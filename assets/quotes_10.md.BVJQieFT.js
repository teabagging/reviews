The Stagger's Act of 1980 clearly was the defining moment when the government stopped micro-managing the railroads and allowed them to serve the public again.

I also reccomend it to anyone who thinks that governmental control is good for the public.."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best general railroad history books out there","review":"Albro Martin has a wonderful style of writing which makes this a great read - even better than Enterprise Denied.

Of course the two languages do share a vast vocabulary and grammar in common, but what it really means here is that if you already have one of these books (the Hindi would be the better one to get) you really don't need the other. The dialogues, grammar and exercises are all in a phonetic transcription and only the dialogues (in the back of the book) are given in the nastaliq script.

The only thing that would impress me is if I did find out a small child had written the book.

I bought this as it has 5 ports on the back to keep cables of items that I have permanently plugged in (like printers and drives) out of the way. It is somewhat heavy and has non-skid rubber pads so it does not slide around on the desk. Additionally, it has 2 easy-access convenient ports on the top for the temporary use of USB key drives, digital cameras, and the like.My only gripe is that it seems to me this hub could have been designed for more than 7 ports, as there is a lot of space on top and the front that could have been used for more USB ports. I always seem to get more and more USB devices, and I would certainly have bee interested in buying a version of this with more than 7 USB ports."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed to work fine, then it died.","review":"I really liked the design of this hub. And I still do. Too bad it is uselss now. It seemed to work fine in the beginning. After about a year, I noticed that my shared printer would occasionally stop working. I had the hub connected to an Airport Extreme, and that way I could share the printer over my wireless network. The hub was the last thing that I suspected, until I tried using an older 4-port hub in its place, and then things were working again. Sure enough, it was the Belkin hub that had died. This looked like a good deal in the beginning, but not any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"This hub generally worked well for the first few months with pretty much any product I attached to it. Later on, it became useful for only some of the simpler devices I was using. It works fine for iPod docks or USB printers, but forget attaching a USB portable hard drive to it. The drives will suddenly disconnect and it's about 50/50 as to whether or not they'll reconnect. This is particularly bad for someone like me who keeps their entire, 100+ GB iTunes library on an external drive. I had the same problems with external drives regardless of whether or not they were USB-powered or wall outlet-powered. If all you want to use it for is an MP3 player, printer, or digital camera, then you're probably safe. If you want a hub that you can trust to work, look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quirky Compared To 4-Port Hub","review":"This Belkin 7-Port Hub is quirky --- sometines failing to recognize and/or handle certain devices.

Every time I bumped into it or even carefully moved it, the whole thing would lose power for a second and disconnect all devices that were attached. I sent it back to the company and they send me back a new one. Less than a year later, this one is constantly dropping its connection. I will sync my iPhone, for example, and mid-sync it drops the connection. Happening more and more frequently too. Not sure if heat is the cause, but these units get too hot. As many others have warned in these reviews - stay away from this model, and I assume the other variations of this design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after less than a year","review":"After about 11 month my hub started to shut off and on spontaneously, so that all devices are disconnected for a moment.

My Mac would alert me that devices had been removed without being ejected properly at random times. This would sometimes happen if I bumped the hub or my desk or if I removed any device from the hub. It would also happen at random times and I would find all of a sudden a hard drive, memory stick or iPod was no longer connected. After less than 1 year using this hub it stopped working completely. It won't even provide power to my USB devices. If you are looking for a good USB hub I suggest you keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"Flaky connections require regular plugging and unplugging of devices before they're recognized.

If I plug too many devices into the hub, they won't start. I wanted a device for the extra USB ports to handle a printer and an external hard disk, plus the occasional memory stick and camera. The printer and hard disk were intended to be on all the time. If they are, and I plug in a memory stick, the memory stick won't power up. If I shut off the printer, then the memory stick will power. On most occasions, I have to plug and unplug/replug the USB devices in the hub to get them to work. The hub is connected to an iMac, which could also be some of the problem. Bottom line - the device is useless as a multi-port solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Up and Died!","review":"This hub worked fine for about 9 months. It's a hub. I don't expect much from it.

No warning signs, and no apparent hope for resurrection. I've tried it all. I've hooked it up to other computers to try to trick it into 'resetting' itself.

It has a 5V adapter which connects into a wall and can help charge Ipads and other devices. Without this, the handy Belkin device can still connect your devices without charging capabilities.This product has great reliability, as I've had this for over 3 years and have had no problem with it.The interesting design allows two flash drives, or any USB connector, to plug in perpendicularly to the desk surface. I believe this possibly is for the temporary connections like the flash drives, which are easier to see as they are standing up and more visible.All-in-all, This connection expander versatile and has a good shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over heats","review":"Well, I'm not sure if I got a dud or what since there are so many other positive reviews. This hub seemed to work great until one day it suddenly started rapidly cycling on and off. I picked it up and it was really really hot.This device seems to work for your regular low throughput devices like keyboards, mice, printers, etc. When I hook up my Sandisk CF card reader, or sync music with my iPhone (and charge it), it gets really hot and stops working.After I unplug it for about 15 minutes it works again.Belkin is known for making over-priced products that aren't anything special, but I often buy them anyway because I know they'll work. This isn't the case with this device. I think I'll try another brand.Your mileage may vary, of course. If you plan on hooking up a lot of demanding devices to it though, I would consider looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine Died After About a Year","review":"I bought the 7-port Belkin from a competitor.

The hub has worked flawlessly and sits on my desk without moving around due to the device's weight. The only thing I'm not fond of is Belkin's choice of colors for this product. I wish they would have just made a black one. The baby blue color on the device looks horrible but I still rated it a 5 since I knew what I was ordering before it arrived. Belkin has yet to let me down on the way their products operate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Add UGLY to your desktop","review":"This hub has got to be the ugliest one I have ever seen. While I generally have not had any problems with using Belkin hubs with my iMac, I was in desperate need for more ports. This was the only 7 port hub available at circuit city and best buy. It looks like crud sitting next to my sleek and shiny iMac. The cable keeper on the side is worthless. The top loading ports make plugging in a cruzer drive easy, but I am definitely looking for a replacement that is functional and better looking on my desktop. FYI the light stays on to indicate that the hub is powered, it does not indicate which hub is in use.4 stars for functionality, 0 stars for design (white with baby blue accent, cord keeper is too small for more than two very small cables, not sure why there is a whole in the middle)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belkin 7 port hub","review":"I purchased this item two years ago. I liked the low profile, and ability to organize the cables. It also has indicators for each port, so you can tell which port might be available when you have them all full, but not all being used.The device worked without any problems and did exactly what it was supposed to, right up until it stopped for no reason that I can think of.

Nothing else appears to have failed at the same time.Great device, just wish it would have lasted longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Belkin","review":"Easy to use right out of the box!

Having a hub fail, especially in the middle of a project, can be a nightmare. I searched the internet for something with extra ports and a strong power supply. I tried this Belkin Hub because it met those criteria, plus I have been happy with other Belkin products I own. I am truly impressed with this hub. It not only can handle my devices, but I have 3 of them daisy chained together connected to my Mac, and haven't had a single problem yet. I can't tell you how many hubs have failed on me over the years, but these Belkin Hubs have been cabled together and running my whole office worth of drives now for 2 years without a single hitch.

After Googling this, I discovered others have had a similar experience with Belkin hubs (see Apple Store). It's annoying enough for me to return. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's OK","review":"I'm using this with an iMac. The hub worked well right out of the box. Two hard disk drives, keyboard, mouse, flash drives, camera, iPod, printer... All work well with this product. I just plugged it in and everything worked.

Still it's a great story and we keep wanting more and more and more of Newman and Page together.The short documentary on the film is also nice, with Shirley Knight, Rip Torn and Madeleine Sherwood sharing memories from the film set.The widescreen transfer is fine even if the image is not as clear as it should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Censorship didn't stop anything.","review":"Based on the hit Tennessee Williams play, this exciting drama stars Paul Newman as a slick young opportunist who returns to his home town with an ageing movie queen(Geraldine Page), but runs head-on into trouble with the town's corrupt boss(Ed Begley in an Oscar-winning performance). As is the case with his 1958 film version of Tennessee Williams' CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF, director Richard Brooks was forced to clean up this Williams play for the movies. But those blasted censors didn't hurt anything. Like CAT, SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH is still a gritty, powerful, and brilliant film. Every one of the performers delivers a top-notch portrayal.

Not only can he sing, but the fact that he writes, produces and plays the music for all his songs, makes him that much better than the rest. No one can deny that he has amazing vocals. He has such control over his voice and can perform vocal gymnastics like no other. This is the first of Brian's many brilliant collection of albums which he has credited to his name. The beats are smooth and the production is superb. Buy this album and you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST in R & B","review":"He is in his own category.

They set the stage by going back in history and delving into the wisdom expressed by philosophers and statesmen. Through the course of the book, they discuss modern-day examples of community that works.The background material is transformed into simple, but concrete suggestions of what it takes for a truly successful community to develop. The authors' ideas are not revolutionary, but they are stated well and serve to remind us all of what we as individuals need to do.In Search of Community is thought-provoking and an easy read. It is obviously based on thorough research, yet it is not overly scholarly. It's very simplicity makes it an interesting and very useful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Panaceas from Ambiguity","review":"The shallow in search of the superficial requires no better example than this thankfully brief tome.

The story has a lot of drama and tragedy in it, ending in the massacre of the shipwrecked French by the Spanish general Menendez - but - not all of them, as has been assumed all these years.This is a very nicely pieced together story by an amateur, but dedicated and bright researcher, eclipsing and surpassing the scholastic establishment by his energy and diligence.He even gets kudos from the National Park Service for his work, so with some knowledge of how that institution works tells me that this work is of the highest order.Great sleuthing, and an interesting read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"HORROR\\" An ELITE Choice","review":"Horror is completely entertaining. The scares are frightening, and it's impact is indescribable. Director Dante Tomaselli blows my mind once again. After viewing Tomaselli's first and highly recommended film \\"DESECRATION\\" I knew I couldn't miss out on this unofficial sequel. Gorgeous colors and amazing sounds keep you hypnotized to the screen. HORROR is addicting, it lives in my DVD player. A classic for sure! Not just for horror fans, but for movie fans. Horror has a little bit for every one, of all ages. You definitely want to add this DVD to your collection. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Ace","review":"After watching Dante Tomaselli's first movie DESECRATION, I was awe struck at the raw talent of first time producer Tomaselli. When I found out that he was releasing his second film I ordered it right away, hoping that HORROR would be half as good as DESECRATION. Tomaselli has once again proven himself a master of a compelling puzzle of psychological horror and gore. Another familiar face in HORROR is the star Danny Lopes (Bobby in Desecration). Lopes gives an amazing performance, sharpening his acting skills and drawing in the viewer. This is one of the summers hottest movies, that you will be sorry you missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horror to watch...","review":"This is a sequence of nightmarish scenes wrapped around the bare bones of a story. Yes, there are a lot of surreal images, and even a few genuine scares and a clever ending. Unfortunately, you have to sit through a lot of poor-quality acting, directing, editing, production and special effects that collectively deflate the whole package. For me, it was just a colossal waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Dante's movies...","review":"Dante Tomaselli truly outdid himself with Horror. The strangely beautiful imagery is what makes his movies truly disturbing, and therefore truly effective. I really think that this director is going places.From what I understand, Dante is being considered for directing the new \\"Halloween 9\\". I believe that a big-budget horror movie in the hands of Dante Tomaselli could easily wind up a classic of the genre.

When I opened it, I was excited to find a Middle Eastern cookbook, but was not expecting it to 'measure up' to the 10 or so Middle Eastern/North African cookbooks in my collection, as the author is not well known as are the authors of many of the other books. After all this time, I have made quite a few recipes from this book, and all were fantastic. That being said, I feel that I haven't even scratched the surface of this book.

This is a great read from a unique perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"Sorry, but Bob's book, \\"Dinosaur Heresies,\\" is his best work to date and shows his great artwork and wonderful theories.

Buy his other book and be entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique perspective on an old story","review":"Raptor Red was definitely a unique book. Learn and experiencelife as a dinosaur, through the eyes of a dinosaur. I could see and feel what life might of been like for dinosaurs as they moved up or down the evolutionary ladder. I developed empathy for \\"Raptor Red\\" and her kin. This is an educational as well as eye-opening book and I recommend it to anyone who loves dinosaurs."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a unique book","review":"Being interested in dinosaurs and paleontology, I thought the book was great. When I first bought the book, I thought this book is only for dinofans. How wrong I was. It was simple to understand and the way Bakker gets into the head of Raptor Red was extraordinary. Any one with the tiniest bit of interest in dinosaurs should read this book, this book has done what many other fiction or science fiction had never done before, telling a story from an animal's point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more than a simple raptor story...","review":"I have just finished reading 'Raptor Red' and I really enjoyed it VERY, VERY much! However, I don't think that it was only about raptors and their lifes. For me, the raptor story was just a sort of excuse to tell indirectly a quite different story ... the one about how close we all still are sometimes to 'animal-like', instinctive behavior... This aspect of the book made me think over many of our everyday reactions... and this is, in my opinion, a great compliment for an author.Unfortunately, the cover of the paperback edition doesn't really fit with this aspect of the book. It is so 'science fiction'-like, that it was almost impossible for a friend of mine to convince me that the book is much more interesting than it's stupid cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN TO READ!!!","review":"This book is fun to read and loved by every member of my family young and old alike. The book can be read easily in an afternoon. My only complaint is that there aren't more like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't have to be a scientist","review":"Bakker utilizes precise and thought-provoking details in order to show the reader a world which, until now, has only been hinted at through fossils. His writing style is both informative and entertaining, allowing the average reader with little or no knowledge of paleontology to enjoy this epic tale. Bakker's Utahaptors as well as the other dinosaur characters are three-dimensional and well written throughout the novel. I read \\"Raptor Red\\" from beginning to end over night and was amazed by its originality. I wasn't disappointed at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop reading it.","review":"I enjoyed this book very much, mostly because I am interested in prehistoric life, and I believe this added a nice insight into what the possibilities were for a dinosaur to see, feel, and think. This book also seemed to parallel modern society, because there is that constant want to improve their own situation and dominate in whatever you endeavor. In addition to this, this book also shows how, when faced with change, people, or in the book's case, dinosaurs, freeze because of the uncertaintly of what to do, as was seen with the flowers. What I really like about this book is that it never gets old to me, because every time I reread it, a new detail seems to appear that I overlooked, which enhances my reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animal Channel, 100 Million BC","review":"This book was a lot of fun. It reads like a TV show with the narrator telling you about animals' behavior and life histories as you \\"watch\\" them take down prey, court a mate, raise babies, and do other things you see in animal documentaries. That's great, because nobody can go to modern day Utah and film the beasts that lived there long ago. The book does show its age, however, by having no feathers on its dinosaurs. More recent dino-fiction, like Hopp's Dinosaur Wars, describes fully feathered raptors. So even dino-fiction evolves. All and all though, Raptor Red was an enlightening read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raptor Red","review":"Great book! Bakker vividly illustrates the mesozoic world. The story is as follows:a female utahraptor loses her lifelong mate and sets out to find another.She faces giant \\"acros\\",or acrocanthosaurs, floods and other obstacles. This story has a little of every thing, including comedy and action. I highly recomend this book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a failed attempt","review":"i know bakker is an authority on dinosaurs, and i'm sure his nonfiction books are excellent to read, but he is not a fiction writer. and it shows in this book. i know what he wanted to do, but he should have left that job up to those who make a living writing. the text jumps between a narrative account and a documentary. the language falls flat, and without human characters, bakker is unable to make raptor red interesting. it's a nice try, but instead of this book, pick up one of bakker's nonfiction pieces and one of crichton's novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"blase dinosaur book","review":"not a great read. not horrible rather repetitive.no comparison to jurassaic park"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise, disappointing book","review":"Baker tried to bite off more than he can chew. He began with a great premise; present a dinosaur's story without romanticizing and \\"Disneyfing\\" it.But it takes a great writer to be able to write an engaging book which uses an animal's limited pallette of emotions. Unfortunately, I do not believe Bakker is that author. The characters are uneffecting and the events are unexciting. This book has no driving narrative and becomes a pointless prehistoric travelogue.After reading this book, I don't feel like I have any better understanding of what a dinosaur's life might have been like.On the other hand, it is still ten times better than Jurasic Park."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was terrible!","review":"Raptor Red was one of the worst books that I have ever read. Robert Bakker should just stick to his paleantology and not try to write books about it. I don't know what posessed this man to write a book because it was horrible! I'm sure there are people out there who could enjoy this book. The story of a female Raptor and her journeys through life could have been interesting if they were expressed differently.

I would not recommend this book to anyone sane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bakker should make low-budget movies, instead.","review":"If you would like to know about dinosaurs, please read anotherbook.

He finds some new dinosaur bones and writes a cheesy melodrama about its life. Loses her mate then spends her time finding a new one! Moves in with the sister, her kids, and her mate!

It was all nonsense on how a guy thinks dinosaurs are.\\"Raptor Red woke this morning. The air was warm as she sniffed. Red found some fresh meat.

For example, being in an S&M relationship. The subject matter in this novel is disgusting and at times horrifying, but the book is very well written. The woman is the narrator, and she tells the story of her relationship years after the fact. She speaks in a very detached way, yet the woman's deep love and devotion for her master are very obvious, despite how sickly she was manipulated.There are certain types of violence that can be very elegant, and i'm not sure that elegant is the word I need here, but this is the case with this novel. It was also scary to see the arrogance and complete thirst for domination that her master had, because it went beyond sex. The robberies she was compelled to commit are proof of that. It is easy to pass judgment on the woman for falling for such a treatment, but the book tells the story extremely well and certainly worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"quick read","review":"I bought this for a vacation read.

But that's not all.Henderson's expert use of landscape and scenery not only reflects the characters' internal struggles, it also puts you smack dab in the middle of the beautiful Wyoming ranch. The story contains enough action to balance the introspection, but not so much as to overshadow the true battles for self-acceptance. The well-rounded characters are both realistic and larger-than-life.The language flows smoothly throughout most of the book, and in fact is as much a part of the experience as the story itself. You cannot ignore the exquisitely crafted prose, and that annoyed me on occasion because it distracted me from the story.Henderson's second novel will be released in the fall of 1997. If it lives up to the promise shown in Native, Henderson is well on his way to literary acclaim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"Did I miss something? Heavy on the mood; plot was hard to follow; couldn't figure out why the characters did most of what they did. I wanted to like Blue, but I didn't understand him. At least Sam's story made some sense.

There were numerous cases of incomplete sentences, incoherent sentences, improper punctution, etc. It was very distracting when trying to read. Further, the author rambled and repeated his opinions over and over in the same chapter; I got it the first time!! The numerous repititions seemed to be a case if I say it often enough, you'll believe it. This leads to my opinion that this book was NOT very well researched. The author makes many asertions not supported by any works already accomplished. He indicates a familiarity with horses but his analysis, while partially correct as to fatigue, is not consistent with other better researched works or my own experience with horses.I would not recommend purchasing this book until an editor gets hold of it. Otherwise, it adds to the very large literature library purporting to be the \\"truth\\" about the Little Bighorn, and we should all be open to new opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO RIDICULOUS FOR WORDS","review":"This author has presented a battle scenario which is so absurd, it is absolutely too ridiculous to be described.

Ringo is definitely the Beatle with the sense of humor who had nothing to prove, but he proves a lot by just being Ringo.

'Snow' is a book I will certainly treasure, it is all I expected yet nothing like what I had previously imagined.

It is in error for the following reasons: 1. flawed, unwarranted, and dangerous interpretation of scripture 2. inconsistent logic and contradictions 3. racist and race-based theology 4. theology that functions in the same way as supersessionism 5. historically inaccurate depictions of Israel 6. dangerous, false, and militant claims to the land which threaten the stability of the current State of Israel For more info: search for \\"Ephraimite Error\\" on the www."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Handbook for those beginning to return","review":"I have read the book and the reviews. I do not ever before recall reading such vicious attacks upon a work as those against this book. This alone should make the book worth reading.The book itself is written well and leads to conclusions that can only be verified by the Rauch HaKodesh (Holy Spirit). Full understanding of this subject can only be given by revelation through the Rauch HaKodesh.As the book says and implies, it is a time of great change, a time of increasing knowledge and a time of awakening. The book presents for consideration an alternative to conventional and traditional thinking. Having been steeped in what we have been told to be true, all our lives, it is sometimes difficult to open our eyes and hearts and minds to grasp a deeper meaning and truth. This book offers understanding and hope coupled with revelation. It was the beginning of greater understanding for me and my household."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Subtle Form of Anti-semitism","review":"The premise of this book, that everyone who is saved is really Jewish, is ludicrous at best, and at worst is a particularly shrewd, yet subtle, form of anti-semitism. The author bases her doctrine of the two houses of Israel (Ephraim being the Gentiles, and the other, Judah, being the Jews) on nothing more than the mis-translation of several passages of scripture. The believer must question the details of Mrs. Wooten's education in the Hebrew language before blindly accepting a belief system based on such blatently erroneous translation. The concept set forth in the book, that every believer is physical Israel, is also insidiously anti-semitic because it's an especially crafty type of Replacement Theology. This is, quite frankly, a book that cannot be taken seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed with the seller","review":"The alarm itself works fine but not exactly what i wanted. i am very dissappointed with the seller. i ordered the pyle pwd501 and i recieved the pyle pwd401. a completely different alarm so i ended up paying the better alarm and getting the smaller model one."},{"rating":"2","title":"been searching for years for one of these","review":"why do they sell squeegys with taper fit handles, but sell squeegy poles with threaded ends.

First off, the whole spoofing on the horror movie thing was done and actually done well in Scary Movie, but Club Dread actually takes its horror seriously and tries to throw in a mix of comedy to try and liven up the old and tired slasher formula. I was expecting more from the people who did Super Troopers but after viewing the trailer I knew it would be a bomb, and to comfirm that, I saw the movie tonight and it was pathetic. Every funny scene was already used in the Theatrical Trailer, so there were no surprises- a few jumps here and there when someone would pop up. Overall, a huge disgrace to both the horror and comedy genres."},{"rating":"1","title":"kill me","review":"what the hell is this it sucks bad not funny it's just poor poor movie oh ya if your looking for a nude Brittany Daniel it's not gonna happen the dvd box my suck you in but no nude Brittany Daniel sorry prvs oh ya the unrated bullcrap not a good movie stay away from it if you know what's good for you lol but dont buy it it's crap"},{"rating":"1","title":"From a huge fan of Supertroopers","review":"Now, don't get me wrong... I loved their previous masterpiece, Supertroopers. Since I learned about Supertroopers from Amazon.com, that movie became my instant classic, I recommended it to all my friends. Too bad I can't do this with Club Dread.In short, this movie is:1) not a comedy (a movie needs to be funny to qualify as a comedy)2) extremely boring,3) painful to watch probably for everyone who saw and enjoyed Supertroopers.Perhaps a DVD edition will come with a personal pack of Johnny Chimpo reefer, which would be the only way to watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Encourages Them and Where Do They Get Their Money?","review":"Now that I've seen three Broken Lizard movies (and they wisely left their name off their third stinkbomb, BEERFEST), I can say that this \\"comedy troupe\\" is horrible. Where did they come from? How do they get funding to keep making lame comedy after lame comedy? What will it take to stop them?It doesn't surprise me to see good reviews here since I imagine most of the four or five star reviews were written by young and unformed viewers who have yet to develop any type of comedic taste and discretion.If you're over 15 and like Broken Lizard, you are clearly brain damaged or have been subjected to such horrific child abuse that you're one trauma away from recalling alien abductions.

No one can act, the plot (was there a script?) is absurd, the music is dreadful, and the director must have been high much of the time. This comedy/horror film is neither funny nor slasher-enjoyable.

It has permanently forfeited its reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhh... hmm...

You're better off with \\"Super Troopers.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"...not what I expected","review":"First of all, make no mistake that these guys are entertaining and hilarious, and if marketed more towards the horror end, I would have given this movie a better rating. THIS MOVIE MAY NOT BE TO THE LIKING OF A SUPER TROOPERS FAN. This is essentially a slasher movie with a sense of humor, NOT a comedy with some gore. The killings are more reminiscent of I Know What You Did Last Summer, and it almost overpowers the feeling that you are watching a Broken Lizard movie. I wouldn't have been so disappointed by it, had everything I had heard about it was more accurate I suppose.

After the first couple of minutes I thought there was something wrong with me. Why was I not laughing? Is it because I'm snooty when it comes to movies?

No. It's because this movie is NOT FUNNY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck, Lizard Has Made Another Crappy Movie","review":"I really don't know where to begin what was wrong with this stink fest. I was ready to quit watching the movie, and almost did, after the first ten minutes. Besides the crappy acting and the false and really bad British accents, the movie has a bad plot that is very predictable to every horror movie fan. They give into every cliche and stereotype a horror movie can have. I knew everything that was going to happen before it did. I really don't know what's worse, this or House of the Dead. At least House of the Dead is so bad it's funny, this is just sad. The movie is definitely not scary, I know what you did last summer is even scarier. Overall, once again, B.

I never saw Super Troopers, but I'll tell you this-the commercials for that movie made me laugh more than I did during this entire film...is it necessary to be high while watching this?

That said this is probably not a movie for everyone.Other people said you may have to watch it more than once to enjoy the movie and this may be the case, but it will be a while before I watch this movie again.My review is from the regular release DVD, but from what I have read would also apply to the unrated release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"after seeing \\"super troopers\\" and the comedic skills displayed by the broken lizard writers and this acting group, i expected far more of \\"club dread\\" than was delivered. The few jokes that there were are simply spread too thin and are not nearly as clever as they could have been, and even the story simply lacks staying power. do yourself a favor, find something else to laugh at, you'll be wasting your time with this one. hopefully they'll do better next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a let down from The Broken Lizard crew","review":"Super Troopers did a lot for me and it wasn't a classic but it was funny as hell. Zoom foward to Club Dread which in the complete end of it has stirred away from it's own pot. Broken Lizard gang brewed up a mix of flat jokes, gorey violence and some scantly revealing women. In conclusion if this is your cup of tea then go for it but it's a let down. Bill Paxton (Near Dark, the upcoming Thunderbirds) who plays Coconaut Pete is the only highlight in the movie. Brittney Daniel (tv's That 80's Show, Joe Dirt) plays Aerobics Amy has her moments. It's like a bad hangover.

The author makes you really understand the most common feelings, mistakes and fault you may do once you move in a new country, new culture. Most of all, he makes you understand how rich and full of challenge is an experience in another country.

At almost age 4 she is rarely without her tiara and jewelry, even when wearing her pj's (which should of course really be a nightgown, preferably well-trimmed with lace and pink thank-you-very-much). I purchased this book for her for Christmas and enjoyed reading it myself. Now it has become her favorite book. The nice part is that as an adult, it's not just tolerable to read over and over again; it's enjoyable. So, we no longer wear purple at our house, we prefer \\"fuschia\\" because afterall, that is a fancier word than just \\"purple.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"gorgeous","review":"A gorgeous book.

Just divine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fancy, not bratty","review":"Since my now 6 yr old daughter was about 3, we've been enjoying reading many of the Fancy Nancy books.Her love of accessories strikes a chord with most girls; while her use of \\"fancy\\" words expands their vocabularies. Most importantly, Nancy is nice. She loves her fancy stuff but not more than her friends and family.

I bought this book for a little girl that I've never met. I met her mother through a transaction on Craig's List and found her to be a very nice, single mother who had just moved to a new area and was trying to find a way to get some presents for her little girl's upcoming 6th birthday.

There was writing on the inside of this book. Wish I had known that before I purchased it. This was not specified in the product description."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series Beginning","review":"Purchased for my 4 yr. old niece, this is a keeper. It's the first of the Fancy Nancy series. Nancy turns a seemingly ordinary items into an ultra fabulous (in the true sense of the word) statement. I like her because she not only exposes children to a better vocabulary (her 'fancy' words) but she also does not give two hoots whether people think she is silly or gaudy or...whatever. She enjoys to the fullest being the type of girl she is meant to be. If others, even her own family sometimes do not understand her, she just laughs gaily and includes them in her world anyway. What a great book! You cannot go wrong with this series.BTW, I pd for the gift wrap option as this was being mailed to another state. It was wrapped in pastel blue with a nice flat ribbon bow, then concealed in a brown box for shipping. Having never tried the gw option, I was pleased with the service & recommend it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this book!!","review":"I bought this book for my niece (she's 3 1/2 years old). Even before reading it to her, I could see she was already captivated by the glittery, 'fancy' cover (the illustrations in this book are phenomenal!). She was excited before reading the book, but once I finished it, she was in love!! For the remainder of the night she repeatedly cried out 'again'! Needless to say, weeks later this continues to be her most favourite book (impressive considering her vast collection). I highly recommend this whimsical children's book to all and I look forward to purchasing other books from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's big; it's pink, and it's fancy!","review":"This delightful book is every girl's dream come true--regardless her age! I bought it for my 14 year old daughter (named Nancy), and she loved it--identified completely with this remarkable protagonist who has to suffer through her parents' very un-fancy lifestyle. We're going to give it to her 68 year old grandmother for Mother's Day.On a larger scale, this book shows a good family working together, supporting each other. My other daughters love it as much as Nancy and I do. I recommend it for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely beautiful illustrations","review":"Robin Preiss Glasser has tapped into everything that five year old girls adore. Every picture is effusive with details. One need not even read the story to love this book. My daughter took it everywhere with her for days; she made up her own stories. This is book is art, every frame worthy of being hung on a wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stupendous - \\"That's a fancy word for great.\\"","review":"This book was so sweet that it actually brought tears to my eyes while I was reading it to my little girl. It is just such a touching and adorable story. Some reviews have said it sends a bad message for little girls but I just don't see how that can be when the overall message is love and understanding. I've read it to my 3-year-old daughter a zillion times and she hasn't wanted to turn me fancy or redecorate her room. In fact, if anything it's made her a little more clever. Now whenever someone says a big word she doesn't understand she asks, \\"Is that a fancy word?\\"I love the book so much I want to share it with all of my friends and I have already pre-ordered the next Nancy book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book - shipping problem","review":"The book is very nice and perfect for my fancy 5-year old daughter. The books is very tall and wide, but not thick. Rather than having many stories, it just has very big pages.My only complaint is that I requested 2-day shipping and it still took 4 days to arrive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fancy Nancy","review":"This is an awesome book. I bought this book for my daughter who is five years old. She absolutely loves it. It is short, sweet, and the pictures are absolutely beautiful . . . who doesn't want to be fancy!

I had to keep it to give as a gift the next day. The book was good but broken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad value system I do not want my daugher to emulate","review":"I really dislike these Fancy Nancy books. The character is pretentious and conceited, and looks down on her parents for their simple style. I think books like these tend to perpetuate a value system that places looks ahead of character. I love it when my daughter dresses up, but I don't want her to buy into a materialistic, mass-consumption lifestyle that I think is shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but she makes me cringe","review":"I am in the lonely position here of kind-of-hating Fancy Nancy. The point of the books seems to be to shoehorn varied experiences into the simplification 'fancy'. Inexplicably anything French is included in this. I am not sure what is more annoying to me, the ethnocentrism of this practice or the pointlessness of the stories.Children typically learn a couple of languages in school along with, hopefully, a large vocabulary of English words. This character seems to be promoting ignorance and parochalism?If I wanted to read my girls a book with a French influence I would probably read the old Madeline books instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible message--why teach kids to be pretentious?","review":"I would give it zero stars if possible....My friend's mother-in-law got it for her new baby. The title character, Nancy, is pretentious and obnoxious. She thinks here family is not fancy enough because they dress conservatively. She thinks everything sounds fancier when said in French and needs to be over the top.Why would you encourage children to act like that? It's bad enough there are so many grown-up prima donnas out there. I know this is just a kids' book and I probably shouldn't take it so seriously. I would never expose a child to this kind of thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you really want your child to think like Fancy Nancy?","review":"How will this book make children who don't have fancy things at home feel? I think materialism is a vice that doesn't need to be taught in a children's book. Enough people learn this on their own, why try to instill it in a 3 year old? If you want a book about a cute silly girly-girl, buy Madeline."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I want my daughters to emulate","review":"If you are the type of person who thinks it is 'cute' when kids talk down about their parents, then get this book.If however, you think that is unappropriate like I did, then avoid it. My daughters, ages 4 and 1, received this book as well as another Fancy Nancy book for Christmas. After reading them, I immediately donated them to Goodwill because I did not want them to be part of our childrens book collection. I fully support little girls dressing up and acting 'fancy', but the problem is that Nancy puts down things that are not fancy, including her parents, and somewhat exhalts things that are really not that important, like all things foreign, etc. I really don't want to plant this idea in my girls head that it's OK to think this way, especially this young. Don't recommend this book- if certain parts were left out of the book it would have been fine, but unfortunately the author chose to include them."},{"rating":"1","title":"why did I get this again?","review":"This doesn't do anything at all.

If so, I absolutely feel for the anguish she must feel at being alone without her mother, famous birth father, and step father. But this book gave me a headache. It was a blown opportunity to tell an interesting story, and kind of wafts along on what sounds like a drug addled haze. its incoherent story telling at best, berift of any sort of structure, with too much meaningless gingerbread thrown in for drama's sake.Save your money and don't bother, Sorry Di, you're a pretty lady and I'm sure have interesting stories to tell - its just that this wasn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning tale from Di Dean","review":"wow..an amazing revelation and fabulous story from a gifted writer...cant wait to read more on the life of Di."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY well written with an amazing emotional impact","review":"I read this with no preconceptions and was VERY impressed; DAMN, she writes well !

It is written in a style my students enjoy, and it does not talk down to them.

The company no longer covers the book.It starts out with basic C++ programming techniques and goes through all the basics of creating games. I would recommend it for an intermediate programmer. You can get the book for free off of the Authors website. You can also buy a CD version. GREAT BUY!It covers video, audio, and very basic structural programming. Not for programmers afraid to do some math and memory address memorization. I absolutely love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nintendo doesn't want this book published","review":"This book is taking a long time to come out because the publisher is under pressure from Nintendo not to publish it. Nintendo feels that the section on using a flash cable and flash cart (obtained from Lik-sang) will be used by people pirating games.

What does it have to do with this review? I bought the album the other day a few days after it came out and it has been in my portable CD player since then I just listened to Closer to You, Everybody Out of the Water, and Three Ways (second time on Three Ways because it is so good).Closer to You gives me hope. Everybody Out of the Water is just a kick A__ song, one of the best songs in a long time and Three Ways tells me you have to move on. The whole album is strong, the next generation (Dylan's son etc.) carrying on the folk-rock tradition with some great musicianship and great vocals. If you are living life and have had some bumps, there is a good chance you will enjoy this CD. Well produced but still authentic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Well, I don't agree with some of the reviews for this album. You probably don't care about that, but many of these people try to make themselves sound like experts in music, which some of them might be. However, i am sure most of them aren't. If you like a good mix of alternative/rock (Springstein style)/pop all put together on a great album by a great band, buy Red Letter Days. Just because Breach may be better, doesn't mean this isnt a good album. Definetely buy it. It has some nice easy to listen to songs like Closer To You and such, and cool songs like Too Late To Quit and Everybody Out Of The Water. Do buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as others","review":"Red Letter Days was somewhat of a disappointment to me, but still a good album overall. Bringing Down the Horse, The Wallflower's previous album, has always been a favorite of mine. It has great lyrics and awesome music. Red Letter Days pales in comparsion. The lyrics aren't as tight, the music seems a little more watered down than past songs, and it just seems like The Wallflowers attempt to reach a mainstream audience. However, the album is catchy and does have some good songs, such as Tracks 2, 5, and 6. If you really like the Wallflowers, this album will be a let down. But if you just want to hear some good music, and by good I mean not Top 40 potential, listen to Red Letter Days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jakob Dylan","review":"Red Letter Days is a lot happier and a lot more fun than Breach. Though not as great as Rebel, Sweetheart....this album is one of those albums you can listen to over and over again driving in your car. Dylan and the band create wonderful jingles and guitar rifts that are a pleasure to listen to. Favorites are How Good It Can Get, See You When I Get There, Everyone Out of the Water, Too Late To Quit, Three Ways, and the hidden track Empire"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Their best Hands Down!!","review":"I bought 'Bringing Down The Horse' when it came out-not a bad disc at all. But some tunes were just so-so. And I've heard 'Breach'..also some pretty good moments-but nothing that overly exciting ( I need a bit more 'pop catchiness' to this kind of roots pop/rock). Now this-'Red Letter Days'..I'll say it again-\\"WOW\\"!! NOW we're talking!! Perfect example of a songwriter/band coming of age here!! This disc is as good as a Tom Petty disc-and that's usually pretty high standard stuff. If you like Petty-you'll LOVE this one! Same genre-great tunes throughout,even the bonus track.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Add this to your collection!","review":"The more I listen to this CD, the more I like it. Overall a great CD to listen to any time, anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"... without Peace, Love & Understanding","review":"...This CD isn't quite as good as \\"Horse\\" or their best CD \\"Breach\\", but still a fine record. Jakob seems to be going for a kinder, gentler Wallflowers. Overall very good. I liked the grittiness of \\"Breach\\" better, though. The band seems to be reaching to have hits on radio, instead of the lyrical intensity of their last CD. I don't blame them though, after the way radio ignored their masterpiece, \\"Breach\\". This will still be one of the best CDs released this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jacob and Company still getting it done","review":"First thing first..if you haven't picked up their previous album titled (Breach) please do so before you buy this cd..Breach was a masterpeice that went unoticed. As for RED LETTER DAYS the bands newest creation half of the the tracks sound off like a b sides collection from Breach. Is this a bad thing? No. Where Breach was laid out as a (muscians album) RED LETTER DAYS stands a bit in the middle ground making it a bit more accessiable album. This cd also at times finds Dylan and friends branching out just a little bit even further where Breach had set foot. RED LETTER DAYS is a bit more (rockier) than their previous expeditions, thanks in part to a small handful of guest musicians and Dylans constant longing from album to album to grow, run , and hide from the demons from which he is haunted. RED LETTER DAYS stands as a constant natural progression for a band that finds its strengths in change. It is a fine album. A fine resting stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is how good it can get.","review":"Like most people, I got into the Wallflowers with the song \\"One Headlight.\\" But it seems only a minority have been lucky enough (and smart enough) to stick around and be rewarded with such great music. This is, hands-down, my favorite of all five Wallflowers albums. Don't let the lack of radio play scare you away. The Wallflowers haven't lost a beat since \\"Bringing Down the Horse.\\" This is just quality music that you can listen to over and over.Favorite song: Three Ways"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"This is a solid album.

This album is surprisingly good. A major leap above the others. Worth owning for \\"Everybody Out Of The Water\\" alone. The Wallflowers, in my mind, are now in a small group of musicians/bands that aspire to, and maintain, a consistent level of excellence in what they do. To boot, you can still see The Wallflowers at relatively small venues ... At present, 'Red Letter Days' and Tom Petty's 'Last DJ\\" are in constant rotation in my cd player."},{"rating":"2","title":"red letter album","review":"finally an album you can listen to every song. great sounds. reminds me of bringing down the horse but more mature. my favorite is closer to you! vintage wallflowers. i can't stop singing the chorus when i'm on the road. i bought 2 one for the house and one for the car. great album for chilling and hanging out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong product","review":"Red Letter DaysI received a version of the album which did not have the song list shown on the web site.

I have given a five star rating to every single one of them except this one, which I give a one star rating to. Imagine my shock when I open up the reviews and see so many five star ratings. Hey, that is cool, to each their own, but I don't get it. This album seems sappy and desperate to appeal commercially. I hate to use the phrase \\"sell-out,\\" but I have to. The word cheesy comes to mind on many songs. I actually felt embarassed listening to some. This is nowhere close to Rebel Heart or Breach or BDTH, not even in the same ballpark. I listen to those albums weekly, this one I took to the used record store (where I bought it) and sold it back. Great band, but this album is really bad, in my opinion. Still a great band and if you like it, more power to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad.","review":"I have to say this is the worst cd I've ever owned. There is maybe one song I did not laugh at and skip over, because the rest are horrid. I haven't bought a wallflowers cd since bringing down the horse, so I did not know what to expect, but this is sad. If you love the wallflowers, nothing will stop you from buying it, but if you've wondered where they've been since their days on the radio, forget about them and walk away before it's too late. Don't let your last memory of them be about how bad they are, but about how great they were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Dissapointment!!!","review":"What is with all these high reviews??? This cd is terrible! The first few songs are cheezy pop songs. Why did the band decide to go this route... Breach is their best album. So diverse, so strong. However it was not very successful at all on the charts. That's probably why they are going back to this cheasy bubble gum pop rock on red letter days.

I was very moved by the raw honesty of these coming out stories . . . their courage, their strength, their wonderful moments of humor, as well. Perhaps it has been argued that one coming out story is much like another -- and indeed, there are numerous moments of affirming and empowering commonality that run like a bright connective thread throughout these pieces -- but what is truly amazing about this collection is the range, variety, resonance, and undeniable uniqueness of each of these womyn's voices.

However, the photos contained within are, well, kind of lame. The theme of the book, as the title DRIVE BY SHOOTING suggests, is photos taken in transit, in vehicles or from the windows of cars and trains. While that idea has potential, the views chosen are uninteresting in the extreme--stretches of highway, industrial areas, yellow-looking people on subway trains. Many of them look like the sort of tourist shots-out-the-window that you struggle to explain years later when looking through a photo album--what was I trying to take a photo of? The photographer traveled all over the world from India to London to South Africa and beyond to assemble this collection.

I am not sure what they used to rub around the casing of this flash light.It looks great, has a long list of functions but that's where the good ends.Here is the ugly;It takes forever to charge,It's heavy because it uses a lead acid battery and here is where the design fails. Lead Acid batteries don't last long... on flashlight mode, the juice runs out in 10 minutes... and just in case you don't know this about LA batteries, they're only good for about 300 cycles before the battery's ability to hold full charge goes down.What's worse is that this unit doesn't hold the charge for a long time. Meaning, if you have a full charge and don't use it for a couple of months, you might not have any juice left to turn it on.This was a pathetic purchase for me. It wasn't worth the $10 I paid for it to send it back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but too shallow...","review":"There's some good things about this book: in typical Lonely Planet style you've got great general travel information for the area (which if I really wanted, I'd buy a general travel book).It does also cover a large number of sites - though is still far from comprehensive.And it has some nice additional information occasionally through the book.Two main peeves though. And they're killers:- Each description is a paragraph, or two at most. You can't tell me very much about a dive site in so few words.- There are no maps / diagrams for specific dive sites (just area overview maps) - a dive guide fails totally without these.It's a pretty book, but to be any use you need to include maps and more detail per site (if this was done it could be forgiven for not being totally comprehensive).In short, it's nice, but it's no use as a tool for researching a dive holiday.What'S further is I now own two of these (Red Sea and Bahamas) - I certainly will not buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"and where might I find these dive sites?","review":"Agree with the \\"pretty but shallow\\" assessment below.

Anne McCaffrey should have taken the time to write a ending to this series worthy of her own talents. Personally I had hoped for many more book's in this series, but this is such a horrible conclusion to the series I almost cried.For me there was no real closing of lose ends, not convincing closings anyway. Characters are flat and unconvincing, to many new ones introduced and not developed, old ones changed past recognition - no sign of the love and layers Anne McCaffrey usually pours into her characters. A multitude of new plot line possibilities introduced, not to be developed.To me this book seemed as if Anne McCaffrey just wanted this series to be over and done with, so that her fans could'nt pester her for more books in the Talent universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell?","review":"What happened in this book? Did the author bothered to create and ending so horrible by chance? I'm a fan of the Rowan and the Pegasus Series, but Anne McCaffrey killed the story. The whole book did not make sense, the author totally shocked me, I do not recommend this book, cause it falls short. The stories before this book, were so rich and full of emotions,the characthers were well devolped and the story aimed at something. This book went on and on on tiresome reading and absurd story arc. If this is the ending of the Rowan series its very sad. I finished reading the book because I was loyal to the author and to the story but was a total lackluster book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh","review":"I liked all the Talent series, although I found Lyon's Pride a little slow in places. But this one stopped. Dead. Okay, I'm exaggerating, there were definately a few interesting moments, but it was just so slow. I found myself skipping such large bits it was difficult to follow the plot. And the Rowan hated beetles, where did this sudden liking spring from? I doubt I'll reread it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed. Not her usual style. Probably ghost writer.","review":"If she didn't feel like finishing off the series, she should not have done so. This was not her usual style of writing, and I have read all that she has written. Don't like quick fixes, and while all the ends were tied up, the story was lacking in fullness and depth. Couldn't connect with any of the characters, even though they were mostly re-occurring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was McCaffrey awake?","review":"Was Anne McCaffrey awake when she wrote this book? I have never encountered such a paint by numbers effort from this author. There was no character depth or development, and the plot was simplistic to the point of boredom. It does not end the series at all. I'll stick to the earlier books in the series and will never attempt this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"McCaffrey's Worst Ever","review":"This book is a disgrace. Too many characters to keep track of easily, stupid and contrived situations, irrational plot, insipid dialog--this is a travesty of what McCaffrey has offered her fans (and I'm one) in the past. I can't believe this tired and totally worthless trash is hers. She should be ashamed of herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read but left too many loose ends","review":"I've loved the Rowan series but if this is the last of the series then I'm unhappy. Not because it is ending but because there were too many issues not resolved. Unlike real life, we only have the writer's words to continue knowing what is going on. I enjoy all of Ms. McCaffeys' books but this one left me feeling unfullfilled. Hopefully she will read comments and give us another 'Rowan' book with fewer mistakes (as with Afra being Damia's brother) and more resolutions not just a dangling ending"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Anne McCaffrey is a fantastic author. I'm glad she wrote another book for this series. It's worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"really disapointing. I could not discern a plot. Sure there were things that happened but no single thread that held this last book together. McCaffrey owes it to her fans to finish this series right and not leave this bad taste in our mouths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I have long believed that McCaffrey can do no wrong but \\"The Tower and The Hive\\" just didn't do it for me. Admittedly, there were some wonderful moments but nothing to compare to \\"The Rowan\\" or even \\"Damia's Children.\\" Maybe she lost something by having many main characters instead of one as in \\"Damia\\", it didn't show in \\"Lyon's Pride.\\" I honestly wish that I never read this book -that I had left that universe to my own imagination because I got no sense of closure for the end of this series. I came away without any satisfaction. Don't bother reading this unless you really like Zara since this is the first time you really get to see her. Read \\"To Ride Pegasus\\" or \\"Pegasus In Flight,\\" earlier books set in the same universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well.........","review":"This book isn't as deep as the others. I liked the Hiver parts, and about finally learning more about the Dini's.She recently mentioned the Charter, but I would like the gap filled in between the Pegasus books (To Ride Pegasus, and Pegasus in Flight) and The Rowan. I think it's facinating what happened with Talent.This was not her best book, not by a long shot, but McCaffrey fans are waiting for the REAL book to end the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I didn't realize that there was a 5th and concluding book to the Tower and the Hive series, and I consider it a waste of money, because there was nothing really in this book that was must-read material. The story may as well have ended with Lyon's Pride (which was probably the worst book out of the first 4). Anne McCaffery _could_ and _did_ write better.Ms. McCaffery introduces a few antagonists, but they aren't enough of a menace to make you feel worried that the protagonists may actually have a real fight on their hands. The conclusion is as anti-climactic as can be, when the Human/Dini alliance (ok, fine, pretty much the Gwyn/Raven/Lyon clan on their own) finds a simple way to address the main problem, and then the story just ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tower and the Hive","review":"Buying the book was an adventure, I was looking for another book in this series, and this book was shipped on time and arrived in the condition described, This was a totally satisfactory transaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still worth a read.","review":"I am an Anne McCaffrey fan and have all her books and although this won't be in my list of top ten books; it is still a good read.

Personally, I thought the pheromone solution was quite ingenious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rushed, disappointing end to the saga...","review":"The Rowan/Damia series, has to date been wonderful. But not here! In an ending I describe as \\"throw the material from two books into one and finish it up\\" this book looks VERY rushed, pushed and uncomfortable with itself. What a shame to end the series on such a note. People and events are refered to out of context to such an extent that you reread earlier parts of the book to make sure the pages aren't missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - not a page turner","review":"My wife eagerly wanted me to read this concluding novel of the Talents series, yet it left me feeling empty. It had been a few years since I've read the other novels, so the storyline had faded from memory. Unfortunately, the novel did not draw me back into these characters. By bringing everyone back and wrapping things up - everyone felt like minor characters. There was no tension and no buildup, and no reward for me. It felt like having a postscipt extended into a full length novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a terribly good read","review":"I've read Anne Mccaffrey books since I was 14 & loved them all, but The Tower & the Hive left me so disappointed. Wishy-washy characters, weak storylines, and more questions than answers does not make a good final book in the series. The story also didn't flow for me & seemed unfocused. What on earth were the publishers thinking letting this book go to print? A pre-teen new to her work may get some enjoyment from this book, but not those who have read McCaffrey's other books and know how well she truly can write."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another installment in a tradition of Excellence!","review":"This is one of the best books McCaffrey had written.

Though it is enhanced for the gamers of today who can't go without better graphics or enhancements, it is at the very least a must-play. I think it is better than Anthology because it is faster.

(I'm sorry, I look at it as \\"choosing\\" to not let my house go into foreclosure!) Modern moms - pass this book up in favor of a book with more realistic, practical advice, and skip this book on baby-wearing, co-sleeping, and being a \\"breastfeeding couple\\" with your child until the the child weans himself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Judgmental LLL Propaganda","review":"There are several really excellent breastfeeding books on the market that have a positive, practical and sensitive approach to all types of mothering and feeding practices. This is not one of them. This is a 400 page advertisement for La Leche League and the message that I received from this book is that good mothers breastfeed and give birth naturally and everyone else just didn't try hard enough. It is subtle, but once I noticed it, I could not avoid the glaring fact that this book is laced with masked criticism and veiled judgment. Wouldn't it be great if, in the collective group we refer to as mothers, we could all stop looking down on each other and promote acceptance instead? If you feel the same way that I do, you will not buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Service was great, book was a let down.","review":"I was not impressed with this book at all. That being said. The sales transaction was quick and easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I wanted guilt, I would talk to my Mother","review":"This book was sent to me by a well-meaning relative. I started reading it about a month before I gave birth and could not get past the judgemental tone of the book. It made it seem like you are a bad Mother if you decide to ween your child or decide to have anything but a drug-free, natural birth.The whole book read like an advertisement for the Le Leche League. I had every intention of breastfeeding, and still do. But reading this made me reluctant to attend any of the La Leche League meetings or calling them for help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Real Impressed","review":"I wasn't very impressed with this book. Anyone who wants to breastfeed and has decent knowledge on the subject won't get much out of it, in my opinion. I read and read and read trying to find something that I didn't already know with no success. And it pushes LLL like crazy. Which I understand, but it got to be a bit much. Plus, if for some reason you aren't able to breastfeed, it makes you feel like a failure. Like you were a wimp, or not woman enough to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who needs the guilt?","review":"This book was so horrible, I returned it even after hunting it down because it came so highly recommended. I was incredibly disappointed with the militant views and the quotes from over-dramatic women implying that you have to be some kind of martyr to be a good mother. One example is \\"research\\" stating that if you don't stay home and mother your child until age three they will turn out aggressive with less ability to love others. Another is the quote from the mother who suffered through pain while breastfeeding but would look down at her child and decide it was worth it. Breastfeeding and mothering are hard enough without this extra stress."},{"rating":"1","title":"disinformation","review":"I was sorely disappointing in reading just the first chapter. Information relayed in the book as to epidural effects on breastfeeding was used as a scare tactic as was the pushing natural delivery.I was most disappointed because this is a group that comes highly recommended and yet presents opinions as facts that are in direct contrast to the Mayo Clinic.It was a waste of $13."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Advertising","review":"I wanted advice on breastfeeding, but apparently purchased a 400+ page advertisement for LLL meetings and products, with propaganda thrown in for good measure. \\"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding\\" offers basic infant advice found in any good parenting/pregnancy book, and from my perspective offered nothing significant either in terms of infant care or breastfeeding advice. The tone of the guide itself was a large detractor for me - as was being told every other page that \\"x\\" was available for purchase from LLL, or that \\"Ms. Y\\" attended a LLL meeting and everything was just peachy (most often without sharing the advice that seemed to make everything better). Personally, I believe this book is a big waste of time and money - you can find the same information elsewhere without all the additional ads and scare tactics"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and Bad","review":"I've really enjoyed this book. It is very informative and has taught me a lot about breastfeeding without pain. It also was a great motivator and comforter to read the many benefits of breastfeeding. The only thing that I would warn to other readers is that some of the \\"facts\\" in the book about how you should be caring for your child (ie: a 'family bed', breastfeeding ONLY, ect.)are very biased toward certain opinions."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Baby Shower Gift","review":"I loved this book when I was nursing my own children and have given it as a baby shower gift ever since. It contains accurate and timely physiology answers, lifestyle options, common problems and solutions that are easy to find and use. Nursing is natural but so are many challenges. This book is the \\"GO TO FIRST\\" reference for new moms. I am an RN and learned lots."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Womanly Art\\" is a masterpiece!","review":"Support is the #1 factor when it comes to breastfeeding success. Organizations like La Leche League support through their books, meetings, and one-on-one consultations. This book lays the ground work; explaining the benefits of breastfeeding, how to begin nursing, solving problems, and weaning. Through a combination of books like this one and real life support from friends, Lactation Consultants and/or women at La Leche League, Mamas can get off to a good start and to continue their breastfeeding relationship for as long as desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding","review":"I thought this was a great book. It not only talks about breastfeeding; it reviews a lot of other helpful topics that first time mothers can use as a guide to get them through that first year of parenting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not realistic...","review":"My mother-in-law bought me this book and I started reading it the first time I was pregnant and it turned me off of breastfeeding from the start. It assumes that all women are able to quit working and stay at home with their children, therefore being able to breastfeed exclusively. It looks down on women who may need to give their baby a bottle because they are going back to work. I work full time and plan to return to work after maternity leave, I was looking for more of a book to help me understand what I can do to continue doing what's best for my child, this book is way to preachy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Information but not what I craved","review":"My mom bought me this book b/c I wanted a BFing book. The first bunch of chapters were interesting but after that, I could have done without. I knew most of that information but maybe that was my fault. LLL did a good job with this book though. I read it for maybe 2 weeks and put it away. I wasn't quite what I was looking for. I didn't and don't know what it was I was looking for but I still wanted more information after having this book. Again, this is just my opinion. Good Luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good condition!","review":"I received this book in the time expected and it was in great condition, like new!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Breastfeeding help or Attachment Parenting?","review":"If breastfeeding is all you're looking for, don't buy this book. The information given was no more helpful to me than a small pamphlet that I had received from WIC. And the exact same information was repeated 4 or 5 times throughout the book, with no added tips or pointers. Maybe you can skim one or two chapters (the ones that are actually about breastfeeding)at the bookstore to learn all you can, but you won't need the whole thing.If, however, you want a lesson on attachment parenting... go for it. You'll get all you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too judgemental and pushy","review":"I really do not like this book. I am all for breastfeeding but in this book they really talk down to you and act like you are terrible if for some reason you choose not to or can't breastfeed. Also they don't give you a whole lot of helpful advice on how to do it, they try but The Nursing Mother's Companion and Spilled Milk are two books that you should buy instead of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better resources available elsewhere","review":"I found this book poorly organized and written. At the time I purchased it, I was already planning to breastfeed, and while I found I agreed with most of the substantive material in the book, I couldn't stand its preachy, condescending and dogmatic style. Nearly every chapter contains the same repetitive arguments for why breastfeeding is wonderful, and downplays the very real difficulties that some mothers experience with breastfeeding. The book is short on practical tips, and finding information on a specific topic is difficult due to poor chapter and index organization."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"This book annoyed me to no end. I am a thinking, practical woman and with all the troubles we had (mastitis, yeast, oversupply, work, food allergy), I needed some guidance, not stupid anecdotes about other people who had that problem and still breastfed.This book is not informative and is not a guide for breastfeeding. If you want instructions, not stories, get the nursing mother's companion book. It actually tells you how to handle situations rather than how other people were in that situation and were so glad they kept breastfeeding through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This book answered all my question reguarding breastfeeding and was a good reference after I had my daughter and was able to look back and read it. I like how it give support numbers and organization!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tried and True -- Must Have for Breastfeeding","review":"This book first became known to me with the birth of my son in 1979. I used it with all three of my children, and now have ordered the current edition for my son's wife. Breastfeeding is indeed a womanly art, and it is cultivated and nurtured by this resource that is more than a how-to manual: it's a trusted friend, an wise companion to take on a journey well worth traveling. I can only speak of this book in glowing terms. It answered all my questions throughout the entire breast-feeding experience. It instilled confidence in me, even though I had no prior knowledge of the womanly art. With each of my babies, I fondly remember peacefully nursing and reading the book simultaneously. I felt so privileged to have such a capable guide; it felt like I was being instructed in the art of the best way of loving the babe in my arms."},{"rating":"1","title":"No help increasing milk supply","review":"Yes, I agree with all the comments about this book being very smug about non-breast feeding or formula-supplamenting mothers. My problem with this book was the very clear indication on the back cover that there was information on how to increase milk supply. The was absolutely NO such information ANYWHERE in this book, and I read it cover to cover. The closest thing I found were a few reassuring comments that as long as your baby is gaining weight, and your diet is good, you should be fine. As a working mom who is pumping daily I have recently noticed a decline in my milk, and while their reassurance is very nice, what I need is ACTUAL practical advice. This book was seriously irritating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful for first time Moms","review":"This book is pretty big and a lot to read for anyone, especially a new Mom who has her hands full with a newborn. I would recommend reading it while still pregnant to find out about what to expect when you begin nursing, and simple solutions to common problems BEFORE you experience them. After baby is born, this book is useful as a reference or support guide from day one through toddlerhood. It discusses the mother-child bond, nutrition and proper diet for baby from her first foods to the terrible twos. I've used this book more as a reference from time to time, turning to the chapter that most fits my need. The stories other Moms share are relatible and supportive. This is a wonderful book for Dads too because it helps men to understand the sacred, unspoken bond a mother shares with her nursing baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but I've read better","review":"This is a great book, but I prefer \\"The Nursing Mother's Companion\\" for practical tips and solutions to problems. This is a bit too preachy to me, but nevertheless, a great resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"New edition has great updates","review":"THE WOMANLY ART is an important book to me. I read an old edition while pregnant. Upon reading this new edition of the book with a baby in my arms, I fell in love with the words because they described mothering through breastfeeding and all the other concepts that I have since lived. I found information about flat nipples and nipple shields that was absent from earlier editions, and wished I had this information while I was struggling with a newborn. I reread other pages that provided the classic La Leche League information and now fully process the time-tested information. Information is factual and carries the spirit of mothering through breastfeeding with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simply invaluable purchase","review":"This is an absolute must have if you are planning to breastfeed. If it completely informative, encouraging and helpful, especially if you are having difficulties. Also going to the La Leche meetings if you need help or support are invaluable! You don't even need to be a member to attend! Its a great support sytem and a wonderful way for your children to socialize with others! Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave Me False Hope","review":"I read this book through during pregnancy (first child) and flipped through it again when I started having nursing problems. It set me up for failure because of the fact that they say \\"breastfeeding should be painless\\" (which is not entirely true) and because they paint a beautiful picture of breastfeeding (but it is quite ugly for many moms). They make is sound so natural and simple but in many cases it is horrendous. I had a DISASTER of a nursing experience despite having read this book and it wasn't because of any medical issues. Even when we were able to nurse pain-free, it was still quite unpleasant and inconvenient (this was a big disappointment because of what I read in the book). The book is written by women who had wonderful breastfeeding experiences and can't really offer any help or consolation to those who struggle or plainly dislike it. It does not paint a realistic picture about breastfeeding and will NOT prepare you to nurse your first child!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic source","review":"I was so glad to see that this is still in print. I used it faithfully 30 years ago. Recently my daughter had a baby, bought it for her,and she, too, now finds it a wealth of information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended for your home reference","review":"This is an amazing resource for anyone who is pregnant or has just had a baby. It is very affirming to the role of mother (and some bits about fathers in there, too). It answers all the tough questions about breastfeeding, gives examples, advice, encouragement. Several chapters in the back are devoted to specific difficulties and conditions. It is a great book. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dogmatic and Degrading","review":"This book is probably the most offensive thing I've ever read. The authors spend much of their time at the beginning of the book pushing forward their ideologies about how women should give birth and raise their child. I was looking for information about how to breastfeed my baby. Instead, I found myself being told that I should give birth without medication, and then have my baby sleep in between my husband and I for as long as the baby (!) chooses to do so. No thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like to be judged, read on","review":"I hated this book.When I tried to nurse my first child, who had multiple health issues at birth, I felt like a failure. Needless to say, this book compounded that feeling and made me feel like I should have a big \\"L\\" tattooed on my forehead. I recommend \\"So That's What They're For\\" by Janet Tamara. She makes you laugh, all the while giving you invaluable tips for every \\"nursing\\" roadblock you could run into. LaLeche League needs to get over their snooty selves and realize that there really is no ideal breastfeeding woman.

Its unlucky story has known multiple obstacles, beginning with the death of Jean Vigo, once the footage was over, the changes made by its producers as well as the successive restorations, being the last one in 1990, that carved in relief a violent film, tormented, fevered, filled of ideas and fantasy, featured by an exacerbated romanticism, almost devilish but profoundly human.Very few films have been able to depict with such poetry and conviction, the quotidian details, images hovered by an enraptured lyricism, in that hard to achieve dimension in which the real and the imaginary are blended with mesmerizing results.Extraordinary and majestic film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"This is my favorite movie; Dita Parlo and particularly Michel Simon are wonderful. The restoration is phenomenal. The DVD release is otherwise not particularly good but the movie is a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Great Film\\" seems dated","review":"We seem compelled to make lists. As we aproach the end of the century, it's hard to open a newspaper or magazine without finding out who were the top 10 supermodels of the '90s or the top 10 chicken soup recipes of all time. So of course, the question of the best films of all time keeps popping up, and most critics agree; this is one of those films. It was released in Paris in '34 just days before its 29 year old director died. Moviegoers were still excited by pictures with sound in them at this time, and the art of film making was evolving rapidly. As a result, good films released then earned their \\"great\\" status based on how deeply they influenced the future. The film remains a very good movie, but in the opinion of this reviewer it has been surpased in the 65 years since its release."},{"rating":"2","title":"River of life","review":"L'Atalante tells the simple story of the trials and tribulations of newlyweds who literally float down the river of life. But there's much more to this movie. The poetic cinematography, the down-to-earth characters, etc. give the film an almost enchanted quality. So many things ring true in this film. The scenes where the newlyweds try to adjust to each other's habits and idiosyncrasies will have you nodding your head. Dita Parlo gives an excellent perfomance as Juliette, the naive young wife who's attracted to the bright lights of Paris, only to discover the seedier side of the city. Michel Simon's role as Jules has to rank among the greatest supporting performances ever. I loved the scene where Jules shows Juliette some of his prized possessions. It's such a shame director Jean Vigo died at a young age. Just think of how many more great movies he would have made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works!","review":"I've been using these since I received them, they actually do make a cleaner cut.

This is a slip over and not a hook style, and the extra fabric on the shoulders make this bra really comfortable.I love that I can just open each side easily around my breast for easy in and easy out. One bad thing is that since it is a low cut bra, you might pop out a bit when laying on your side, but it has never come out all the way and also you can't really use the larger nursing pads because they do stick out.I am normally a 36B and now a 36-38 C/D, and I am using a Medium just fine.For the price, value, and convenience, this is a highly recommended bra.

The elastic band around my ribs fit fine and was almost to maximum stretch yet the cups and shoulders were way too big. The cups extended past the elastic band so there was a lot of loose fabric under my arms and this left me unsupported in the middle.

That set was done to side-step contractual troubles regarding rights to material, as ARS was trying to re-establish itself in the mid 90s. While the remakes are a curious listen, this 1991 Polydor collection does tremendous justice to a wonderful group. I can't top Kevin's great review seen in these pages, so this was mainly to clear up the misunderstanding about the bogus best-of.

Even the wacky 70s Marvel stuff that most people hate - Eternals, 2001, Captain America. I also love the Black Panther. As written by Priest, he's one of my favorite Marvel characters. I never had read any of Kirby's 70s BP run until this collection came out. I'm wishing I still hadn't encountered this. I was ready (and expecting) a ton of weirdness and nonsensical stuff going on but I really wasn't prepared for how badly plotted and written this stuff is. To me, this is absolutely the worst Kirby-written product I've read. Knowing the potential of the character makes these awful stories even worse. The art is great 70s Krazy Kirby but it really doesn't make up for the bad stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a 0 star rating??","review":"This is one of the worst technical books I have ever had the misfortune to purchase.

Now, my daughter lives in So Calif where the temperatures exceed 100 degrees in the Palm Springs area so how in the world would anyone with a mind think that these would arrive without any damage after having been in a hot FedEx delivery truck --- you would think a grower or supplier would have a better idea of shipping fresh flowers.

What really struck me about this wonderful book was not only does it capture your interest, but if you are paying attention, it contains many important lessons about life!

But when I got home I did a quick read-through of area I'm familiar with and discovered these authors know nothing about correct directions or facts.For example, I found a listing for a covered bridge in Pennsylvania that I used to live next to. Armed only with this book, no one will ever find it. That's because it's about two miles west of it's listed location and it's on a completely different road. Not to mention there are no signs to aide lost tourists.Then there's the mention that the Appalachian trail runs through the Catskills in New York \\"from Pennsylvania to Vermont\\".

As such, this is a book you read for what you can learn rather than for literary pleasure.Nonetheless, it is enjoyable reading for someone (like myself) with no particular interest in the region or the time nor interest in female literature solely for the gender of the author.The most surprising piece is a poem written by a woman to a woman.

Her \\"knowledge\\" is a tissue of myths, extreme prejudices, and confusion. My favorite: \\"The doctrine of Immaculate Conception, which made the Virgin Mary herself the child of a virgin birth, was an ingenious way of sparing Jesus Christ the indignation of having to pass through a contaminated mother. As a second generation virgin, Mary presumably was free of the curse of Eve.\\" (11) Mary is conceived by normal sexual intercourse between her parents, but by anticipation she does not have original sin. Having never read Steven Runciman or a dozen other scholars on the Cathars/Gnostics/Manichees, she presents them as \\"pacifists and vegetarians\\" (58), which would greatly amuse the Cathars! Far from seeing women as \\"equal,\\" they particularly deplored women, who by giving birth served evil.

The instructions that came with it are terrible. They look like a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy. The text is hard to read and many of the illustrations are illegible. Many of the instructions and illustrations are incorrect, omitting steps that must be done and including steps that have either been completed at the factory or simply do not apply to this particular bike.

We love it. It arrived quickly, and in great shape. The bike was fine on it's own, but we added white-wall cruiser tires, Avenir Fenders, a trip computer, and lights to give it a retro-beachy look. My only complaint is that the seat posts are difficult to adjust and the post clamps have to be tightened extremely hard to keep the post from moving. Other than that, it's a great cruiser, my wife and I enjoy our rides very much. It's easy to ride, and easy to get up to a good speed. We are able to get it up to 15 mph on a flat surface without much difficulty. It has very high quality Shimano shifters, which operate very smoothly, not cheap by any means. We did however, have to adjust the derailleurs a little bit too get it to shift into every gear, but that's common to all multi-speed bikes.

Quite honestly, if I could perform every technique in this book and do it well, I would be extremely happy. The only criticism of the book are the defenses against punches and grabs.

Well grounded and fast paced, the story is well told and as good as any tale by Cornwell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent tale of middle age life","review":"I am a huge fan of B. Cornwell form his earlier books and this one is another riveting story. His ability to discribe the difficulties of life in those days is amazing. I find that the constant warfare between Britain and France must have been a constant drain on the populations of both countires. The details of archery are great. That was indeed a brutal age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull & Bloody","review":"This book was an alright read but it really dragged in parts. The author often seemed determined to show the depth and breadth of his historical research instead of delivering a well paced story. Amazingly even the climatic battle scenes dragged on and on with repetitive workmanlike writing. It felt at the end like Cornwell was writing to hit an total page count for his publisher. This whole book could have been 100 pages shorter and better for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Cornwell I've read","review":"I've read all of the Saxon series and Agincourt, and will have to say I think this one is the best so far. I think the writing is better, and the characters more sympathetically portrayed. Uhtred in the Saxon series seems to have a limited range of emotions, and after a few of the books it begins to boil down to what will happen in the next battle, which becomes increasingly predictable. But the dialog and interactions between the characters in The Archer's Tale are much more finely drawn, and while I read what they are saying to each other it draws up mental images of their voices and expressions. Thomas is a more complete person than Uhtred, and we have hints that he can become more than the person that his times have made him, that the story is not just about triumphing as a warrior, but growing in understanding. Not having read the final two books in the series I hope that potential will be realized by the end, but suspect that would be too much to hope for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Cornwell","review":"I, personally, didn't care for this book as much as some. I think the problem was I had just finished reading the Uthred series, which I thought were fantastic and anything after that was going to be a slight disappointment. If you like this genre then don't give it a second thought about buying this book, you wont be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Historical Fiction","review":"I didn't realize, going in, that this was a historical fiction. I thought it was only fiction. It is a very good read and I'm looking forward to the next 3 books in the series.At the end of the book the author explains his \\"inventions\\" in actual history and it is very smooth and doesn't deviate from actual events.The main character, Thomas, is stubborn but quite likable. You find yourself really getting behind him and routing for him.You are left with a wonderful conclusion and at the same time a good cliffhanger.My only problem with the book, and I'm sure it will continue, is that there are way too many \\"g*ddams\\". I'm sure we all get the point after the first dozen times it's said."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great start to a new series","review":"I have been a fan of Bernard Cornwell's books ever since Winter King. His books are all gritty, realistic portrayals of a very different world that we live in. Cornwell eloquently uses words to paint a vivid picture, and the stories come alive with his skill in desription. Thomas of Hookton, like Derfel Cadarn, is a compelling hero, unwilling to accept what destiny has to store for him while rising to the challenge all the same. From the initial skirmish at Hookton till the amazing imagery of the battle of Crecy I was hooked (pun not intended). Great writing from a fantastic author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent History and Action together","review":"Cornwell is always an entertaining read and The Archer's Tale holds true to form.

He blends historical events and characters with fictional characters to bring this period to life. His research and knowledge of the times comes across to the reader in a very lively and entertaining way. I have read Agincourt, the Archers tale trilogy, the Saxon series, and am now finishing up the Arthur series. They are all terrific stories and I am worried what I will do when I am finished with Excaliber. Mr. Cornwell you will just have to write more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Start of a Wonderful New Series!","review":"The choice of a young archer for this latest series beginning in the mid thirteen hundreds is an interesting one. The invention of the long bow changed the way battles were engaged in its time. This story line also depicts the interwoven stresses upon the life of the peoples living through the start of the Hundred Years War, when as many battles were fought to gain religious power and approval from Rome (and therefore better access to their great financial resources) as for possession of kingdoms and their lands. Thomas of Hookton is a typical Cornwell creation in that he retains a secret goal which sends him questing far and wide, and his particular skill wins him valued placement with powerful men of his time. There are great battle scenes, sex scenes and good historical content. As usual, the brush strokes of the story were so vivid that I found myself breaking away from my reading to do a little further research into the history behind the fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alas, not Mr. Cornwell's best...","review":"Not bad for pulp fiction, but falls far, far short of the standard set by the \\"Saxon Tales.\\" Mr. Cornwell can do much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessarily Violent","review":"Probably an interesting story in the end, but I just can't get through the graphic violence. The story begins with a raid on an medieval English village in which nearly everyone is killed. The survivor begins the rest of his life avenging the deaths of his family and the theft of a religious relic. Sounds promising, no? But after getting through the initial violent beginning the book continues in the same vein.It occurred to me that maybe this kind of graphic violence is what appeals to (or rather is meant for) men who want to read adventure-type books - lots of blood, descriptions of what arrows do to various parts of the body, horses 'screaming' (a particular ugly picture in my mind), and other descriptions of various ancient tools of war. No thanks.I was looking for a captivating historical fiction read on vacation (picked the book up at a used book store). Instead of a book where the story is key I got book with violence as the main character. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable Read","review":"I must admit that I don't read a lot of historical fiction,but on a friend's advice, I picked up this book and found itto be an interesting read.

Unfortunately, it's not much better. I can't understand why these books get such rave reviews. The characters are flat, stereotypical, and predictable. The writing is at a 7th or 8th grade level. The plot is stale and arbitrary. But ooh! It's violent and there's lots of rape and battles, so it must be interesting. Yawn.For the record, I gave up on page 43, by which time the recently-introduced villain Sir Simon had been described as replying \\"sourly\\" FIVE times in as many pages.

It was still unbearably bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing...","review":"I bought this book some time ago because: 1) someone reccommended it to me and 2) it was set during the 100 Years War. As a holder of a History BA and having a keen interest in the Middle Ages (specifically the HYW) I was pretty interested in this, and perhaps my hopes were set too high. I found it to be pretty predictable, the main character had nothing that would keep me interested in him, and overall I found it pretty melodramatic. I think if I were 16 I might like it much more, but at 28 I have more discerning tastes. I think the main criticism I have about this book, however, is that like Chrighton's _Timeline_ at no point did I feel convincingly like I was in the mid 14th C."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?

Now, I read, on average, one large paperback novel a week. As an avid reader, I have also become quite picky. I enjoy the finer books, the gourmet. This novel was based upon the life and times of Thomas of Hookton, and his experiences in northern France during the opening of the Hundred Years War.

These are my first Bernard Cornwell books but definitely won't be my last. If these are any indication of his story telling prowess then I'm definitely a new fan.Thomas of Hookton is raised from childhood to be an English longbowman. Raised by his eccentric and mad relative (a priest) and orphaned young in his life the story of Thomas's search for the secrets of his family's past which holds within them the secrets of the Holy Grail is fascinatingly told.

While some might argue that Mr. Cromwell has a problem with the actions of evil nobles, the truth of the matter was that the nobility of the time were often beasts. That the hero of the story resists as well as he does was more likely the exception than the rule.Besides being historically believable, the plot was equally solid and the characters were realistic.

The movie starts with no real direction, you're following around a mentally ill man who wants to find his young daughter. After a while you're thinking \\"OK, I get the picture, he's disturbed and lost, now what?\\" Well, now nothing. There really isn't anything more to this.

But it exploits this stereotype of a homicidal maniac that our culture is obsessed with. So its negatives tip the scale towards yakkk. The acting is great, he plays a convincing lead man, Winter. Thats the scary thing, its so believable, yet not true...schitzofrenic people are far different. they can lead normal/average...maybe enlightened, productive lives. The story was told from an interesting angle, through sounds and experiences of a scattered lead character.

I'm not sure about how long the cartridges last, but it seems like a good long time.

So much so that my white printing paper looks gray once it's been printed on. Yes, I have shaken it to spread the ink but to no avail. I now have tons of scratch paper because everything I've printed on so far is trash. It's too embarassing to submit.So now, I'm waiting for my new HP toner this week.

Eventually it started to print without such dark blots (after about 50 pages), but because it had wasted so much ink on making awful blots, now the prints come out with light patches.In other words, this product is cheap in price and even cheaper in quality.

Print quality isn't always perfect, but it's adequate for the job (I'm an attorney, and I file many court documents printed with these cartridges).Do the math: 14 performing cartridges for $170 or less this way; 14 cartridges from Staples for $7,000 or more.

Like others, I tried plenty of times to shake the cartridge to redistribute the toner to no avail. This is not only an inconvenience, but also a waste of money. If you don't mind the spotty reliability and risk of being without a printer (if or when this cartridge fails and you need to go get a replacement), then this product could potentially save you some money.

Don't know if I'm going to get 1,000 or 1,500 or even 2,000 pages from this toner replacement but the way I see it, $10 is more than worth it for any of those quantities. I have an HP LaserJet 1012 - no color, duplex or multiple uses other than straight B&W; printing. HP (thru Staples or their own website) wants $80 PLUS tax. It's a simple laserjet for simple printing - if this is what you have, you can't go wrong with this product IMHO.**UPDATE** less than 1 month and 50 pages later, streaks and blank areas on every sheet. Yes, I'm shaking it. PLUS, the original seller is no more as they changed names presumably secondary to all the bad press. I have to go with an OEM product here to get my money's worth, I guess.

Most of the left side of printed sheets were very faded from the very beginning and even after repeatedly rocking cartridge as per the instructions for before initial use. This product did not work anything like a new, not remanufactured or otherwise refilled, HP toner cartridge. It performed as if it were nearly empty. Since I needed a replacement cartridge immediately after waiting a week for this product to be delivered, I purchased a genuine HP toner cartridge at a local brick and mortar store. The latter worked flawlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works until it doesnt","review":"The genuine HP lasts 2,000 prints or more.

All seemed to be ok, but the printer rang/screeched when a document was sent to print. I figured I could live with that, but then it started jamming the printer now and again. Still, I need this printer for my business and will see how it goes down the line. I don't want to have to go out to a retail store and pay premium....but my business comes first. Wonder if others have experienced this problem. I know the price is extraordinarily low, but I went by all the reviews and felt I was safe to order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Work","review":"Wanting to save $63, I ordered this cartridge. I finally installed it tonight, and it printed just fine for the first sheet. All of the next sheets came out super light, then completely blank.

Shipping was fast and packaging was good, but the product just didn't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not professional grade","review":"You get what you pay for. The cartridge I purchased leaves an ink \\"smudge\\" every other inch down the right side of every page printed as if the drum has a fault. No amount of shaking of the cartridge will fix the problem. Consequently, the cartridge is worthless where professional quality work is required. I now use this cartridge only for draft work and copying the daily crossword puzzle. I purchased a new HP cartridge for anything leaving the house. My advice, save your money if you require professional quality printing."},{"rating":"1","title":"HP profit center","review":"Last 12A cartridge leaked toner. Not good. Didn't last very long, either, though that's just more perception than anything else. If there was a God, He'd introduce the concept of competition into the toner cartridge business... best way to reduce the high costs, without resorting to \\"remanufactured\\" cartridges.Of course, HP simply will respond as it currently does by introducing a new cartridge design with every different printer it makes, an infuriating practice.

I would definitely order this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The item does not fit in my hp laserJet 1200 Series printer. I request a refund. It is not a good policy to sell items by misrepresenting their function. It seems amazon suggested item to fit/be compatible with the noted printer was not correct. Amazon recomended us to buy 12A cartridge that does not fit. After further research we found out that the right cartridge should have been 15A. Please send me a 15A replacement or refund my money ASAP.. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT an HP cartridge","review":"It was under $20 and Great Toners, the vendor, had amazing ratings, so I was willing to risk it. But be warned: Although the description is for an HP cartridge, and what's pictured is an HP cartridge box, what you'll get is a knockoff. I have no idea how long this no-name cartridge will last, but I'm not expecting HP quality. For the price, I'm willing to give it a shot, but I'm angry at the false advertising from Great Toners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Quality & Too Late to Return!!!","review":"These cartridges definitely prove that you get what you pay for. I have had them too long to return having ordered them ahead of time. The quality of print is terrible with every page being gray and quite difficult to read. Nothing printed with this could be used for business purposes. I am very disappointed and here I am stuck with two of these things!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Toner.

I didn't faced any problem so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Streaks!","review":"The toner was complete junk. Every page I printed had a black streak down the far right hand side of the page. I took it out, examined it, and tried to clean it, but it still streaked. It also left chunks of dried toner on some documents.I finally took it outside, smashed it up, and threw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to be a great product with great savings!","review":"Just received this item today, great item with no immediate problems experienced and at a \\"great price\\".Be sure to look carefully as there are two different tapes/tabs that need to be removed before use. One tape is on the drum, and the other is on the left side (a long tab that hast to be pulled out) which keeps the powder in place during shipping. No problems and no \\"mess\\" because of packing and execution of refurbishing/refilling by the company. Hope it last as long as the original that came with the printer a long while back. Will update if any issues are found in the near future. Great item, do not hesitate to buy and save $50."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work For Me","review":"I thought I would save some money and buy this cartridge instead of the HP one. All I did was create a lot of problems. It printed with specks on the pages and then black lines. I would have to remove the cartridge and clean it and it would work for a couple of pages then the specks and black lines would come back. I finally just ordered the HP cartridge and I haven't had any problems. I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 out 5 worked - 1 had a bad drum and didn't work","review":"Fair enough price with adequate amount of toner in each, however, one was bad from the get-go with a bad drum and unable to print properly. Used it in different printers and all gave the same thick black lines all over the page. Unfortunate really as I thought I had found a decent way to supply my office with toner without resorting to eBay or expensive local options. Will look for another vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic","review":"This product is listed as \\"HP 12A Toner Cartridge\\"...I chose this one because I wanted the name brand. However, the product is actually the generic version. It seems to work okay for now. But definitely false advertisement."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For ...","review":"The physical cartridge works well, and I trust from the other reviews that it will last. However, my experience is that the ink, the toner itself, is definitely not the same quality of the hp. At first I noticed a slight streak, more like a strip about an inch wide of ink chips going down the page. Next I noticed in that same strip, the ink does not adhere to the page as it should. There are tiny chips from the letters that come off the page.Furthermore, I tend to work with my documents on the page, and as I edited, crossed things out, rewrote in the margins ( pages lie around on my desk for days as I work out kinks of my writing ), it was clear the ink chips off and simply does not last like that of the hp. I don't mean the whole page becomes illegible. I'm talking about chips, but clearly noticeable. This is not what I want, especially if I want to send things out in a professional setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cheap toner that works","review":"HP asked me $70 to replace my toner so I ordered this one. It worked well for a few days before I noticed some uneven grayness at the center of the page. I shaked the toner again and the problem disappeared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre experience","review":"I went with this toner cartridge based on the great reviews. However, maybe it was just a unique incident, but the toner cartridge I received did not have a solid working drum. It could print out a solid black page fine, but normal text came out uneven. And yes, I shook the toner cartridge plenty of times to spread the toner. The toner looks to be fine. I ended up having to transfer the toner back to the original HP cartridge and I'm back in action. I did not contact customer support since I could not afford to be without a working printer for more than a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laserjet does its job","review":"This toner cartridge is for the HP 1012 (and others). As fas as toner goes, this one lasts a long time. I use it often and for heavy duty printing, including resumes on resume paper, term papers for school on high quality laser paper, and websites, which usually contain images that come out in black and white, using up more toner. I would say that the toner gave me just about 2,500 sheets, and it is just now fading. When you balance the price of this printer with the price for toner every 2,500 sheets, it is a very good deal (less than 3 cents a page when calculating just the toner). My printer does not make any noise with this toner! If you have this printer, then you wont be sorry when using this toner replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Initially good, then misbehaves.","review":"I initially gave this a rave review but I've got to come and change it to reflect a new experience with it. At first, it printed just fine. Couldn't tell the difference between it and the OEM one. Now, a month or so later, it leaves vertical lines. After every 10 copies or so, I've got to remove the cartridge and shake it, and hope that fixes it. If it fixes it, it will re-appear after another dozen copies. Sometimes it will simply have a blank vertical space that runs the length of the page.I won't be buying another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"unacceptable quality","review":"I returned this toner cartridge. Since I pay less than the orignial HP toner price, I don't mind if the volume of this toner is less only if it works cleanly and efficiently. However, it is NOT. There is always three black dots on the printouts caused by this toner cartridge, which is unacceptable. It's just like you print out something from a dirty copy machine. It seems that it is a refilled toner cartridge but is not refilled properly. I returned the product and would rather pay the full price for a normal one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problematic. I'd avoid it.","review":"I gave this 2 stars instead of one because eventually 500 pages later, the line going down every page I printed went away. The quality was never perfect, and I often had weird splotches. No, it wasn't my brand new laser printer. It was the cartridge. The fact is, you're taking a risk with the remanufactured toner cartridges. In my case it wasn't anything more than an annoyance because I was in grad school, and most of the stuff I printed up was to workshop with my peers. But I couldn't use it for anything professional. I have since purchased a brand new toner cartridge, and it works perfectly. This is not to say that EVERY remanufactured toner cartridge will have performance issues, but mine did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't even read printouts from this cartridge","review":"Bought 3 of these cartridges since HP doesn't seem to support this anymore.The print quality is so light, you can barely read the text. Some areas are faint and others are even lighter.DO NOT BUY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I had to use this product because I was out of toner, But the quality is poor and the prints are not very clear and visible just like it is going to run out again, with the exception that these cartridge is supposed to be working like new. I have seen and work with much better product before and this does not meet any of the standards. Again this is a very poor quality replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable","review":"How sad - completely unusable. I tried all the tips, but the drum was damaged and I didn't get a single copy off this. Back to square one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't work right from Day-One","review":"Almost from Day-One this toner was spotty. I shook it and it worked for a few pages. Then the same happened again and again. When it's not working, almost half of a page won't print or is very sparse. I don't recommend it because it's a big hassle.*** UPDATE ***I got less than 100 pages out of this -- and I almost never print graphics -- usually only a few paragraphs per page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty after 2 months","review":"I purchased this because it was so much cheaper than the branded cartridge. It has lasted just 2 months with little use. Previous expensive branded cartridges have lasted many months to over a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm!!","review":"So far, these cartridges have performed as expected. The print is clear and crisp, no streaks or squeaking noises. I am always afraid of purchasing the refurbished cartridges because you never know quite what you will get. However, the price was right and I will hope that all 4 cartridges turn out alright!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I love buying things from amazon whenever I can but I must say buying toner cartridges isn't easy. It's very easy to be deceived because of how things are pictured or worded. I actually thought I was buying a genuine HP product, which I always do when it comes to printers/copiers. I should have known when I saw I could buy 4 cartridges for the price of 1. The description made me believe that what I was getting a genuine HP product. Well let me tell you that is NOT what I got! When I can acutally get the cartridge to print...the black color is good. I have to stop about every 30 pages, take the cartridge out and shake the toner around otherwise it acts like it's out of toner...this started happening after I printed the first few pages. Needless to say I now have toner everywhere it doesn't belong and when I do print I get dirty copies. Lucky me I have 3 more cartridges to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective cartridge","review":"I purchased three of these cartridges back in March 2011. The first two worked just fine. The third was defective. It printed a black smudgy line along the right border of all of my paper. At first I thought it was my HP laser printer and tried cleaning it.

I have to say that it is a pretty revolutionary toothbrush. Very easy to use and cleans excellent without a doubt. The only problem is the battery! It usually dies very fast and cannot be replaced. Fast means even in few weeks. I followed all charging instructions, yet had no luck. This is not a single case, even a replacement toothbrush from \\"Bed Bath & Beyond\\" had the same problem. I've had 3 of these, but I finally got the clue! My recommendation to you is stay away from this product, it is probably a waste of your money.

But it is also typical of a much greater defect. The record companies waste our time and money by releasing comps containing tracks by both the original and \\"new\\" Animals, as if they are the same band. They are not. the only two members they have in common are Eric Burdon and Barry Jenkins. They are still two seperate musical entities.The first four tracks on this disc are by the original Animals, not Burdon's backing band of imposters, although the single release of \\"See See Rider\\" was erroneously credited to Eric Burdon & The Animals, It's still the original Animals. It was on the original band's last American album \\"Animalization, and was released the month the original band dissipated. It doesn't belong on this disc, nor does, \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" or \\"Inside-Looking Out\\"! It only confuses newcomers.

Only the first four cuts feature the original Animals. The rest feature Eric Burden and the \\"New\\" Animals. The groups are quite different. The original group played blues-based rock, and the new group played psychedelic rock. Personally, I prefer the original group's sound. But there are still some great tracks here, like \\"Sky Pilot\\" and \\"When I Was Young\\". It should be mentioned that \\"Inside Looking Out\\", \\"When I Was Young\\" and \\"A Girl Named Sandoz\\" are in mono, for some reason. I suppose they couldn't find the multi-track tapes for those songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT BAD","review":"This is a pretty decent CD that dips into both trippy-dippy hippie psychedelia and raw garage rock. I love that Girl Named Sandoz tune. ... As stated in other reviews, some of the lyrics are [weak] but that is not uncommon with many late '60s releases. If you like \\"Nuggets\\" style music then this CD is worth a listen, but those looking for the earlier R&B based Animals lineup should check out the Abkco Greatest Hits CD. The 1966-68 Animals roster is completely different, with the exception of Eric of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Compilation Of Late-60s Eric Burdon","review":"THE BEST OF ERIC BURDON & THE ANIMALS, 1966-1968 is a great collection that starts off in the Memphis-Chicago-Detroit-Great Plains blues-rock-soul vein of early Animals, and then quickly moves into psychedelia. The most compelling cut on this anthology is \\"Monterey\\", a hymn to the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, and in a way, amessage against treating anyone who doesn't fit a certain \\"little mold\\" as an outcast. This is a great anthology which any fan of classic rock should own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Sound Quality","review":"This is not a \\"best of\\" or \\"greatest hits\\" collection, too many songs are missing for that.

I do know I found it incredibly dumb that the \\"reason\\" our heroine was transported back in time was because of some freak accident the government was working on that she didn't know about.I also found it absurd and insulting to Navy Seals that the Seal sent back in time to bring the heroine back was so obsessed with his \\"mission\\" that he wouldn't let her bring with her a plant that might cure her brother, all because he had his \\"orders.\\" Please!

I have a king size bed, and couldn't afford a new mattress, so I looked into buying a topper. I have no had any pain at all in my back since I bought this topper. It is wonderful.

This item had obviously been returned, repackaged and sent to me. There was no markings on the item or within the box to let me know what company made this topper. When I unrolled the topper I discovered it was for a full bed, not a queen. Furthermore it did not become \\"spongy\\" like it was supposed to. It just stayed flat and did not expand. It did not even have that awful smell toppers have when you just open them. Very disappointing. I suspect a cheap substitute was sent to me. I bought another one at Wal-Mart instead.

It is strong, but the manufacturer does include instructions regarding this and that it should be aired out for AT LEAST 24 hours.The 2 inch one would probably have been a better choice as this is almost too thick, but it definitely made a difference with sleeping.The only downside I can think of is that it is a bit warm - doesn't necessarily provide good heat escape.

I now use the guest bed for rest when my back or body is particularly stressed, especially on those nights when I've had a strenuous KINESIS workout at the gym. Very comfy. I can sleep all night here, but I can also lay down for 20 minutes and feel refreshed and ready to go again!I can NOT use it with my regular mattress because our master bedroom mattress has the extra thick mattress with the suspension built in (as opposed to separate mattress and box springs).

The original mattress is really BAD. It considerably improved the \\"sleepability\\" of the bed. We don't have any other foam mattresses so it took some getting used to. The mattress conforms to one's body so turning over can be somewhat daunting. We bought the king size to go on our \\"trailer\\" queen size bed (which is shorter than a regular queen) since we were going to have to trim it anyway.

I was taking Biblical greek at the time of my purchase and ran into numerous problems. All the problems I had were due to the terrible print quality. Let me be clear what I mean. It was like reading a page off a cheap fax machine. The punctuation was quite unledgible in numerous instances. Please don't fall into this trap. If you cannot read the text correctly with it's punctuation, then you can easily translate incorrectly. I felt the need to bring this to peoples attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reference","review":"If you only bought one book on sex positions, this would be a good book. There were many pictures showing clearly how the positions worked and the text is loaded with basic wisdom that often gets ignored in the heat of passion.

After reading all the raving reviews from previous readers I ordered it and when it arrived I was very disappointed by the pictures. They are mostly black and white, very small (Expect 6 pictures per page, the guide doesn't have many pages) and of such poor definition, almost fuzzy, that you have to concentrate really hard to try and find out which part of the body belongs to which individual. It looked fairly complete, with twosome, treesome, foursome and the models had beautiful bodies although their hair style is almost a parody of the late seventies. I really didn't like this book and although it might be complete, I think this book needs a fresh new look with recent pictures of good definition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't support Derrick Grant!","review":"This album shows a weak side of the band.

It weaves in various Bible stories (the Mighty Fortress, the Great Shepherd, and more!) The Bible stories all have different drawings in them to illustrate the stories in a way that everyone can understand. Although the main characters are puppets, the students we had in grades K-10 all got something out of this video; you could've heard a pin drop as the video was shown. One of the neatest things on this video is the carving of the jack-o-lantern and a song that reminds us that we are Jesus' light. With song, a great storyline, and various Bible stories, everyone (yes, even adults!) can learn something new from this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative! An easy read...","review":"I have enjoyed reading books by both of these authors. The technical layout of information allows the reader to focus in on what is being presented.

Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And the point is?","review":"This CD-ROM consists of Adobe Acrobat files. It is a compilation of publicly available web pages that contain information about US Navy submarines and the submarine force. As far as I can tell, you could just as easily find the same material on the web with a decent search engine. For example, the CD contains the issues of Undersea Warfare magazine, which is readily available from a Navy public website. Many of the graphics are extremely blocky and unreadable. The web pages are largely DOD server downloads of public material, and are verbatim, right down to the warnings. A surprising number of pages are just \`spillovers\\" from the bottom of a web page, and contain no information. Clearly, almost no editing of the material was attempted when transferring to the disc. If you use the disc while online, you can click on the hyperlinks and they will take you to more information. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought this book was great.","review":"I have read the book and thought it was compelling and thought provoking. I think it is worth reading. By the way, it is very well-written, and it raised my respect for the author.I think you can use the information in the book in everyday life to understand people better, and be able to forgive them more easily when you follow the train of thought and theory about how people do what they do."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are easier books on the same subject","review":"This was not the first book I read by L Ron Hubbard, but when I did read it, it went over my head a bit. Then I read some other books by Hubbard and found them much more accessible for me. This book seems to be what the title states: the original thesis and it was later that the subject was more elaborated on. So I would not recommend this book as a first read, rather something like Dianetics, The Modern Science of Mental Health or even Scientology, A New Slant on Life. Both were much more accessible for me and gave me a very good understanding of the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to set","review":"I bought this watch for my son, who is almost 12.

However, DO NOT rely on this text as your only source of information as it does NOT cover all the material (probably about 70-80%).

This book has many basic errors and contradictions as did the version 7 guide. Its a real shame as it will mislead and confuse people who will then probably fail their exams.

Therefore, a two star."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's a good book to study for OCP","review":"I have just passed IZO-023 (second of the five-series) and this book is the only source for my study. I agree that there are some minor mistakes but in general, it is a good book and the author suggests several review sections at the end of each chapter enabling you to cover the whole part in a couple of pages. In summary, combined with some computer practice, this book should suffice for your OCP track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent !!","review":"I just went through the initial few chapters and it really is excellent. I think the author has changed the style from the older version (oracle 8 certified OCP book). The topics are arranged logically. It can be used even by a novice. The fonts are smaller and better.

I love this album and someone told me she had two more out in Brazil. If anyone knows of a source where I could obtain them - please email me at ze_povinho@hotmail.com.I can only reiterate what the other reviewers have said. Rita's music has a base in the local traditions of Northeastern Brazil, but there is a modern element as well which combines somehow combines berimbau, guitars and beats into some great songs. My favorites are \\"Ha Mulheres\\" and \\"Pensar em Voce\\" but the whole album is good. Believe it or not, I can see the comparison between The Who's \\"You Better You Bet\\" and \\"Ha Mulheres\\" in the way the song builds up and progresses around a simple, yet clever lyric. Very sharp observation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brava !","review":"The best I have ever heard in this genre. I am still trying to find other work by Rita.

It gives concise reviews of what the kid needs to know, so you can check her readiness. The practice items are very similar to the real tests, a very helpful warm-up. Note that such a thin book doesn't do much to improve math or reading. That requires daily learning in school and study in home. There is a nice web site http://www.beestar.org you can use weekly to assess your child's skill levels step by step. With the fundamentals in place, this book is a nice warm-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful book","review":"This book really helped me understand how the STAR works. It also helped me realize that even though my son knew the material, he did not have the appropriate test-taking skills (like, making a good guess, moving on if he didn't know a particular problem). We only did the practice tests, and did not read the other information. I found it very useful. Towards the end of the book, he had mastered the art of \\"moving-on\\".We also tried the beestar web-site as recommended by the another reviewer, but we did not find that quite as useful. The web-site only tests the students with 10 questions at a time. This book was much more realistic about how an actual test looks. I also agree with the publisher, that this book is not for teaching to the kids, but only for practicing test-taking skills, once they have learned the material.I would certainly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor durability","review":"Very comfortable, but not a good value.

Old C is by far more confusing in my opinion.This book is 1700 pages long - a big chunk of it is almost pure code dump, that could easily fit on a CD (and does).

The individual seasons were originally released at 60-70 bucks each, so for the complete series fans shelled out around $500, and for something that required an entire bookcase to display.

The packaging may be bulky, but it as far superior to that of DS9, VGR and ENT (I ordered those off the official site, so they are legit copies. The packaging is as cheaply made as others have noted).The video quality is obviously not 1080p, but I didn't think it looked as dreadful as others have complained. In fact I thought it looked really good upscaled, especially for a TV show shot in the 80's.

The discs actually play but they are in the infamous baggies and shoddy packaging that is described by hundreds of reviews I've read. The case underneath the shrink wrap looks like some kid was sliding around on the floor with it. The quality is bad, low quality I can accept because I know that for the most part TNG was filmed in video - but this is VHS copies 5 times bad. I inspected the DVD in the computer and noticed that it only holds around 4GB of space at capacity, much less than a quality DVD which should be around 8GB. Also, the data was created on July 24 2010 although the set was released in 2007? I'm really disappointed in Amazon for standing behind this product. I'd rather pay twice the price to get something from a physical seller than the junk and knock-offs you get online nowadays.Get the individual seasons instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half of all discs came scratched!","review":"It is insulting what PARAMOUNT has done in regards to the cases the discs come in. They put the 5 dollar dvd's at gas stations in better quality cases then these (LITERALLY 100%) I feel so ripped off because half my Next Generation episodes cannot be watched due to poor quality casing. The discs came with scratches and fall out every time you try to flip through them. Some were all ready out of place when opened for the first time!; Im just amazed at how terrible Paramount is with quality...... Im pissed off dont by the complete series, they might not even play when you pop em in the DVD player and you will experience extreme frustration thinking about all the money you just waisted.

I have the \\"silver box\\" set of all seven seasons, so I was curious what this new set had that was different. Per my review of the details at www.startrek.com the only differences are: (1)the new green slimmer packaging for the 7 seasons, and (2)one more disk (#49) with new features. All the other disks #1-48 are the same as the \\"silver\\" boxes---ie. all the episodes and all the same extra features for each season. This new set is still fullscreen and has the same audio options. It is not HD as some may have hoped. Therefore, if you already have the 7 seasons, at least for me, it makes no sense to buy this set just to get one extra disk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Trek The Next Generation Complete Series","review":"This complete series is not well organized. The disks are packaged all together--ie. not by Season, and there is NOT a synopsis of each episode.

Look for a Complete Series where the dvds are better organized physically, and have a summary of EACH episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disc Problems","review":"I was so excited when I ordered this, couldn't wait to get it. I watched Season 1, then almost all of Season 2. My disc player couldn't read the last disc. I received the replacement and had a problem with jumping images on season 1 even thought the disc was clean. I checked the disc, cleaned my player and tried again. Same problem. Amazon refunded my money promptly. In reading the reviews I noticed someone else had problems with their original purchase and their replacement. Apparently, Paramount has either a problem with quality control, or no quality control at all. I also agree that the packaging is shoddy (holding the disc holders together with tape--what's up with that?) I would strongly advise against purchasing this item until Paramount fixes their disc issues. And I hope Amazon notifies everyone who was forced to get refunds due to Paramount's incompetance when this issue is resolved."},{"rating":"2","title":"what else can be said","review":"It is Star Trek, fantastic.My main reason for reviewing is to get the word out that nobody should go cheap on the price and get the asian release.

Another counterfeit item identical to the fake item on ebay sold on Amazon for $234. BEWARE of this item anywhere on the internet. Recommend pay more and buy locally if you can find it.

Some years ago, I had a house fire and lost them all. I thought buying this package would be a quick way to re-establish my collection. But half of the discs wont even play in my dvd player! My dvd player is about one year old (this post is in 2011) so I see no reason why these discs should not work, and yet, I cannot watch most of the latter seasons because the discs are unplayable. I have a region one player and the discs are formatted for region one. They will play for about ten minutes (four episodes on each disc) and then the DVD player shows a screan saying \\"disc is unplayable.\\" Additionally, Paramount offers no replacement discs for the malfunctioning ones. DO NOT BUY THIS SET!!! THE DISCS WILL NOT PLAY IN YOUR DVD PLAYER"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just What I Didn't Want","review":"Go ahead and order them if you must, but the transfer to DVD is terrible. To get all the episodes on as few disks as possible, they either compressed them too much or just didn't take care in doing a quality job.

I shouldn't have to do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nerd Heaven!","review":"Love this set! I've been waiting for years to get Next Gen and I'm glad I waited.

I can't believe this cheap piece of dung is normally sold at $450+. The packaging is so bad I'll have to spend more money just so I have a GOOD WAY to protect my disks.1) First this thing has a plastic base that has one of those flimsy clear covers to go over it.2) Clear flimsy cover (as said above).3) The disks are in a cheap like plastic holder like you would find in packaging to hold headphones in until you open it and throw it away. Even better description would be that kind of cheap plastic found in marshmallow candies that is holding the candy.4) The above DVD holders are then TAPED together (8 total) which acts as the hing.I'm going to have to buy and/or find at least 7 DVD cases that can hold 6 DVDs (6 disks per season) just to keep the disks from getting all busted in the cheap packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek: The Next Generaton - Complete Series","review":"The price was great, compared to some of the others (for the complete series).

Then, if you get them to actually play on some systems they play one day and not the next. I tried 3 differnt systems before I now finally broke down and bought a second copy. Don't buy the green set.These are inferior copies and while they may show a logo I do not believe them to be real.

In addition to what you read there (shoddy packaging, size of DVDs are only 4.5 GB and not the standard 7 GB), I can confirm there are plenty of spelling errors on the disks with the episode titles. For example, Season 1 Disk 3 reads \\"Hide And O\\" (instead of \\"Hide And Q\\") and \\"The Big Boodbyb\\".Obvious pirated software. Do not buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Next Gen Complete-what it's missing","review":"I am enjoying going through Next Gen, however I caution you that there is no table of contents or index. That is my great disappointment with this collection. Additionally, the episodes appear to not be in original order (as their numbers presumably were).

We were unable to watch even one complete season. Several of the episodes failed part way through and some disks wouldn't even load. I have never had this happen before! My DVD Player is a new Sony and it will play scratched Netflix movies all day long. When you look at the disks, they look just fine, but they obviously were made with defective equipment. The set was a birthday present from my Wife and she bought it two months before my birthday, so Amazon would not take the set back. A very expensive paperweight! I never heard of the company Amazon got this from, and other people seem to have had no problems, but be careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Trek The Next Generation complete series","review":"Set is poor quality and now with Amazon Prime I get the full series and all years of all the Star Trek productions.

I'm on the verge of sending it back anyway due to the packaging which is the worst I've ever encountered. There aren't words to discribe how horrible the packaging is. If I keep it I'll have to buy a folder to hold the discs since one can't determine what is even in the slots. The cases are taped together with scotch tape and most of the cases are plastic and cracked and/or chipped. I thought the packing for Babylon 5 was bad but this one takes the cake. We pay top dollar for these sets and we have the right to receive these items in packaging that is at least acceptable.

I would concur with many of the negative things others have said about the shoddy quality of packaging, etc. but would add that we found nearly every disc to be unplayable. We would be able to see one episode, tops, then it would freeze on us and refuse to read the rest. Since our player works fine on other discs, I suspect that the poor quality of the discs is to blame. NOT WORTH THE MONEY, don't be sucked into buying this like we were!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of bootlegs","review":"Bought this set for Christmas 2010 after much tribulation over the price, only to find what many others have written here. While the episodes are great, there are several discs which are unreadable, and our set has one disc missing completely. Imagine yourself watching an episode with family when 10 minutes from the end the disc becomes unreadable and you have to skip to the next episode. \\"Well kids, this is what happened...\\" The seller conveniently disappeared from Amazon within days of our purchase. I can only assume the reason I got a somewhat better price is because the seller knew they had a bootleg copy. So pay full price, and check out the seller before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great series in terrible packaging","review":"This is a wonderful series, but unfortunately the packaging for the product severely diminishes the overall value of the product. The trays are cheap, fall apart easily and don't hold or protect the discs very well. Best to buy a cd holder for all the discs. There are no descriptions of the episodes, and the only references are the episode titles which are printed on the discs themselves. So, if you're looking for a particular episode, you'll have to sift through the entire collection. It's a very disappointing re-packaging of the television series."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVDs not received but paid for","review":"The person I ordered these DVDs from notified me they were out of them.

I love it or I would not have purchased this set. My problem is the way it was manufactured. There are no inserts, No Cover art. The Trays containing the DVDs break very easily. And usually are shipped broken.If you can find this set as cheap as I got mine then it might be okay (I spent $75.00 for mine). But unless you can get it that cheap, it is more advisable to buy each season individually. This way you get a decent case and artwork to store your set.

Taking a tip from another reviewer, I found a great dvd case at walmart for this set. Its a 48 capacity disk box by Vault for about $20. It is a hard case, not just a soft wallet style. All 48 disks fit well with two extra pockets for the special features disk and the paper foldout that comes with this DVD set.Just thought the info might help someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor packaging and poor production","review":"I didnt heed the warnings about this product before buying it.

This set comes with the discs set into double sided plastic trays that are cheap and fragile. They are taped together with packing tape in three packs. Mine came cracked, but I didn't return it because the discs are okay. I'll probably end up transferring the discs to a higher quality case. I bought this set because it was on sale.

What can I say: I love it!The Next Generation stories are great (the science is plausible & the actors do a great job, unlike the newer \\"Enterprise\\" series).It's great to go to a place where rationality & morality rule.

A must-have for any Trek fan, whether it's to revisit the episodes you remember from their original broadcast or to view for the first time. The series is, remarkably, as fresh now as it was then, and would match or better any series currently on-air.The packaging manages to squeeze seven seasons' worth of DVDs into a reasonable volume, but does look fragile and only time will tell whether it will hold up over the years.

It is the only tv series I have ever received that has had issues, let alone this high of a failure rate.You MUST check all your disks to make sure they play before your 30 day return window expires.My advice is to look at the price and whether it is a new seller.

It appalls me that a product as poor as this can be successfully produced and sold in a capitalist society. The hacks at Paramount have obviously outsourced the production of these dvds to China or a similar place. Low quality discs, low quality packaging. You get what you pay for, I guess.

Then I checked out how much it would be if I just got the 6 seasons I am missing.It turns out that I would end up paying nearly $90 more for this BOX versus the Season box sets 1 by 1. Buying seasons 2-7 only amounted to about $220 at a price between $36-37.99. (Seasons 1-7 would run you $259.93 before any shipping costs, roughly saving you $60.)Seems to me that the price of this thing with it's sub-standard packaging would aim to be LESS of a cost, rather than more.Anyhow, I ended up going with the single season box sets and am perfectly happy with them, and the $90 or so I saved by doing so.I hope this helps someone out in a similar situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap just dropped to a new level","review":"where do I start . . .1.

And I am very happy to be able to watch it now at my leisure. However, in reviewing this product, it must be said that it is really disappointing that Paramount did such a crappy job. Yes, the lime green disc cases are thin and easily breakable, there are no summaries of the episodes, and the quality of the video is pretty low - some scenes are clear, and then all of a sudden, it looks soft and almost hazy. Kind of shocking really for a sci-fi release. Audio commentary would really be nice, too.Obviously corners were cut to increase profit margins. I'm disgusted, they ought to know their fan base would be critical of a bad release, or extremely grateful for a good one.Being such a big fan, I bought it anyway, used. I don't want to give any more $ to the studio. I highly suggest you do the same - money talks, my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the best series ever made, but horrible packaging.","review":"I'm really disappointed in Paramont for releasing this set in such a crappy box. I really wanted to see something great for TNG 20, but I was greatly let down. I've seen this box set in person and can vouch for how crappy the box is made. I will not buy this until it has been put into a better box that isn't really over priced. I agree with other posters, I believe that this will be coming to Blu-Ray within a couple of years. I'll wait for that.While I love this series, I will refuse to buy this crappy box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show is great but my package came broken!!!","review":"I like the show, no problems there. I was so upset though because when my boyfriend opened the box all of the cases holding the dvds were broken and/or chipped. Thank God it was a gift for my boyfriend because I would have been very embarassed giving a bunch of dvds in broken cases to someone else. not only did my order take a week longer than it was supposed to (because it was lost in the mail) it was not handled with care.

I got the set for her birthday. When we watched the first disk, it froze near the end of the pilot episode. Amazon said to return all 50 odd disks, not just the defective one. I did so and received a replacement. When we attempted to watch the end of the pilot episode, we got a little farther before the disk froze again. We watch about 10 DVDs a week and have had no other problems with our DVD player. It makes me wonder about the quality control on the copying of this set. I returned the entire set and requested a refund. It has now been 6 weeks and still no refund. When I requested the replacement disk, I was advised that the warranty lasts only 30 days. That is not enough time to verify that 50 disks (approximately 150 hours of video) are good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality","review":"As many others have observed, the packaging is VERY cheap. Parts of the plastic trays were broken in shipping.

The disks themselves seem to be of poor quality, with several being either unplayable, or problematic.Overall, poor quality in both media production and packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"*No Words*","review":"The Village was a movie battered by film critics and the audience alike. It stands to me as a film I will always respect due to disquieting effect.The Village Score is no less any different. The music is like one walk through a forgotten land and time that I would like to take. I'd do that more than once. It draws attention due its complex melody.I fail to put in words the quite unearthly effect it holds. I was never a big fan of Scores and instrumental music until I heard this particular piece of music. James Newton Howard shines in this respect worthy glitter of astonishing proportions.(If you like what you hear, I recommend the score of the movie Road To Perdition which again is something exquisite for your ears)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful!","review":"This soundtrack is by far the most beautiful and emotional I have ever heard.

James Newton Howard's newest project \\"The Village\\" is a testimony to everything that makes him a great film composer. The construction, destruction, and warping of the almost undecipherable theme is of the highest quality. The entire album plays with ease, and the listner is tugged through every emotion that he would if the pictures were there too. When I saw the movie after hearing the score I instinctivly questioned the originality of the plot, only to realize that the familiarity was the music. The score really tells the story! What a find!! Don't forget Miss Hahn's playing (words cannot convey the appreciation and respect).!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Score from Howard yet","review":"If this isn't his overall best score, I'd definitely call it his best of M. Night Shyamalan's films. The music is beautiful and appropriate for the mood and story film. Hilary Hahn's violin solos are amazing. I'd love to see it nominated for some awards this year. I enjoyed the movie more because of this music. In some cases I think it tells the story better than the film. It's not as scary, or \\"jumpy\\" I guess you could say, as Signs, but I think it makes for a better soundtrack. I'd definitely recommend it, even for the people that might not like the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"as good as the movie, and better!","review":"After Seeing the village i was desperate to get the score on CD. i found that for the first time, not every song had the same sound, and i was basically correct when i listened to the score on CD. it was an amazing score using violins and making sound a lot softer but much nicer then signs, i thought it sounded so stressful, like howard was trying to acheive a fear with his score for signs. but i was pleasently surprised (as with the movie) that it was his best score yet. the movie wasn't my favorite of his, but it is my favorite when it came to twists, because there were many.anyhow, this is a great CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Those We Don't Speak Of","review":"\\"The Village\\" soundtrack is a really beautiful score CD by composer James Newton Howard. The best score on this cd is \\"Those We Don't Speak Of\\". It is very creepy and sets the tone for the film. The score is very different than his other work on M.

The biggest disappointment is that although the DWA-130 reports that it's attached to the router at 130 MBPS, the effective transfer speed to the network-attached storage box that's plugged into an Ethernet port on the DIR-655 is somewhat slower than it was using the 56 MBPS wireless-G router and adapter that this replaces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wireless nothing","review":"We bought this to try to get my son's computer connected to the wireless router in my office.

Plus D-Link's policy is to not do exchanges if you have the wrong revision; they only do exchanges if an item is broken - I called D-Link to try and find out and had to explain the problem THREE times before they told me I couldn't trade it. I ordered one through a local business who didn't know about the different revisions, got an A, and they can't return it or order a specific revision. Another store I called told me they couldn't order a specific revision, either.So if you have Vista, I'd only recommend purchasing if you have the 32-bit.

It connected great at first, then began intermittently disconnecting after that and would refuse to reconnect without a reboot. When I called D-Link about it, the tech told me their adapters don't work very well with any Vista except Vista Basic. If that is true, this is a worse product than I first thought. Got a Linksys adapter and it works perfectly. So if you're going to buy this adapter, your only chances of success are 1) maybe if you have a D-Link router, or 2) maybe if you're running the cheapest version of Vista.

The signal strength says excellent, yet about every 10 minutes it looses the internet connection and I have to manually reconnect. This is *painful*.

Married to Michael Braden, a man she scarcely knew and hardly ever saw, surrounded by African servants who could barely speak English, living in a big dark mansion isolated on the moors, Eleanor had never felt more alone. Then Roderick Atherton came into her life. Handsome, charming Roderick, whom Michael hated and had forbidden his wife to see. Roderick, whom Michael called a womanizer and a scoundrel, but who had helped Eleanor to discover the awful truth about her husband and the horrifying secret hidden within the depths of her own home. But could even Roderick save her from the satanic man she married and the dreadful fate that awaited her if her husband learned that she had found out the truth about Blackmoor?"},{"rating":"2","title":"turtle watching","review":"I used the red filter for turtle watching on the beach.

This game brings back the same feel of high speed, knocking opponents off (no weapons though) and adds a few cool moves like a powerslide to go under obstacles. It also has tricks you can do but they aren't really going to help you in a race, they are put in to help you unlock new bikes and skins. Road Rash and racing game fans should get this game. You will like it. Anyone else, if you are unsure, try a rental first. The game does not support soundtracks, replay saves, or XBOX Live. Lets hope these features are added to Speed Kings 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"FAST...almost too fast!!! RENT IT FIRST","review":"I'll try to make this quick. I really like this game. It's fast, has great graphics, there's NO slow-down, plays at a solid 60 frames per second, has cool stunts to perform and lots of traffic. It's very much like the first BURNOUT, except you're on motorcycles. With that said, I couldn't give it a full 5 stars because I find it to become very frustrating and have to turn it off before I through the controller out the window. What I don't like about SPEED KINGS is it's too fast. When performing a stunt I can't see the traffic ahead and the turns are too close together making it very difficult to complete a stunt. Any reality is thrown out the window because of its ridiculously high speeds. Don't get me wrong...it's still very fun, but it can get frustrating. I recommend renting it first. It may be worth the few extra bucks to make sure you like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan Reed made his bed real bad, now he has to lie in it","review":"Nothing of what made the debut album good is present on this forgettable effort.

I suppose we, the viewers are supposed to be made to pity poor Larry Flynt while we watch him defend his rights to make lots of cash peddling porn. The story is punctuated by a series of sex scenes featuring drug abuse, alcohol, and so on. Poor Larry Flynt. For technical aspects, Woody Harrelson was great, and so was the rest of the cast.Some documentaries are best left to A&E."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably boring","review":"Who cares about Larry Flunt?

It's well acted and well directed. I agree with the review written by Dennis Littrel., but write to add just two thoughts:First, this is the type of film that should be made more often. It'd doesn't fall into the typical Hollywood formula of smaltzh, but instead actually has a message. Hate Larry Flynt if you will, but respect the fact that he did us all a great service by testing the limits of our tolerance for 1st Amendment values. It's a great civic lesson.Second, Coutney Love is OUTSTANDING in this role. She has a charisma that cuts through the screen, and reaches the viewer in ways that I never would have expected from her. Ok, maybe playing a junkie was not much of a stretch for her. But she does it with pure magnestism. Bravo to Ms. Love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only in Hollywood. . .","review":". . .could this man be treated as a hero. Honestly: did anybody ever lose money underestimating the taste of the public? Flynt was raking in the dollars with a stupid magazine which holds primitive attitudes toward women, sex and minorities. OK, fine. He has the right to do so. . .maybe an imperative in this country which treats the almighty dollar as the purpose of existence. . .and he can appeal his right to do so all the way to the Supreme Court. But is he a hero? Great. We live in an age which could use a few heroes, and Milos Forman (who I once thought a semi-great director) spends his producers' money on a flick celebrating a stupid redneck and his crazy wife. (Although I must give kudos for his casting--he found the perfect actors for the two leads. In fact, I don't think either one was 'acting' at all. Woody Harrelson and Courtney Love were made for their roles.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Satisfactory movie, moronic subject","review":"Clearly, the world needs more cynics. Did, or does, Larry Flynt really care about the First Amendment? You bet, but only because it lets him make a livelihood selling pornographic magazines that also attack minorities and gays. I can't wait for the Hollywood movie that portrays Charles Manson as a kind-hearted performance artist who only wanted to use human blood and entrails as a medium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, definitely worth seeing","review":"I can understand that a lot of people on this board don't like the topic of this movie, but that shouldn't keep them from enjoying a fantastic movie. I personally found this movie absolutely hilarious--Larry Flynt is definitely a colorful character, as is Althea. Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love, and Edward Norton give outstanding performances. It's really amazing to see how a dirt poor red neck kid can end up being a millionaire. You'll be left wondering what stunt is Larry Flynt going to pull next. So what if Hustler is disgusting to you? As Edward Norton said, you have the right to not buy it. A brilliant, brilliant film. I would definitely recommend picking this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great biopic","review":"When it comes to biopics, Milos Forman (Man On The Moon) is as good at it gets. He does a great job getting the audience to not only sympathize with but look upon self-proclaimed smut peddler Larry Flynt as a good guy. By far Woody Harrelson's best role. One must assuem based on her real life trials and tribulations with stripping and drugs, Courtney Love didn't have to stretch too much for the role of Althea. Overall, a great film and fun to watch---highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful Reminder of a Simpler Time","review":"Hustler Magazine was the epitome of poor taste and Jerry Falwell with his mother in an out house was enough to \\"shock the conscience;\\" those were the days.

You often cant try things as you read about them. This is especially true for the chapters on style sheets. I think the trouble is that the book tries to cover HTML and XHTML simultaneously. While there is obviously alot of overlap, there are enough ideosynracies to scramble the natural order of presentation. Compounding that is the small size and format of the book. Many of the examples are incomplete or not well connected to the text just because they wouldn't fit otherwise.I'm going back to the 4th edition.

I found myself anxiously awaiting the next free hour I could find to get back to reading the next chapter. The last 100+ pages were the hardest to resist - so much so that I gave up all free time to find out what Antonio was going to encounter in the next chapter and where this story was going to end. I was not the least bit disappointed and would certainly read this author's next book. I just hope he does not wait another 60 years to publish his next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burt Lancaster","review":"Very interesting....good reading.....unknown information regarding his position with Directors and the power which he maintained. Him being raised in an Italianneighborhood was unknown.

Lancaster was not.

He looks like he must have been an uncommon personality. You'd never guess it after reading this. Too much emphasis on the history of the film industry, not enough information or anecdotes about the man. And the editing is terrible ... lots of paragraphs that just don't hold together, irrelevant notes that an editor should have chopped (the geneology of the Lancaster name ... for a high-school level biography, maybe, but not for a pro). Maybe Lancaster turned out to be boring, and the author had to fill in the book with all this extra stuff to meet her obligations to the publisher?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where Was This Book When I Started My Company?","review":"As an employer of many, this book certainly hit home.It is a must-read for employers of any sized company, because what we really look for is the engaged employee.Lots of nuggets to help prevent the employer from making mistakes in hiring, and also strategies for them to identify the warning signs of disengagement before it occurs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diverse and entertaining throughout","review":"I heard these guys at a club in NYC and thought their show was impressive.

It says a lot about the NPR mentality that the author, their chief financial and business correspondent, cannot distinguish between investing in the stock market and going to Las Vegas. The author has no background in economics or finance, no experience in the financial world, no respect for free markets, and no clue about what is going on in the world around him. Alas, ignorance is not bliss in this case. This book is a grotesquely overinflated ego trip in which we learn a lot about what the author thinks, feels, did after college and had for breakfast but nothing more. A colossal waste of money; avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor layout","review":"This book should retail for 8.99 or less!

I had it set to run until it hit the right humidity. So if it was running constantly for a week, it should have put some water in the bucket (otherwise it should have shut off).I went back on Amazon and saw the recent reviews about it not working and the horrible customer service from the company so I requested a refund from Amazon and sent it back to them. Hopefully I'll get all my money back.

My basement has never been very damp, but you can notice it more on very hot or humid days.Pros:- Quiet. I wouldn't say necessary \\"whisper\\" quiet, but it's definitely no louder than a small desk fan and much quieter than other humidifier units I've heard.- Energy efficient. I've barely noticed a difference in my electric bill- Stylish design, easy controls- Definitely keeps my basement less humid- Adjustable thermostat. It has 4 settings, continuous, 70%, 60%, and 50% relative humidity- Easily portable. Includes a handle.Cons:- The water collection basket on the bottom is sometimes a little difficult to removeOverall I would highly recommend this unit. I've had trouble-free use out if for about 3 months and it's perfect for my basement.

On muggy days, I turn out the water once per day, but otherwise every couple of days (though I've only had it for spring/summer NYC). I also find that I use the AC a lot less than I might ordinarily.

The only thing I may change is to get the larger unit since the 25pint will last about 24 hrs till the reservoir gets full.

Did not draw a drop of water. On one unit the coils in the back were not even cold. I was able to ship them back for replacements, however one unit they just sent right back to me since I checked the serial number!!!Same results, no water. So I sent these back for replacements. The replacements arrived, same results, no water. So I finally got in touch with the retailer and was able to send the units back to soleus for a refund.

I read other reviews here on amazon and they state that the company was not responsive when a local tech contacted them to supply parts for out of warranty repairs.How nice. I wonder, how much more would a similar unit cost to be manufactured for durability? Nothing crazy, but to last 7-8 years under light usage.

It does not produce astounding amounts of heat.It's draw backs are: 1. Even though it is weighs about half that of those dehumidifiers using the traditional compressor technology, it is still rather hard to move due to having casters instead of wheels. 2. The water catcher is more cumbersome to remove with grace than in other brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked twice, then stopped","review":"I am very dissapointed with this product. It filled the resevoir twice then stopped, although we still have moisture issues. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I bought this dehumidifier in Oct 2005 after reading all the nice reviews. However, when I got mine, it didn't work. Not a single drop of water. If the humidity level was truely below the setting, the unit is designed to turn off. But it kept running for two days until I switched it off. Did troubleshooting with the manufacturer without any success. Amazon sent me a replacement but it had the same problem.When I came back to Amazon I saw few other buyers had exact same problem in Nov & Dec 2005. Wondering if there was one defective batch. After this experience, I don't have the confidence to recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for small spaces or basements","review":"The only significant downside with this dehumidifier is that it has a relatively small water capacity. The device itself it compact, quiet, and lightweight. The settings on the control panel are simple and intuitive, as is the overall design. It is more than adequate for a northern midwest atmosphere.I run it on low in my basement, and empty the tank every couple of days (usually it's full within 24 hours, but I just don't feel like going down there and emptying it every single day). Sometimes, if it gets particularly muggy, I'll run it on high in the bedroom or living room, and it does an amazingly good job of pulling moisture out of the air (obviously it's not instantaneous, or even as fast as a much bigger or louder unit). I think, on the balance, this unit is an extremely efficient balance between dehumidifying and noise/electric usage.I've had this unit for about two years, and I haven't any problems with it during that time period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk about quiet","review":"I bought this after seeing the other good reviews on this unit. I have another brand, and it sounds like a jet airplane. So I bought this, and its very quiet compared to the other one. I wish the bucket had a handel to cary the water out, but other then that I love it. It runs 24/7 and no problems, it does give off warmer air that will be nicer in winter. I will probably get a CFM-40 for our sealed crawl space. ITs right under our bedroom so I need something quiet instead of an airplane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet, Small, & Efficient","review":"Initially I was surprised at how quiet this unit reportedly is, but after having it for a few months, I can confirm that it's both quiet and efficient. It's perfect for the times when it's too humid to be comfortable, but not hot enough to have the air conditioner on. It's so quiet you'll hardly notice it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken after two summers","review":"Product worked well but does not last. I only used it for about four months in the summer. This is my third summer and it quit working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet, simple, effective","review":"Removes a satisfying volume of water with a minimum of fuss. Although mine works mostly in the basement, where it pulls out about 40 pints a day, but it is easy enough to lug to where it is needed - for example, to help some new plaster dry on a humid day - and it is presentable for work in a living space.Researching this purchase it was hard to find what size dehumidifier I needed - some kind webizen persuaded me that, if more was needed, two smaller units would be more flexible than one large unit anyway, and more effective in an area with poor air circulation. I'm glad i went that route."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken after a year","review":"it broke after a year of use, no single drop of water is collected anymore.

Customer service is non existent, you have to leave your name and number on an answering machine - and no one ever calls you back called several times over months. Repeated Emails also go completely unanswered as does certified mail. I wanted to get mine repaired under warranty - but you can't if you can't reach the manufacturer.I should have heeded some of the previous warrnings, but saw so many positive reviews, probably like my initial thoughs - short term satisfaction.DO NOT BUY - IF THERE IS A PROBLEM - AND THERE WILL BE - YOU ARE OUT THE COST OF THE MACHINE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems and AWFUL customer service!","review":"Once the power goes off, this stops working. You have to manually turn it back on. Even quick power off that does not reset the clocks and this stops working. I made the mistake of purchasing two of the and the both do the same thing. DO NOT PURCHASE FOR USE IN A BASEMENT or any where else you will not know when it stops working. In other words, this is not the unit for most places you need a dehumidifier.And talk about POOR customer service, wow, these guys are BAD! They will not reply to emails and if you manage to find the phone number and in the unlikely event they answer the phone, they are rude beyond belief. These people are more rude than the DMV on a busy day!This is money down the drain for me!

Is that too much to ask? This unit is silent, but it does not collect a drop of water. the noiser units that I have tried collect lots of water, but they sound like a helicopter is operating in my basement, and the noise would carry throughout the house. I worked with Soleus , they even RMA'd the original, and I'm on the 2nd unit, but I can not reccomend this unit. Maybe if i lived in a more humid area, such as the deep south, it would be useful, but the unit did not work in my chicago land basement.Also, a quick note on working with soleus customer service - obviously this company does not have a service department like DELL or some other large company. CS consists of 1-2 people, so it is not all that convenient.Can somebody reccomed a dehudifier that:collects water!has a hose attachment optionis pretty quiet (I'm not asking for silent!)costs less than $200?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought on 11/14/2005, stop working within 2 years","review":"When it works, it is great, quiet and efficient.However, it has been only 2 years, and we only run it maybe twice a week during summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent dehumidifier","review":"Just wanted to reiterate what everyone else has said about this dehumidifier: it is a great buy. It is super-quiet and does a great job pulling the moisture out of the air. Our basement has never felt so comfortable. My ONLY complaint is that I have to dump the holding tank almost daily (which is why I gave 4 stars), but that is more a symptom of the amount of humidity in Virginia rather than the dehumidifier (although I guess it could have a bigger tank). Pre-dehumidifier, basement humidity was around 70%. Post-dehumidifier, basement humidity is around 50%."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't be better","review":"I bought the unit for use in a small basement area but, when I saw how attractive and quiet it was, decided to use it in our kitchen area. It sits unobtrusively next to a stool at our bar and quietly removes a container of water every day and a half. Rolls around easily. The container is much easier to remove than those on Frigidaire units I am using ( 25 and 50 pt).I love it. Can't comment on durability becuse I have only one month of experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out nicely","review":"It worked ok for the first year. Like others have said its quiet and the bucket is a bit kludgy to remove. We only use it in the spring/summer in a 600sf basement. Worked ok and even got through to customer service when we have a question one time.but... This year it does not work. Have tried to contact customer service and it appears they don't answer any more. We have cleaned (wasn't dirty) reset and primed the unit but no water is collected.Not a good investment. Time to look for another brand type. Being that it was only used about 12 months total = FAIL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started well ... 1.5 yrs later stopped working","review":"Bought this unit and it worked great for the first 1.5 yrs then ice started forming on the back of the unit, and thawing simultaneously leaving a pool of water on the floor behind the unit. I contacted customer service and they suggested cleaning the filter, which I did, and then allowing the unit to thaw. I did this but ice continued to re-form. I contacted customer service again and they were extremely unhelpful suggesting that there's nothing they can do since it was beyond the one-year warranty period and that I should seek repair from somewhere. I asked if they could recommend a repair specialist and they gave me a simple one word answer, \\"No\\". No other help was given despite repeated attempts. As result, I shall NEVER purchase another product from this company again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother Loved It","review":"I got it for mom for Christmas. She loves things that look like money.

The only two I use are LMZ and the one with Ginkgo. I started with the one with Ginkgo. It helped me to manage my gum problems, which I spent thousands of dollars in gum surgery and cleaning in the periodontist offices about 10 years. Maybe I do a better job in taking care of my teeth or the effect of the Chinese toothpastes, one way or the other, my gum problems are gone. I could not find the one with Ginkgo a few years ago, so I changed to LMZ. Now I use whichever I can find in the Chinese stores. I saw that they are for sale on the internet today.

This happened after a few days of inconsistent response to button pushes, and randomly blinking lights on the control panel. Seems very much like a wiring issue which makes the fan a potential fire hazard.3 weeks of trying to get through to tech support (warranty is good for a year) with no response. I've emailed, gone through the website contact, called and left voice messages. Nothing.I will avoid Soleus products in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was good while it lasted","review":"I got this fan just under 3 years ago, and it has worked very well up until recently. I noticed that the fan slowed down a lot, but it still worked for a little while longer. Then one day it just stopped spinning. It just makes the humming sound like its trying to spin. I really liked this fan, but I'm very disappointed that it just died all of a sudden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a different fan.","review":"As far as fans go, this one blows air and oscillates, it's quiet and doesn't vibrate, and basically does everything you need a fan to do. But all fans do that. Par for the course. This fan gets a one-star rating from me for the fact that I could not get mine put together using the included parts. The rear-half of the cage would not fit flush with the motor-compartment, and either the big plastic nut that is supposed to keep it securely in place was too small or the hole in the rear-half of the cage was too big. I was only able to put this fan together by stealing parts from my old fan, which miraculously fit this fan perfectly. So now I'm stuck using some kind of hybrid Frankenfan. My apartment looks like a battle zone with fan parts thrown everywhere. Two fans met in combat, and only one survived.Don't buy this fan. Spend your money on a different fan and you'll be much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"The 2 big issues I had with this fan are that after the engine warms up it emits a machine like smell that will gradually fill the room if the windows are not fully open. I can't figure out why this happens but it does. The second issue is that on the slow speed setting the plastic blade piece vibrates making a high speed clacking sound so using it when you want to sleep is out, unless you like a fan on high speed when trying to sleep. Maybe it was just mine but I knew that something as cost efficient as this would have risks to it. I decided to return it and get a different one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these fans","review":"I have bought several of the soleus fans and I really love them, they move the air perfectly. They have multi-function remotes, you can change the wind from normal to a natural breeze flow, set a timer on the fan, 3 speeds, it's just a great product, and the price from amazon was terrific too. I would defenitely recommend this product to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aircraft jet engine.","review":"I give it a two because it does blow.I wanted a \\"quiet\\" fan for my bedroom. And based on at least one other review that said the fan was super quiet, I purchased this fan. I had an old fan that was starting to click and whine a bit. But you could hardly hear the fan portion.This thing is like an F3 tornado with the loud wind noise.It has other settings where it cycles to a lower speed then cycles to a higher speed continuously. I guess to simulate the fan rotating. But all it does is wind up being annoying.If I could cycle the thing down to 1/4th the speed that it goes at on \\"low\\" I would be a cappy hamper. As it is, I am going to take it to my shop and use it there.When Lowes brings out the summer stuff, I will actually try one before I buy one to make sure I get what I am aiming for.If you need a fan that can blow you down 40' away, then by all means buy this fan. If you want to use it in your bedroom, only buy it if you are deaf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Besides the manual being a bit of a joke, with photo illustrations for only half of the assembly process, the fan itself is not sturdy and poorly manufactured. Obviously, being a discount fan I didn't expect it to be great, but this fan is worthless. Even after the assembly process, the fan is loud and barely emits a what I'd consider a breeze. Likewise, it's unstable-- there is no way to securely bind the top half of the fan with the lower half or adjust the height.Don't waste your money. I'm returning mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor warranty service","review":"This fan only lasted a few months with intermittant use- the motor slowed down and now only hums.

However, it is not difficult to figure it out.The screws and nuts they sent were the wrong sizes. 2 of the holes drilled for the screws were too small.The fan will only stay positioned so it blows towards the ceiling. When you push/pull on it to pull the fan so that it blows where you want it to, it makes the clicking noise it should but will not lock into place. As soon as you let go of the fan it pulls itself all the way back and points so it blows toward the ceiling.There are many, many fans out there for the same price. (29.99) Buy those.

This fan was comparatively inexpensive, and really not worth much. First of all, the fan blade was unbalanced, so on the 2 lower speeds, the wobbly fan action was really loud. At the highest speed, it was less wobbly, but at night that's too much air. Secondly, the height adjustment control was badly designed and just plain didn't work: while assembling the fan, the first time you try to use the height knob, the threads on the screw will get stripped. The manufacturer actually knows this, so has included a second one -- THAT one is sturdier, but it turns out it STILL doesn't function due to poor design. Therefore the fan can't be raised to the normal height of a floor fan -- it's too short.I'll be sending this turkey back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice fan","review":"This fan is easy to assemble and is quiet. It is worth the price and the remote control is very handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy if you have all the time in the world to make it work","review":"The fan worked well for a few months and then the controls began to have problems.

What a great tune Celtic Sonant is.The Moodies used to be criticised of each album sounding the same, but The Other Side... Sur La Mer, Keys... and Strange Times are all quite different musically.

The characters, the races and their outlooks, the enemy, even down to the details of the protagonists struggle. I can't believe the author did not receive a subpoena from Tolkienn's estate demanding him to cease and desist.

This series is a real blessing for those that don't have the time, patience, or mental capacity for the original... Seriously, I suppose this shows that Tolkien has reached that ultimate pinnacle of literary achievement, where the story he has told is so compelling that others feel the need to retell it their own words. This puts the Lord of the Rings in the company of such timeless tales as King Arthur, Robin Hood, and Sleeping Beauty. In case you haven't guessed by now, I recommend that you read Tolkien's works, not the pale imitations by Mr. McKiernan."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed the book even if it did copy Tolkien.","review":"After reading the reviews it is obvious that anyone who has read the Lord of the Rings can see Mckiernan has copied much of the plots and themes from Tolkien's work. So what. If the Tolkiens don't mind and it's a good read, then the book should be enjoyed. I've read most of McKiernan's other books since reading the Iron Tower Trilogy and have found his later works about Mithgar to be original and very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A imitation that forms a solid foundation","review":"I liked the Iron Tower trilogy, at first I was put off by the glaring similarity to Tolkien's L.O.T.R. but I continued to read. I began to enjoy the characters, and appreciate the subtle differences that were his own. He has taken this world and made something wonderful(see his later works). I feel that he has carried on Tolkien's legacy, which I feel was his intent with the Iron Tower trilogy and the Silver Call duology (which he actually wrote first). Have fun and enjoy, it also helps to set the stage for his later books. For those who scream \\"rip off\\" I say, are there really that many fantasy books that don't carry elements of Tolkien?

Sadly, there is absolutely nothing here to hold a readers interest, unless of course you are hoping to spot the next post-Tolkien cliche. I will give the author credit, at least he is up front in the introduction as to where his influence came from for this novel - and it shows in spades - but this is really a poor work, lacking depth in every aspect of the plot and writing.Just say no."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor carbon copy of Tolkien.","review":"Wow. Before attempting to read the Iron Tower trilogy, I thought that The Sword of Shannara could not be surpassed as a pure rip-off of Tolkien. I was wrong. Suffice it to say that if you have read Tolkien, this is a poor quality carbon copy of the Lord of the Rings not worthy of your time. If you haven't read the Lord of the Rings, then read that series and forget this one. Finally, for those of you who gave this series a ten (or I suppose its five stars now) you evidently either believe that this series is either as good as or better than LOTR, or you have never read LOTR.

But, reading it back in the late eighties, I was fresh off ofDragonlance(probably waiting for the next book in the series to come out, actually) and I hadn't readThe Lord of the Rings, yet, so I wasn't aware of how derivative this series was. For a fantasy-starved voracious reader who'd already racked up all the overdue library fines I could take, finding this book in a \\"give-away\\" pile of other mass market paperbacks was like a godsend. This book was basically theEragonof its day. A total hack rip-off of Tolkien, but for a young teen who didn't know better, it totally satisfied the itch for epic adventure.The Warrow are basically slimmer, shoe-wearing, jewel-eyed Hobbits with archery skills.

The author talks about how much he loved The Lord of the Rings and how he kept looking for more books like them and couldn't find any and so he decided to write these stories.It is more like a tribute and a compliment, then anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imitation is the highest form of flattery.","review":"Any aspiring basketball player would love to be compared with Jordan, so why is it wrong to compare Mc Kiernan's first effort with Tolkien. Although there are many similarities in this first book, I found the series to be very strong. The charachters are well developed and touching.If you give Mc Kiernan a chance he will envelope you in a world deeper than Middle Earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misunderstood","review":"Some people slam this as a Tolkein rip off. It certainly apes much of Tolkein, but that is because it was supposed to. McKiernan wrote The Silver Call Duology for the Middle Earth universe. When he could not get the rights, he made some changes, and then wrote this trilogy as a back story. So yes, it is very middle earth, but it is also an entertaining story.

Maybe his writing style is just not me, but I found it tired, listless, and highly similar to the Lord of the Rings in many, many ways.I thought I was going to be getting a rip-roaring saga, but what I got was a fairly predictable yarn about hobbits, by a different name."},{"rating":"1","title":"unoriginal and so much more","review":"Now, I like McKiernan. He's a good author who has done good books. So after reading this series I recommened reading something else of his. This is by far his worst work. My main feeling coming away from this book was \\"Hey, Tolkien did this too..but he had detail.\\" It was a painful experience to read such a bad book from an otherwise good author. Look for some other titles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I rate it ZERO stars?","review":"McKiernan came up with the idea for these novels while recovering from an auto accident. Not bad for someone on pain medication, but I didn't have that benefit when I read them. I was shocked at the blatant ripoff of Tolkien, intentional or not. All the wonders of Tolkien are there, in a pale, cheap reflection, like Scarlett's Tara, AFTER the Yanks got done with it. Frodo wrapped in the shabby green curtains. If you want a better read, find some of McKiernan's later, much more original work, where he uses this admittedly fertile world much better. Don't bother with this freshman effort.

So, I could not use it for class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad plot kills the watching experience, despite decent production","review":"In consulting we have a saying, garbage in, garbage out. That's not quite the case here, but close. The novel from which this is adapted has a terrible plot that makes no sense: a woman kills a pedophile, then, with the help of her cop father, disappears, leaving behind a husband she's known since childhood. Then she re-appears after eight years, only to be hunted by the father of the pedophile. What makes no sense from the beginning is, when she knows they're being watched, she still sends her husband e-mails (on Yahoo!) about where to see her and eventually meet her.The film does have decent production, from directing to acting, but, alas, like most French films, tend to drag a bit, so it's a good thing we can fast-forward. And it's definitely a good thing it's free on Prime Instant Video, for I wouldn't have paid a penny to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tell Everyone!","review":"This is a stylish, Hitchcockian thriller from France, based on an American novel by one of my favorite authors, Harlan Coben. I saw it in a theater twice, but the DVD is a special treat. Gorgeous picture and sound, and the subtitles are easier to read than on the big screen. It's a \\"man-on-the-run\\" action mystery in the tradition of Hitchcock's THE 39 STEPS and NORTH BY NORTHWEST, and it's very nearly as good as those classics, thanks to a great new director (Guillaume Canet) and a terrific cast. Francois Cluzet is wonderful in the lead, and everyone else is very good, too. The tension never lets up for a minute, and there's one particularly jaw-dropping chase sequence (with Cluzet performing all his own stunts) that's truly unforgettable. A really solid thriller, start to finish. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very much worth watching","review":"I was on page 48 of 198 trying to find something interesting on prime worth watching.

What a way for French film making to move to the forefront of film making in World Cinema.

My only regret is that it is in French and will not be seen by many of Coben's fans. I have heard rumors that an American version of this story may be in the works. The cast is excellent, but unknown to Americans,except for Kristin Scott Thomas. Yes, the same actress who played the very English Lady Sylvia in \\"Gosford Park\\", speaks fluent French. This film is a must-see for Harlan Coben readers like myself, even if you have to get used to reading English subtitles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Flawless Thriller","review":"Not going to say much since its all been raved about here. Watched this first by myself then a few years later I showed it to my wife. I figured I'd watch it a few minutes with her then move on to playing video games while she finished it. Didn't happen.

Too many gruesome scenes, and the film itself just isn't worth it. I finally turned it off after an hour & 22 minutes (with 50 minutes still to go!)

However...the central premise is decidedly flawed as are some of theconvoluted explanations to the mysteries that surround ourhero. These explanations are wholly unsatisfactory, as muchas the denouement; in sum, they are quite unbelievable.This reviewer is not familiar with the novel, but it beggarsbelief that the author would echo Chandler and be unsure asto who killed who and why.And on that note: why was the hero's wife's best friend killed?How did the rich-man-in-the-big-house know when to have the hero'scomputer hacked? How come the bent cop who was supposedly sogood at being bent not cover up the murder of the rich-man-in-the-big-house's son?

(I kept checking my watch to see what time it was--that's how slow it was.) I think the reason for this was because it was way too talky--even for a thriller. One thing I like about Hitchcock films was that they were never talky. His films focused more on the character's behavior than speech. All I can say was that I was glad when this movie was over. TELL NO ONE reminded me of CACHE although I thought CACHE was a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun French thriller","review":"\\"Tell No One\\"(Musicbox Films, 2006/2009)--------------------------------------------This was a fun, frequently baffling French thriller, based on a mystery novel by an American author. The plot involves a man whose wife was declared dead after a mysterious attack and abduction, who finds himself a suspect eight years later, when two more bodies are found near the same remote rural location as the original murder. In classic Hitchcock-ian fashion, this well-to-do professional soon finds himself on the lam, chased by almost the entire police department of Marseilles, and able to find protection only by trusting some surprisingly affable members of the city's criminal underworld. The movie is engrossing, but you may find the big-twist ending a little too hard to swallow -- there are holes a mile wide, but I can't discuss them without giving the story away. Still, it's a fun film, certainly worth watching. Some great bad guys, too. (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Films Reviews)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Look Close To Home","review":"Alexandre Beck (Francois Cluzet) loses his childhood sweetheart to murder and becomes the prime suspect for the crime. Eight years later, two bodies are found near his home and once again, he becomes the suspect. Alexander starts receiving emails hinting that his wife is still alive but instructing him to tell no one.Different than most French films which rely on nuance, Tell No One is a real thriller. The best parts of this film are performances by cherished actors like Kristin Scott Thomas and Francois Cluzet. On the downside, this film is pushed by a mystery that is cheesily resolved for the viewer with ten minutes of dialogue at the conclusion. Tell No One has a strong and interesting plot that should have played itself out through on-screen action, rather than have a guy sit in a room and reveal a back story that wasn't hinted at in the plot.RecommendOne to Anotheras another example of a good if not better, French thriller based on a real life crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really the same author?","review":"I loved Judith Michaels \\"Deceptions\\", \\"Possessions\\", \\"Inheritance\\" and \\"Private Affairs\\".

The only thing wrong with this gold-standard booklet is that its price will mean execs of some non-profits will not be able to afford a copy for every board member. This is so good it may be worth paying out of pocket to get into the hands of the board who you so badly need to think and act wisely.Though directed mainly at chief executives, there is as much orientation for the board.

I was pretty pleased with their performance - but as I went to put one of them on this morning, I noticed that one of the elastic straps had halfway ripped off the actual pouch. I was kind of miffed, and went to put the other one on instead, and I saw that the actual elastic strips inside the straps themselves had torn and were starting to poke through the fabric.Let me remind you that I've owned these for less than two weeks. All I've done with them is gone running - no abuse whatsoever. And they're both falling apart after a single wash.I knew Under Armour was overrated but I didn't realize they could screw up something as simple as a jockstrap.

If I had to hear one more ditzy phrase about my buns (\\"C'mon! Tight tushies here!\\"), I would have...well, you get the idea. Denise Austin teaching yoga is just too weird and I couldn't take her seriously. She never mentions how to breath properly (essential to yoga), let alone when. If you're a regular yoga practioner, be advised that all of these moves are found in your regular practice.Basically, I really disliked this dvd. However, I gave it 2 stars because if you're into aerobics and pilates, you'd probably really like it and get a good workout.Someone mentioned that they didn't like the \\"new age way\\" that yoga was presented.

It's not an American workout that sometimes goes with meditation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tape","review":"I may be biased because I like yoga moves but I really don't like all the meditating and new age spiritual ways that is can be presented.

It is horribly designed. The motor is underpowered, and it cannot deal with 2 cats. The litter level cannot be above the lowest fill line level because the motor can't move more litter than that. It is extremely poorly made. Unfortunately, I'm stuck using it because my cats refuse to use the automatic litter box that uses crystals, which is a much better system. Please save your money. If you have just one cat, it is at least livable, but with two cats, it sucks! The old version, without the removable rake, worked much, much, much better.

But I wouldnt suggest this to be used if you have a male cat, or large cats. My boy would pee too much for the little motor to handle the large clumps.The other issue I have is the worst of all. The smallest clumps that break off arent able to be raked out because they are too small and fit right through the rake. You can use any clumping litter you can find, and no matter what you do, this keeps happening. So the small particles that get left behind constantly stink so bad. They tell you to recycle the litter in the box and just keep adding to it, and completely change it every so often, but i was completely changing it all the time to avoid the smell. All that work made it pointless to own since i had to keep doing all the work myself.Now I just keep a open litter box by the toilet, scoop and flush everytime i end up in there. much better system this way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"stinks","review":"I had an older model littermaid which was not perfect but provided a decent reduction in litter-sifting labor.The rake motor seems much weaker than the older one. With the old one, used to be, I'd sift the litter and replace the receptacle every week or so. Occasionally i would have to \\"rescue\\" the littermaid because it couldn't cycle past a clump.The new litter box rarely cycles, ever.Another problem that I don't believe I ever saw with the old one is that the rake comes down off of a little ledge, rather than a fully-retracted bay. Litter can and will find its way onto this ledge. The smallest bit of litter will prevent the rake from coming to rest at the end of a cycle, so it will cycle again. It will do this something like a dozen times before giving up. Coupled with the loudness of this machine, this is extremely annoying when it happens in the middle of the night.Avoid this.

It worked well for a few months, but then stopped scooping the poop into the bin.

Since we have multiple cats, it's important to always have a clean box. While the previous models certainly weren't perfect and didn't last as long as I thought they should, they at least did a fairly good job. This new model misses even large clumps, creates a smelly clump behind the rake, and wastes a lot of litter that gets raked into the receptacle. This last problem is caused by a change in design, which has the rake just push the waste into the receptacle instead of lifting it, which means that all of the litter that used to sift back into the box (in previous models) now gets dumped. I've taken to emptying the receptacle back into the box and sifting myself. The only plus with this box vs a standard plastic one is that the littler stays a little cleaner. Certainly not worth the money!!! Save yourself the hassle and find an older model."},{"rating":"1","title":"This box is terribly awful","review":"I've gone through about 4 of these things.

Also, I initially put the waste pan on wrong and had a huge problem of litter dumping on the floor. Put it on the correct way and NO waste falls onto the floor. Follow the instruction manual and you will not have the issues that I read about. Great product if you use it as instructed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible waste of money","review":"i had the previous version of the LitterMaid and was really excited to try this \\"new and improved\\" model. What a disappointment! it does not work AT ALL. It consistently jams up, does not scoop everything, and is INCREDIBLY loud. I find it laughable that they say this is quieter than the old version--it will literally wake you up in the middle of the night, even if its on the other end of the house. I literally had to just turn it off and use it as a regular litter box until i could justify the huge expense of buying a new one (I went back to the old model). DO NOT BUY THE ELITE MODEL. Stick with the old school version."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money!","review":"I originally gave this a rave review. But then the wheel on the rake broke after 3 months, the rake never really worked well enough to scoop all the poop out and it felt like trying to scrape dried up cement from the bottom of the litterbox all the time. I've tried getting a replacement rake from the company, even calling and emailing them. They don't have it at all, they don't know where I could get one but ... and this turned out to be the last straw ... they charged my credit card for the rake anyway!Needless to say, I don't recommend this product and if you're reading this, don't even consider buying Littermaid. I wish Amazon had negative stars cuz this product would get a -10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!!! - not respresentative of the product line","review":"I bought one of these to replace a previous model tht was slowing down. It looks sleek and sounds great, but... the motor is noisy and seemingly weak. The pan is designed with a shallowly sloping end that allows the blades to leave material in the pan. The blades continually got stuck and the system would shut down. Within 30 days it would just die in place, and the motor went entirely. The tent that comes with it is too small, and very annoying to remove and replace when fixing the machine, which was basically every time the cat used it. I have used the Littermaid products since getting cats 8 years ago, and they have been great. I didn't bother to deal with getting this replaced at the store or by th company; I bought a model 500 for half the price here on Amazon and I'm back in business!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a horrible nightmare!","review":"I got this machine, because my husband said: \\"because it's the most expensive it must be the best\\".It wasn't.

It was horrible tosee the way that box was looking. I had to clean it up 3 times a day, and besides, I had to see all the residues of the disgrace that the machine does.This doesn't work properly, so it will leave everything on top, with a horrible smell. If you can, don't get it.Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"Terrible, awful, piece of junk!! Does not even begin to describe this scam!

It worked very well and I had 3 cats.I now have five cats and thought it a great idea to buy 3 of the 'Elite' models. After only 2 months two of the units have failed. The wheel which allows the rake to move through the litter has sheered off. The machines will now run endlessly and never remove the waste. I am not happy.They are very poorly constructed and an absolute waste of money. I like the concept of an automated litter box and will buy another brand.

I have 2 cats and never had a bit of trouble with it. I decided that it was wearing out and bought this newer model. What a mistake! I was changing the container every 3 days instead of every 6-7 days. The rake did not get all the waste but got most of the litter so therefore the container was mostly litter and not waste. It is not made the same at all. I returned it and was able to find the original box and now we are all happy again. This new model really needs to be re-configured. It does not work. Don't waste your money, buy the original at a lesser price."},{"rating":"1","title":"It seemed like a good idea at the time.","review":"This seemed like a good product, and other purchasers seemed to like it when I ordered it. however, after less than a month, this litter box has become more work than the manual variety. the shallow litter fill means that when the cat urinates, the resulting clump adheres to the bottom of the pan, and needs to be manually scraped loose for the rake to properly dispose of it. in addition, small clumps get trapped behind the rake, causing additional problems. it is now cleaned and will be going back to the manufacturer for a refund.review update: no refund... but at least it's not cluttering up the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than old one","review":"I hesitated ordering this litter box after reading so many negative comments, but I'm glad I did. I must say that I like it even better than the old one which I had for many years.

Using the LitterMaid brand litter and other premium clumping litters, the rake rakes a ton of clean litter into the box (and under the receptacle, creating a huge mess), necessitating either emptying or removing the disposable tray every day or two (for just one kitten). Generally I had to dump the plastic tray every day, then re-scoop what was actually dirty to avoid going through a ton of litter. The litter area of the box is so small that my kitten could not get comfortable, and often missed the litter, doing her business on the rake mechanism or the sides of the box, making lots of extra clean-up work. The charcoal pads don't stick to the lid like they're supposed to, leading to more odor. I found this system to be way more work than a much more basic system and have quit using it. I replaced it with an Omega Paw flip-over box, which costs a fraction of this product and works way better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is garbage, lasted less than 1 year","review":"Bought this at Petsmart about a year ago. Today, rake finally gave up, got stuck right in the middle of the pan, won't move forward won't move back. This product needs a stronger motor, same issue with the older models but I guess this company refuses to test its own products and learn from its mistakes. The rake gets stock on just about any clump. It seems they test this with mice instead of cats. The urine amount of an adult cat makes such a big clump that this motor cannot cope. There is also the issue with unused litter falling through the treshold between the edge of the pan, and the receptacle, making a nice consitent mount underneath the unit.Will be throwing out today. Done with this crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"cat likes it","review":"I thought I ordered the smaller version, which would have been OK as we have only one cat. But the larger version we received works alright, the cat likes it and my wife and I take turns emptying the litter container. We were surprised by how well it manages odors--no smell at all. It's possible to turn the mechanism off during sleeping hours (ours, not the cat's) but we leave it on 24/7, as we keep the LitterMaid in a spare bedroom where we can't hear the raking noise after the cat composes herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Great Littermaid :(","review":"I thought the newest and fanciest Littermaid would be the bomb .. oh yeah it bombed all right. The litter area is WAY TOO small for a cat of 10 lbs or more and they end up peeing on the circuit board and shorting the unit out. I went through 3 of these (Littermaid replaced them for free)Littermaids in under 1 month. In the end, I went back to the other older version as the litter area on those is MUCH bigger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like throwing money out the window","review":"We had an original Litter Maid self-cleaning cat box for nearly 5 years. We had very little trouble with it, so when it finally died, we purchased the new Litter Maid Elite, without doing any research. We figured our past experience was research enough - oh, how wrong we were.The Litter Maid Elite is a completely useless product. Ours, apparently, is afraid of encountering clumps. The rake will begin to move, but if it encounters the slightest clump, it will immediately reset itself. Once I manually scoop out the litter box, the rake will freely \\"clean\\" the box, but the self-cleaning function will then not stop - it \\"sweeps\\" back and forth 5 times, until it settles itself back into place, green light merrily blinking to indicate there is an error.I am now performing the function of the \\"automated self-cleaning litter box.\\" Basically, I paid $119.00 for a box.

From the first time the cat used this one, it was clear that it was worthless. The stainless steel forks are too far apart. Everthing sticks to them. Litter also flies out of the box creating a huge mess. We used Littermaid's litter and filled it exactly as they said, but that made no difference. It is also impossible to program correctly.

I had a littermaid box for years that worked fine. Eventually I had to replace it, which was fine since the original had a decent livespan.I bought the Elite and could never get it to work reliably. When I first add litter, the rake moves and does a pass, then never moves again. I manually covered the sensors and nothing happened. My cat used the box and nothing happened.

I've had the same experiences as many other one-star reviewers of the product: really noisy and it just plain doesn't do the job, although I've tried 3 of the \\"recommended\\" litters. I wanted to send an email to the folks at Littermaid, and discovered that the company behind it-- Applica Consumer Products, based in San Francisco, is responsible for a whole lot of bad products, and is engaged in a number of recalls and lawsuits. You may want to steer clear of any electronic stuff made by this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work","review":"Agree with other reviewers. I owned an earlier model which worked well, and purchased this one when it broke. The design has changed to the detriment of the product. If you fill with litter as outlined in the directions the \\"rake\\" goes over the waste and smashes it up making it more difficult to remove. If you fill it with more litter than recommended, the motor lacks the power to push through it and move the waste. Tried to solve the problem by buying \\"premium\\" litter, but to no avail. Three kinds of litter later, it still doesn't work. Finally, i unplugged the litter box, took out the rake, and started manually scooping as i would with any other litter box. This works best! Unfortunately, the price of the automatic litter box as compared to a plain plastic tray is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!","review":"I have used Littermaid products in the past and they have always been great.

They last about 2 months, then I call the customer service line and get it changed under the year warranty which each unit comes with. I have done this continuously for about 3 years. You just have to mail a check for $10 to cover shipping.They are cheaply made and the rake doesnt really work. The usual problem is that the rake gets stuck and the wheel on the side snaps. So it just keeps going and going. The rake only gets the large chunks. The small ones are left behind, so I still have to rake by hand on an almost daily basis.

After returning from vacation, decided to put the old one in the basement for storage until the next vacation. The Elite was supposedly good for multiple cats. Well, to be frank, the Elite allows clumped mess to get caught behind the raking bars so you have to scoop this out from behind. The biggest problem with this model is that it wastes sooo much good cat litter! Yep, scoops so much more up than the clumped waste and deposits it into the collecting tray as well as into the floor. I personally think LitterMaid was trying to get consumers to buy more cat litter...their brand!

Most of the time, the rake gets stuck in the up position and sweeps nothing. When it does work. the rake reaches just to the edge of the plastic receptacle, but does not push the waste in. They give you 4 free receptacles. Great, except mine were all bent and so did not fit properly in the opening.

Then it actually breaks up a lot of pieces since it doesnt go that deep so you have to back and scoop after it anyway. Who came up with this design??

When reaching out to the rude CS rep at littermaid I was able to reluctantly get them to give me an adress to send my receipt and power cord for the unit. That was the last time I have heard from that company. No replacement for my three month old unit and no contact from them.

When I had the older version (before it finally died), I recommended it to everyone that had cats, I loved it. The LME9000 Elite Series that I now have it the WORST!! I hate it! The 2nd day I had it, I had to do the reset on it. Over the next few weeks, I had to reset it about 6 more times to get it working. Now, it rakes back and forth 5-6 times then stops. I've tried everything! I've cleaned it thoroughly, used less litter, more litter, reset, different litter...everything! This piece of crap just does not work! $180 down the drain as far as I'm concerned. I just sent a complaint to customer service, we'll see if anything comes of that. But for now, the box is unplugged and I have to clean it manually. I would have been better off buying a $10 plastic box because that is all this one is good for!! Junk, junk, junk!!

Within 60 days, mine stopped working effectively. The rake just gave up and wouldn't scoop any clumps. It would just return to the home position and leave clumps unscooped. I ended up doing all the scooping myself, which I could have done for much cheaper with a regular litter box.

When it finally arrived we noticed they sent us the Basic model which is smaller. We have 4 cats, 2 of which are rather large males, we need any extra inches offered. When we called the company to have them fix their error they refused. First trying to tell us there was no difference between the basic and mega and then saying they will pick it up, but will not honor the price for the Mega like they originally promised. Now they will not refund the shipping costs for their error and we are out of a litter box. With customer service like that they just lost a customer!

THEY CAN'T TELL TIME!!! covering those with duct tape helped, but then It just did not have the poop to rake a good clump all the way to the bin. for smaller clumps it would rake it all the way, but would also take a good sized scoop of fresh litter with it. weak wastefull, and a step down from the original. mega headache and not elite."},{"rating":"1","title":"LitterMaid LME9000","review":"Neat product but the cat makes more of a mess with the litter and it forms underneath the litter box so it makes more work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"I rate this item 1 star because there are no lower ratings that I can use.

I read the reviews but just could not believe the product was as bad as they said since my original boxes were so great. Well, this piece of junk lived up (or down) to even the worst review! After suffering with it for a few months, I finally purchased a new machine; the older LitterMaid model Mega LM-900 and threw this new model machine in the trash.

I have to say that I have been a LOYAL customer of LitterMaid for almost 10 years and I just bought the LitterMaid Elite and I can not stand it. To begin with, you can not move the litter box without the top coming off. There are no latches to lock the top and bottom. It is MUCH louder than the older models and it does not clean at all. I still have to go up and scoop the litterbox every day. All the rake does is push the litter around and the poop gets stuck behind the rake. I guess that the only bonus is that the rake comes off so you can clean all the yucky litter out. The way the receptacles fit, all the litter falls out and I have it put together properly. I am so disappointed with this new model. I will be returning it and purchasing an older model. This product is terrible.

As a consequence, the wheels snap off the rake and you have yourself a very expensive standard scoop-it-yourself cat box.I suffered this same failure twice within a year or so of purchase and had to scold customer support before they'd send a warranty replacement the first time around -- They tried to blame their product's failure on my being overseas and seemed unimpressed with the fact that the power supply continued to work just fine, thank you.This was the second Littermaid automatic cat box I purchased (two separate models), and the first failed during the warranty period as well.

They worked fine but they had a built-in design problem (planned obsolescence ?) so they only lasted a couple of years each. The power cord for the scooper would eventually break from metal fatigue at which point the scooper was dead. I bought the new model because Littermaid fixed the power problem by redesigning how the scooper worked. Unfortunately, although the power cord was fixed, the overall operation of the unit was vastly inferior to the previous models. The new scooper is supposed to slide on plastic rails but it always jams. The motor unit can't figure out when to stop backing up. The scooper itself is under powered. The older units worked fine; this new one almost never works. Save yourself the aggravation and the money.

It is just horrible. I have gone back to just a regular old litter box as the other one wasn't worth all the hassle. They need to go back to their earlier model and get rid of this one.

I was careful to only use the expensive premium litter and was sure not to fill above the line. However, after only having it about 3 weeks, the gears starting making a clicking noise when cleaning. Then, it started continuing to run constantly and wouldn't shut off. We called the company, and they told us where to find the reset button and how to do it. We did that and now, every time that it is supposed to clean the box, it not only makes a clicking noise, but runs 5 times back and forth (clicking down the whole track each time), instead of just once like it is supposed to do. Very annoying!I am very dissatisfied with this product. We have 2 cats and keep it turned off so that it won't run 5 times each time one of the cats decides to use it.

First, you do have to keep it filled fairly high, or else the rake won't get the waste. The cat also is able to urninate beyond the rake, which forces me to remove the rake and clean out the clumps with the scooper. This is not why I bought a self-cleaning litter box.When the rake does lift up the lid to deposit the waste, sometimes the plastic receptacle lid falls loose, and it makes a mess. I wind up cleaning more around this litter box than any traditional one.It is also very noisy when running - enough to wake me up at night, and I am a heavy sleeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks worse than what it doesn't scoop","review":"We had two of the older basic models which worked pretty good...This new elite STINKS.....If you buy one make sure to train your cat to pee toward the front of the litter box.

First off, it is big, and the tent we bought (from the manufacturer) barely fit around it and was a hassle to try to change the receptacle while in. So we stopped using the tent. Secondly, it was LOUD. Super super super loud. Like, my sister who lives in the basement was having a hard time sleeping because it sounded like someone was drilling in the ceiling loud. We followed the directions and only put a small amount of litter in the box. For a while, it worked pretty good, but at about 6 months, it just stopped scooping all the way. We cleaned it, and tried again with the same problem. So we're done.

They have all been LitterMaid because I think they are the best brand out there but definitely have problems. This one was actually intended to double up - keep our old one and have two - and it has made a huge difference. I think not having one constantly running is helping save the motor. With two or more cats, I would recommend having two. But it still has some problems. The pan is not very big and we have a huge cat that pees RIGHT on the rake, which then clumps up and gets stuck behind and in the rake, making the litter box run consistently until we go and fix it. Also you'll want to put it somewhere far away from your bedroom - like the basement - because they are loud. But so far with two we are having better luck with the motors working much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money and frustration","review":"The manufacturer sent us this model (LME9000) to replace a different style that broke while under warranty. The LME9000 is a poor design with a weak motor. If it looses the power, you must manually turn the box back on which does not help if you are away or do not know of the power fail. Our motor continues to work now but can not \\"scoop\\" into the disposal container (this is with or without litter in the box). When it did work properly, the rake would often push against the container and deposit the waste under the box. The only plus is that you could use more litter, which the cats seem to like, than some older models without jamming. We have had older models of the Littermaid products that may have had little issues but at least would last longer the 2-3 months (with 2 cats) as this one did (older models lasted a couple years with use from 3 cats).

Instead, it will keep going back and forth from the middle to the back. We have attempted reducing the litter, but this does not help. The \\"improved\\" rake also does not scoop all of the feces when it does scoop.

It does not clog as often as the old models. But you still have the litter spills between the container and the box and of course it also clogs some times with my two cats. The Elite is built far worse than any other model. In a little over a year I've been through 3 broken rakes, and 2 failed boxes. The third warranty replacement just arrived today. Between cleaning a regular litter box and dealing with the Elite I pick the latter, but when my warranty expires and I have to purchase a new box it will not be a Littermaid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Newer does not mean better","review":"I have had two littermaid boxes that both lasted just over a year before they broke. I was so happy with their performance that I decided to upgrade to the newer and better version. I have had it for about 4 months and I have to say that I am very disapointed.The pans don't fit very well and a lot of litter ends up on the floor between the dump pans and the box itself. It waists a lot of litter! With the older boxes I would change the pan and add litter now I have to move the entire box, clean under and around about every 4 days. The \\"air cleaner\\" feature is a gimic and makes absolutely no difference!The only positive I can say is that the metal rakes are good for the larger clumps and it doesn't seem to get stuck as often as the older one.

The first 2 were also littermaids and worked fine. I upgraded the first one for a larger model and then the motor just finally wore out. At any rate, I purchased this new stupid \\"Elite\\" model in September of 2007 and it is horrible. The rake doesn't completely clear and most times it actually lifts up the plastic container and dumps the waste under the container instead of inside it. Every day I have to go down and check on it and every single day I have to touch it and reset it. I may as well own an old fashioned non-electric version for as much good as this thing does me.

I purchased the Elite Mega as a replacement for the LitterMaid LM900 which finally stopped working after many years of service. Unfortunately it was an impulse buy at a local pet store before I read the Amazon reviews. With a few tweaks in the design, the Elite Mega could be a pretty decent litter box. Primarily the LitterMaid company needs to deal with the weak motor which often doesn't have enough power to make it through a single cycle and the issue of Litter being thrown out of the box near the receptacle.Pros:Removable rakeOne piece bottomCons:Very weak motorComplicated assemblyToo much litter misses the receptacle and winds up on the floorThe receptacle doesn't open wide enough to accommodate some debris"},{"rating":"1","title":"One or more steps backward","review":"I've been searching for an auto litter box for a month now. I've compared the LM900, LME9000, and Scoopfree Ultra. This one was one of the worst for the reasons below:- cheap and flimsy build and design- whoever designed the location and attachment method of the waste receptacles is a complete moron- the new rake is more like a plow, again highly moronic- taking a simple task and making such a complicated device, even more complicated than the old model, to complete it is just insane- the clock resets when you hit the power button (poor choice there again)- Littermaid likes to make many different products with different numbers and not even have proper information on their website pointing toward extremely poor support- the noise of the wimpy motorThings I like:- more modern styling- ability to attach the tent directly to the box"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good....","review":"I don't even know where to start with this product. Absolute piece of junk in my opinion. The rake gets stuck and can't push one tiny turd into the waste receptacle. The motor has about as much power as a single AAA battery. Just not enough to get the deal done in a two cat household. The angle that the rake attacks the litter is flawed too. I found that if I ran it and just applied a little pressure to the top of the rake backward, that it went through just find. Without that, it craps out after its 3 tries, and you just have to clean it out manually anyway. BTW, the waste bins are ultra thin. Good luck getting it out and in the trash if it's full without breaking it. I got so frustrated with it the other day, I tore the motor out and threw that away. Going to try something else at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just burn your money instead!","review":"This hunk of junk isn't worth the \\"product\\" my cat puts into it.

It is over a year old and have had no problems at all! As long as you follow the instructions, don't fill with too much litter...use a good quality clumping litter etc, you will be fine. I have gone from 2 to 4 cats and this machine it great. The one and only problem I have had is because my male cat likes to go on one side. Everytime he goes in the same spot so the rake pushes the clump into the waste receptical in the same spot and gets full on one side, so the lid doesn't always close unless I empty it. There will always be tiny clumps that get past te rake, and you just scoop those out. I line the plastic recepical with a small trashbag and empty it as often as needed. Fill the pan with more litter when needed and everything is great! Now that I have 4 cats, I will be buying a second one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I bought this item because the reviews were, for the most part, pretty good.

The gears became clogged/corroded and the raking mechanism did a better job trapping cat gunk than extracting it from the litter box. All and all it was an expensive disappointment.

When the rake comes through to the end it doesn't lift the panel up correctly every time and it get litter all over the place. When that happens its not easy to clean. Not to mention it does not consistently push clumps into the basket on every occasion. Rather, many times the rake gets clumps stuck in it and brings right back to where it all started. Or even worse some times the clumps get stuck behind the rake. The idea is a good one. I really wished it worked better and if its something I'm doing I'm glad to hear it.

To make matters worse, they have some pretty bad customer service. It is ridiculous how long I stayed with this litterbox.

Poor design. Poor application. Will break or have to be reset every other day. If they used sturdier materials (and actual metal railings, gears and wheels) it might be effective but this product, as well as most other automatic cat litter boxes are a waste of money. Ten dollars worth of materials with a 100+ pricetag and it does not work like they say it does. Do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not self cleaning","review":"My husband thought this would be great, a self cleaning cat litter box, wrong, it makes a big mess, as shown in oneof the photographs, as the automatic forks drag the clumps to the disposal tray, it drops litter down the crack between the desposal container and the unit. You have to pick the whole unit up to sweep up all the cat litter that has dropped under the unit. You can spend more time cleaning up after the automatic cleaner than you would if you just used a regular cat box. The other draw back is the unit is very noisy. I will not be replacing the unit when it dies and that can't happen soon enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Last a year.","review":"I purchased this less than a year ago and the motor is dieing all ready.

When the rake begins to lift to push the poop into the receptacle it lifts up leaving a gap of about 1\\"-1 1/2\\" leaving most of it (poop) in the box and what is left is now caught behind the rake as it returns to its resting position and pushing the poop to the back of the litter box squishing it into the rake.I wish I had never wasted my money on this.

Although it was rated multi-cat, it was completely incapable of handling my single cat's needs. I had to unclog it several times a day, which was more often than I had to clean a normal pan! I think the thin layer of litter it requires to operate \\"properly\\" did not provide adequate absorption for my cat's urine, which overwhelmed it, even though I used premium clumping litter.

I was excited to get a new shiny \\"elite\\" littermaid, but was sadly disappointed when we found that they changed how the littermaid functioned. It no longer lifts the waste up and in to the recepticle - it now just slides everything in, which includes more clean litter than it does waste. It also isn't strong enough to scoop the \\"pee spots\\" which just get stuck in the corners of the box and forces you to have to scoop the box on a regular basis.So you throw out clean litter, and have to scoop the waste.

Then somehow the rake got slanted and would move on an angle up and down the tray. The customer service people were excellent and sent me a new box.

I too had older versions for many years. This one does NOT do what it is suppose to do! The company recommends 3 types of litter. I tries all, 3 not only the unit gets stuck when raking thru the litter, most of the time it pushes the good litter into the dump container wasting litter. The motors are too weak for the unit. You can hear the motors sound like its skipping gears. I have to dump the litter and siphon the good litter out, which is what the litter box is suppose to do. The ionization device on the unit does not do anything. When power goes out, you have to turn the unit back on. As the old units, it would turn on and clean. The rake system gets stuck up sometimes. And most of the time the stuff the rake is suppose to dump, gets caught behind the rake unit(cause rake does not go down far enough). DO NOT PURCHASE THE THIS UNIT. What ever person designed it, should not work for this company anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal Product.

What it doesn't have is basic functionality.Waste gets caught behind the rake or left behind. It requires daily attention to keep a modicum of cleanliness. If I wanted to pay daily attention to the litterbox, I wouldn't have purchased an automated one.Littermaid's Engineers need to go back to the drawing board with this one. Fortunately LM's customer service was up to par. I called them and complained, and they sent me an LM900 (After I sent them $10 and vital parts.) The LM900 sells for less than this model, so I lost money on the deal but ultimately ended up with a functioning product.Bottomline: This doesn't work. Buy the LM900 instead. It works, and it's cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it, buy 10 regular litter boxes","review":"You would be better off to buy cheap litter boxes and replace them monthly than to spend your money on this. The disposable tray the poop is raked into is nearly impossible to line up right, so everytime the litter is raked over the edge, a good amount of it bypasses the tray and goes right onto the floor underneath. The construction is flimsy. The rake does a very poor job (I end up scooping through the box daily to get what the rake left behind). At this point, I've turned off the power and am using it as a very expensive, non automated cat pan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I do a zero?","review":"One word: Crap!Pushes more litter out of the box than waste into the receptacle.

The motor is so weak and the design so poor it can slide a single cat turd up a 45 degree inclined plane. I'll have to scoop it. That says the whole story. It's so noisy that the cats are scared to death of it. For the noise it makes you'd think it could pull a stump.I spent $150 so I wouldn't have to do that.

I think my husband broke it. I loved the old version. It cleaned very well. This new one is designed with a much flimsier plastic. Constructions is weak. It does not clean nearly as good as the old one. This one seems to shove the waste up to the receptical leaving pieces of waste in the litter box. It also seems to trap waste behind the rake. Somehow it falls through or behind the rake when cleaning and then ends up stuck there as the rake retracts back into the starting position. I am constantly having to full with this machine. The other and older models were much sturdier and required less babysitting. If you can find the older model, buy it. I just ordered the LM900 from amazon to replace this elite model.

You'll have to scoop it or toss it.2- You'll notice poop and/or piddle collecting on and behind the rake.3- You'll notice poop marks on the housing of the unit, requiring cleaning.4- You'll be cleaning the unit and repacking it in the box to return it to the store.DON'T BUY IT!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"From good to bad","review":"I, like many others commenting here really liked the old littermaid automatic litter box. I'm talking about the one with the plastic rake. It worked great for many years, then the motor went out. That was fine, I expected it to die after five or more years and two cats using it. I upgraded to the Littermaid Elite and it wasn't as good as the first one, but functioned. I wanted something better, so I assumed that buying the best product they offered on the market would improve the performance at least to that of the first automatic box we owned. Wrong! The Elite Mega was very problematic and after only one month I discarded it and have moved onto a new comapny. The PetSafe Simply Clean is now in our home and is working out great so far. The reviews on here were very supportive so I have high hope for long term success."},{"rating":"1","title":"This stinks, literally and figuratively.","review":"After having this contraption for only 8 months, it has stopped working altogether.

Amazon was great they had to send three, yes three, before I could get one that worked. It lasted exactly 16 months before the mechanism went crazy and started grinding gears at 4AM. In that period of time I was going through 40 pounds of litter a month for two cats because this device drags the waste through the litter and into the bin and by doing that takes a good deal of clean litter with the dirty. The older models lift the waste out of the ltter and drop it into the bin.

After having it for about one month, I have come to the conclusion that this is one of the WORST products I have ever purchased.Prior to purchasing the Elite Mega, I owned an LM500 Basic model. While it didn't work as well as I liked, it was 100% better than the Elite Mega.The Elite Mega is poorly and cheaply constructed. The rake doesn't lift the lid of the receptacle high enough for the waste to go in. The rake doesn't go all the way back and lift out of the litter allowing the cat to urinate into the litter behind the rake which keeps the waste from being raked out. The attachment points for the receptacles are extremely hard to work, don't fit well and are often knocked loose by the rake.For $150, I expect a lot more from this product. The LitterMaid Elite is not nearly as good as the old model."},{"rating":"1","title":"This version must be BETA!","review":"I have had this Littermaid (LME9000) for just under 60 days (Purchase date was 8-22-2006). It was a replacement for an older Littermaid that I had for 4 years (give or take about a month).Here are the problems I have:The flimsy molding causes the cover for the receptacle to never close. It catches on the sides, so its always cracked open. So the ionic filter may sound nice, it can't battle that much smell.Also, since the rake doesn't have a fixed guide, it catches a lot even when its only raking through litter with no waste to plow through.The rake guide wheels are not so great either. If the rake gets caught on something, the motor is actually strong enough to break the wheels off the rake, resulting in a completely useless littermaid.I would not reccomend this model/style to anyone. You are much better off with the LM500 since its the older design and should be far more reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible purchase","review":"I had the original base model for a few years and then it finally died. It wasn't great and each week I would have to resolve at least one problem it couldn't deal with, but on the whole it was fine. So stepping up to the top model I thought was a smart idea, it'll be much better than the base model... yeah right!This thing barely touches the bottom of the tray so it will 'never' get everything out. It's design makes it 'impossible' for it to get 'anything' at the very back of the tray. The forward portion of the scoop cycle has a half inch to inch gap between the tray and metal prongs (yes, it's put together properly so the 'you should be able to read this text' text is under the tray). The plastic boxes don't fit in the area given easily so you have to lock them into place... this and the motor seems weaker than the base model...A total useless waste of money, resolving it getting stuck is now a daily operation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"We have the LME5500 model made by this company.

I had three original littermaids before this and was quite happy with them. This one though, first of all, the \\"air freshener\\" doesn't help much, and all those little vents mean it's quite filthy and impossible to clean. Secondly, the metal rake doesn't work as well as the plastic rake and stuff gets caught in the back behind it. Finally, when you fill it to the recommended level of litter, it dumps half of it on the first pass into the receptacle. So you can never have enough litter in there to clump properly. I just bought another original LM900 (to replace the LME900 I own currently) because I can't stand it any more. The night timer I've never used, I keep hoping they will let you adjust the clump time, 10 minutes just isn't long enough even with their brand of litter.Having said all that, I have used it for two years and it's still easier than a litterbox, but for that kind of money, it should work better than it does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Littermaid yet!!!!","review":"I've purchased several Littermaid's over the years (a different story), but this one is the worst.

Well, it does its electronic thing every ten minutes or so, but it takes more time to maintain than a regular litter box. If the point of this is to help people who can't bear to look at or touch cat pee or poop, forget about it. The receptacles are flimsy and easily collapse, and the tines of the rake get clogged up every single day (or more). It would have been much easier to save the more than $150 we paid for this and just take the time to clean our regular litter boxes. I am deeply disappointed. By the way, we use the highest quality litter - Arm and Hammer clumping multi-cat litter, which clumps just fine in the regular box, but gets all clogged up in the Littermaid.

To my dismay and frustration I spend just as much time now as before scooping and vacumming litter. Even with the Kitty Cabana covering the box, the cats still manage to sprinkle litter all around. Because the rake sits a bit forward, clumps of \\"smelly stuff\\" get stuck behind it-this I have to remove the old fashioned way.

It does have another function that is not spelled out. You can plug your guitar cord in to the unit! Great for tuning up before the show....just make sure you check the tune!

The best print of GFB! (1951) appears on Warner's triple feature alongside Raoul Walsh's enjoyable 'Objective Burma' and John Sturges' disappointing 'Never So Few,' but this Mill Creek DVD offers a better-than-average p.d. transfer with clear picture and audio. It also boasts the cleanest version I've encountered of Universal's clunky but energetic 'Gung-Ho!' (1943), the source-quality of which seems to range from bad to unwatchable depending on the distributor you choose.

This was one of the few numbers that retained the choral parts, but the man they chose for it made my ears bleed, and the song- the formerly lovely duet between the phantom and a soft piano- has been changed into a synthesized, pop-like monstrosity.

The arrangements are strange, making \\"Music of the Night\\" into some sort of pop-rock ballad and distorting many other songs terribly. Of course, when it's so obvious your \\"orchestra\\" is made mostly of synthesizers, with only a very few exceptions, I guess you have to work with what you've got!

It is further pleasing and edifying that it is performed by the ensembles that premiered it on Good Friday 1727 and 1729. This, along with the Richter 1979 recording, would be a must-have for any collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Chore to Read","review":"I've been reading a number of memoires of WWII German generals, so I picked up this book. I don't regret reading it as contains an account from an important player in that war. However, I found it very dry and without much soul, unlike the memoires of Guderian, Rommel, von Luck, or even the cerebral von Manstein. And unless you are really into the details of tank battles, it contains very little new if you've read Guderian and von Manstein because the author succeeds pretty well in hiding himself.If you like detailed accounts of battles, you may find this book to be interesting. If you tend to like war stories or some reflections on the war experience, this book will probably leave you cold. Worthwhile read I think, but definitely not a pleasure. If I were to assemble a reading list of German commanders, I'd probably put this book toward the end of the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"read with military curiorsity but with political discretion","review":"Great military insights, a classic Prussian staff officer's work. A must read for understanding armour battles in WW2, especially those on the Eastern Front where the most intense armour battles took place. Tactics and commands were well-analyzed in most chapters.However, politically this book seems a defense for the German General Staff. As a general in the Wehrmacht, Mellenthin disappointed me for not expressing opinion towards the Holocaust, and in general his opinions towards the Red Army and the Russian people seemed too strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book for the serious student of WWII","review":"Panzer Battles is a must have for those interested in the fighting in North Africa and the Eastern Front. Major General von Mellenthin provides an extremely knowledgeable account of the divisional level fighting before El Alamein and during and after Stalingrad. Of particular interest are his accounts of the 4th Panzer Army's attempt to rescue the 6th Army at Stalingrad and the 4th's actions near Belgorod during operation Citadelle. The only flaws this book has are von Mellenthin's tendency to blame Hitler for any setbacks and his comments on his Russian opponents which lead one to beleive that von Mellenthin had little problem with Hitler's \\"lebensraum\\" policies. These minor details notwithstanding, this is a very good book well worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little knowledge of events outside 38 Panzer Corps","review":"This book presents a very limited view of a HQ officer of a German Panzer Corps. It is clear that he has a somewhat shored view of things happening outside of his Corps. He has very little knowledge of Russian behaviors and is clearly a one-sided biased presenter. In his work he is trying to discredit Red Army's victory and attribute it to other factors and intangibles.It is rather clear that he is not familiar with the evils perpetrated by NAZI occupiers while he would readily attribute things of that nature to Russians. Which could be expected from a front line commander unfamiliar with zonderkommandas"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the serious student of WWII, a great book!","review":"For the serious student of WWII I think this is one of the best books out there. Concise and well written, Von Mellinthin provides great tactical and strategic insight into the deployment of armor on the eastern front in WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its ok","review":"I bought this book with the hope that it would include a detailed counter-hegemonic theory, theoretical breakdown. What the book was, was a general overview of the theory applied to Jamaica during the '60's and early '70's. If this book was a $20 paperback it would be a 5 star book for the price, especially if you are interested in Jamaica. But if you are interested in counter-hegemonic theory this is not the book. it is too expensive for the information that is contained within this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"wedding songs","review":"I don't think this CD is for weddings....I personaly didn't care for it.

I'm in my twenties and I've only swallowed a few pills in my life (and they were tiny!). I think swallowing pills has a lot to do with how you naturally swallow, and if you swallow incorrectly even this cup won't help you. I naturally swish liquid around in my mouth and swallow it in a few small swallows. I can only successfully swallow pills when I make a conscious effort to swallow all the liquid straight down in one gulp without allowing it to swish around in my mouth. So all that to say, the if you don't swallow correctly the cup probably won't make a difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Pill Takers Cup","review":"This cup just plain does not work.

The controls were extremely sluggish making it impossible to control objects and complete any of the timed puzzles. I met the minimum specs for playing the game, so why didn't it work? Answer: get a game-quality graphics card and like ATI or NVIDA and the game plays smoothly. Once I got past the technical frustrations, I settled into the game. I did not encounter any other bugs whats-so-ever. The storyline is fun and new, and humorous at times. The puzzles are clever and not too hard, although on a couple I had to get a clue on-line (I hate doing that!) so they are not all easy. This is a great adventure game for new and seasoned gamers alike. I racked up 24 hours of game play so I got my money's worth. I would definitely buy the sequel to this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible controls","review":"I think this game would be a lot of fun if the controls didn't lag so much. Like a few of the other reviewers, I have a brand new computer that far surpasses the requirements for this game, and still it runs slow. I have even turned the graphic settings all the way down, and that didn't help either. For now I have given up on the game, beause it is too hard to play, but hopefully the company will release a patch one day. I was really looking forward to playing this game, as I have enjoyed the other Broken Sword games, but I am sorely disappointed. As I said before, it would probably be a lot of fun, if it wasn't so hard to control."},{"rating":"1","title":"A buggy mess","review":"What a disappointment! On my old computer, which met all of the specs asked for, this thing crawled along and was unplayable. I was very excited when I got my new computer, so I could finally play the sequel to one of my favorite computer games. I installed it, only to discover this does not support Nvidia GeForce 8800 video cards, among others. I did some internet searching, and discovered this is a common problem for people. There is a patch for the European version of the game that corrects this problem, but no patch for this version. It is the same game with a different title, but you still can't use the Angel of Death (European version of this game) patch to fix this. It's frustrating, because you would think The Adventure Company itself would care enough about its own product to put out a patch, but apparently not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Reliable","review":"This game loads properly on only one out of every three attempts. When it does load properly, the main character sometimes goes someplace completely different than where I click. If I don't do things in exactly the proper order, I can't get to the next clue. For example, at one point I had to go from a hotel desk to another building, talk to a guard, and come back to the hotel desk to find a clue. But when I came back, I did other things first and by then the clue was not there. Thanks to a walk-thru, I returned to talk to the guard about the same thing, and then came back and went directly to the clue. Not my idea of fun. I gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Sword ..Broken Game","review":"I was excited to play this game.. and its terrible.. the movement is Slow .. tons of BUGS.. its like pulling teeth to play.. and its a shame.. cause this could have been a great game..THUMBS Down"},{"rating":"1","title":"killed a franchise","review":"Unfortunately this substandard game will go down in history as the piece of software that killed the brokensword franchise. Listing its defects is describing most adventure games these days: badly thought-out puzzles, sleepy progression in the game (zzzz), a hard to follow story, dubious character motivation etc. Nothing wrong with the graphics, game run fine, no bugs that I noticed.

However, like a previous customer, I was unable to get this game to run. It's completely unplayable. I have a brand new PC, and even the 3 year old low res movie files at the beginning stutter, even after applying the \\"fix\\" that the game suggests in case they are slow.

After reading the reviews of the book's supporters, one person said, \\"After all, it is difficult to read if you are blinded by hatred or prejudice.\\" The authors of this book are blinded by hatred and prejudice. Much of it is true and they try to appear balanced by including some watered down Rebublican faux pas'. People who really know history and possess any wisdom know that both sides have much to atone for, but these authors have an agenda which is to make the Republicans appear more moral than the Democrats, which is patent nonsense. Anyone who believes this is truly prejudiced, blind, illogical and grotesquely unwise.

I forgot to review this item when I purchased it almost a year and a half ago. We played it EVERY night for the first 7-8 months after our son was born. We moved a couple of times afterward and this album got lost in the shuffle. My son's attention was captured INSTANTLY when it began to play in another room last night! DADDY FOUND HIS CD!! My son, now 16 months, swayed from side to side with his eyebrows raised and a huge smile on his face - truly brought tears to my eyes! This is the sweetest CD with a sort of R&B or jazzy type feel!

I read the NY Review of Books' article on Lumumba first, which gives a good sense of the historical forces. The former UN Undersecretary however is unrelenting as far as Lumumba is concerned, painting Lumumba almost as a psychotic unrelenting fanatic. It appears the Undersecretary's bias stems from his frustration felt by many UN leaders at the time in dealing with a distrusting world leader (ie., Lumumba) wanting to play on his own terms. Peck on the other hand shows Lumumba's idealism, integrity, fears, and demand for equal recognition clashing with the designs of the West and the riotous factions within his own country. The movie is much more sympathetic and realistic in portraying what Lumumba was up against. The audience really feels and relates to Lumumba in a way that is not at all schmaltzy. I highly recommend this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"I am loving lifechange books. Greek looks good I need more Greek books lifechange needs sunshine.

I am on my 5th or 6th steamer now. I have had to return 3 or 4 of these. They only have a one year warranty and don't expect it to last more than that. The thing is, when it works its great which is why I keep buying one. I have to admit I am kind of adicted to it. It works really well on cleaning carpet and fabric. I especially like to use it to clean the car and the kitchen. Maybe eventually they will make one that doesn't break all the time. I have also purchased the Shark equivalent and had the same issues with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this item!!!!!!","review":"I just received this item and tried to use it in the bathroom. The steam not only comes out of the nozzle but also the trigger that you press down. The handle becomes so hot with the steam that you can not hold it. I put on dishwashing gloves to use this item and it was still too hot to handle.I called Scunci to see if the item was defective they said to use it without the attachments. What good is it if you can't use it with that attachments. I listened to what they said tried it without but the steam still poured out of the trigger making it impossible to hold.Please do not buy this product!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"I tried it in the bathroom and on tennis shoes without luck. The only thing it has worked on is the grout on my tile floor.

Cleaning without harmful chemicals is really the way to go. But the vapor-systems are more than my budget allows. So I got one of these Scunci steamers instead. What a mistake. Should have saved my money and followed the advice of sis. This is a toy compared to the powerhouse she has. Plus her steamer goes much longer on a tank of water. And it does not leak or leave things real wet. Oh well, live and learn. You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time-consuming to use; waste of time/effort","review":"The Scunci Steamer takes longer to use than more conventional ways of cleaning. Because of possible personal injury by steam, you must: wait for steam to begin (naturally); wait several minutes before changing from one cleaning tool to another; wait to unscrew lid to refill so you will not receive burn injury; wait again for steam to begin, etc.; you should not use on \\"cold\\" glass (can cause cracks); did not steam out wrinkles from several shirts of various fabrics. Terribly inconvenient and time-consuming product to use. You must be careful at which angle you hold the unit; otherwise, you could receive injuries. It did not clean bugs from the front of my car. The steaming process didn't last long enough to finish most chores. It did not clean well under the rims of the toilet. Greatest thing about it?? The container doesn't take up much room in the storage closet, where it now resides. Very disappointing product."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK!!!","review":"Got one of these and what a mistake. Total junk. Looked at them steamers at vapor-systems.com and contacted a lady on the testimonial page. They seem much better. Man o man are they expensive though. Don't know how we can afford one but we're saving. Steamers are the way to go without chemicals. Forget this junk though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Buy","review":"Believe what you read in the other reviews. I received the steamer and I couldn't wait to use it. The upholstery and clothes attachment worked OK, but when you put on the attachments which hook up to the small nozzle, it SCALDS you, the trigger and the crack under the trigger emit steam. Burned my hand and returned the steamer according to their instructions. That was 3 months ago, and, despite repeated requests, I still have not receieved another. DON'T BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"P.O.S. (i.e. Do Not Buy)","review":"Despite the other negative reviews, I figured I should at least try this steamer. At $60, it is a total waste of money. From it's un-ergonomic design to it's worthless cleaning ability, (not to mention it's incredibly loud) I am returning this crap and getting my money back. It barely got the wrinkles out of a cotton shirt and did nothing to my filthy oven OR the grout in my bathroom. Oh well. Guess I'm back to elbow grease and my $60 back in my pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scunci Steamer isn't that great!","review":"I have tried it in the bathroom without much luck there. I tried to clean tennis shoes without luck. The only thing that it has helped on is cleaning the grout in my tile floor.

After reading the reviews here I was kind of nervous to buy this steamer but my boyfriend really wanted it so we decided to give it a try, this thing does everything !!! Me and my boyfriend both smoke in our apartment and we also have two cats. So neadless to say ashtrays get spilled and so on... so I decided my first job with the steamer would be to clean the stains on my carpet !!! I used my steamer along with the scrubby atatchment and it got the stains out !!! Not even spot shot did this !!!! Yes it took a little bit of elbow grease but it was wonderful, also it was removed soap scum on our shower cutain, cleaned the floors in the kitchen and bathroom, cleaned counters, and faucets, and I have to say it did everything wonderful with little to know effort !!!! Also it makes the air in my apartment smell so much cleaner !!! Away with cleaning products away with deoterizers SCUNCI STEAMER is here to stay !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than imagined","review":"I purchased the steamer after getting severe chemical burns in my throat and lungs from using household cleaners. After finding out that I am allergic to cleaners, I tried every \\"natural\\" cleaner I could find. I was never satisfied by the job they did, and they were considerably more expensive. I bought the Scunci steamer and I put this steamer to the test. There is nothing this thing can't clean. I use it ALL the time and LOVE it. I have never had a problem with the handle getting too hot, and I use it for long periods of time. After showing neighbor's and family how clean it gets things, they have all bought one and use their's instead of cleaning products. Bottom line is-I LOVE MY SCUNCI STEAMER and would highly recommend it to anybody and everybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off - Criminal to be ablre to sell this item","review":"This item is so falsely represented on the infomercial and it's advertising nationwide and on its box.This product will steam away that dirt or material which you can easily hand wipe away - for anything more significant such as some baked on grease on the stove top, I steamed and steamed - then finally in exasperation just took my normal cleaner, orange clean paste cleaner and the same sponge with the scouring pad on the bottom and it all wiped clean easily. The steaming did nothing but aggravate my wrist as it is very heavy.This company should be ordered to return the money to everyone who purchased it. I will be sending it back as soon as the post office opens after Christmas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"only thing it does for me is blow away dust","review":"Don't waste your money on this. After watching the commercials on tv I was anxiously awaiting it's arrival. It does nothing that it does on the commerical.

It is being returned today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer Clear of this one!!!","review":"What a piece of garbage. Not only is the steam barely hot enough to make you pull your hand away, it doesnt work well at all. They may show it blowing grime off that grill on TV, but I guarantee you someone had just painted it on only seconds before. It clogs, even after having used distilled water and you cant use common cleaning solutions like vinegar or CLR to unjam it. The only good part is that I got a canvas bag with it. I now use the bag to store products that actually work. Id throw this thing in the garbage, but I dont want to insult the waste disposal guy. Youre better off blowing the steam off the mouth of a regular tea kettle than you are using this thing. Total piece of garbage, and if I could give it less than one star I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scunci Steamer return to sender","review":"I just received my Scunci Steamer and cannot get the attachments to attach to the base unit.

This is a piece of junk. I brought this product to remove the stain from my bathroom tiles. The steam lasted about 15-20 mins and I cleaned 4 tiles. Well...it only managed to get little bit of stain out. This product is nothing like what they showed you on their comercial. I am gonna return this piece of junk and donate the 50 bucks to the children's hospital."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Ripoff","review":"This product did not work at all. It didn't really get rid of dirt (if there was dust it blew it around). And I needed to scrub by hand anyway after I used.

Don't waste your time and money buying this steamer."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNSAFE Product","review":"I just pulled the thing for a second round of cleaning.First, steam cleaning works for a lot of things, but it's not a complete solution. I had good success steaming off hard water marks, oven grease, soap scum -- and even candle wax on the cool-decking in the back yard.But, now, on my second round using the device -- steam was escaping through the HANDLE. I have minor burns on my hand because I depressed the button fully and didn't expect to get a hand full of steam.I tried calling Customer Service -- number not in service. I tried the Scunci website listed in the owners' manual and they don't exist.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT unless you like having steam burns on your hands. It's not safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cleans the crud around the faucets","review":"I think people need to understand that this product is not for heavy duty cleaning. If you are looking for something cheap to clean the crud around your sink faucets or if you want to clean a small floor area, this steamer does a half decent job. However if you are looking to clean all the large floors in you home you should consider something like the Bissell Steam Mop. It costs less and does not use chemicals and what you save by not buying chemicals will more than pay for the mop. Now if you want to do the whole house (floors, tub/shower, kitchen cabinets, windows, stove, refrigerator, etc) one of those steamers at vapor-systems.com has the punch and capacity to tackle just about everything you have. But forget the Comet spray stuff for the bathroom. It will make you dizzy. Also if you switch to liquid soap and throw your bar soap away your shower will stay a lot more scum free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"i wish i had read the reviews before my purchase. it did nothing as promised. do not buy, as you will be very sorry. it was a waste and took to much time. cleanned nothing. i'm taking mine back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a great book, and has helped me a lot.

It is so simple, and direct toward anyone who is going through really difficult times. After experiencing divorce and many other tough situations, God directed me to pick up this book and it focused on exactly what I needed to know and change in my life.Explains explicitly what forgiveness is and why we must practice it with everyone - even if they don't ask for it from us, because that is how God treats EVERYBODY! How this will release the power of God to change US and OUR CIRCUMSTANCES when we are thankful for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected","review":"Elegant in it's simplicity, profound in it's depth.I'm always cautious about books that friends say are 'must reads' for certain situations. We all have a desire for quick and easy answers and I find those to be more often shallow and distracting than actually helpful in addressing fundamental issues. So I was very reluctant to read this the first time it was suggested to me more than 20 years ago, but I did because I trusted the man who gave it to me, and I was desperately in need of hope...It's an easy read, but very hard to forget. It's still with me two-and-a-half decades later, and so is my family which was very much at risk during my 'hell' that led me to a place of listening.

Besides the PC, I've played versions for the PS2 and Nintendo 64. Upon seeing this for the Mac, I just about went nuts and ordered a copy. Nothing but disappointment since. I've tried running it on my older PPC Mac (OS 9.1), but it doesn't like my 3DFX card very much, the frame rate studders quite a bit, and the graphics have a washed-out look. Moving over to my more modern G4 Cube and OSX, the frame rate problem goes away, but the graphics are still very washed out with a 'gray' tone to them along with bad visual effects, like the explosions and hovercraft vapour trails. Network playability also only appears to work under OS 9.1, I haven't figured out how to get the option enabled under OSX. This is not the same quality game I remember from my earlier PC and console gaming days, so far just a big letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, terrible quality","review":"I love the idea of these frames. They seemed a wonderful gift idea, and I bought one for each of my pets and as gifts for a friend. The problem is that they are very poorly made. I have purchased 4 of these in the \\"natural\\" color. Every single one of the frames has fallen apart. Hang them on the wall and the cheap wood and poor construction can't handle the weight of the glass - the four pieces of wood that make the frame will begin to seperate from one another after less than a month and send the whole thing crashing to the floor. As soon as it hits the floor, the frame breaks off into four seperate pieces and you will be left with a mess. Wood glue and reinforcing with brackets doesn't work as the cheap wood just splits.If they were about half the price, I'd recommend buying them for the paw print kit, matting, etc, and purchasing a box frame seperately. But for $30 + shipping, these things are an incredible rip-off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product for a decent price.","review":"This is the second one of these that we have purchased. The item is just as described and works well for it's intended purpose. Note, the directions say it will be 'dry' in 24 hours, in reality, you should let it set a day or two longer and then gently mount it.

The book catches you up and sweeps you along in its flow. However, there are some rocks in that flow. Tom Clancy seems to consistently take only one side of all the issues at hand - and while this is common in thrillers, in this book it reaches extremes that almost sickened me. There is a general refusal to acknowledge that terrorists or rebels ever have a cause or a reason to do what they are doing other than greed. The IRA are portrayed as evil murderers without a shred of conscience, and the protagonist Jack Ryan frequently goes off into philosophical reflections on how horrible and evil terrorists are (e.g., they can't face a \\"real\\" army, they always murder innocents, etc.)It could be argued that thrillers cannot funciton without some bias, but I think Tom Clancy takes it too far."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's good historian","review":"tom clancy is an excellent historian and technical writer, but bad a fiction. His book on the special forces was so in depth, it was almost to much information. This book was a waste of his time. he should have used his time better by writing a history book then this. He just did it for the money like all his fiction. If your a military nut who has fantasies of being a secret agent of being in special ops, then Tom clancy is for you. If you're a reader who wants a book that is believable and has well developed characters then stay away. But that really only is my compliant, the story and the character. The movies are awesome but the books [are bad] (never thought I'd say that). Read michael crichton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good follow-up for Jack Ryan","review":"Clancy is faithful to the character he has created in Jack Ryan. Stpory is realistic but not futuristic. The vents a believable and plausable. He also does a good job of presenting Mrs Ryan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book, but spare me the right wing propaganda.","review":"I guess I shouldn't complain too much about Tom Clancy's books having a right wing bias. After all, there are plenty of other good authors out there who inject the opposite leanings into their works. Since I'm fashionably liberal myself, TC's political views tend to rub me the wrong way. Nevertheless, he still writes excellent thrillers, and Patriot Games is no exception. If you're new to Clancy's books, this is a good one to start with. One reason his stories are so good is that he always has things go wrong during tense situations. Someone's key piece of equipment fails or a communication is misunderstood, causing chaos. This brings a real-world flavor to his stories which make them quite believable. I thought this book had a good story and was exciting to the end. The development of Jack Ryan as a character is well done and continues throughout most of the other Clancy books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I love to read Tom Clancy and this would have to be my favorite book that I have read of his. Including The Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising. The characters are developed nicely such as the transition of Jack Ryan and his family. There's a balanced amount of action and setting of the plot. Theres also not as many technical details as in The Bear and the Dragon. All in all this is a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different Feel, But Still One of Clancy's Best","review":"This book seems to have a different feel than the other Jack Ryan novels. Not to say that it is bad, but just different. This book focuses on Ryan & Family, not Ryan & bad guys. I personally liked this difference a lot. It really let me get to understand and know the character Jack Ryan, while still maintaining an exciting story line and realistic events. An excellent book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Editiing Issues in the Kindle Edition","review":"I have always enjoyed Tom Clancy's work and Rainbow Six was the last printed version of any of his novels that I read. Fumbling with a thick and clumsy novel on the beach lead me to purchase a Kindle. I'll leave any editorial comments about style, etc. to those more eloquent than I, but I have begun to notice a number of typos in the Kindle edition of Patriot Games. Nothing really terrible, but I don't remember any of these in the printed editions. It appears that the publishers aren't quite as serious about ebooks as the printed ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clancy the unbeatable","review":"Once again Clancy delievers a bang up action thriller that is unbeatable by any other author. It is about a guy named John Ryan who thwarted a terrorist attack on England's Royal Family. He then has to come face to face with the realities of his heroism and suffers the consequences. His wife adn daughter are attacked by the ULA( Ulster liberation army) and he is having the Royal Family over for dinner! But all goes to hell when the dinner is interrupted by a group of uninvited guest, the ULA. Now John must fight to save not only his family, but once again the Royal Family! I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to keep up with this top notch action thriller! The action never stops!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clancy's best ever!","review":"Clancy did an excellent job following up on the intensity and action found in Red Storm Rising. This is an action-packed novel about Irish terrorists that get upset when Ryan foils one of their plots to assassinate the Prince of Wales and his wife. A renegade with in the group -- called the Ulster Liberation Front -- takes matters into his own hands, going after Ryan's daughter and wife. In the gripping final scene -- a boat chase on the Chesapeake in a vicious storm -- Clancy brings to the readers what he has become famous for: page-turning action and vivid detail"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE MOVIE SUCKED BUT THE BOOK IS SPECTACULAR!!","review":"I watched the movie before I read the book and when I read the book I had to go back and watch the movie again! What were they thinking when they made this movie?!?! The (movie) plot is all messed up and half the characters from the book aren't even there!! The ending was a real sham and Harrison Ford should be ashamed to even be in this movie. As for the book I found it refreshing after the techno jargon-riddled Hunt for Red October. I think this is one of my favorite Clancys because of the way he makes the terrorist's need for revenge the main focus of the book. A definite must-read in the Jack Ryan series."},{"rating":"2","title":"This a very exciting and suspensful book","review":"Tom Clancy writes another excellent book. You can hardly put it down. This is an exciting book that I think you will enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too simplistic","review":"Somebody mentioned Polly and the Princess. I could not write a more damning indictment. Of course, the british acted with \\"fair play, old boy\\" in northern Ireland, and the irish people are all foaming at the mouth terrorists, because they can't actually be anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute drivel.....","review":"What a pity that Amazon doesn't give people the opportunity to provide a list of their least favourite books. This undoubtably would top my list. It is complete pretentious and (from a British perspective) deeply patronising nonsense. The plot is laughably implausible and Jack Ryan's character is utterly one dimensional.I agree with a previous reviewer who gave credit to 'Hunt for Red October' and 'Red Storm Rising' for their technical content. But I'm afraid as a good storyteller, Clancy just doesn't cut it. For the ability to tell a good yarn I'd recommend Frederick Forsyth and John LeCarre anytime over this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patriot Games","review":"I thought Patriot Games was on OK book. It was really long, not that that matters, but it just droned on without really any plot to it. I didn't enjoy it as much as his other books and only would read another book of his because of Rainbow Six and the good reviews of that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy before he found his form.","review":"Having now read about 80 percent of Tom Clancy's books, I can say that this one is the worst. His finest skills have to do with his intricate knowledge of a wide variety of technical, procedural and military matters. The parts of the book where these skills shine are very interesting, such as the satellite surveillance scene. But most of the pages are dominated by characters interacting with each other emotionally, and Clancy's simplistic understanding of human emotion quickly reveals the vacuous dullness of his characters. They are stuck in a situation where they are incapable of action, and ACTION is one of the things Clancy is the master of. So if you like to read about some boring, whiny people waiting around for a terrorist to attack them in the final pages, then you'll enjoy this book. Otherwise, read Clear and Present Danger instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched Excess","review":"I enjoyed Hunt For Red October and Red Storm Rising for what they were -- pulp fiction with lots of action and enough juicy details about hardware and weaponry to satisfy a modern techno-fetish. Great literature they're not, but they're entertaining. But THIS...Clancy obviously read super-hero comic books when he was a kid. His Jack Ryan is unbelievably heroic. Scant pages into the book he's knighted by the Queen, and not long after that he's giving the Prince a pep talk and handing him back his manhood. (No, I'm not kidding.) Golly, that Jack knows everything and can do anything! Let's make him President!If you are a ten-year-old (or just think like one) you might like this book. If you're looking for something that doesn't insult your intelligence, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally awful","review":"What is wrong with Clancy with this one? I have read Rainbow Six and The Hunt for Red October and thoroughly enjoyed them but I had to force myself to read this one. It is totally awful. It is slow and British people do not speak the way that he says they do. I've never heard one say \\"chap\\". Do NOT waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy is better than this!","review":"The ending of this book provides the excitement, but the first half is barely digestable. I mean, really, Jack Ryan telling the Prince of Wales off, give me a break! Tom Clancy is a great storyteller, but this one is a major dud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this the actual first book in the Jack Ryan series.","review":"Some people, including me, start the Jack Ryan series with the story about Clark in WITHOUT REMORSE. Other say this is the first book about jack Ryan.Clancy takes us into the seemy world of ruthless Irish patriots who switch their anger and hate to our hero Jack Ryan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The start of the Jack Ryan story...","review":"Although we are introduced to Jack Ryan in Clancy's first novel \\"The Hunt For Red October\\", this is actually the start of the Jack Ryan story. From the first few pages, you are drawn into a scene involving an attempted kidnapping of a member of the Royal Family which is thwarted by Ryan (of course). From there on out, the rising action keeps you from being able to put the book down. Pay attention to all the detail in the middle pages of the book because they merely set the scene for the final few chapters that are quite simply ACTION PACKED! If you've seen the movie, forget about it. The movie doesn't do the book justice. I've read many books, but this one remains my favorite and it will take a great one to take over the top spot."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent edition to the Clancy Collection","review":"A great book that I loved. Although a little slow at first it picks up into a nail bitting finish. Its all about a man named Jack Ryan who stops terrorists from assasinating the prince and princess along with their child. One of the terrorists named Sean is about to go to prison when his terrorist buddies rescue him. He takes it personnely that Jack screwed up the mission and sets out to kill him and his family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patriot Games","review":"An excellent action adventure book. Clancy is very detailed but still keeps the reader wanting to turn the pages. His characters are real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware -- This has nothing to do with Football","review":"Read this through twice. No mention of the Superbowl."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it.","review":"I have the complete Jack Ryan series but during a move my copy of Patriot Games had gotten damaged so I ordered this on as a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read for a 1st Time Clancy Reader","review":"This was the first time I read a Clancy novel. I had heard that this was a good place to start as it is a prequel to \\"hunt for red october\\" and also isn't so technically deep as his other books. The book starts out fast and got me hooked; however, it slows way down for about 300 pages in the middle. There was a time when I thought about taking the book back to the library and said I wouldn't read another clancy book. I plowed through though, since I figured it had a lot of good reviews on here for a reason. Turns out I am happy that I did because all of the boring dialogue and plot build-up pays off in the end as the last 100 pages or so were a real page turner.If you start it, make sure to finish it as you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really the Second novel in the Jack Ryan Series(Great tho)","review":"Believe it or not this is the Second Novel of the jack Ryan Series. The first one is Without Remourse which he only has a small part. Amazon.com does not list all the Jack Ryan Novel. Okay now this is a really great novel. It's about when Jack was in London one of the royal family members and his family were attacked by memebers of the URA.(I think that's the name) and Jack killed the one guys brother(Like in the movie) and so he targets jack and his Family. Unlike the the movie at the end the were are on the boat and Jack and Robby went and got on a coast graund boat(Didn't tell what type of boat) and Sean Miller, Kevin O'Donnell(Only two left) were both arrested. This is better then th movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!","review":"This is Clancy's best! Reads like a movie. Constan suspense. In this book, more than in all others, we get to see what Ryan is made of"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long book, with little action","review":"If you are looking for an action packed book, this isn't the one for you. There are some very good action sequences in the book. But most of the time it just about Jack Ryan sitting around thinking about the terrorists.The beginning of the book starts out with a good action scene with an assination attempt on the British royal family. What comes after that was mind numbing. Pages and pages were written about Ryan being laying in a hospital bed. The rest of the book has a few action scenes, but not enough to really keep my attention for long.If action is important in your decision to buy a book, then this really isn't the one. But if you are a fan of Clancy, this one is worth the read to be able to compare it to his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book","review":"While the book was as advertised, hard bound, I wasn't aware of exactly what a turtle back was. Whne th book showed up, it was indeed hardbound, but the size of a paperback. I can't fault the vendor for my ignorance though. The service was prompt and the product was in the condition advertised"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Clancy's Bunch","review":"Every time I re-read Patriot Games I find a couple of more irregularities, but over all it's a great book. Full of action, but no lacking in character development.The irony of going back to early Clancy works is how it blows away his latest effort Rainbow Six. This makes me think he simply tried to bang out Six in as a marketing tool for the accomanying PC game."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is great!","review":"Patriot Games is about the terroism in Great Britian and it also gives Jack Ryan a history. During a terroist attack Jack Ryan just happens to be in the area of the royal family and jumps in front a shot from the terroists. He is shot in the shoulder but is hired by the family has a bodyguard. This book is slow at the begining of the book but speeds up at the end. If you liked the other books in the Jack Ryan seires you should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I found this video excellent not only for the DIP's, Lift's and solo's lessons, but because the lady's fabulous technique it's a plus, she dances so good that you can learn many from her technique.

(1) instructions to match transmitter to receiver are not very clear (probably written by someone whose native tounge is not english). (2) seems like the pairing of the receivers to the transmitter has to be done more often than should be. maybe because the battery in the transmitter was dying???

I know it's meant for a starter level on Paganism, but I was expecting the reading level itself to be higher toned. I got the impression throughout the book that the writer was addressing a child, possibly a very young teen ager.

If you're looking for introductory books, there are definitely better ones out there than this one - though this is certainly not the worst I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting","review":"This book was exactly what I needed! It is a simple story with a simple message.

Some get angry and turn away, but others recognize their own need and are open to Christ. In this way Sam, and the others that begin to witness with him, learn how to do the work of a true Christian. The message of the story though, is that Sam, nor anyone else, does not have to know a persons specific need in order to witness, all that is needed is the knowledge that Christ is the answer.

The author bases his \\"information\\" on 60 year old meetings, and the readers are supposed to believe that his famous subjects revealed (to someone they just met) their deepest, darkest secrets. Did it happen? Perhaps, but I'd like to see some proof, any proof, for some of his wilder rumors.

We have so many great scientists, bankers, businessmen, politicians, artists,musicians... who are Jews!Watch this movie and there is a clue. The strict adherence to tradition is awfully hard and their parents' of expectations from and requirements of their offsprings are equally shocking. No wonder some of them, like the main supporting character in this film, would refuse even to talk even when they are already five-- they are made to recite long and incomprehensible scripts at such an early age. Was that the reason why Einstein started to talk only at five? Little wonder that those who passed such hurdles are different.So what is the message in this film? Better get localized, goes drifting along and borne by the air as the heroine in this film, rather than get drowned like the five years old?

Was it worth the wait? You bet! Rarely does a movie grab your attention from the start and pull you into it's beauty and morality as this movie has. It is especially intriguing for persons who have any ties to Holocaust rememberances (or desperate means of forgetting) and to the Jews who remained in Europe after the war. The short moral of this movie is about a young girl in Antwerp, Belgium during the 1970's who has no knowledge or regard for her families tragic background. The big picture though unfolds when she spends time with a four year old boy and his ultra orthodox family who show her what she is, who she is, and ultimately the importance of where she came from.

This movie does the same with a beautiful mixture of harsh, bizarre and touching moments, and the occational stunningly poetic vignette; Like when Matt Dillion is told there's no smoking in a tiny room of a massive warehouse where he's just found work. As soon as the foreman leaves he opens a small window and begins to smoke. The camera then pans away from the outside (to some of Buks prose) to reveal one tiny solitary window on the massive side of the bleak brick building.In the end we are all alone but you can still enjoy the poem."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think this movie really misses the point.","review":"I've been a long time fan of Charles Bukowski's work and i was sadly disappointed with Factotum. I think Matt Dillon is a great actor but this movie just doesn't work. To me, this movie came off as if it were the 'Coles Notes' of Bukowski's work and unfortunately flows like a high school book report. I think Matt Dillon was way to polished for the part of Bukowski and because of it Hank came off almost completely devoid of passion and wit. Matt's performance regrettably does not touch his incredible work done in \\"Drugstore Cowboy\\" or any other one of his many great roles. I think some great talents were cast and i don't want to take anything away from them but this movie simply doesn't work. If you're a Bukowski fan and you haven't already seen 'Barfly', i would defiantly recommend it over this."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder Bukowski hated movies","review":"I love Bukowski's writing. I couldn't put the book Factotum down. On the other hand, I couldn't wait for the movie Factotum to end. I don't think it captured the spirit of Bukowski one bit, unless we are to believe that his life was slow and boring. I am quite sure that there was rarely a boring day in the life of Charles Bukowski. As far as Matt Dillon goes, with the exception of a the make-up job to make him look like Bukowski, I'm not sure there is any depth to his performance at all. His readings sound like a bad imitation of \\"An American Prayer\\" and he's completely stoic on screen.

At 94 mins, you feel like it is never going to end and you keep waiting for a story line to develop. It doesn't. All I got from it is Alcoholism ruins lives. Yeah, I know that.

Hamer's take on Bukowski is so far off, that it's almost comical. This film offers nothing revealing about Bukowski, his life, and his art. Everything about this is just plain wrong. Everything is just a bit too clean. The setting is modern day, which doesn't lend credibility to the basic storyline of the original novel. Even the soundtrack is completely wrong. Well, at least Hamer is consistent in his ineptitude of the subject matter. Dillon's performance? Whatever. To say this was a disappointment is an understatement.

If you're going to make a book out of something like FACTOTUM, you should at least be able to create something far more effective than this. While Dillon was really, really good in his portrayal of Bukowski, the rest of the movie is something of a train wreck. You never know where you're standing if you're unfamiliar with Buk's writing, and one feels completely let down if you are an admirer of the vast spread of Charles Bukowski's stories, novels, essay, and poems.Don't waste your time.

First, the press base, filter screen, and rotating plates that form the flavor lock are thin and flimsy. You can almost cut yourself by simply handling them by their edges. The Bodum parts are much more solid. Further the flavor lock is just a gimmick. There are no currents circulating through the pressed grounds on a unit without the feature to over-brew the coffee anyway. The flavor lock is a solution to an invented problem. Second, the glass was secured in the frame so tightly that it cracked the first time boiling water was poured in.

The design of the press makes it difficult to keep the stainless steel frame for the carafe clean of water minerals without taking it apart and upping your chances of breaking it. If you lay your plunger on a counter or table, it has the tendency to roll off. The ball on the plunger unscrewed causing difficulty threading on the flange to the filter and realignment of the filter. (My husband put it in a vice to tightened the ball enough to thread the flange on the filter.) The press is top heavy. If the ball (top unit) would roll off and drop on your toes, it might break a toe. As for the filter that open and closes, to stop brewing. Come on! I have tried it both ways.....

Eddings created realistic economies varying from the manorial system of Arendia to the imperial power of Tolnedra. I thought the system of magic lacked some. The Will and the Word is a very creative idea, however I feel it gives the sorcerors(esses) too much power to be able to anything. But otherwise Eddings is a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Going Strong","review":"Well, David Edding does it again!! His characters become so real to the reader that you feel like slapping Ce'Nedra, you feel like telling Silk that if he pulls any more stunts you're going to turn him into a radish and you feel like giving Garion a big hug and telling him that of course his Aunt Pol still loves him! I just wish David Eddings was as immortal as Belgarath so that he keeps turning out more sagas like the Belgariad and the Mallorean! These books are my talismans and in my opinion every household should have a set."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beginning","review":"\\"The Belgariad\\" began it all for me. Before this, I was rather put off by fantasy books, and I never felt the desire to start reading any. But to my delight, I found this to be an immensely interesting experience. Eddings's prose flows smoothly, and the adventures of Garion and friends have helped me spend many otherwise sluggish evenings. On the whole, this is a highly readable series. If you are not looking for the kind of intricately detailed writing by authors like Tolkein or Jordan, this is your best bet! Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Orb chase.A knight, an archer, a telepathic horse whisperer, a bratty princess, a couple of grumpy sorcerers, and, of course, the farm boy with super powers.A-questing they will go.

Although the series can be somewhat predictable, it remains an enjoyable read and one of my favorite fantasies. Eddings has a knack for producing interesting characters who have complex interpersonal relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"**YAWN**","review":"Once again, Eddings succeeds in boring the reader to tears. Yes, there are new characters, but sadly, they are once again predictable and one dimensional. Book 2 is again a monotonous drawn out journey with the same pompous conversation repeated at each stop. More whining and amazingly predictable perfect timing from the irritating and completely unlikable main character. Even if you had never read another fantasy book, or seen any Hollywood movies, I am sure you would still be able to predict everything in this book. Eddings has the remarkable ability to take small hints and turn them into large cement blocks that he repeatedly bashes you in the head with. Then he expects you to be surprised when he reveals whatever the hint was leading up to. Honestly, he insults the reader.My only solace in forcing myself through these ghastly reads is that I did not buy the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not if you are over 12 years","review":"Do not even think of putting your money on this one if you have aged out of the world of paper-thin characters and nintendo kind of plot.

Apparently it's not enough for him to be the secret survivor of the Rivan royal line, but he needs a good dose of sorcery as well. He talks to the little voices inside his head as well, which is often preferable to talking to those around him. Back where I come from, setting people on fire is not considered socially acceptable, but apparently in fantasyland it's okay if the bad guy is evil enough.This book is no better or worse than the ones before or after it, regrettably."},{"rating":"2","title":"high adventure","review":"Many people think David Eddings is overly formulaic which he is a bit but since I enjoy the tale he tells I do not mind reading it over again. His characters always have great humor at their core and you can't beat a good epic tale for entertainment value. This particular book is one of my favorites by him."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Horse Is Out Of The Gate.","review":"More of his ultimate destiny is revealed as Garion under the protection of his Aunt Pol begins to grapple with the extraordinary powers that are at his beck and call. Filled with action and political intrigue, Wolf and Pol struggle desperately to stop the Orb of Aldur from reaching the wrong hands and destroying the world. Sure at times some of the minor characters become interchangeable and a bit one dimensional, and Garion seems beyond naive and almost dumb sometimes with his wide eyed innocence. Still, the formula works, and in this book the plot has finally taken off with a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent production from an excellent Pastor","review":"Dr. James Nestingen Has made an excellent resource for both people who are seeking personal spirituality in prayer or for those who are seeking to teach prayer and meditation in a group setting. Dr. Nestingen's years of experience as a pastor and a professor have led to this very high quality work on prayer that is simple and understandable to all people, even those who are not keeping up on church vocabulary and literature.

He captures their spirit in a most amazing way, using them as a means to express himself on another level. At the begining of the book, Jim Dine mentions that emotions are used as a medium, in this specific case, it was anger. Anger at not being able to produce, yet trying anyway.These portrait studies were done using various mediums such as pastel, oil paint, pepsi cola, charcoal, and other untraditional mediums.

Without enough transitional filler to make it understandable, it was just a jumble of nonsense. Another disappointing part is that she falls in the love with, of course, a prince who we never know for sure if he is a jerk or a nice guy.

Went off after the five minutes. Came on again. It does this over and over for no reason I can see. There's nothing to cause it to come on. I tried all the settings and adjustments available.

Even with whatever erection I managed to achieve, there was little sensitivity, so climaxing became a real chore.After trying Passion RX w/Yohimbe for about two weeks now (5 per week - two on, one off, then three on, one off), I do feel a heightened sensitivity. No, it hasn't created an erection on it's own, I still need Viagra for that.

They're good build quality, but the hardware wouldn't hold the panniers onto the rack. Even with bungee cords, the hooks would let go over pretty small bumps. Obviously, a simple locking hook would solve this problem.After contacting SunLite's customer service, I was given the run-around. They refused to address the issue, offering only to let me return it to them at my expense. They said they would fix it if it was a warranty issue, but offered no hope that they would address the obvious design flaw. If they saw nothing wrong with it, they would simply return the unusable bags back to me.I love to give glowing reviews, but I simply can't recommend a company that hides from responsibility like that. I just want to try to save others from wasting their money on a potentially poor purchase from a company that clearly doesn't value service, or their products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small simple good panniers","review":"These are good, simple, smaller panniers. They hold a decent amount of stuff and seem well made. I don't understand other people's mounting problems - they have four straps and clip/buckles that let you attach it to the corners of your rack and they have very simple cords with hooks that come down the wheel-side of each bag which clip to the bottom of the rack. If your rack isn't compatible with them it could cause grief, but it works beautifully for me. It has never fallen off - although it is also not a fast bag to remove or attach either.My wife and I have now used them for several hundred miles of \\"light weight\\" touring with no problem.

I have both other brands and they are excellent, well-made tools, but the workmanship and the quality of the Spirit is second to none! Tight tolerances, super locks, SOLID! What's the caveat, you may ask? I was looking for a tool that was lighter than my Gerber 400 Fisherman's tool at 7.2 ounces. I was leaning towards the Kick or Fuse, but ran into the Victorinox - advertised at 3.25 inches and 5.75 ounces. It's actually 4.20 inches and 7.50 ounces so, while a little lighter than the Wave, an ultralight tool it ain't.

I found the Canterville Ghost a fun and touching story. Very well done.An American family moves into Canterville Chase and are met with a ghost. Instead of being terrified by the spirit, the ghost is tormented by them!! I chuckled often during the first few chapters. Later I felt sorry for the ghost, Sir Simon.

It is a sad history, but there is a happy ending.There you see the different between the serious spiritual English people and the practical American people.You can see the similarity between the story and the writer. Oskar Wilde has had a very difficult live, and in his story is the ghost a thing, which have a bad live.I think it is a good book for read at school, because it is a good English.

When I saw the book was available on Kindle, I remembered that I had seen the black-and-white movie on television several years ago and thought it was delightful.

Sometimes it is used all the way down at table height, as a writing table. Sometimes all the way up for stand up work. A few times in the middle. Easily moves in and out as needed. The cup holder places are not necessary for me, but the lip around the edge keeps things (laptop) from sliding off and presumably contains liquid spills.

I've read other Susan Andersen books and enjoyed them, but found this almost impossible to even finish.After setting up a contrived situation, the author went on to create flat, stereotypical characters. Although the characters kept finding new depths in each other, I saw no development at all in any of the main characters. Every major event was completely predictable from the foreshadowing. The future ambassador (the third major character) had no personality save that used to drive Nick & Daisy towards the all too predictable ending. I love romances, but this was a total waste, only finished since I had nothing else new to read in the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"book junk food","review":"i read this years ago and recently re-read it and realized that the writing is very unrealistic. the character daisy's dialogue in particular (her \\"just a girl from the 'burbs\\" routine) is particularly bad. overall the chemistry is great, there are some funny parts involving nick and the drag queen best friends. great for a beach vacation, then leave it at the hotel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"Totally boring and unrealistic...could not believe Susan Andersen even wrote this book.

So full points for marketing - the cover, the synopsis, they work well.However the story was really, well, un-romantic for starters. I didn't warm to either Nick or Daisy, didn't really care what happened to them and didn't fall in love with anyone in the book. Actually, I was really disappointed with the book, it seemed to be unacceptably formulaic, and Anderson has written far better books.I just hope the next one is back up to her usual standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the standards of Susan Andersens past work.","review":"This book disappointed me. The characters were so flat and lifeless that I had a hard time sympathizing with anyone. The secondary characters and sub plot felt thrown in just to give the hero and heroine an excuse to act reckless. And all of the secondary characters were too stereotypical. The thugs, the gay friends; no one struck me as realistic. I kept reading, hoping it would improve, unfortunately it never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to even finish","review":"First of all, I had a problem with the way Nick left Daisy after taking her virginity in the beginning of the book, never to speak to her again, very callous, huh? Then, years later, they meet and he hires her to be his bodyguard. Someone does a person like this and they expect to trust them to guard their life! Not to mention the guy kept calling her Blondie really annoyed me a lot. I mean she does have a name. She was annoying too. Of course the sparks started flying and they made it several times, in vast detail, but it was very empty and unloving and unsexy. After every time she was like 'don't tell me you love me' blah blah and by the time it finally got real, it felt forced. I like slow buildup and true tension and chemistry and this book, in my opinion had neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Nine years after a one night stand that ended badly, Nick Coltrane and Daisy Parker meet again.

Nick was annoying, Daisy was more annoying and the two seemed to only have sex between them. Boring. I hope her next book is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is my first Susan Andersen book and I got it because she seems to be on everybody's must-read list, and I'd heard so much about how great her books are. One reviewer even said that Andersen's writings reminded her of Susan Elizabeth Phillips'. So with that in mind I rented this book. But I have to say, this book does not even begin to live up to its hype. The characters are unlikeable and lack depth, the dialogue uninteresting and getting through those first few chapters was such a bore until I finally gave up. It just seems to me like this book was written without real effort and just for the sake of meeting her deadline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this supposed to seem like a cartoon?","review":"I want to start off by saying that Susan Andersen is on my automatic buy list, so even if the book description sounds kind of silly, I still expect Ms. Andersen to make it work. I cannot explain how disappointed I was in this book. It was so unrealistic that at times I was picturing cartoon characters. I've read almost everything of hers that I can get my hands on. Some of her other books I have given 5 stars (books like Obsession or All Shook Up). The only reason that I gave this book even 1 star is because it did include her trademark steamy love scenes. I normally finish a book this size in 1 or 2 days, but \\"Baby, Don't Go\\" took me over two weeks to muddle through. I definitely don't recommend this book, even if you are a fan of her other work.

I found myself saying, \\"Enough Already\\"! I wouldnt waste my time on this book. Plot and reality are missing in this book and the characters were too way out there in that boy/girl, shes masculine and hes just too pretty way. I kinda had the feeling the guy was a major wimp!

Two differences that I see are 1) the product I received was black, not green as shown in the picture and 2) the package I received was marked 7 lbs. on the cardboard box that it arrived in. The netting or fencing or whatever it is feels more like 2 or 3 pounds, the cardboard box (big) makes up the difference.

The deer have gone through the fencing several times. It rips quite easy. We cut a piece and patch it over the rip with zip ties. It doesn't look pretty. I wish we had gone with a stronger deer fence. We will probably have to take all this down and replace it with something better. Also when installing, one half is straight and the other half is on an angle. The squares are not lined up straight. Makes it harder to install. Maybe it was a defect in the rolls we received. So if you have deer that want to come through they will with no problem. We watched one the other night come running, jump through one side and straight through the other side as if it wasn't there. If they want to come through they will."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good..","review":"I got this deer fence to use around a vegetable garden to stop deer from making a meal of it. The fence was easy to cut to length and install. The material was thinner than what I expected, but time will tell as to how durable it actually is. A friend of mine installed a similar fence last year and it is still going strong. I'll be more than happy if the fence lasts for at least 5 years.Although it is labelled as a deer barrier, I will most likely use the material as bird netting to cover fruit trees as well.Update (June 10, 2011)----------------------It has been over a year since we installed the fence. Still up and doing a good job of keeping deer away from our vegetable garden. We know this for sure because we see a lot of deer tracks just outside the fence!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kept getting WRONG item!","review":"I have purchased the deer barrier FENCING before (about a year ago) without any issues. HOWEVER, this time, when the item arrived, it was the WRONG item - it was deer NETTING - these are entirely different products. The netting is 1/3 the cost of the fencing and lightweight - the fencing is much more heavy duty. So, I returned the product hoping that with a replacement, I would get the correct item. No, not so lucky. For the second time, I received the incorrect product. The AMAZON LABEL was correct but the ITEM was not - someone put the wrong Amazon label on the product so I am sure that is why I got the wrong item for the second time. The PLUS in all of this is that Amazon is FANTASTIC in the return process. They make it easy to do returns without much hassle at all. I just wish the correct item was possible to acquire.

When I finished I wanted to call Ms. Berg or e-mail her or anything just to make sure she's busy writing another book. I can't wait another 2 years to read her. She touches the reader in so many ways and she says things you want to write down and savor. She says things you want to show other people. So once again I say Buy this book to keep after you read it and buy an extra to give to someone you love and who loves to read. Also, if by any chance you should ever read this, Ms. Berg please don't wait so long for the next one we all need it soon and thanks for them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible-don't waste your money!","review":"This book was terrible.

The book is comprised of fourteen very short stories, none of which seem to have any real purpose or substance. With the exception of three stories, \\"Martin's Letter to Nan,\\" \\"Regrets Only\\" and \\"One Time at Christmas,\\" the stories read like the ramblings of a tormented soul. I always try to find something positive to say about a book. In this case the only positive comment I can come up with is \\"thank goodness the book was short and ended quickly.\\" What more can one say other than it was a tremendous disappointment and fell far short of Berg's usual writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"A brief taste, but no substance","review":"Elizabeth Berg books are a treat to be savored and \\"Ordinary Life\\" had all the promise of another delight. All the necessary parts are there, characters who ring true, family dynamics, true to ear dialogue.....but this book falls short. With all these pluses, it is all tossed into a thrown together book that seems more like some story outlines, not actual stories. Each story is brief, too brief and each one suffers from the brivity. There is no opportunity to develop each story, just a scrap here and there......This book is a disappointment, perhaps because I have come to expect more. This is like Elizabeth Berg lite.

The slower cars supposedly have better handling and strength, but the steering is awful and randomly sticky, and no matter how \\"strong\\" your car is supposed to be, you can barely budge your racing opponents, while they can absolutely manhandle you at will. This gets aggravating because they can knock you into barriers and spin you around, but they almost always land facing forward. So speed is the only strategy that really works. If you try to bang with the other cars you don't stand much of a chance. It makes for a pretty one dimensional game. If there was a better balance between the cars' attributes this could have been a much better game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"This product is terrible.

In my opionion if there are going to be police in a game, it needs to be possible for them to arrest you.3)You can only be the cop in 2 player mod and even then it is just like a normal race.

It has been reported by William Friedkin that Mercedes McCambridge refused to grant her permission and that project never made it to light. This record, which has been around since the Seventies, contains maybe only two pieces that made it into the film. The rest of the music is new classical: dense, discordant, intense and mostly unpleasant. Some will appreciate the talent involved, but it is not the sort of music most people would want to listen to while reading or dusting the house. Whether or not it might have worked in the film is beside the point. It wasn't, and so calling this recording a motion picture soundtrack is misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would you like to scare yourself?

Apparently, it did not at all cover 9th grade material and did not set the bar high enough. However, I am sure it can match elementary to middle school standards. It is unbelievable and absurd how the publisher can actually dare to distribute this straightforward material. When I took the STAR test, I noticed 95% of the practice questions (given in the workbook) were not at all alike compared to the real deal.

It covers only material learned in elementary school and middle school. The reading comprehension is much too easy and is at a 6th grader level.I would never recommend this book to anyone.

It happens to be just so amazing within his long time career. That seems to be great and all, but it also comes with a powerful side of it too. That comes the way with Believe, the first single from Elton John's 1995 record, Made In England. The song seems to have a similarity that was captured within John Lennon's Imagine, as Bernie Taupin felt about it. Arguably, it still shows that people have to listen to Elton's music because it is truly made to believe. Hopefully, he will keep making good ones like this all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"great live versions","review":"\\"Believe\\" was the best song from \\"Made In England.\\" Song with emotional urgency by Elton with a great string arrangement by Paul Buckmaster, it holds up as one of his great anthems.The extra songs are wonderful.

With the actors involved (Martin Clunes and Julie Graham), this show should have been good.......and with Mary a midwife and William an undertaker, there should have been some great story lines. However, for me it just wasn't there. The stories were more annoying than entertaining. The teenagers involved were not interesting, just disgusting kids, and the relationship between William and Mary was not worth the time spent. Between William and Mary's love life and their not-so-good-looking naked bodies, the low-life teenagers, the high-brow/low-brow relationship between the main characters, and the more-than-annoying women in the throes of childbirth, I feel that this series is a waste of time.

It's a great story where love conquers all in spite of everyone's flaws and all the obstacles in the way. Julie Graham and Martin Clunes also have great chemistry together, which certainly enhances the fun of watching this series.

Have never done this before. Yes, there are questions left, but really are for the writers: there is clarity about William's [deceased] wife in just a few lines, enough said. But not a clue about what Mary saw in the father of her children or in her last boyfriend [would hate to think she always makes poor choices since that would be an inditement of William, and we can't have that]; or why she would [working single mother that she is] have paid a dating service 700 pounds. As the writing is excellent I know the answers could have been worked into the script. The characters grow [including up], evolve, are \\"real\\" without being dysfunctional. There is comedy, but the comedy of life rather than pratfall slapstick, which the Brits can do in embarrassing abundance. To describe William as a \\"lonely undertaker\\" does no service or credit to the role. Makes him seem one-dimensional and wierd. The acting is superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"William and Mary","review":"If you enjoy watching the show on television, and even if you haven't seen it yet, it is one of the most wonderfully written, acted and directed shows around.

The main characters are real people and very likable; the writing is good; the juxtaposition of his career as an undertaker and hers as a midwife is poignant and thought-provoking.What I really hated was that they rushed their relationship so fast and that they slept together from the first date - and in every other episode that I have seen. I'm enough of a traditional fuddy-duddy that I think it's a good idea to get to know someone well and marry them before you hop into bed with them. I realize that doesn't happen often in real life anymore, and even less on TV, but I still think it might have been better to delay it a bit in this show. The relationship might have developed more interestingly if it had been allowed to progress more slowly. I also was very tired, by episode 4, of the bad attitudes and mouthiness of the teenagers.I enjoyed the show, to a degree, and wanted to love it but didn't because of these factors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incisive and In-Depth Indeed","review":"I came across insight as a student studying abroad in Windhoek.

I like how it is often fearlessly critical of the SWAPO government and the journalism awards they have won are well deserved.

They sound like the speakers are blown. I didn't even have them real loud so I don't understand.Quality wise these outrageously priced headphones are no better than 30 or 40 dollar ones.

Not even worth 30 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Earbuds, questionable cable durability","review":"These are great buds. I'm no audiophile, but I wanted some good-sounding all metal buds for not too expensive and these fit the bill perfectly. The sound quality and bass is awesome. I have comply foam tips and they make these headphones even better.My only gripe is that the cable's connections seem weak where they enter the buds and the plug. I wish the plug was L shaped instead of straight, I'm worried about the durability.Maybe they are more durable than they seem, but for the price, the sound quality on these is amazing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Went defective in 5 days with less than 4 hrs of usage","review":"I purchased these babies during a sale for around $55 bucks from Amazon. Within prompt arrival of these earphones, I compared them to my 0.99c earphones and noticed that something's not right...cause my 0.99c earphones along with my other under-$10 pairs were sounding as much as 3-4 times much louder than these Monster Turbines. I thought that it probably just needed a few weeks of break-in time before they sound better. But during 5 days of minimal usage (45 mins a day)...I started to notice that the max volume kept getting lower and that the bass kept getting flater. On the 5th and final day all the vocals started to sound like chipmunks with some harsh distortion associated with it. Kinda obvious to even a non-audiophile that these turbines have failed. Sad, cause I really had high hopes for the the sturdy construction. Guess I got unlucky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype. Hype. Hype.","review":"Borrowed these from a disgruntled friend for a week and compared them to my $79.99 Sennheisers. There was absolutely no comparision, none. Where my trusty Sennheisers sound robust and crisp, these Monster buds sounded like state fair speakers buried under wet mud. Awful.Unfortunately, free markets have to tolerate companies like Monster who make sub-quality products, and cloak them in elite-quality hype. While it's up to you what you want to spend $150 on, I hope that this review prevents one regretful decision.Go with Senneheisers if you're going to spend the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monster Turbine High-Performance In-Ear Speakers","review":"The sound quality was good with these earbuds, until they broke! These earbuds are very cheap quality and broke the second time I put them in my ear. The dark0 gray, back casing just separated from the part where you put your ear in, and guess what??? There was just a small amount of glue holding it together. I expected more from Monster, which is usually a brand that makes a good name for itself, but this time, they let me down. Also, these are the old models and do not come with the thing to hold your two wires together when you are listening to music. I would not recommend this to anyone unless they want a good sound paired with very cheap quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money","review":"Pros: Amazing clarity: Highs, Mids, LowsCons: These particular \\"In-Ear Speakers\\" are more like \\"In-Ear -> I can't barely hear\\" I have to manually increase the output level of every single song to 75% in my iTunes library and have the volume turned all the way up to hear the music at a loud enough level.If you like loud music and please do not consider these \\"In-Ear Speakers\\". The ear buds that came with my iPod are louder and more audible than these. I even had a pair of Bose that were at least 100x times louder than these and sounded great. I don't know how this product has good ratings from anyone. I was excited for these because of all the positive reviews. I'm probably just going to throw these in the trash, because they are that bad. Waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Earphone sound AMAZING!!! But..","review":"As soon as I took it out of the box, the product was defective. It did not emit sound from one of the earphones and I already shipped them back and I am waiting for a refund.For a few minutes the sound did come back on and I was blown away by the sound, it is so much clearer and enhances the music experience!! I was going to order another pair and return these but instead I asked for a refund, it is too much trouble to be doing this constantly if the earphones are just going to be breaking..SO far, no refund and I shipped them back a week ago. I WILL Update on the refund to let others know about how responsive this seller is and how fastI just received my refund. It took about a week so that was amazing and fast. Thank you so much Amazon, this has been a better experience than Ebay! =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overprced","review":"I usually don't waste my time filling out product reviews, but since I fell for the hype and advertising I thought that I'd post this to forewarn others who might be as gullible as I was. I'm a professional musician and college music faculty member who has good training with what acoustic music is supposed to sound like. If a musician gives a bad performance in recital, audience members might say (instead of complimenting the music) \\"what a nice dress you have on tonight!\\" That being said, these earphones LOOK Terrific.I bought a $5 pair with a mic to use with my i-phone that sound as well. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"iiiiiiight, good for the $58 i paid.","review":"iight, so i copped these along with the beat solo hd's and the beats studios. the beats solo hd's r the best to me, studfios are the loudest.... but these have the highest highs and the clearest vocals, but no bass really. there good if you dont like alot of bass, these are deff hot. highs = 10/10, mids = 8/10, lows = 5/10 - not alot of bass, but u can tell its there, nice quailty, i wouldnt pay more then $60, i got them on a lightening deal on amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"No specs","review":"As with all other pricy Monster Cable products, there are no published specifications (efficiency, bandwidth, etc.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"Wow just purchased these and they are great.The best thing about them is the balance between the highs and lows its perfect in my opinion.I use them with my creative zen xfi2.One of the best players for sound quality in my opinion.Thanks Monster I know have my perfect combination for my music listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy customer","review":"When I heard about these earphones, I was a little skeptical but after owning them for a month, I must say that this is one of the good purchases I've made. They sound great and I'm happy with my purchse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay Headphones","review":"These headphones sounds pretty good but I've encountered some problems. First they are quite heavy so they fall out kind of easy. Secondly the right earbud cord is shorter than the left so you can constantly feel a tugging on that cord compared to the left. Combining this with the heavy weight and the right earbud falls out very easily. Also the left earbud is bassier that the right which is really annoying when listening to techno, dubstep, or other genres with heavy or a lot of bass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good treble. Ok Bass","review":"First of all, I'm a metal lover. I listen to music with extreme intensiveness, high distortion and lightning fast. And this review is heavily based on my own experience.First you'll be very disappointed this earphone produces relatively poor bass. You won't be satisfied if you listen to metal genres that go heavy on bass like Power, Black, etc.But if you are acoustic type, such as piano or classic guitar, this earpiece would be great. You can really feel the vibration of the sound.So it would be up to your music preference. I do not advise this for metal folks, you should stick to something that has sound isolation, not this one. But overall it produces nice sound quality for most of folks. If you still listen to Backstreet Boys sometimes like me, you'll may love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING SOUNDING HEADPHONES","review":"These Headphones ARE AMAZING!!! I listened to one of the songs I play when I get knew headphones or speakers, a song I have heard hundreds of times by the way, and I heard new things on it. I use them for motivation to work out. these HeadSpeakers are one of my best investments in a while. The bass is really booming, great mids and treble. I used to have the Altec Lansing UHP106 Backbeat which are $30 at best buy. until I got the Monster Turbines the Altec lansing ones were the best I had owned. The Turbines Blow them away. No pun intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for a year","review":"Ive had these for a little over a yr. they worked great up until a few days ago. All the sudden I noticed the bud seemed to be a little loose. The next time I wore them they just fell apart. I cant figure out what happened. For the money these things should last a lot longer than 2 yrs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sound.","review":"I bought this together with the ten dollar V-Moda and at first, I was disappointed. It sounds pretty good but hardly any bass. But as I keep using it, it keeps getting better and now I think it's worth the money. The sound is crisp and the bass is what it should be. Not a very good noise cancelling feature but good enough for my purpose. I bought this because I don't like listening to people screaming on their cell phone. It works. The leads are rubberized so it does not kink or or get tangled up. Good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely!!!","review":"I've never owned a pair of head phones that cost more than $25, but when I saw these on sale for $58 I decided to give them a shot. When I opened them, I was pleasantly surprised at how well they were packaged; the box is high quality as is everything that comes with it. The sound blew me away, the clarity is amazing, and the bass is powerful but not overpowering. The little rubber tips that come with it are absolutely sooooo comfortable; they send a wide variety of them so if you cannot find any that fit your ears right, you probably have craters for ears. Overall I feel that monster really delivered on this product. I would definately recommend these to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, I really liked it.","review":"I enjoyed listening to this head phone through my ipod. I could hear all the small detail, and the quality of the wires also looks very good. When used properly the head phone provides a nice noise isolation. I'm only concerned about the plug as it is not ninety degree there is chance that it will break. I have only had this headphone for a week, and I'm loving it so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds great - while they last","review":"The first set lasted 3 weeks so customer service sent out a new pair. 2 months later (used in an office environment) and the left ear just went out. I used a pair of Bose for several years before replacing them with these so I don't think I'm the cause for the failures. They sound great when working but my experience with these leaves me looking for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"Do not get me wrong these are good in-earphones and bass is really amazing. However there are several caveats.(1)Around the ear pieces are very flimsy and can easily snap off;(2)You have to achieve a good-fit or seal with the provided plugs to hear the truly remarkable bass reproduction. Once you achieve the seal these earphones are extremely uncomfortable in your ear canal. They are not quite conducive to extended listening. I often listen to radio while in bed and these earphones were remarkably uncomfortable for extended use.(3) I also used them once in the plane and it turned out to be a very bad idea. These snug fits in your ear canal are not quiet good for changes in air pressure.(4) Each time I use these ear phones it is a struggle to get the right fit.I would recommend IE2 Bose headphones any day! Agreed the base reproduction for Bose is not quite as good. But what is the use if can't use these phones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money....","review":"These were really great earbuds when I first got them but in less than two weeks the right ear went out in sound. I did get new ones from the company but the ones that they sent did the same thing except it was the left one this time. The sound is great yes, but it's not worth buying. They break super fast and trying to get a new par took two months to get. I'm going back to my old earbuds. They may be ten dollars but at least they don't break as fast. This was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Buds","review":"These are excellent buds that produce outstanding sound. For the price I would reccommend them for anyone who wants to use buds (which cannot totally isolate outside sound). They are as good as these type of ear phones get"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cable","review":"These Headphones are amazing! The sound is great, bass, treble, everything is crystal clear. The only problem with these is that connector wears easily. Don't carry it in your pant pockets. The back and forth motion wears the inside of the wire and then you can lose sound in one or both of the ears. it's best to either buy a good quality extension (2 or 3 inches) or put it in your jacket or hoodie pocket. The Turbine Pro Gold do not however appear to have this problem. This problem aside they are the best headphones i have had ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Good Speakers","review":"Here's some actual specs since none were listed:Type In-CanalSealing SealedNoise-canceling PassiveSensitivity 97 dB SPL per 1 mWImpedance 18 ohmsMaximum Output 110 dB SPLWeight 0.6 ozThese ear-buds excel in one area where most fail and that is very deep, rich bass.

Personally a good bass to me defines the difference between ok and great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster Turbine High - In ear speaker","review":"These Monster Turbine High Performance in ear speakers are truly remarkable the detail to every note and excellent bass response is unequaled. The only thing I've heard that comes close to these ear buds are electrostatic head phone - bought a used pair on ebay and they were not cheap! I think they lasted about 2 months. My hat is off to Mr. Monster, Thank you. Buy a pair today if the music you like to listen to means anything!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too heavy and underpowered in comparison to others...","review":"I purchased these a few months ago thinking they would be a sound improvement over my Klipsch pair (see other reviews), but found they are way too heavy (physically)in the ear and do not have sound quality as good as the Klipsch. Shipped them back to Amazon after a few days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty good sound but flimsy construction","review":"Ironically, considering that Monster made its name with ultra-thick audio cables, the big problem with these earbuds is the cheap construction of the cable & connector. These have VERY thin conductor wiring -- so much so that my model, at least, had a bad connection in the molded plug area. I have the turbine pro model, too, and I'm happy with them (admittedly, the cable there is also thinner than, say my shure E4Cs). I'd bought these for my daughter. The sound quality is not bad, though not great. We could have lived with that, if not for the construction problems. Going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monster Pulls A Fast One On Their Customers! BEWARE!!","review":"I just picked up a pair of these over the weekend. I want to let everyone know that monster is still packaging the OLD headphones in NEW boxes. APPARENTLY a new version is coming out and they are still trying to sneak out the back stock on the bad ones. I just spend a day on the phone with monster, first they didnt believe me.... then i had to send in pictures... then they thought their own headphones were counterfeit. Now they want me to send in these headphones so they can replace them, and didn't even tell me the ones on the box even exist!Why would you pull a fast one on 150$ headphones when you have all the profits from Dre Beats to help cover extra costs.these sound great, but i want the new headphones not the old model....They even removed the product temp from their site!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken, poor production quality","review":"The right ear plug broke down, sound off and the cap fell off.

I contacted monster and got no response. Do yourself a favor and stay well away from these headphones and any monster product based on poor quality and non-existent customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Customer Service I've Ever Experienced","review":"Please understand, the one star I give this product is based mostly on Monster's customer service. I bought my pair of turbines on 12/20/10. They worked fine for 8 months, and then one of the speakers started cutting out. I sent them in 8/30/11 and finally received a replacement pair today, 12/23/11. It took them almost 4 months! During that 4 months I contacted them a number of times only to be told each time that it would be a couple of weeks till their stock replenishes, even though their website didn't mark them as \\"out of stock\\" as some of the other ear buds were. As I said, the 1 star is for the fact they broke, and their customer service is horrendous, other than that the speakers produce a nice sound. Just be wary that if you do buy a pair of turbines and they do break you may be without a pair for 4 months. Crossing my fingers my replacement ones don't break so I don't have to deal with them ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, bad construction","review":"The bass in these things is incredible. Just absolutely amazing, sometimes even too much though. But the bad part about these earbuds is the construction. Half of the left earbud fell off the first hour i got it. That was an easy fix, just a bit of superglue needed to put them back together. But a month later the left earbud has a spotty connection to the jack and i have to fiddle with the part of the cord just go make the sound go to both ears. That was not solvable and the left earbud eventually became unusable. The website listed in the packed that came with the earbuds for customer service no longer exists. soo..... basically, if you are not going to be doing much traveling with these earbuds, then they are good for you. If you are even going to be wearing them outside while walking around, dont buy them cause they will break on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"i got these puppys when they were on sale, i got em a day before i went on a plane, as everyone knows all you hear is the engine when you on a plane so i thought these would do nice.

Within a few minutes i started having horrible pain and realized that the headphones were electrocuting me. There were sparks jumping from the metal headphone to my ear. I called the manufacturer and they said that it was a manufacturing flaw. For $150 pair of headphones, i was extremely upset. I would never buy these again! I would never touch these headphones again, even if they were given to me for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's The Beef","review":"This is the first time I've bought a pair of upgraded earphones. I was excited to try them but when I put them on they sounded tinney. No midtone and no bass. The earphones themself were pretty heavy compared to the free ones that come with most things. I tried them with my ipod, iphone and a beefed up audio on my PC. I had my wife try them as well. Nada. I sent them back. I don't understand how they could make it past quality control. Amazon, as usual, refunded right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound and Great Bass","review":"I have used a lot of cheap Head phones, these sounded Great and came with a awsome case difference is visible and worth to purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ipod-Iphone Alternative Headphones","review":"This is the second pair of the headphones that I've tried. Initially, the first pair only provided high-fidelity with almost no bass-so I returned them. The second pair were only slightly better. What I discovered was that you must place the buds fully in your ear which I'm very uncomfortable with. This is the only way to experience the \\"Deep Bass\\" that the manufacturer claims. I am very disappointed with my purchase---I just summed it up to great advertising..bad result for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy from a company that makes headphones, not overpriced cables.","review":"I compared these against a pair of Shure SE110 earphones ($60 cheaper), and I can say without a doubt that the Shures blow these \\"monsters\\" out of the water. They were superior in every way - general build quality, frequency range, clarity, and bass response. The monster earphones also distort at much lower volumes than the Shures. Don't be fooled by the Monster brand marketing or fancy packaging. Monster spends there time and money on marketing and suing small companies that want to use the word \\"Monster\\" in their name, and obviously much less time and money on product research and development. These earphones are lower quality than even some of the cheap Sony earphones and should be avoided at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound is decent but read the review","review":"The only reason why these earbuds earned two stars is because they sound decent. But the problem with most in-ear buds headphones is that when you wear them while you are exercising or doing a strenuous activity (Like running), it is not uncommon for them to fall out of your ear, so in return you may push them in deeper and deeper each and every time they fall out of your ear and eventually you will encounter one huge PROBLEM! The silicone tip of the earbud may become disconnected from the earbud and is in return deeply stuck inside your ear canal!! Just be careful if you are considering in-ear buds because of this problem. If you don't believe this happens, you can google it and see what other similar problems like this has happened to other people."},{"rating":"1","title":"They smell terrible!","review":"These Monster earphones smell terrible! Like toxic industrial waste. I hoped airing them out for a few weeks would help, but no. They sound great, but the smell is intolerable. Possibly unhealthful for human contact.An increasing number of products made in China smell terrible. They emit a horrible chemical smell. This is possibly a significant health problem for us, but how can we know for sure? China is one of the world's largest purchasers of recyclable material. Is there a connection?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously overpackaged and overpriced","review":"I can't remember buying anything as nicely packaged as these ear speakers which must be why they cost so much.I plugged them into my NAD receiver with ZZ Top playing and kept rearranging the ear pieces trying to get them to sound better. So I swapped out eartips and put on Etta James and it sounded like I was listening to her on and old AM radio.I'm giving them two stars rather than one because they have a nice traveling case and I liked the assortment on eartips. I'm giving them to my grandson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound, but too heavy for running","review":"I bought these to replace a pair of Shure E2C's that lasted 3 years of heavy use (half marathons). I also bought the Shure SE210's for essentially the same price ($100). The Monster's sound better but are very heavy and tend to slide out of the ear canal when running. The SE210's fall between the E2C and Monster's in sound quality; they are very comfortable and secure when running. I kept both: Monsters for commuting, Shures for running."},{"rating":"2","title":"monster earphones rock","review":"these kick ass well worth the $[...] i paid the only thing i would change to improve these are adding a lil more bass for hip hop music but they sound way better than $129 bose earphones"},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster Fantastic","review":"Ive have many hi-end ear phones which these Monster's are equally as good as anything Ive bought.....I find them very comfortable for shrt and long term general use and even at Gym.

Great price for its quality!","review":"Awesome phones! Before turbines I had Shure SRH 440 and the dr dre monster studio beats, and since I usually use phones with my htc cell phone when im at work or on a bus, I think turbines was the best choice. What they say about the amazing bass is true, and it cancels external noise better than any headphone I ever had. I recommend to anyone who uses phones with portable devices and wants quality, because I realized that although headphones are awesome, they are heavy and no matter how comfortable they were I used to get tired of them very fast. And shure srh 440 is not really made for portable devices, it needs an amplifier to make it sound really good.I am no professional....far from that, but personally,in my humble opinion, I think turbines sounds better than dr dre studio beats! Seriously! Especially when u look at their prices, monster turbines is a lot more worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"monster sound","review":"i listen to a wide variety of music from classical to metal and everything in between these head phones are by far the best ive ever used hands down they out performed my sennheiser hd202 over ear head phones in every category bass,mid,high,and low i love these things! the only thing that i didnt like was the mic and volume control is a little to high up its a pain to reach for if your doing activities like biking and snow boarding other then that the turbines are awesome thanks monster!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great buds","review":"I use these as a replacement for the cheap MP3 buds that come with a unit.

Listening (with some burn in) to these turbines have COMPLETELY changed my music listening world. The very first thing I noticed when I started listening to various genres of music with these plugs was the booming base! My goodness, the bass in many instances was almost so overpowering that I had to actuually put the ipod on pause and gather myself. No seriously, its true :) When I say \\"overpowering\\" I don't mean that in a bad way. I mean the bass is poweful, yet clean and sounds very percise. There has been no noticable distortion. The mids and high's sounded very accurate and sharp too. Coming from the very low end earbuds I have been listening to, and experiencing these Turbines, is like coming from the outhouse to the penthouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eek","review":"the ear buds dont have good bass, I know they are earbuds but the range on these are limited.

AND here is the kicker........If I wanted to purchase them again, I could not get them for the SALE price, The Vendor would not honor the sale price...so now I would have had to pay 3 times for the actual cost of the item, which equaled an extra $174 dollars. So I returned them. They can have them. I purchased a set of Bose ear buds which worked out great."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Really awesome headphones, though they don't deserve such a high price tag, bought them on a gold box deal for 60 odd dollars and its 60$ well spent.

Unfortunately my opinions are totally opposite.Sound quality is great but volume is very low.Bass none what so ever which is very disappointing consdering $40 earphones have more bass and volume which is also nice and clearI have also ordered a pair of Klipsch IMAGE S4, going by those reviews im hoping there much better than the turbines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately frustrated","review":"I really wanted to give these headphones a higher review, though i cannot. I must admit the sound quality is superb and unmatched by any previous models of in-ear headphones i have owned, BUT the build quality does not match that of the sound. After about a month of owning these the housing on the right headphone came apart but i snapped it back together and didn't have any problems until recently. After about 6 months of regular use the left housing completely came apart and recently one of the wires detached itself from the speaker (if that's what you would call it) rendering it useless . I'm going to try and sauter the wire back to the speaker so i'll update my rating based on the outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"as usual pretty good until they die....","review":"Heavy, not really comfortable but a pretty good sound, this is how I wanted to remember these earphones.Unfortunately, I will also have to remember them as the earphones that lasted only a year, day to day.Bought these on November 10 2010, died on me November 8th 2011.It just makes you wonder. Moving on to Shure who at least gves you the opportunity to replace your cable when they die...."},{"rating":"1","title":"After four pairs, still no luck","review":"These sound great for the two months that they work...then the ears start cutting out and they become useless. Call their customer service, wait on hold for 20-30 minutes, and they're happy to take a return. I think at this point their call center knows that the headphones are terribly built and they just spend all day taking warranty replacements.The first two returns, I had to pay to ship them back which didn't sit too well. Once the third pair broke, they started emailing me prepaid FedEx labels. When the fourth pair came and the plastic around the jack came off before I'd even plugged them in, I called Monster and now they've switched me to Beats By Dr Dre, which they tell me are more durable thanks to their flat cable.You'd think that a company that made its name on cables would have better, more reliable cabling in their too-expensive headphones. Here's hoping the Beats by Dr Dre headphones will last longer than these Turbines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound. Terrible quality.","review":"After thinking about finally getting some earbuds that cost more than $20 I settled on the Monster Turbines. The sound quality blew me away. It was amazing how much better everything sounded and the bass was awesome! But after two week the right speaker went out :(. After paying about $100 for some earbuds I expect them to last. I really wanted to like these, but I just can't recommend them to anyone.PS: If you return these expect to be on the market again because you won't be able to stand the sound quality of cheaper headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable","review":"I liked these and used them daily for about seven months, then one day while at the gym the left channel just died.

No more Monster earbuds for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Know What Your Listening Too!","review":"I believe I was being generous with 3 stars. These things sound like you are listening to music from a pair of tin cans. My $99 pair of Sony's have twice the base with less distortion. I was listening via IPOD which of course music isn't great but with these, wow! 45's sounded better out of an old audiovox player/speaker combo.Well constructed if that counts so if you keep them past a return you can listen to them forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"I purchased these based on the amount of positive reviews I had read here at Aamazon. My ear buds came defective. The left ear piece was extremely loose and the speaker was barely audible out of that side as well. Sometimes it would make a crackling noise and begin to work. There was not anything really impressive about the sound quality. Several items such as the extra rubber ear buds, the right angle connector and cable clip were all missing from my box. I suspect i received re-packaged merchandise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst in ear headphones i tried.","review":"I ordered these from Amazon last week and returned them right away, the sound was nowhere near as good as Shure In Ear Headphones, there was also static noise.On top of all this, the left headphone blew out just after TWO days of use, i listen to music with a volume a little above average (65/100).Please take my advice and do not buy these, there are MUCH better Headphones out there, such as Shure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and Switch","review":"I purchased these on a gold box special.

You would think it would offer deeper base or louder sounds, something, but for the life of me I can't tell the difference. I guess at the end of the day they are earbuds, and it's probably hard to make huge leaps in audio quality with them.

First off, any in-ear headphone will sound worse than those that sit over the ear. These leave no room for the sound to reverberate, and can lead to hearing loss. With the sound bouncing, much of the finer qualities can become muffled and lose meaning. There is no reason to buy these, when many comparable substitutes can be found. Plus, by buying these, you are supporting a company that bullies small businesses. Stick with a nice pair of cans from Sony, or Bose if you want to spend a ton of cash. Stick with a manufacturer that has been in the business for years, not one that uses celebrity branding to overcome shortfalls."},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid these like the plague","review":"these would be great if they came in a cracker jack box.... alas their sound quality for ear buds is about on par with that of the stock apple iPod buds. sure, they isolate outside noise better, but that's about it. if you're looking for the best bang for the buck and you have to have buds instead of over-the-ears, save yourself some money and frustration and go for the jlab j2's which amazon usually sells for $25-$30 at any given time. the j2's have a rich frequency response curve with no discernible distortion even at high volumes. you'll much appreciate those and loathe the monsters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Turbine's","review":"I got these for Christmas.

I had my eye set on the Bose IE2's but for $58, I figured the Monster Turbines were by far the better deal. I live in NYC so the noise cancelling factor is a must for me. These earphones are great for the price I got them but not for $149.99! Yes, they sound great and have wonderful bass(for you hip hop fans)however, they are overpriced.

These, by far, are the better sounding, deeper bass, not as bright treble (which is good from my point of view) ear phones. It take a little time to find the proper fitting for your comfort, but it is a very worthwhile process. I tried with different types of music to get the best sound for my taste.They are a bit heavy, and the wire feels thin, so I can't speak about durability. Time will tell. Given that I had got a great deal on these ($58 I think), I am very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"These headphones are horrible","review":"After 1 month of use the right ear went out.

The original iPod/iPhone headphones give better sound quality.If you seek in-ear phones to block out cell phone yappers on your commute or colleagues at work, you will spend several times more money than a cheap pair of headphones. Even on these Monster Turbines. Spend a bit more and get a decent earphone. Try the Shure SE315s (if they don't fit well, the predecessors SE310 or E3C have the same quality but better ergonomics). Try Etymotic ER-4Ps. (I think those are the best phones out there... and the only earphone whose price has increased over time.)Mine also arrived with gunk on the outside of one of earphones. Amazon accepted the return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart after two months of very gentle use","review":"Bought these last year at Christmas time in a Gold box special for $70.00. Less than two months later one of the ear buds separated, rendering it useless. That's a lot of money to throw away. As to the sound it was OK, but not great. The bass on my Sennheiser CX-300 II Precision Enhanced Bass Earbuds is superior and they have held together very well. I would not recommend these and seeing another Monster Gold Box special today with poor customer reviews reminded me to speak out about the inferior workmanship of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recommendations","review":"unless you want to waste $100 DO NOT PURCHASE THESE HEADPHONES!!!!

BUT I workout, run, and snowboard and these headphones haven't lasted more than a weekend. So the overall construction of the buds is not up to par, but if your a casual listener these do have really great sound! I ended up returning these twice and am unfortunately trying something more active!Ended up using a replacement pair for about a year and the left speaker just gave out on it. They did sound great and I wanted to like them, but when I bought them they were a deal of the day at 120$ i believe. Anyway look elsewhere.

My crappy stock ipod headphones have lasted me longer :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound quality, very poor construction","review":"I purchased a pair of these earbuds this past December. I was very pleased with the sound quality- clear, deep bass and good overall balance. I was using them at my computer and walking to work. Last week, I was taking them out of my ears in a very standard fashion, and the right earbud broke into two pieces, leaving the wire hanging out. Naturally, I was surprised. With a price tag like this and a brand name like Monster, I expected more.I contacted Monster's customer support via email 5 days ago outlining the problem, and have yet to receive a response. Needless to say I am hesitant to recommend this product to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"look no further","review":"I was doing research and found some beats by Dr. Dre but found out they were crap. These I ordered a week or so ago and they truly are amazing. They look great sound great and were in great packaging.

They are worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps defective - NO BASS!","review":"Given the other glowing reviews, perhaps my product was defective. These are terrible sounding headphones (equivalent sound found in the $10 range). The treble was tinny and the bass totally absent. I read about \\"breaking in\\" high quality headphones by playing full range music at full volume for several hours - I tried and no improvement. I tried all the ear pieces thinking perhaps placement in the ear was the issue - no improvement. I returned the headphones - Amazon is great! One solid plus is the tangle free cord - it truly does minimize tangles. On another down side, the weight of the ear buds make it hard for them to stay in your ears while running (even with the correct sized ear piece)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed Customer","review":"I bought these headphones with expectations of being blown away with impressive bass and pure sound. On all counts I have been let down by Monster. The headphones are well built, cables are flimsy and ear tips are not comfy. I also owned V-Modas, Sennheisers, Klipsch and Skull Candy. Though Klipsch cost @ 79 they provide superior sound and comfort. I was planning to ditch them for the Monsters but no more. I am sticking to my Klipsch's. To get the same level of sound and bass from the Monsters means me having to use the triple sleeve ear-tips and pushing them as deep as possible into my ear canal. Rather uncomfortable after a few minutes of use. Save your money folks and look elsewhere until a redesign is done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monster Turbines: Bad choice for Iphone, IPod, IPad","review":"If you are planning to use these with your Iphone, Ipod or Ipad you will be very disappointing as I am now. Monster should put a warning in their product labels, sounds is terrible!!! Waste of money. Please don't buy this product if you are going to use it in your apple products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad These Were Found in a Parking Lot","review":"I found a pair of these in my girlfriend's dorm parking lot. Imagine my surprise when I found that they normally go for a hundred and eighty dollars! After listening to them, I could find nothing special to say about the sound quality. In fact it was worse than some previous headphones I had. No bass, very little mid range and an average high range. Though the problem might be with the fact that the ear buds are too small for my ears? Being that I found them, they only came with that one pair. The build quality is above par, but the cord loves to tangle. Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Bass AT ALL","review":"I don't know if I got a defective pair or if my ears just aren't compatible with these earphones, but there is no bass. NONE!I listen to electronic/dance/dubstep music with massive amounts of bass and I literally hear none. There's more bass on those crap apple headphones that are like $15. I tried all of the ear buds they came with and tried all different positions of putting them in my ear, but I still hear no bass. I thought these were known for their excellent bass? Do I let them burn in or am I missing something completely?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was refurbed","review":"Left speaker ear bud was defetive the sound was lower than the left and you could hear the sound that a busted speaker makes at time other than that the sound that was not effected sounded great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ehhh","review":"Theses are okay... at first I got fakes but after returning I got real ones. They're pretty decent. The high and medium voices I found excellent. The bass... a little lacking but still present. I had a pair of Sonys extra bass for about $40 so I'm used to more bass but the sound quality is very crisp and clear. And you do have to break them in because they kept getting better. I would never buy these for the full $175 but for the $100 on Amazon, they're a good deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, if you can keep them in your ears...","review":"I got these for $58, so I guess I can't complain much but I thought I'd steer people away from these if I could. They sound great for the price, but dear God it's almost IMPOSSIBLE to keep them in your ears. I've tried every rubber tip included and they're constantly falling out of my ears at the slightest head movement. Incredibly frustrating! It got to the point where I was so distracted at work from having to jam them back in my ears every 30 seconds that I just stopped using them. Turn your head slightly? They fall out. Yawn or talk? They fall out. Put the left one back in your ear? The right one falls out. They're just far too heavy for the design and the rubber tips don't have any grip to them.So in short: They sound great, but in my particular case, they're absolutely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"NICE WHILE THEY LASTED","review":"I bought these when they were on sale for 50%. Really liked them, but with daily use, they don't last. Too bad and not worth replacing for over $100."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great...for about 2 months","review":"Bought these for my girlfriend. I, myself, prefer Klipsch but she gets what she wants. Great packaging and (deceptively) they appear to be very solid. The sound is almost comparable with the Klipsch S2 (more bass, but less crisp mids and highs) but not near the X10. My GF however, was happy with the style and performance .... for the approximately TWO MONTHS she used them before the left bud simply went out. When Monster claims that these earbuds are \\"built to last\\".... they left out the remainder of the sentence... \\"built to last -- two months\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice while they lasted but they didn't last too long","review":"I used these primarily at work, just sitting at my desk listening to podcasts and music while programming. Light use, non-sport. And they broke 2 times.The first time, the left earbud split in two where it's assembled. I used some JBWeld to seal it back together and all was well.However recently, the earbuds have all but died, giving muted music.While they worked they sounded great and came at a fair price point of around $100 when I bought them through Amazon. 2 stars for that. Minus 3 stars for average quality and poor durability. $100 earbuds should not break after 3 years with light use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Break too easily","review":"The right earbud cuts out on my set of headphones, have a friend who bought the same pair, same story.

After using this product for about a year the right ear-phone started cutting in and out, after I sent the product back I received a replacement 3 months later that was also defective. Very disappointing. I have now sent about ten emails to there customer service in the last month and have not yet received a single response. I have tried to call a couple times but received no answer after waiting for about 20 minutes. Despite the great quality of this product I will never purchase from Monster Cable ever again. It is not worth all this hassle. There are similar products by companies who offer much better service for the same price if not less."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Priced, Not Worth it.","review":"Bought these headphones about 5 months ago. They actually sound pretty great, when they're not falling out of your ear or not isolating sound. After 2 months they went out, I sent them to monster, and got them replaced by a brand new pair. Which then lasted about 2 months, and went out again. I would expect this out of a $20 set, but 100+ dollars? Definitely not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I bought these 'Monster Turbine High-Performance In-Ear Speakers' 6 months ago and they were great for about the first 3 months but right about that time the one speaker started slowly fading and now I can hardly hear anything out of it. Looking at the speaker without the ear tip attached, there doesn't seem to be anything blocking or inhibiting the speaker and none of the wires appear loose or frayed. For the money that I paid for these I would expect a much longer life span and certainly better customer service. I opened a ticket with them via email explaining the issues and my dissatisfaction with the product and except for the automated reply letting my know they have received my email, I haven't received any acknowledgement or contact from them. Clearly this is the last nickel from me that Monster will be seeing coming their way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty #&*%^!@! Good!","review":"These definitely surpassed my expectations. I have not yet had a chance to get them broken in yet but right out of the box they sound great. Great bass the is as good or better than my Sony on ear headphones. I snagged these up for $58 as Amazon's deal of the day yesterday so I cannot really complain about anything so far. Best $58 I have spent yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good so far and pretty awesome.","review":"I have had the ear speakers for a little more than a week and they are pretty awesome so far. Their sound quality is very crisp and clean, awesome basses. The mids and highs are also awesome. So far I haven't had any issues with the construction of them, they seem to be well made and look like they sound, high-end. They are really amazing they make you feel like your in a live concert even at low volumes. I don't know if anyone can make earbuds sound any better than these, but then again I never heard really-really high-end earbuds. I recommend them to anyone that wants great sounding earbuds. I wish the price was a little better, too bad I didn't buy them later because Amazon had a sale on them for $106 I paid $179 for them. If you get them, enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"yep, totally worth it","review":"I like to think of myself as a music connoisseur (using the term loosely).

I had a concern that you had to burn in the headphones for the best quality but I've been using it for a couple hours and it is amazing. The bass is not too overwhelming (still knocks cleanly) and the vocals sound like you're in a studio listening to a live session."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just bought these","review":"Hey, I just bought these headphones and at first, they didn't sound good at all. Only after I found the right fitting rubber piece thing did they sound good. So don't knock it till you fit it to your ears. They have great, clear bass, and just sound good overall. They feel solid, much more solid than the bose in ear headphones they are replacing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome earbuds but needs burn in time","review":"These are amazing earbuds with deep bass and great sound quality.When I first tried them out, I was little bit disappointed as I couldn't hear the bass.I decided to try the burn in process (playing music with bass for over 24hours).IT SOUNDS GREAT NOW WITH SUPER BASS!!

Wouldn't use them for working out.Sound Quality: Again, not the best but not the worst. It doesn't match the price tag in this category.Durability/Style: While they look really really cool, they get a bit heavy being all metal. The microphone/song selection button feels cheap compared to the rest.

They easily match up to the audio quality of my Monster Beats in-ears and even surpassing them in areas:Audio Quality: The bass bumps, the mid's are clear, and the highs soar. These are a great pair of mid-range in ears for a great price.Build Quality: These things have held up for years with no issues. I accidentally ran them through the washing machine and dryer and when I pulled them out the headphone had separated a bit but the wires were still connected. I let them dry out and glued the case back together and they work perfectly.Cons: The only issue I have with these at all is the stupid cord. It's prone to twisting and once it gets bent in a certain manner from wrapping or whatever it really doesn't want to straighten out again. Also with the majority of in-ears if the cable is bumping against something it will be quite audible, similar to a stethoscope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound great","review":"These are great headphones.You do need to make sure you put them in your ears correctly.

While Copeland are good, they have the same type of fanboy base that made Coldplay famous: drooling college and highschool kids who think they're so poetic.

Needed to get the band resized since it was large but the watch is beautiful, lightweight and metal band does not tarnish since it is stainless steel. Have yet to see how long the gold finish will last but my previous two tone watch held its color for over 2 years. It does not need its battery changed since it is a rechargable cell that works via solar cell and artificial light works. Just be careful if you wear long sleeve shirts all the time, if so you will need to leave the watch under the sun or a lamp when you are not wearing it to charge it. I dropped the previous watch a few times and the hour hand came off.

A hotel cleaner apparently bumped into with a card in it. Not something I would normally worry about. It turned out to be slightly sprung and a pin was bent. It was also popped open slightly. I have good mechanical skil and managed to it as it was. But a waste of time as it tuns out.It won't mount, thinks my cards are all 1.5 terabytes and cut life is complicated.

Every single time I use the adapter, I end up in a kernel panic. Sometimes it's immediately upon putting the adapter in the expresscard slot. Sometimes it's in the middle of transferring images off of the card. Sometimes it's when I've successfully gotten images off the card, and have forgotten to eject the card before working on the images.But it's always a matter of WHEN, not if it's going to kernel panic my machine.

Apparently the script writer is not a surfer and has never met a real surfer. The entire film comes off as a cross between a soap opera and a documentary. It reveals nothing of why people surf at all much less why they surf dangerous waves.

I can identify with Patrick Shane Dorian's role as the soul surfer ~ if you're buying this as an entertainment video for non surfers, don't, but if you want something you can connect with, relate to, dream about, this movie is perfect.

Otherwise, if you want to avoid such a tragic movie, you might want to miss this.This is shot beautifully, I'll give it that. But, stick some high dollar equipment into any fool's hands and aim towards the ocean and you'll get the same effect. Kind of like Bob Guccione decided to shoot a surf movie. Makes no real sense, looks okay, but doesn't even have the merit of lots of T&A; to redeem it. So, it falls flat.Avoid, avoid, avoid. North Shore is much better than this, and it even has a point/purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Wad's Hands...","review":"This movie has a few good surf snippets, and a few good song snippets- but overall its just quite poor. The way the scenes are put together seems rather haphazard, the attempt at romance is weak, and the plot is difficult to get fired up about. It's not a 'terrible' movie, and is OK for a first watch. The attempt at doing a more 'artistic' and 'engaging' story revolving around surfing is always welcomed, yet, the film just seemed to spin too long in no-man's-land before the climax.The biggest challenge for a story writer and filmmaker is to keep the audience engaged between Plot Point I and II- that long middle section must maintain viewer interest. 'In God's Hands' must have more 'mature' conflict or at least move along at a steady clip. 'In God's Hand's' makes a noble attempt, but maybe something got lost in the editing process? Thus, I can only slightly recommended this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"In reaction of: Sam Kim fron SoCal","review":"How typical is this reaction coming from a small-wave surfer from SoCal. Ok, I totally agree with you on the acting part, but then they're not actors, but surfers. You're looking at it from the wrong perspective. It's not the acting, not the setting, it's the message, way of life they display in this film. Not actors being surfers, but surfers being themselves.But you really ripped out my hart when you compare this one with movies like Big wednesday and Northshore...they're fun to watch but have nothing to do with real surfing! I mean, a schoolboy, who's surfchampion in Arizona (great waves there!) wants to take it on in Hawaii? Come on, even you can't believe that!When you take it up to Endless Summer, I can relate...I'll pay you the shipping costs, you send that DVD to Europe ok?A former Santa Cruz Citizen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie Ever","review":"In God's Hands was an awesome movie.

A MUST SEE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"...hit the MUTE button...","review":"...Sure, the surfing footages are gorgeous and inspiring, but as a movie trying to convey the soul of surfing, it fails. Most scenes and situations bordered between the absurd and laughable, as was the dialogue. I found myself wishing the filmmakers wouldn't take themselves too seriously. Watching this was like hearing Laird Hamilton wax poetics on why surfing is good for the soul (boring!!). Give me the guys over at Mavericks anytime. They never talk about soul-searching. What they experience out there on the waves are hard to put in words. Being didactic about any activity that is life affirming and joyous is mistake. Forget this film and rent Bruce Brown's The Endless Summer, which mangaged to say all that and more about surfing with so much less. Mahalo."},{"rating":"1","title":"good surfing bad acting","review":"This movie was an excellent show of waves but it really lacked acting.

The whole time I kept thinking to myself, \\"How could you actually MAKE a movie this bad?\\". To think of all the starving independent film makers. This movie pieces together about 200 different scenes, from surfers getting chased by tribe leaders, to stupid chases in bali, it makes NO sense. Do not bother. The total surfing time shown is only about 10 minutes and it does show some MACKING waves, but you could buy a video on Mavericks and you'd have a better time. This movie was put together by a madman i assume. Matt George does a good job acting, but Shane Dorian is horrible (sorry shane, you're a great surfer). Way worse than Point Break and North Shore. Way, way worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"Horrible butt nugget of a surf movie. Poorly scripted and acted.

This album is more of the same from Russ Freeman, modern smooth-jazz with a flair of latin style. To me they just haven't been the same since left GRP in 96, there only good album to me outside that label was Brave New World (96) back then they're style was a lot faster, cunning and bold, Russ and the band would at times almost cross the line from rock to pop back to smooth jazz with sheer brilliance, the last few albums have been nothing different, from everyone else. With the exception of the song (In The End) the album was okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wild Card? Nothing \\"Wild\\" about it...","review":"I have been a fan since their \\"Moonlighting\\" album (I have them all), but after hearing the \\"Let It Ripp\\" disaster, I figured they would come back strong. I was sadly mistaken. The latin flavor is OK, but it seems to have consumed their focus, making all their music sound exactly the same. I used to buy their albums sight unseen, but those days are over. This will be the first Rippingtons CD I will not buy.

Some of them seem like they were written for her. Wild Card has a few good songs on it. The title track is okay. Moonlight and King Of Hearts are better. The last good CD by the Rippington's was Weekend In Monaco. Changes in personnel, locations, and labels haven't proved to be too good for Russ's music. He's made his money and can experiment with various ideas. Wild Card is loser in my opinion, but at least it's better than Brave New World."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another let down","review":"This is a very ordinary effort from the RIPPINGTONS. Instead of RIPPING they seem to be heading towards a RIP (REST IN PEACE). I am really very disappointed with their latest effort. Barring the title track, the remaining numbers are lame with some insignificant vocals thrown in as well. The group is known to move the listener's mind with their songs....none of the songs in this CD does that.

I'm a big Rippingtons fan, and I also tend to enjoy music with Carribbean/Spanish flavor, so this one's a winner. I actually like all the songs on this album, which almost never happens. Yes, some (all?) of the lyrics are in Spanish, but that just adds to the Carribbean vibe. English would be completely out of place.If you liked \\"Life in the Tropics,\\" I think you'll like \\"Wild Card.\\" To me, it's as good as \\"Moonlighting,\\" which is my all-time favorite Rippingtons album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rippingtons- A total hit, different form the others","review":"I am Venezuelan, and I loved the fact, The Rippingtons, took the time to give the latin community a touch of their music in company of Two of the top latin Salsa Cuban artists such as Albita & Willy Chirino. Also, they gave us a little of R & B with Chante More and Gypsy Eyes a pretty ethnic melody with a touch of the Spanish Guitar as Spanish Girl. Beautiful work as far as production, melodies and taste. I feel this is one of the best album from The Rippingtons, cause it is different and comes out with all genre styles. Congratulations....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something worse than Let it Ripp?","review":"I didn't think the Ripps would release anything worse than Let it Ripp, but I was wrong. Wild Card is essentially an adequate CD, but truly a poor performance for the Ripps. When compared to earlier works such as Moonlighting and Welcome to the St James Club, the last two CDs are a complete wash. And what's the deal with the excessive latin leanings on this CD? It's extremely forced and really brings the album down a notch. The latin grooves were great on Life in the Tropics, but it doesn't work at all on Wild Card. I own every Rippingtons CD, but I feel this disaster may be my last contribution to Russ' retirement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going Downhill- where is the creativity???","review":"Wild Card was a disappointment with two songs out of the entire album. I have all of the other Rippington albums and this is the worst one to date. The Latin Theme drowns out any creativity that came with other efforts.

I did build a screen for mine and my basement theater is very very dark and that has helped alot but even with minimal light It still works great.

Also is has no zoom so the largest screen you can hope for is a 73\\" diagonal in a 15' deep room.Unless you are looking for a super inexpensive projector for the kids to play video games on.

There are two on/off groupings (so your device will switch on and off twice in a 24 hour period), which I like. Our lights come on in the evening and turn off just after we go to bed. They come on again in the morning and shut off when we leave for work.There is a simple override switch that will not interupt the cycle if you want to turn on your device at a time outside of the \\"on\\" period.The device is a \\"wall wart\\" and if you have another plug that is even a bit over-sized, you will not be able to plug both into a normal wall outlet. For instance, we cannot plug our vacuum cleaner into the outlet in which this device is plugged.My only major gripe is that if I'm sitting in the room at night reading a book or doing something else quite, it sounds like I'm sitting inside a clock tower (the timer mechanism if very loud)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timer Purchase","review":"This product was a close-out at the time of purchase.

It makes nothing but a mess when filling the water resevoir or just pouring a hot cup of coffee. I've learned to scoot the maker right to the edge of the sink to help avoid excess cleanup. It makes a mess! The brew basket requires some force to remove too. I finally learned to just carefully extract the used filter with grounds after exerting too much force a couple of times. With some force, the basket would pop out, sending wet grounds all over the place. I've finally given up on this coffee maker now that the non-stick surface has worn in several places. The plate is beginning to rust and I'm a little concerned about it rusting through and creating a fire/electrical hazard.

He slowly enters their world and before he knows it, he's become one of the man's henchmen.This is a cute drama with an appealing leading man. Ian Hart is sweet and vulnerable playing a dreamer with limited talent. I was rooting for him all the way. He gets into some nail-biting situations with the gang, led by Brian Cox and Tommy Flannagan who are both quite menacing. Kelly Macdonald is adorable as a cigarette girl who falls for Toni.The movie is exciting and really held my interest. The Glasgow slang and accents may require the use of subtitles, but they are charming. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live a Paris","review":"This is an excellent CD.

I have nothing against serious fiction, of course, but Pratchett seems to have lost his muse with this book.

As a person who knows rock'n'rock history, particularly the '50's and '60s, modesty side, I would place more value on the jewel box in which this CD, and others like it, are packaged than the CD's themselves.

Also, the one positive [embarrassingly gushing] review for this CD must be a shill for Madacy, or completely tone-deaf / has taste for you-know-what. Sad, just Sad.

One includes Tigger being pulled up and down the tree and another has Eyeore floating down the river whilst Christopher Robin and Pooh are playing Pooh Sticks.Each of the sections has a pull down section of story that can't be pulled out.

That approach makes your device turn on and off willy-nilly. Instead you push in as many adjacent triggers as you like to create the duration of time you want the device on.Yes, it's certainly one way to do it, but it strikes me as a baffling choice to physically map a reversible operation (on/off) this way.Each time you override the timer with the switch, the timer dial rotates one notch and your schedule begins to creep forward.

When you set the built-in thingies, they're backward. And the one we bought (suckers!) didn't even work backward. The clock mechanism would go to ON and the light would go on, and then off in about 2 seconds. We returned it. Cannot find anything like the \\"old\\" fashioned ones.

This story just never builds any steam or dramatic drive. Alan Cumming, a talented and engaging actor, is given pitifully unfunny lines in an effort as comic relief. Neil McDonough seems to be channeling Dirty Harry area Clint Eastwood. I liked the lion, not many lines, but his actions did create a character that was true to itself throughout the film. Miss Deschanel, whom I have liked since 2002's The New Guy is the most disapointing. She has a zombie-like wide eyed non-reaction to every conversation/situation she is engaged in. If she doesn't get worked-up, emotional, caring, sad, scared, angry...then why should we?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not in Kansas anymore...","review":"Since I will never love another movie as much as 1939s The Wizard of Oz, I will not compare it to Tin Man. Also, the two are completely different, and I enjoyed Tin Man for what it was: an entertaining series with good acting and a plot that holds your attention. McDonough, IMO, was the best of the bunch as the title character.What I really enjoyed were the nods to the original movie and book. A dog/man named Otto, Ahamo=Omaha (wizard's balloon), the \\"he went that way\\" with the arms, and countless others that I will enjoy seeing again when I purchase the DVD.Whether you like it better than the original, that's an opinion.

She waves her arms a bit and opens her eyes really wide. All of the actors seem to be trying very hard to stay in character but there is no chemistry between any of them. On the other hand, the production is lavish and the special effects are very good for a television production.

Or under the influence of formaldehyde.And the lines they should've been putting some, er, acting, into were also dreadful -- some good ideas here (actually, too many... it would take an encyclopedia to map out the stolen \\"homages\\" to various genres) but terrible, terrible writing.For a low budget, though, the sets, special effects imagery and photography were quite good.Too bad overall.... I really wanted to like this one.Absolutely not worth paying any money for.

This isn't The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but then again, it doesn't need to be.Tin Man is not a cinematic, theatrical masterpiece. It is what it is: a T.V. miniseries, and it's one of the best I've ever seen. Like The 10th Kingdom from years and years ago it incorporated just enough from my memories of reading those childhood stories to be nostalgic while being edgy and 'modern' enough to hold my attention now.There are the obvious parallels: Cain/Tin Man, DG/Dorothy, Azkadelia/WWotW, etc. and then there are the more subtle things. DG's calm manner and witty one liners mirror Dorothy's easy acceptance of a world that should have been terrifying, the trek to the Northern Palace, the ways in which each was injured during the fight at said Northern Palace, etc.It isn't The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, like I said, rather it is a beautiful entertaining story in its own right."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"The story is an interesting derivative- I won't say adaptation, because it isn't even remotely like the original LF Baum books. That wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, but as it stands I cannot recommend it. The story is predictable and poorly written. The director doesn't utilize the strengths of the actors, who have the potential to be good. Overacting seems to be encouraged. Some acting is better than others, but subtlety is totally nonexistent in any of the characters. Was this written for children? Not sure who the audience is supposed to be, but sure wasn't written for me.The production design was pretty good. The makeup was horrid. Being a fan of the LF Baum books, I wish that someone would do a series that was as scary and dark as the original books.

The cast is marvelously enchanting and the director and crew are truly 'Wizards' in their own right and the writing is inspired. \\"There's no place like the O.Z.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Retelling of The Wizard of Oz","review":"I'd highly reccomend this to buy for it's current ten dollar price tag. It's a good movie, especially without the commericals. There is even a cameo by Richard Dryfuss. It has all of the elements of the classic with a surprising adult twist. I'd watch this again. This is from someone who isn't happy with what the SY FY channel is turning into. This was done with intellegence and class. If you don't remember some of the actors,the lead had a bit part as a character called Hawk in \\"First Contact\\". All of the actors get a chance to shine in this SY FY channel movie of the week special. I just wish there were more well written movies like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tin Man is Awsome!","review":"Tin Man is one of the best mini series I have seen in a long time.

But, by the time I finished the first third (it was a three part mini-series), and started the second third from my DVR, I was TOTALLY hooked. I couldn't get to the second third of it fast enough. It is an excellent adaptation. I can't wait for the DVD. I am a HUGE fan of adaptations with a twist, and this was definately a good book adaptation. I watched all 6 hours of it in one night. It was amazing. WELL worth the time to watch it. Though the ending was a little bit predictible, especially once you learn what happened to the girls, but it is still VERY well acted, and VERY well put together. I have not seen a \\"Made For TV\\" movie/mini-series that has captured my attention like this since Dr. Zhivago. Well WELL done! Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!","review":"Oh man, I love this series. I really liked this whole new version of the Wizard of Oz. Yeah okay, Zoey DeSchanel's acting wasn't up to par, but the rest of the story was really good. I loved it!!!! Very good story telling. Very good graphics or CGI or whatever you call it now-a-days.

That should give you a pretty good feel for this story. The original Dorothy makes a short cameo appearance towards the end of this movie. All the other characters you expect are there, but almost unrecognizable. Some of the dialogue is a bit stilted and some improbable-for-no-reason events occur, But the story line is fresh and alive. This movie is well worth its cost and can provide hours of entertainment for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It","review":"I saw part of the Tin Man on TV and missed one episode.

If you're expecting just a classical, modern remake, you're in for a surprise. If you're a die hard Wizard of Oz fan, you might not like it, but if you step into this movie with an open mind and not too many expectations as far as similarities to the original go, you might just love the ride! This is definitely a movie I can watch over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Our family enjoyed watching this movie together.

We Started Watching It At 10:00p.m. And It Ended At About 3:00a.m. If You Decide To Watch It, Make Sure You Have A Lot Of Time On Your Hands. It Is A Long Movie But I Loved Every Minute I Spent Watching It. I Don't Recommend This Movie For Young Kids. It Is A Movie For Teens And Young Adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long","review":"Loosely based on the Wizard of Oz, Tin Man has a good cast and everything to be enjoyed by the family: a fantastic magical world in which the good sister, DG, has to overpower an evil witch that took possession of her sister Azkadellia; friends (Cain aka Tin Man, Raw, Glitch, Tutor); mad men (The Mystic Man); and the bad guys of course (Zero).However, this television mini-series in 3 parts is simply too long, 2 parts would have been just fine. It just keeps dragging on and on. The good thing is that there are no useless repetitive scenes; from 1 part to another, the writers didn't feel the need to summarize what happened previously. (Thank you!)The acting isn't that great, but it works for most of the actors' performances.The special effects aren't very special either; nothing worth mentioning.Tin Man is enjoyable, but just drags on too long, which made me long forward to the ending - which was predictable of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"cookie","review":"Boreham is a master at delivering spiritual truth through simple everyday examples.

Connection wasn't too difficult, I flipped the breaker, pulled the fuse from the box near the water heater and checked it with meter to make sure it was dead before working on it. I followed the directions exactly and the only hard part was fitting the wires behind the little screws in the timer box and then tightening the screws without cross-threading them or the wires coming out.

I will not, ever, give these bones to my dogs again. The reward, the time they spend chewing on them, is minimal while the risk, that swallowing bone chunks will hurt them, is higher than I prefer.

Together the two argue women's ideologies. That's about it. Add a cast of quirky-but- lackluster characters and you've got a novel doesn't amount to much.

It realistically depicted family and sibling relationships, and the narrator, Caroline Winters, was at once deeply troubled and hysterical. I was engaged in this book from cover to cover, mostly because I really wanted to know what happened, not so much because the writing was anything extremely memorable. But the story was engrossing and the ending did not disappoint. A quick summer read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lovely Book","review":"Terrific, and lovely, and lumpy in the places a book should be lumpy.I was surprised by my surprise, and full of the soft meanderings found within.

The family has not given up, and about fifteen years later, the search resumes in full force (not by the police, but because the mother will not let go). It is the story of three sisters, their mother, father, and other people in their lives. They deal with, or not, the child gone missing.The effects of the loss of this child, for her sisters, and her parents, is well written. Also, the search for her when Ellie's sister is an adult.Also, there is a resolution, extraordinarily well written, as is this book.I would recommend this to anyone, except perhaps a new parent (just because of the subject). It is well written, a good story, and, I plan to read more by this author.P.S. My synopsis is lousy...I would suggest that you read the book and don't listen to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"you can't always get what you want...","review":"No offense to the hoards of people who love this book, but... I thought it got off to a good start but then the horrible writing killed it. It was like proof reading the work of a talented 8th grader.I only hung in there as long as I did because the story sounded interesting. I would have liked to see this great plot in the hands of a more capable writer. But as Mick Jagger says, \\"You can't always get what you want.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Ok","review":"After reading \\"A Sleep Toward Heaven\\" I was really looking forward to reading this book.

Hope her next one is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"I couldn't wait to see what happened in the end--which made this fun to read. I liked the way the story unraveled. I liked the main character. The only thing I didn't like was all the alcohol! Every character drank ALL the time. Are people really like this??? Also, the scene I had been hoping for the entire time was finally about to happen--but then the author decided to leave it up to the reader's imagination. I wish there had been that one extra chapter. But the book was still GREAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An unfinished story","review":"The author leaves too much to the imagination in this novel. The abrupt ending was unnerving. Had I known that the stories would go unfinished, I never would have attempted to know these characters. I am very dissapointed in the ending. The book itself was not one that was absorbing or a satisfying read. I was hoping the the ending would make the rest of the book worth the read. I don't think I have ever read a book that left the readers out on limb like this one did. The story is not mysterious it's unfinished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant Book","review":"This book is very easy to read and I could not put it down. I recommend this book, the story is not a type of story that you read all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lesser novel","review":"This story was not convincing. First, there is a dream sequence, about midway into the book, that is so linear and realistic that I felt embarrassed for the author. Second, the story came to a sudden and too perfect conclusion, as though the author surrendered to who knows what. Third, there's all this alcoholism, with no consideration of how the alcoholism dooms the characters' unwritten futures, despite the cheery ending. I would have been much more hopeful for the characters if Agnes never returned and, instead, Caroline and others began attending AA meetings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Lousy Ending!","review":"I adored this book until I was left hanging at the end. I felt so cheated I was angry and tempted to write the author. I never did because she wrote it years ago and figured what did she care about it now. I didn't know how many stars to give it. How about this? Five stars until the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep end of the ocean redux ???","review":"This book had so many references to smoking in it I had a sore throat when I finished it. The author did not know how to transition her work without a reference to cigarettes. 'She ground out her cigarette, she lit a cigarette, she offered one to her 13 year old sister....smoke, smoke,smoke. This also happened in Deep End of the Ocean, a similar tale of kidnap and return. First of all, most upper class people have eschewed the tobacco habit in recent years, so it made no sense, second it distracted as it made the characters one dimensional and showed no sense of transition without the references. Did she get paid by the tobacco companies for this book ? Premise was good, execution was painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous Book","review":"I'm disappointed I wasted my time reading this book but I was stuck on vacation and had read everything else on my Kindle. Very unsatisfactory ending....spend your time more productively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give This A Miss","review":"Besides the hum-drum nature of the author's writing, this book was impossible to read due to the slapshot editing of the various storylines. A reader has to be committed to learning from or finding out what happens to the main character from the beginning in order to go through the torture of reading disconnected storylines. In this book, from page one, the main character is a whining loser with almost no personality, a trait from which she never recovers throughout the narrative. I'd classify her as a fool on a fool's mission.Give this one a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and unorganized","review":"I had read the reviews before I read the book and thought I would enjoy the book. I was wrong. It was confusing and unorganized, and most of all very unbelievable. Too many coincidences that were a bit too unbelieveable. Definitely should not be compared to Lovely Bones, not anywhere near that caliber of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dazzling Story woven like a precious Persian Rug","review":"Ward has done it again!!!!This novel confirms that she is not a one shot wonder.

Ideas, images and emotion bounce off every word. Her characters are compelling andbelievable. I have a very tender spot for the mother.This is a must read. It is written by an author whose mastery of language comes second only to a very intuitive grasp of ideas and observations.Ward is destined to become a literary force."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Find!!","review":"I really liked this book!!

The pegs are definitely not as long in reality as they are in the photo. When I put my trumpet on the mount, the pegs are only long enough to fit under the lead pipe, so when I leave it up, the trumpet is half held up, then tilts forward until the bottom of the valves is touching the wall, so my horn is just leaning forward the whole time and it doesn't look good. Seriously, who measured how long the pegs should be?? I only rated it at two stars instead of one because they got it to me so quickly, so kudos for that. But the mount is simply not worth the money if it can't even hold my trumpet up correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, sucks putting it in the car","review":"It works great, but removing the old one and putting in a new one is a B."},{"rating":"2","title":"Having fun in Spanish","review":"When I teach the clothing unit in Spanish class, one of the culminating activities is a fashion show.

Students recognize it and like hearing it in Spanish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mindblowing","review":"An unassuming cover and title do not come close to revealing the riches within. This book embodies a passion rarely found in how-to-manuals that belies the author's awareness that he is archiving an artform that has been nearly lost to us. Very well-organized, easy to read and thorough, this should be the bible of building and sculpting with lime.The introduction alone will change the way you see concrete (i.e. portland cement) forever. If you are even remotely concerned with a healthy and sustainable future for our cities, this book is a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent data","review":"This is an ambitious work. The author attempted both detailed studies and a statistical overview of 100 pioneer emigrants from Great Britain to Utah. It must have been difficult finding accurate records on that many women. She organized the study by phase -- family roots, conversion to Mormonism, emigration, first impressions of Zion, settling experience -- using all 100 women's stories to create a composite pioneering experience. Despite some minor errors and typos, this approach gives a fascinating, in-depth understanding of who, why, and how about 50,000 British women succumbed to Mormon proselyting and opted to reinvent themselves in the desert of the American West."},{"rating":"2","title":"nicey nicey","review":"Extraordinary Ordinariness is basically a little book containing photographs and an overview of the Smiths' history and music, accompanied by a 3-song CD. It's not particularly essential to own, but it's excellent if (as in my case) you've been looking for a copy of the rare song Jeane on CD. Jeane is actually one of my favorite Smiths songs, and I'd consider the song to be the best reason to purchase Extraordinary Ordinariness. But all in all, the whole thing is enjoyable as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"WESTERN LOVER","review":"Not much to say but your delivery from time of order to when I received it was GREAT !!

Pointless and tasteless, this film does not even show the wonderful city of Paris to good advantage."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"This movie popped up when I was ordering a couple of videos as one I might also be interested in ordering. First copy came defected. When the movie came I put it in and sat with my husband to watch, what I thought would be an enjoyable movie. On the contrary, it was awful. The acting was terrible and the plot was even worse. We didn't finish watching the movie. It went in the garbage. I thought it was even too bad to put in a \\"Goodwill\\" collection box. I didn't want someone else loosing money on a crappy movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exactly what the title says","review":"This movie is exactly what the title says: 2 days in Paris in the life of a couple of hysteric, insecure and basically unbearable individuals.No plot, forced situations, a tad of overacting.Some American viewership is granted by the role of Adam Goldberg, who plays the perplexed, French-challenged fianc��e.Barely worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid if you enjoy Paris or France","review":"Another reviewer summarized it well: Pointless and tasteless. The word \\"annoying\\" also came to mind many, many times while watching this film to the end, and I only continued watching it to the end because I thought it might get better or somehow redeem itself for the time spent watching it. In my case it most certainly did not. If you're tempted to watch it because you enjoy Paris or France, or because you enjoy romantic comedies, then I highly recommend looking for another film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run away now!","review":"I rented Two Days in Paris because I thought it looked like a good chick flick for my wife. What a mistake! We didn't even make it past the first half hour. If you are amused by the self absorbed whining of neurotic, pseudo intellectual New Yorkers, then you might actually enjoy this movie. Otherwise run away now. The French characters in this movie reinforce every negative stereotype ever created. And the lead American character puts the ugly in Ugly American. This flick is strictly Woody Allen lite. If there were a negative star rating I would have used it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two days you will definitely want to skip","review":"\\"2 Days in Paris\\" starts off OK but the relentlessly obnoxious characters - especially filmaker and star Julie Delpy - quickly become tiresome and irritating. Much of the dialogue and many of the situations appears to be unscripted and go absolutely nowhere - case in point the scene on the Metro. Only Adam Goldberg comes out of this with any distinction. Delpy has almost succeeded in doing the one thing that you might have thought impossible - making Paris look unappealing. These are definitly two days you will want to skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"We get it already, you're a miserable cad!","review":"This was a difficult movie for me to get through. In fact, I found myself completely disinterested and literally waiting for the movie to end. The male lead character seems merely an incredibly bad homage to Woody Allen.I've seen Adam Goldberg before in non-lead roles and enjoyed his style of sharp, sardonic humor, but it was just a non-stop whine-fest throughout this entire film...and utterly petty for the most part.Don't get me wrong, I love neurotic characters - Julie Dempy's character, for the most part, is fantastic - and I very much enjoy dark humor, but Adam Goldberg's character was just a complete drag and made it very difficult to remain engaged."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 Days in Paris","review":"I chose it because it was a good movie and I liked the story behind it and the diversity of cultures ,did not like it only because the problem with the sound and definitely recommend it for the sense of humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"I loved before Sunrise/Sunset, was hoping for something like that. This was uncomfortable, sorry I saw it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Days in Paris","review":"Having just come home from spending a month in Paris, seeing this movie was a real treat. It's not a movie about Paris, so much as it is a movie about two very different people grasping at love. Viewers looking for Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe panoramas will definitely be disappointed; think more along the lines of too-real Sunday markets, Canal St. Martin, and the outskirts you just won't find in your Guide Michelin.The dynamics between the two protagonists are great; their stories are fascinating, and are slowly revealed, explained, and analyzed. This isn't a movie about truths; it's about the way people love, learn, and struggle to understand themselves and each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Bad, Bad, Bad!I didn't even finish watching this movie. My recommendation is, do not waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-Hum","review":"I had high expectations of this movie after its review but it was about as interesting to me as watching water boil. Take these two out of that beautiful setting and the movie wouldn't have been watchable. Much of the dialogue is in French, which we're privy to with the captions. Adam Goldberg is excluded from many conversations at family meals, conversations Julie Delpy has with friends and old lovers who seem to pop up with amazing frquency in this short time. The 'eccentricity' of her artist father is illustrated in one scene by his scratching marks on cars with a key if they dare have a tire up on the sidewalk. Funny? I think not. Delray is a bit ditzy and screams a lot. Goldberg pouts a lot. In the end, they seem to have some sort of bond that never becomes clear to me. My recommendation is 'don't waste your time'."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't want to spend two days with this couple","review":"A young couple, Marion (Julie Delpy) and Jack (Adam Goldberg), find their relationship imperiled during a visit to Marion's home town of Paris. Jack is neurotic and insecure; Marion is flighty and insensitive. Both are whiny and judgmental. An amusing film could be made about this couple, but writer/director Julie Delpy doesn't seem to realize how irritating they are and wants us to love and identify with them instead.There are a couple of strong points here. Delpy's real life parents (Albert Delpy and Marie Pillet) are wonderful as her fictional parents. Also, the depictions of Paris's cab drivers, restaurants, and street life make it feel like a real city, not merely a picturesque backdrop for romance and intrigue. But that's not enough to save this self-indulgent bore of a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Found the movie not as funny as I thought it would be. Also too exaggerated to the point of uneasiness where I didn't even recognized the French even though I'm a native from France."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the funny parts are on the trailer...","review":"I looked so forward to seeing this because of the trailer. Little did I know I'd already seen the funny parts because of it! This movie tries way too hard to succeed. Instead-it fails miserably. Goldberg's character was extremely whiny, a hypocondriac, depressing and just mean! Actually, I liked neither character. The humor fell short most of the film. I can appreciate that Paris is an openminded city, but I fail to see how all the sex talk, 'dirty' words and innuendo would actually happen like it did in this movie. It was in excess.Lastly, the conservative bashing took this film downhill faster for me than it otherwise would have. It got old. Fast. Yeah yeah, we know. Hollywood is left leaning and thinks the whole world should be. We got it already.Bottom line: I kept looking at the clock every 2-3 minutes for it to get over. Next time a movie has quite a bit of 1 & 2 star reviews, I will pay more attention to it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry not funny","review":"Billed as a comedy, this is more like an angry drama.

The story is about a decsendant of Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings who asks other decsendants what they know about their relationship. Before I read the book I didn't even know anything about Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings and now I know so much more than I expected. Jefferson's Children gave a lot of information about Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings. The reason the relationship is so improtant is because Sally Hemmings was a slave of Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson was about thirteen years older than Sally Hemmings. Thomas Jefferson married Sally Hemmings after Martha Jeffers, Thomas Jefferson's first wife died. I find two things very interesting about Thomas Jefferson and his decsendants. Thomas Jefferson fought againts slavery but owned slaves. I think it is amazing how big the Jefferson and Hemming's family is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jefferson's children","review":"The book is really good and my husband will be delighted to get this on Christmas Eve at our eldest daughter's..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spirit of Hope","review":"I have just finished reading Jefferson's Children:The Story of One American Family, and the stories included here of the Hemings and Jefferson families have given me renewed hope that someday we all will treat each other as cousins and family. I realize that all families don't love each other, but these stories encourage me to believe that we can be more loving toward all people.While this is catalogued as a children's book (ages 9-12), I believe it is a family book. Parents should read and discuss it with their children and teachers will develop lesson plans around it.

I don't know, I just don't like the idea behind a fake as hell sports game. Don't get me wrong I love the action, graphics, sound and easy gameplay but beyond that, I just didn't enjoy it like others would. This is fantasy sports to the max. Where on Earth can you see someone slide into second and give the 2nd baseman a ... whooping?I guess I just like a little realism to my sports games. I'd have to say rent this one first otherwise, you're wasting your money.

Unrealistic and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is boring","review":"The game has too many controls. It feels slow and gets boring after 2 innings. The pitching is awful, you either throw a ball, or the pitch over the middle of the plate. The fielding is bad, it is auto fielding."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game [stinks]!!","review":"This is one of the worst baseball games I have ever played. It is the blitz of baseball (i hate blitz with a passion). The pitching is terrible because you cannot tell where the ball is going or how much speed you can put on it as in Triple play 2002.Also the batting is etrocious and the fielding is even worse. I dont know how someone could give this game a good rating, and all the people i played it with said it [stinks} too. Some of the things in the game might be fun like having your bat on fire and hitting people, but I like a realistic baseball game and if you do to go for something else. I have played almost every good baseball game except for high heat if it is good. And the best one is triple play 2002. I say go for that or all star baseball 2003, both great games. But slugfest should be called [stink]fest 2003."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS GOOD AS PUT OUT TO BE!","review":"This game is the dumbest game ever made for sports. It is so unrealistic and none of it could happen. It's like the blitz video games and is not worth the money. The fighting is the best thing about it, but it's still really fake. I mean, the players catch on fire and the pitching is weird. Overall dont buy the game unless you like blitz games."},{"rating":"1","title":"only the good get good reviews","review":"its not real its too easy never buy it. buy world seires baseball its way beeter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book's OK, Amazon's price off by $10","review":"The book has a bunch of tips, roughly 2 per page, like the other books in the series. There's a mix of 3 kinds of tips -- ones that are common to other programs, like Illustrator and Photoshop, ones that are unique to InDesign, but either fairly obvious, or just uninteresting, and ones that are unique and non-obvious. There are enough of the latter to warrant buying the book, if you want to learn the shortcuts that make you efficient with the program. The CS series of programs no longer come with manuals by default, and the manuals that are available from Adobe by special order are much thinner than in past releases. So we're going to need books like this to reveal the shortcuts, especially those that don't have corresponding menu items!Note, however, that the current price Amazon is listing, $39.99, is off by $10, since the actual retail price of the book is only $29.99."},{"rating":"2","title":"InDesignCS Killer Tips","review":"If you are a new user or just switching to InDesign - YOU WANT THIS BOOKIf you make your living doing layouts - YOU NEED THIS BOOKThis is a case where haste does not make waste - it saves time and allows you to take on more work.... more work - more moneyIf you only remember half of the tips in this book you will save loads of time and, better still, save yourself from last minute crunches when a deadline approaches.BUY THE BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Known shortcuts, very small book high price","review":"I bought this book thinking I would find some shortcuts for ID CS. If you have no idea what you're doing in ID you might have some use from it. However, if you've bought the Visual Quickstart by Sandee Cohen or practically any other book on ID you will bu lucky if you find 4 or 5 undocumented shortcuts. A real ripoff in my opinion.

The binding, paper, and quality of print is marginal, especially for the price. This is not a high quality book by any definition. Additionally, the spine has already broken on this book and that happening with very little use. Very poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware, this book is probably NOT for you, real review","review":"If you look at the two other reviews for this book, you'd think it's great. But then look closer, one of the reviewers has only rated 5 books, and they are all about nudism. Each book got 5 out of 5 stars and a great review. So, if you are a person who is into the nudity movement, or a naturalist you will love this book. If you are not, it will fall flat. The other reviewer has only ever rated one book. Hmmm.From the standpoint of a photographer, or someone interested in photography, you will probably be disappointed. The work is very armature. The images tend to be very poorly exposed, lack good contrast and without the best composition. The idea is good, but the execution is lacking. He needs to take a basic photography class. He self published his book. Get a chance to look at it before you buy it, if you like it, good for you, otherwise beware, it's all about nudity and not about photography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived broken, but works...","review":"It arrived cracked in two, but after a little time with some Gorilla Glue it was good as new.

The songs are good, the message clear. The problem is, TST, for whatever reason, does not seem to give his \\"all\\" in live performances. He sounds like he's reciting the words, versus singing them with conviction. The same passion that's found in the studio albums is not found here.I hate to say it, because I've been a fan for years.This is a good \\"complete-your-collection\\" CD, but beyond that, there is little here to rejoice in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starting point!!","review":"I'm a jazz newbie, i know what i like when i hear it, so i'm not even going to try comment on the technicalities of the selection here. This is a 2 cd set! I bought this cd based on my love for the 2 compilers, Gilles Peterson and Jazzanova. They have made world, dance and jazz music accessible and introduced me to some great music. I am very happy with this purchase, the track listing provided here is missing some songs, refer to the cd itself for full track listings. Don't let the 2nd cd (modern jazz hybrids) deter you from getting this. It is just as good if not better than the 1st cd (old, classic jazz). Sure it's not pure jazz, but it's interesting and has jazzy elements. Jazz connosseuirs might skip this, understandably so, but for a newbie, this is an easy transition into the jazz genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original artists remakes","review":"These are songs done by the original artists in studio long after the original songs were released. It would have been nice if someone had said up front that these were remakes and not the originals. Some of the singers are still able to duplicate their original performance, like Gene Chandler's \\"Duke of Earl\\". Others, like Skeeter Davis' \\"The End of the World\\" is embarrassing to listen to, her voice is gone. If you like oldies, save your money on this one and buy the original hits."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the annoyance","review":"I wouldn't buy this thing again. We have it running a lamp next to the front door. There's no wall switch for that outlet, and the switch on the lamp is a bit cumbersome, so I thought the clapper would be a convenient way to turn on the light when returning home at night. It is, but the unit is way too sensitive. Maybe it's the acoustics of the room (hardwood floors), but just about anything will set it off. Ours has the adjustable sensitivity and even with it set fully to \\"home\\" mode (least sensitive) it gets triggered when not desired. It will eventually get scrapped when we get a different lamp with a more accessible switch, although I'm just about fed up enough to do away with it even before then."},{"rating":"2","title":"World Class - Awesome","review":"I came across this little known and hard-to-find book quite by accident. The title suggests simply another sex education book, but it is much, much more than that! It is truly an introduction and detailed lesson book on the human art of touching. It shows how touching can be used as communication - with youself, with your children, with friends, with patients, and yes, with your loved one - involving every part of the body. No academic tome, it is a reintroduction to life itself, and refines the meaning of intimacy! A manual if you like; only 120 pages, beautifully written and illustrated - A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE!Recommend it? FOR THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ripley Believes This Is Awesome","review":"I bought this for my boyfriend, and we both really enjoyed watching the movies.

The only movie not here is Predators, which can easily be bought somewhere else. You can see the chronology of the adventures of the Alien, the Predator, the good guys, the bad guys, and Weyland-Yutani. See who the heroes are, who the victims are, and how certain people or creatures were decieved, manipulated, or changed. You will have movies of multiple time periods, and different moods from 1980's, 1990's, 2000's, and the future. Along with extreme action, built in comedy, slight suspense, and classic horror.

I just don't care about those things. I simply want these movies. This pack has them. if you want to own these movies, this is a GREAT deal.If you care about what the director ordered for lunch on the 5th day of shooting, then spend twice the money and get the special super pack.

Many teenagers including Cassie Bernall has been through alot of pressure and personal problems of her own and has came out with exrodenary effort and never let it interfear with her and her family.She Said Yes is a really touching story . I think cassie is a very brave girl and i look uo to that and respect it , I think for Cassie standing up for what she belives in is very mature and respected by a lot of pepole including myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"She Said Yes","review":"She Said Yes by Misty Bernall is the best book I have ever read! Cassie is the protagonist in the book, she was at school when she was killed by three gunman. Misty Bernall uses lots of interesting words, that makes you feel like you are apart of the story. I think everyone would enjoy this book, because it makes your mouth water wondering what's going to happen next. I proudly give this book five stars because it is awsome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No she didn't...","review":"This is one of the most disturbing and depressing books to be published in a long time.Its now known that poor Cassie didn't say \\"yes\\" because she wasn't asked the question.So the book's title is simply a lie. All right, what about the contents? Well, they just summarise from a deeply predjudiced point of view how an ordinary (yet rather beautiful) teenage girl started going off the rails (expressing herself) and how her parents stepped in and using tough love (fear and anger) managed to persuade her to become (act like) a model christian teenager...Poor, poor, Cassie! Her short life was manipulated and controlled by dominering religious fundamentalists, and they've been equally successful in dominating and manipulating her death.Said by some to be inspiring and uplifting, this reader found it forced, artificial, and deeply depressing.There really are people out there who will do anything to turn a buck, especially if they can feel good about themselves while they do it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a Lie","review":"The whole premise of this book is a lie. Cassie Bernall was NEVER asked whether she believed in God. Eyewitnesses say it never happened, and the 911 tapes PROVE CONCLUSIVELY that this exchange never happened. The girl who actually WAS asked whether or not she believed in God was shot 9 times and survived. How about a little respect for her and FOR THE TRUTH???? At the time this book was published, the author and publisher both knew the truth but published a lie anyway. If it is your aim to draw people to Christianity with this book, you are most definitely having the opposite effect, by cementing the idea that Christians are fake hypocrites. Of course I feel for her mother. I am one myself and cannot even imagine the pain of losing a child. I'm sure Cassie was a hero for many, many reasons but don't just make one up or print a rumor you already know to be false. This is not shining a light. This is just wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"The even MORE unlikely martyrdom","review":"This book is not moving well in the neighborhood bookstores around the Columbine area, because everyone knows the truth is not contained between its covers. The girl who really DID say \\"Yes.\\" has suffered for the printing of this book. It was dishonest for the publisher to proceed with publication once the police informed them of the truth. This book does a grave disservice to the memory of Cassie Bernall, trying to force her into false martyrdom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factually Incorrect - Lies told by a grieving mother...","review":"This book is a fraud. The Columbine shooting was based on a lot of incorrect information. It is a sad deal that Cassie had to die, but her story is being exploited by the Christian right. This book should be filed under \\"Fiction\\". Do not read this book based on the premise it is a true story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"You shall not bear false witness against your Neighbor\\"","review":"The ninth commandment proclaims \\"You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.\\" It has been well proven that Cassie was never asked \\"the Question\\" that the exploiters of her death claim she was. Perhaps what Christians perceive as an intolerance of their faith stems from their arrogant view that their religion is the only true path to salvation and others (in fact the majority of people of faith)are wrong and will be eternally damned. Christian proselytizing also demonstrates this arrogance. Cassie was an victim of demented, hateful young men, not virulent anti-Christians. I would be interested in hearing from people defending this arrogance and hypocracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peek-a-boo! Don't let the truth get in the way of a good story.","review":"Sadly, it just ain't so.

She said nothing of the sort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cynical...","review":"I read this book and I have a right to my opinion.The negative reviews are disappearing. All the more proof that there are people who do not want the truth told. Cassie never \\"said yes\\" and this is conclusive from the witness sitting next to Cassie and witnesses near Val Schnurr, the girl who by all reports did answer \\"yes\\" when confronted by the gunmen. The only person who said Cassie \\"said yes\\" became physically ill when investigators confirmed that he was pointing in the direction of Val Shnurr's table, not Cassie's.But the point is to sell books and politicize a child's death. Regardless of what really happened. It's sad to see people profiting off of a tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE!","review":"No doubt the review below was written by one who will be making money from this.

Written by her mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids give these out at school","review":"I am a youth counselor. The kids in my youth group have funded and given away over 70 copies of this book at their public high school. Inside each book they have glued a little note that tells the reader to sign their name in the book and pass it on to a friend when they have finished. This way the message of Cassie's story lives on and on. We got the idea from a mother/daughter team in Ohio who are doing the same thing. Similar things are happening all over there are 500,000 copies in circulation now! It is a great book and it is changing lives. People who have been moved by it should spread the word to others.

Why should we be any less offended when someone fabricates the details of a tragedy in order to turn it into a commercial for Jesus?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"fiction through and through","review":"The fact that they used a title that is untrue should have been my first clue that this book was nothing but an attempt to cash in. What is between the covers is almost worse. Satanic rituals where kitten blood is drank? PALEEESE! Did the lady bother to even research satanic rituals or did she just make everything up for it's shock value? All I can truly say is after reading this, I'm counting my blessings that this overbearing, delusional, self-centered, hypocritical and dishonest woman is not MY mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WRINKLE IN TRUTH","review":"As many writers have pointed out, the \\"trial by faith\\" aspect of this story is complete fiction. More distressing, the authors knew this and chose to perpetrate the lie anyway.However, Misty Bernall is one of the most compelling monsters in contemporary fiction. The idea of a child entrusted to her care is more chilling than any high school shooting.Madeline L'Engle did so much fine work. It is truly a shame that she would fall in with such bad company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prophaganda...","review":"I have one point that I'd like to make before anyone else starts spouting prophaganda about this book.

It's the title of the book! If actual facts are irrelevant why not title the book: \\"She said yes, in Latin, and then spat in his face!\\" And even more troubling, where was this \\"god\\" in the library? Waiting for everyone in heaven? Having lunch with Santa?

It will provide answers for dealing with a difficult teenager."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Impressed As Some","review":"I finished SHE SAID YES in a very short amount of time. However, my opinion of this book is not as high as many others. I feel sorry for the Bernall family as they grieve the loss of their daughter but I feel that this book was written too soon. I feel that many times Misty rambles and jumps from one subject to another. Perhaps this is in part to her own wounds from April 20th not being completely healed. I also feel that she does a disservice by not confronting the issue that Cassie probably did not get the chance to say anything to her assasins that day. I reccommend the powerful books \\"Rachel's Tears\\" and \\"The Martyr's Torch\\" for more comprehensive and non-biased reading on the life of Columbine students. I do beleive in the life changing grace of God that occurred in Cassie Bernall's heart but found Misty's retelling self serving and sometimes incoherrent."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was an inspiration for me regardless of what she said","review":"Why are there all these reviews as to whether Cassie said yes or not. This book isn't just about what she said, it's about how she lived. It brings hope to parents who feel there's no way to reach their child anymore. It's an inspiration and encouragement to me to know that I had a lot in common with Cassie before she died. She struggled in her relationship with God too, and at times felt she was at a standstill, just as I was feeling at the time of reading it. It really helped me knowing that someone with a such an intricate story, as Cassie's, had a lot of the same struggles as me. But what helps me most of all is that she was able to pull through them, and this book offers hope to me. Regardless of \\"what she said\\", this book is an encouragement to parents and teens about the struggles that teenagers face."},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest, courageous story!","review":"I have read this book several times, and this book has never grown stale. Misty Bernall was brave enough to put Cassie's story down on paper in order to let the world know who she was, and what she'd escaped from before her transformation. I'm convinced that if Cassie's parents had ignored the letters plotting their deaths, they would have been dead, and Cassie and the friends planning their murders would have been dead as well. It would have been a much sadder story to read in the papers, and Cassie would have been forgotten.Instead, she's being remembered in a much more hopeful, inspiring way.ALSO! If anyone has any info about some of the classmates that Cassie went to school with before Columbine, please e-mail me at debwood_1999@1coolplace.com.

Listening to satanic music, witchcraft, and even substance abuse. It was a loving mother and father that turned the tables for Cassie. Cassie became involved with her chruch youth group, and though she at times felt that she didn't fit in, she was connecting with God. And though some believe that she did'nt actually say \\"yes\\". I for one believe that she did, her friend reconized her voice. Because she and Val Schnurr had been praying when the killers approached her. That is also one of the reasosn they shot Val as well, however Val was lucky to survive and Cassie was not. Good book however, I was much more impressed with the book Rachel's tears, the story of Rachel Scott."},{"rating":"2","title":"review","review":"I enjoyed reading this book.

I was also surprised to read her story; that she wasn't the student i potrayed her as before i opened the book, her story, her life wasn't perfect in the years growing up. She had her own trouble and rebellions as a teen and finally found God."},{"rating":"1","title":"She didn't say yes.....","review":"The more I read about Cassie Bernall, the impression I get is of a young woman whos parents, in the name of \\"tough love\\", victimised their daughter. When she attempted to define herself and her own spirituality, her parents denied her that right, forced her into a virtual re-education camp, and turned her into a little parrot of their beliefs. And all this book shows is that the Bernall's victimization of their daughter continues after her tragic death. Violating their own faith by bearing false witnesses against the one who truely spoke out for her faith and spirituality, they create an urban myth out of their daughter's \\"Martyrdom\\". The true martyr here is the truth. We'll never know what the truth of Cassie's beliefs and her true spirituality. All I hope though is she's safe and happy in the arms of what she, in her heart of hearts, held as a Creator. As for her parents, their own actions condemm them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for all ages. Cassie's life & death will touch you","review":"I am a slow reader but this book is easy to read and will change your life in that you will be able to say Yes. She would have been 18 on November 6th. So young but she accomplished so much by being sold out to Christ. People are experiencing changed lifes by one person saying yes. The true example of what Christ did for all of us on the cross 2000 yrs ago, he too said yes. Thank you Cassie and Cassie's mom Misty for this book. This is one of those books that you could buy and read the last chapter and feel touched, changed and a true love for Cassie and her family and friends. See you in Heaven Cassie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange","review":"I find it rather disturbing that so many people seem to applaud Cassie's parents for basically forcing her to conform to their religious beliefs as part of their \\"tough love\\". So is it wrong that she was interested in the occult and dressed in dark clothing? Did she need to be forced into accepting Jesus Christ in her life in order for others to see her as a upstanding normal girl? I believe that people should be allowed to make their own choices in life, especially when it comes to very personal things like religion. I think that this book has its merits in describing the life of an interesting young woman, but I think it is more interesting to see how her parents reacted to her earlier lifestyle and how that reaction is a shadowy reflection of the mindset that seems to have driven her killers to do the things that they did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Michaevillian","review":"The notion of this book not being true but being good because Cassie said Yes many times before and the end justifies the means is pretty Michaevillian. If it isn't true than it should go under fiction, a story based on the Life of A Girl who Said Yes.I borrowed this book from a friend. While everyone was raving, I was unimpressed. If only for the occult letters and recipies for how to murder her parents that are illustrated here (which she had prior to her dramatic save by Jesus Christ! )you know the book is goofy. If this describes most teenagers, then Littleton will be known for it's bizarre teens as much as Salem is for it's witches."},{"rating":"2","title":"she said yes","review":"She said Yes jennyCassie was at the age of 14 when she was going to die. One day a man came up to her when tare's men were acting her school. On asked her if she believed in god. She said yes and he blew her head off from there. Now before any of this happened her mother heard that her school was under act. She got really worried. So she called their dad, which was at home. She told him to look over the fence. To see if Cassie's school is getting acted. So he looked over the fence. He was very sapriced to see cops helicopters, ambulances, there. So he called her back and told her the bad news."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Only the Positive, but also the Negative","review":"First of all, I highly recomend this book to Christians and non Christians. This book shows how Cassie went from being a bad girl to being a God loving teenager. Also, this book is for teenages of all races, religions, and backrounds. It may just help you find your path in life. It helped me to relize how much my faith means to me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"teen looking for truth","review":"hello, Like many teens I was looking for an answer, and answer about god. I wanted to know if he was real, I read most of this book I had not wanted to at first but my friend told me I had to. the book did not affect me until I saw a play at our babtist church put on by a collage. As I saw the man that played cassie's father start to loose his stength he had most his life. It really hit me that my life could end shortly. With the way I was going I could have ended up like mona her freind. But after seeing and reading the book and play it really hit me I HAVE to do more with my life as a christain. I could be the line for someone between life and death. Read this book and you will feel and know what the family felt."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST READ","review":"Reading this book as a High school student, It really does hit you right at the heart. It makes yoiu question if you would do the same, if you would stand up for what you believe in. The book at times seemed to be depressing to the point where you didnt know if you wanted to contiue on reading, but their was something their telling you to keep on going. In 1 night I read all 140 pages of the book in the middle of my busy High School schedule. Once you start the book its so hard to put it down. I would reccomend this book to any teen or any adult who is looking for a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"While the Columbine Incident was truly a disaster, and I feel terrible for all who died, this book isn't worth reading. This book is basically a mother, undoubtedly upset with the unfortunate death of her daughter, trying to put a positive spin on her life. It details all her struggles with different social groups and changing schools to make things better for her. As to whether or not she actually said 'yes' I'm not sure. I would give it the benefit of the doubt, but she apparently, by the details of her life, was not a very devout believer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title of his book is krok!","review":"Why would Misty Bernall sink so low and authorize (the publication) about her daughter's alleged admission in her belief in God when she was being killed by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold last year. In fact another one of the victims, someone who survived the massacre, said yes. Misty Bernall is as low as the parents of JonBenet Ramsey, just trying to make fame and money off of her daughter's tragic death. I really think Ms. Bernall and the publishers should have thought twice in writing this book because this has caused much distress to a lot of people, including the young person who was in the library at the same time [of the massacre] and who actually said yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a shame that it's all a lie","review":"It has been proven that she never said 'yes' since the gunmen didn't ask her if she was a Christian. Instead of listening to the FBI and law enforcement officials a whole group of people are clinging to this story and using it as a cause to get behind.I find it sick,and sad, that there are people out there who beleive the whole 'goths are evil' media hype. Cassie was never 'goth'. She was just a teen who saw what the media's interpretation of goth was and decided to follow it like a lemming. If she was angry, depressed and listened to Marilyn Manson then she was nothing more than a normal angsty teen. It's sad that she died but the people using this book as a platform for hate disgust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont read","review":"this book was, to put it nicely, horrible. i was forced to read it, and must say it was one of the worst books i have ever read. the only reason i think it has gotten good reviews is people feel sorry for those who died at columbine. i do to, even though countless children die each day, but that doesnt make this book worthwhile at all. im not even sure i believe this girl really \\"said yes\\" if you want to read a book about columbine there is another book about a girl who told the killers she believed in God. her name was rachel something and i thought it was much better. and if you want to read a book about teenage problems and overcoming them or whatever, there are SO many better books. its only good point was that it was a fairly fast read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless exploitation based on a misunderstanding","review":"As many of you know, the very premise of this book is wrong. It had been shown that Cassie did NOT say what she was credited with saying. She did not stand up to the killers with her strong faith. This means that the very reason for writing the book is gone. Both the authors and the publisher were aware of this before they printed the book, YET THEY PRINTED IT ANYWAY.This is a sad attempt to capitalize on the Columbine shootings and promote Christianity. But truth cannot come through lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lie","review":"This book is propaganda. It is not true - \\"She\\" never \\"said yes\\". This word \\"martyrdom\\" in the title is entirely misleading - a martyr dies for a purpose, for something s/he believes in. I'm sure Cassie was a very nice girl - but not a martyr. She died in an act of senseless violence. The fact that her very own mother is capitalizing on the death of her daughter is disgusting to me. It is sad that so many Christians rally behind this book without checking the facts first."},{"rating":"2","title":"read this remarkable book before you criticize!","review":"For those of you who are inclined to dismiss this book becauseof recent controversies surrounding details about Cassie's death,consider this, please:1. The book is a remarkable story, told by a grieving mother, about how she saved her daughter. It is not about the events of April 20. Cassie said yes many times before April 20. Read the book.2. I know Misty Bernall, and I know details about what happened to Cassie that are not being reported by the Bernalls. Thankfully, there is new information available now responding to the critics who have been quick to discredit Cassie's powerful story. One is an article by a journalist who spent time in Littleton in the months after the shooting, and another is a comment written by the person who edited the book which Misty Bernall wrote. Read them both."},{"rating":"2","title":"She Said Yes","review":"The novel She Said Yes by Misty Bernall was very touching and was one to always keep my attention. I was given the book as a gift from my parents after the Columbine High School shooting in 1999. The first day I started to read the novel it took everything of me to put it down. I beleive that Cassie's testimony was an ecouragement to every young teenager, christian or non-christian. Since her mother wrote the story, the little details like how Cassie's mind set changed from being suicidal, to giving her life over to Christ really stuck out in the novel. I was in middle school when I read the book and still have read it numerous times. Everyone, young or old, should take time out to read the novel of Cassie's strong faith and let it make an impact on your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This a story of true faith and love. We wer all shocked when the news stories flashed pictures of the school and its students in 1999. I remember being 11 years old and feeling numb that a beatiful young 17 year old, was shot simply because she told the shotters that yes she did beleive in God. Some of the revies of this book say that it is false and not well written. They are very wrong!!! This book containes stories from the girl who sat and watched her best friend asked if she believed in God and then shot because she said one word yes. I loved this story, it tells the true story of Cassie a young girl who wanted to do one thing in life. Please her father."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshingly honest book","review":"I applaud Misty Bernhall on her honesty. In just everyday life we find parents covering their parenting flaws and their children's flaws. How refreshing it is to find someone in the spotlight being open and honest about their life!The point of it all is that it really isn't about whether or not she said yes at the moment in question. She tried to live her life as one giant yes. Let's face it being a teenager is hard enough on its own with all the changes physically and emotionally. But add true convictions and morals now that its not cool to do so and that adds up to an agonizing struggle. This book takes us behind the headlines and news bites and makes Cassie human.I really appreciate Mrs. Bernhall opening up her life and not trying to candy-coat it. This book really touched my heart and started me thinking about when my own children will be teenagers and the steps I can take now to help them when they get there."},{"rating":"1","title":"she didn't even say yse","review":"is there no end to the ways people will try to cash in on the LIE about Cassie the martyr?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The mysterie","review":"She said yes is about a girl named Cassie. Cassie faces many difficulties in her life such as drinking and smoking ect... Until she meets the Lord. Cassie face's a big question that could take her life. I love this book because of all the action it contains. Mrs. Bernall did an awesome job with this book. Is she going to die? Is her parents going to die? What will happen next? read the book and find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a Memoir","review":"A memoir, told in various perspectives of the life of Cassie, a victim of the Columbine shooting in 1999. With a gun to her head, she was asked if she believed in God, and she said, \\"yes,\\" becoming a modern-day martyr. This book would appeal most to Christians and parents as well as anyone looking for where they fit on a spiritual path. This book does not sensationalize what she did and provides a very balanced look at her life, and thus leads to reflection on one's own."},{"rating":"2","title":"She Did Say Yes.","review":"I have to wonder if people woulddoubt what Cassie said before shewas brutally murdered by those little%^*('s if she had been a Muslim orJewish instead of a(gasp!)Christian.A couple of years ago on the tv show20/20(I think),they played an audiotape that a student had recorded thelast moments of poor Cassie Bernallon.You can clearly hear the killersapproach Cassie Bernall and hear themasking her if she gave bible classes and such.She was frightened and crying and she didn'tsay anything at first,the killers thenproceeded to spout hate-filled remarksagainst God and Jesus and the bible andagainst religion in general but especiallyagainst Christianity.Then they askedCassie if she believed in God and that's whenshe stopped crying and shaking with fear,she looked those two bastards in the eye andsaid \\"Yes.\\" And that's when they emptiedtheir guns into her. When our turn comeswill WE be as brave and true? I wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Divine Novel!!!!","review":"She Said Yes is a great novel about the human spirit & how people can be totally turned around.How a person can sacrifice everything including their life for their devotion to God.She said Yes is a beautiful novel that is a joyous tribute to someone willing to stand up for what they believe in at any cost.This book will cause you to reflect on your own life & how you're living.It's a wonderful story of how a girl can go from being darkened to loving God unrelentlessly .I loved this book so much & it was really worth reading & owning for few books can be that good & make all your emotions come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"she said nothing","review":"Of course, that's the sad reality and I guess I can understand why people distort it. It's not that comforting because it doesn't offer the simple vindication and easy to swallow narrative that fiction does. But fiction presented as reality can potentially be dangerous. I'd say this is the case with this book. This is a sad tragedy, made even sadder by the complete victimization that took place. The truly awful thing is - this book only lays the foundation for this heinous act to happen again.Christian martyrdom and victimhood only militarizes individuals who spread intolerance. Intolerance spreads hate. Hate causes actions such as this to take place. Is there any wonder that all school shootings took place in right-wing Christian areas?"},{"rating":"2","title":"moving and thought provoking","review":"I finished this book over 3 weeks ago and couldn't put it down until I had finished it. It was a very powerful 2 hours at which I would find myself crying. I don't believe the message is to doubt whether or not Cassie said \\"yes\\" but whether or not YOU have the faith to believe in God and to always put God first in your life. I have passed this book on to my Mom and she has passed it on to others....hopefully down the line it will touch each person as it has touched me. To re-examine my own life and my relationship with Christ and how I will help my two beautiful sons grow up to be spiritually wonderful people."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Will Change Your Life!","review":"When I first heard about this book I knew that I had to read it! It changed my life and it made me think about things in a different way and not to jugde people and go and reach the unreachable! So I would recommend this book to anyone! Enjoy:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's true: no teenager should ever be considered \\"lost.\\"","review":"If nothing else, this gripping account of just one of the fifteen students at Columbine High School reminds us that no teenager should ever be considered \\"lost.\\" Cassie was apparently no angel: instead, she was a thankless, even murderous, daughter, who despised her parents and dabbled in witchcraft. Even more amazing than her death is the story of how her parents fought back: how they dared to step in and take control of a situation that had long ago spiraled beyond their reach. That Cassie died so soon after being \\"saved\\" must hurt her parents more than anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misty's story touched my heart!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It's all about the Columbine shootings written by Mrs.Bernall in memory of her daughter Cassie. Cassie was shot and killed at Columbine. It was a real loss because she had worked so hard to change her life and was successful. She had so much to live for. I really liked this book because it's real and it makes you feel like you were there in the library and with her. It really shows you how something like that can effect everyone. I think that girls in 7th grade and older will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"This book is powerful,and real. It takes you through the struggle of light and darkness. Parents that love there child enough to change there life style for the sake of there daughter. They were willing to say no which enabled there daughter to say \\"Yes\\" This is a must read book it will change your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cynical","review":"I was shocked to find this book sitting on the selves at my local bookstore the other day. The fact that someone would write a book about a situation that has even the remote possibility of not being true is beyond foolish."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Big Lie","review":"It's sad that so many young people are reading this book and believing it to be true. Folks, it just didn't happen. Even worse, her parents knew it didn't happen when the book was published. Shame on them. Read the news reports for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, it is about what she said","review":"It is most certainly about what she said. It is ONLY about what she said. This title was chosen to sell books and it is misleading. Nothing in this book comes across as honest. Not only are they making money on this book, they have an entire web site promoting the fact that she supposedly said yes. They sell t-shirts, hats, bracelets, etc. I don't believe that ALL proceeds go to charity. (They only have to donate a tiny percentage to be able to say it.) Mommy travels on this money and she certainly isn't holding down any other job now that she's raking it in from the book and it's aftermath. It is an ugly thing to make money off this, especially if you are the mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant example of Christian myth-making","review":"As a contemporary demonstration of how religious myths are created, this book has no equal. When this book was written, the authors undoubtedly believed that Cassie was killed because she affirmed her faith in God when it mattered most. They wrote an extremely moving and loving book, intended to be nonfiction. Millions of people now believe the myth, though objective evidence is now quite clear that it was another victim who said yes -- and was promptly spared, not killed. Read this book as an awe-inspiring exemplar of how powerful myths are created and believed, even when they are precisely opposite to the truth. Read it as a tribute of a loving mother for her daughter. Read it as a story of the trials of growing up in modern America. Read it as a cautionary tale of how easily religion can induce believers into falsehood. Read it as all of these, and more, but I suggest that you not try to read it as the true story of a Christian martyrdom."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Tragic STory","review":"I feel that this story was just a way to cash in on a person who altimitly died, well rather tragically. I think the author made up a lot of things and as we all know, she didnt say yes, some other girl did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational, what really happend, and the after effects.","review":"Wonderful book. Page turner. Can't put it down. Tells what really happend at Columbine. And how people must deal with the loss of thier family and friends. She wasn't an angel, only stood, most likely scared, of what she believed in the most. I highly recommend reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting and heart touching","review":"This book gets to you it helped me see a lot of things about my relationship with God and other. It showed me that someone also had the same questions about god that I did, and helped to find some answers. It proves that in the face of terror you can be strong and say \\"Yes\\" to God. What Cassie did was very admirable even though she thought that she was normal and should not be recognized for doing this, how many people do you think would answer the same without remorse. In conclusion this book is special it changed me in away I had never expected, and hopefully it can help you in your journey with Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cretinously vile right-wing Christian pabulum","review":"This shameful piece of fundamentalist-propaganda-for-dollars is exceeded in fatuousness only by those unthinking reviewers here who embrace it.\\"...
