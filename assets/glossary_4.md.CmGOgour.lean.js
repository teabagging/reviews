It is so easy to be complacent about what we see and experience, never questioning other possibilities. This was an eye opener. What if we're like the square or the poor dot? Worse yet, what if we're like the smug sphere who preaches to lower dimensions but can't see beyond his own?"},{"rating":"1","title":"quite boring","review":"Unless you are a math teacher or enthusiast this book can put you to sleep.

I am going to review this e-edition of the book.I downloaded many free versions of Flatland and they all lacked the REQUIRED accompanying illustrations. This edition includes all illustrations in the proper format at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"One of the better books I have read. If you notice the parallels to social warfare in book one, you will find it absolutely hilarious. I would suggest this to anyone who likes math. It definitely helped me quite a bit in multivariable calculus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exponentially entertaining!","review":"Keep in mind that this book was written over a hundred years ago, and consider the incredible ground it covers with this little tale: geometry (obviously), physics, government, politics, the clash between the sexes, class structures, manners, human nature, psychology, philosophy and even neuroscience (consciousness)! At first reading, it's deceptively simple, but explain it out loud to someone else and you'll find yourself noticing new things. If something doesn't seem to make sense, ask yourself \\"why?\\" This story is an allegory, a metaphor for so many things that fall into disjunct categories. There's a reason for the weird; the \\"bump\\" is there to make you take notice. Read it, think about it, give it some time and you'll be on your way to understanding the incredible range of this tiny work."},{"rating":"1","title":"very basic","review":"I heard the audio book of Flatland and I found it very basic in terms of Geometry. I did like the author's creativity in creating the 1- and 2-dimensional world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curious","review":"This book could have been reduced to ten pages. Great for for someone with a third grade education. May be that was the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"When a good idea goes bad...","review":"Flatlandwas one of my finds on my recent short-novels hunt. I was intrigued by the premise - a comparative story of different lands, each of which features a different number of dimensions - and by the fact that its author had written the book in the 1800s, long before Einstein's theory of relativity and theories of time as the fourth dimension were common parlance. It was written by a non-mathematician and non-scientist. And it was only 75 pages long! I figured I had all the ingredients for a great, interesting, informative - and above all else, quick - read. Not so, she said. It took me forever to finish this extraordinarily short book, and it was a huge disappointment. It was rambling, overly technical (I do grudgingly have respect for this aspect, even if I did not enjoy the book overall), and (no pun intended) oddly flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Relatively Little Mathematical Heft","review":"A whimsical introduction to the concepts of multidimensional mathematics, this book is very much the product of the 1880's Victorian era in which it was written. In a preface to the book entitled \`\`Limitations'', Isaac Asimov writes, \`\`This book, then, should lead us to question the limitations we set to our Universe generally, not only those that are mathematical and physical, but those that are sociological as well.''Indeed, this book taught me more about the backward attitudes of Victorian society than it did about mathematics. It does a nice job of illustrating what it means to project, say, 4-dimensional space into 3 dimensions, by starting from physical concepts we can grasp, namely, the projection of 3-space into 2 dimensions. However, if you're already familiar with such concepts, there's not much else here to recommend this one. The anachronistic references are just too distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flatland-the edition with blue squares on the cover","review":"This edition of Flatland has all of the diagrams made with the keystrokes of a typewriter, not with continuous lines. So the squares, triangles , circles , etc, are illegible. Since the many diagrams are an indispensible part of the book, this edition is completely useless. I bought four copies of this edition for gifts and had to trash them all. Flatland is a very well written, profound, thought provoking discourse of our inability to comprehend life in more dimentions than the three that we occupy, and it is a shame that this edition, well done in all other aspects, contains this fatal flaw, rendering it junk. Do not buy this edition. There are many other far better editions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating book in which the characters are shapes","review":"Flatland is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. The characters of the book are lines and geometric shapes. The main character lives in a two dimensional world, then is exposed to the third dimension. Returning to the second dimension, his heightened knowledge is marginalized. Overall, the book reminds me of Plato's allegory of the cave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Budget Buy","review":"Don't you just love it when classic recordings get reissued on CD at a budget price?! Such is the case with this title in the \\"Universal Classics\\" series featuring Weber Overtures and the Clarinet Concerto No. 1, originally made in the mid 1960s for Deutsche Grammophon. I fell in love with conductor Rafael Kubelik years ago after being introduced to his recordings of Dvorak, and he produces the same glowing results here. Of course performing with his beloved Bavarian RSO on the Overtures, and the Berlin Philharmonic, with soloist Karl Leister on the Concerto, ensures performances of the highest quality. With classical budget lines beginning to inexplicably disappear (like Sony's \\"Essential Classics\\" series -- what's up with that?!), I'm delighted that UNI has made these great recordings available again at such an inexpensive price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply great music","review":"I discovered these recordings many years ago on an Eterna LP. I was really happy to see them released on CD, although they took their sweet time to make it happen. This may be a budget CD, but don't let that fool you - it offers what I think should be reference interpretations of its pieces. It is ADD, but I find the sound engineering to be excellent.If you don't know Weber's music, this is a great place to start - this is accessible and energic music that is easy to appreciate from the first listening. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST JAZZ RECORDINGS EVER!","review":"Disc 2, which I knew many years ago as the \\"Don Shirley Trio\\" LP album, is incredible (which is not to slight in the least Disc 1, \\"Plays Love Songs\\"). Shirley has an inimitable style, and \\"Waterboy\\" is one of the great classics of jazz and belongs in the Jazz Hall of Fame, if it isn't there already. \\"This Nearly Was Mine\\" is one of the most poignant renditions you will ever hear -- if you've ever loved and lost, you can just feel your heart cracking on this cut (he gets you with his pauses every time). \\"By Myself\\" is another of my favorites on this album. As for Disc 1, curl up on the couch by the fire with someone you care about, and savor together the beauty of Shirley's mastery. You will never regret buying any album he's ever recorded!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be confused--this DVD version is the remastering!","review":"I've loved this film for decades and lived with the wretched old 16mm Blackhawke print (to tape and later to DVD) because of the outstanding film making it is. Whether you think it's preachy or passionate, the direction, art direction and performances are outstanding.Anyway, don't be confused. This is a remastering from 35mm originals found in some vault somewhere (no details offered on packaging or disc). I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because there's no restoration here--just remastering. Still, it's wonderful to see more detail and better contrast come through. There might even be a snippet or two that aren't in the previous version--can't be sure.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated English Science Fiction","review":"This film to many viewers today will seem dated today.Alexader Korda direction is a little stage like andMenzies Special Effects are a somewhere between an erector set and a model rail road.Yet the story requires multiple viewings.It is a near perfect moral tail that still echos in todays news.As to \\"COLORIZED VERSION\\" #79654There is \\"NO\\" Ray Harryhausen running Commentary!There is what amounts to two featurettes containing almost containing the same interview clips (sometimes taken with different camera angles)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some things are best left to memory","review":"I saw this film when I was an 11 year old boy, and was profoundly impressed. I wish I had left the memory untouched.By today's standards, this film creaks badly. The story doesn't hold water, and the political philosophy is pure fascism. The acting was way over the top.A severe disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"Sorry folks, but this movie is only good for the production design, which itself only gets interesting about an HOUR into the film. The characters are negligable and vaguely fascist; the story boring, pretentious, and didactic; and the pacing is glacial. I frankly think that this film's supporters are mainly lured in by a sort of nostalgia for this era of film, more than the film itself. When I rented the VHS of this way back when, it mentioned on the box that it was the Star Wars of its time (it was not, neither in popularity nor quality). Finally, I love old sci-fi movies. Really! It's just that this one sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time and money","review":"I have no idea why this film is lauded and feted as a great classic, as it has to be one of the worst films I have ever wasted my time on.The various scenes and sets look like they were made in a model workshop and are on the same level as Thunderbirds and other Gerry Anderson films.Then there is the very annoying habit of the main \\"actors\\" shouting their lines instead of speaking with normal voices.Maybe they think they were still in the theater when this alleged film was made?The irritatingly over dramatic music that plays over a lot of the film, even for scenes/moments for which there is no drama, becomes draining and sould sapping and it is very distracting.This film ranks, IMO, only 2nd to the worst film in history - The Seventh Seal.Don't waste your money or time."},{"rating":"1","title":"DATED!","review":"This film is just overall dated. Although I respect the foretelling of actual events that did take place in history, the movie itself is just not up to standards anymore and I cannot relate to it, sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy the Image Entertainment DVD","review":"I just want to reiterate the comments below that this new Image Entertainment DVD release is by far the finest version of this sci-fi classic that I've ever seen. Though not perfect, it towers above the many public domain versions that have been floating around over the years. Though occasionally a bit pompous, this memorable film is justifiably notable for its striking production design--the futuristic portion may be the part everyone remembers but the design of the post-apocalyptic Everytown by William Cameron Menzies is just as impressive. \\"Things To Come\\" is a worthy addition to one's sci-fi DVD collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madacy DVD ruins classic movie","review":"I guess you get what you pay for. I would recommend AGAINST buying the Madacy Entertainment version of Things To Come. This inexpensive DVD uses an extremely poor print of the original movie and is very hard to watch. I've learned my lesson and bought the Image Entertainment version. It's significantly more expensive, but the quality of the print is SO much better that's it's very much worth it.As far as the movie itself? Gotta have it! This is a classic that should be in every Sci-Fi fan's collection. It's full of bang-on predictions, wonderful 1930's art-deco imagery and that amazing pre-WWII sense of mankind being able to pull itself through to a technological utopia - even to see that tarnished in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb!","review":"This is a must for film buffs!

The long wait for another album from Lisa Loeb, was simply that. Long, with with much anticiaption. So, with \\"Cake and Pie\\" and \\"Hello Lisa,\\" many people were excited, especially to hear what has been going on in that musical head of Lisa's. \\"Hello Lisa\\" is amazing satisfying. While she maintains the beautiful and poetic lyrics that started with \\"Tails,\\" she seems to have taken on a few extra ideas musically. Not quite oh-so-folk as \\"Tails,\\" but more so than \\"Firecracker.\\" However, its still enough of the singer's sound as when she first began to draw in avid fans and give them satisfaction and make them smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"I must have missed the fine print. I didn't realize this album was just a rehash of the last one. What a rip-off! Do not waste your money on this CD if you have the last one. The back of the CD states that unauthorized duplication is a violation. Read the fine print, Lisa."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Lisa Loeb has been my favorite artist since 1994, but this is her worst album yet. Except for a select few, this album is nothing compared to \\"Tails\\", her first and best. If you want to hear good music, check that one out instead; this one's not worth your [money]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Lisa","review":"I went looking for Lisa Loeb's first CD 'Tails'. Instead of 'Tails' they had this, and I had to buy it... well because of the cute cover. At first listen I didn't really care for this CD but the more you listen to it, the more it grows on you. Sort of, anyway. My favorite song on this album is 'Someone You Should Know'. I don't know why but I think the chorus sounds like a choir singing in the background. Other average-okay songs include: 'What Am I Supposed To Say' (the accoustic version) and 'The Way It Really Is'. But pretty much the rest of the album isn't that great. It isn't exactly bad, just kinda...blah. I wouldn't reccomend this album to anyone unless you're a Lisa Loeb fanatic. Her debut cd 'Tails' is a little better, but not that much. I don't think I'll be buying anymore Lisa Loeb CDs in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job, Lisa!","review":"Lisa Loeb does a fantastic job of mixing sensitive lyrics with catchy melodies. The new songs on \\"Hello Lisa\\" are some of the best songs of the year - it certainly beats the mindless hip-grinding tunes by the likes of Christina Aguilera and Justin Timberlake.Lisa Loeb may have been overlooked throughout the past few years, but that does not mean her talent has waned. If anything, she has perservered and improved upon her art, churning out not only songs, but rather stories. \\"Take Me Back\\" tells the story of a friendship on the verge of breaking down, and \\"What Am I Supposed To Say\\" chronicles what it's like to be caught between warring lovers... definately not your typical 'I can't live without you' love songs.Overall : Good Job, Lisa, and we hope to be seeing more of you in years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Kept Secret In Show Biz","review":"This CD is a nice contrast to all the mind numbing boy-band, baby doll singing no talent stars the late 90's and early 00's have produced.

Thumbs down! What a disappointment! I listen to their other cd's all the time but this one is not worth listening to. The lyrics are very shallow.

It's been boiled down to show biz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can it get more shallow?","review":"I'm sorry, but this CD is terrible. First of all the music itself is bland and processed, however, more importantly, the band's lyrics are very shallow. The Newsboys had some good early stuff, the band expressed good Christian values and advice. Now the band seems to be marketing their faith. The Newsboys said that \\"it's a feel-good approach to faith -- hey, everyone, come on in and join the party!\\" A Christian life is a life of service and submission to God's will. In 2 Tim., the Bible says that anyone who wants to live a godly life will be persecuted -- doesn't sound like much of a \\"party.\\" Living for God is the most rewarding thing you will ever do, but the \\"feel-good, God is my pillow\\" view on Christianity the Newsboys sing about neglects some of the fundamental aspects of the faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Newsboys have gone down hill","review":"There live shows are still great, but sence the loss of their lead singer/song writer (ie. The last two albums) the band has been loosing some of its creative christian genius. This CD is a big dissapointment considering what they have supplied fans with in the past. They just don't have that same Newsboys fans that listeners who have followed them through the years love them for. Trust God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Newsboys Do It Again!","review":"These guys just can't stop! The boys from Down Under began blowing the christian music world away nearly a decade ago and they just keep doing it! This is yet another album to add to your Newsboys collection.

So keep it up boys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff!","review":"Newsboys are truly one-of-a-kind in the world of Christian music. The latest album the \\"boys\\" have come up with, \\"Love, Liberty, Disco\\" is an amazing piece of work. From \\"Beautiful Sound\\" to \\"Fall on You\\" this album is incredible! The lyrics of the songs give a message about God's love and spreading the Good News to a fallen world. all-in-all there is a lot of \\"Good Stuff\\" flowing in this album.

Newsboys are my fav. band and when I bought this cd I thought it was pretty much a waste of money. I have all there albums and I am most likely one of there biggest fans. and I say Excluding \\"read all about it\\" this is the biggest disappointment. I liked 1 song, and that was \\"break\\" if it didn't have that awesome song I would rate this album one star!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When I'm in the mood for slow music. . .","review":"I listen to this CD! It has good lyrics and on most of the tracks the music and vocals are good, too. Especially for writing the whole CD in a week! The biggest problem with this album is that Peter Furler either slurs his words or sings through something that makes the words very hard to understand. This would be okay if the lyrics were in the jacket. The lyrics that are in the jacket are the first draft of the song, meaning that alot of the lines are different. There aren't any lyrics for \`Say You Need Love' at all. The best tracks on this CD are: \`Forever Man', \`Break', and \`Beautiful Sound', in that order. This record is full of happy tunes that are reflective on how wonderful God is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe just not my style","review":"I really enjoyed their other cds, but this cd just didn't appeal to me at all. I went to a couple of their concerts, and I didn't enjoy their 'disco' one very much. It just seems like they are re-inventing the wheel in this CD. Though I like the band itself and their Christian stance is commendable, I was thoroughly disappointed in this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very different but very worthy!","review":"This album struck me by suprise. I had to get used to the disco sound on this album but the songs themeselves stand alone. The sound on this album is much more tame than their previous work and I'd say a little predictable considering that the Newsboys are known to be surprising when it comes to guitar licks, chords, whatever! However, I don't think it takes away from the purchase. The album is very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money - skip this CD... What's the big secret?","review":"First off, big Newsboys fan here, so this is a review from someone who likes their tunes. But...If I had it to do over again, I would have skipped this CD. It's nothing special. From the weak tunes (where's the big sound we heard on previous Newsboys CD's?), to the completely unreadable lyrics in the CD sleeve, to the muffled spiritual overtures in the songs, I have to say about this CD: \\"what's the secret?\\". This one does not compare to previous Newsboys efforts...a real disappointment.One could hardly tell that from the music on this CD that its a Christian album, especially compared to the very vocal faith in previous Newsboys CD's.However, I'll go see them in concert - hopefully the stage show can make up for this very weak CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, Liberty Disco","review":"I just wanted to comment on everyone's comments --Every single Newsboys CD I have bought has had different music styles than the one before. I think that this is why I like them so much. I don't have two CD's that sound the same. With every new Newsboys CD, I have to listen to it a few times to really start to like the songs and get into them. I love this CD...I wish it was longer than 35 mintues! I am seeing the concert on Friday and looking forward to an awesome show...because they are always good too! I would totally recommend this to Newsboys fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not today!","review":"For a band with as much talent as the Newsboys I was expecting more than a funky disco beat and wierdly mixed tunes. The direction the Newsboys have gone with this CD stinks. I can apreciate good effort but this music does not turn me on. I've just discovered the Newsboys a while ago and got hooked on Step Up To The Microphone, but this was a flop. If any of the Newsboys read this GO BACK TO THE GOOD STUFF YOU WERE WRITING BEFORE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"why buy this cd when i'd be happy to give you the one i have. don't get me wrong, i like the newsboys; but this is nasty!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth checking out","review":"Love Liberty Disco is viewed by many people as a disappointment, and by the Newsboys standards, it is. However, by normal standards, it still stands as an above-average CD. The main weakness with LLD is its glut of slow songs, many of which seem to run together. The upbeat tracks, songs like \\"Good Stuff\\", \\"Say You Need Love\\", and the title song, fare much better. Also, the opener, \\"Beautiful Sound\\", is indeed a beautful sound. Overall, an album worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Christian band around","review":"Wow, that is all I can say. This is the funkiest album to come out of the Christian music scene. If you need a break from the slow, melanchonly vibes of Jars of Caly- then this is for you. It's really hard to sit still with this album playing. You wont be able to take this CD out of your player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Liberty Disco....","review":"Some of these reviewers are way too serious. Come on people, look at the front cover of the CD! Does it look like you're going to get a Stephen Curtis Chapman type sound? I think not! The first six songs are excellent, the other's are just good. But they're inspirational, you know, they're uplifting, I sometimes think that half these reviewers simply live for trashing anything that's not perfect, lighten up! The songs have great beats, great hooks and make you just wanna dance. The best tracks are \\"Everyone's someone\\" and \\"Beautiful sound\\" but there's something for everyone. The only bad part is that one of the songs featured in Australian soap-opera \\"Neighbours\\", come on newsboys, you're not really that desperate for cash are you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gimme lOVElibErtYdiSCO!","review":"as with almost all of the newsboys' CDs it starts out very strong, but sort of get worse and worse until the last song. (but the newsboys worst song is pretty good still!) the song \\"love liberty disco\\" is the best song on the CD, closely followed by \\"beautiful sound.\\" these two tracks are well worth the 11 dollars alone, but then along comes \\"everyone's someone\\" and \\"say you need love\\" which are great too! buy the CD! it's awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but no.","review":"I am really disappointed with this cd.I bought step up to the Microphone and loved it,so naturally thought i would like this one,but they got too mellow and I just can't get into the songs.granted it does have some good songs(i.e. the title song,Beautiful sound,and good stuff) but it really is not worth buying unless you do not mind buying a cd for 3 songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The five stars aren't just because Newsboys are my faves!","review":"Don't expect \\"Love Liberty Disco\\" to be anything like any of the Newsboys' previous albums! Their sound evolves from record to record, but \\"Love Liberty Disco\\" seems to come out of nowhere. It might take a little while to get used to the disco on tracks 2, 6, and 7, but they rock. Newsboys have always had a strong message, and the lyrics are as good as they've always been, but the music is... ethereal. There's more basis on keys and orchestral instruments (bravo to keyboardist Mr. Jeff Frankenstein for those string arrangements!), and Peter Furler's vocals can be a bit eerie at times. It's all good, though! Whether you like the Newsboys' previous stuff or not, give this album a shot. I do believe you'll like it quite a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Expect a lot of suprises on the new Newsboys' release, Love Liberty Disco! A reflection of their previous albums (Not Ashamed & Going Public) shines through continuously. With the exciting tones of \\"Good Stuff\\", \\"Say You Need Love\\" and the title track, you will also enjoy the more worshipful sounds of \\"Break\\", \\"Fall On You\\", etc. An awesome addition to your own music collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love,L,D","review":"I bought this for my kids and I lisen to it just as much as they do.

Although the spy story was a bit clunky, all the rest was a great pleasure to read, particularly when encountering characters from other stories or novels. Like Jane Austen, to whom Pym is so often compared, the only disappointment arises from the fact that there is no more to read. I've probably read each Pym novel at least three times, and in some cases even more than that. An insightful, comforting, and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick, \\"Okay\\" read.","review":"While I may get tired of Rebus' drinking and angst, Skinner is so perfect as to be annoying. He is tall, lean, attractive, smart, an excellent shot and at hand-to-hand combat, well liked by his superior and subordinates, and has a perfect wife and baby. He easily gets the cooperation of other police agencies and bad guys tell him everything. It all gets to be a bit much. So why do I keep reading the series? Because under all that is a decent procedural with just enough suspense to keep me going.

Trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this, you'll be sorry","review":"I can't say I wasn't warned, but decided to ignore the reviews. Mine didn't work correctly out of the box. With both probes placed into the same glass of ice water I read 39 degrees on one probe and 59 degrees on the other. Switching the probes reviles that the same readings for the same inputs so the problem seems to be in the main unit and not the probes.I experienced the same kind of readings when in actual use (which is what made me do the ice water test). A pork roast in the oven for 10 minutes registered as done with a reading of 180 degrees internal, this of course is absurd.Don't buy one of these things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality - broke the second time used","review":"It looked interesting in the ability of monitor two things at once, but the probes are very low quality. The first broke the second time I used and the second one is already behaving erratically. Very thin wire, not durable, not appropriate for such use. Look for one with a nice probe with a wire mesh shield on the wires - one like that lasted 8 yrs. This one didn't make 8 weeks.

Buy the THM-360 and you have half the device works well and the other not at all. Amazon helped me with a new replacement. One of the probes on the second one stopped working on the first cooking as well. Frustrating! You make the judgement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works","review":"This thermometer works great at monitoring internal food temperatures and simultaneously monitoring the temperature inside my smoker. I have not used the alarm feature so I can't comment on that but I would recommend this unit based on monitoring temps alone.

I used it successfully on two different occasions for a brisket and a pork shoulder. Ever since then, the probes read only \\"LL\\" or \\"HH\\" no matter what I do. I've never again gotten any kind of useful reading from it.Maybe because it's never worked well, but the interface is quite confusing too. It's not clear how to adjust it to specific temperatures, which is an important feature. The instructions aren't clear either.Pass on this product if you are serious about cooking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't take the heat","review":"I use probe thermometers typically when cooking a roast or bird like a turkey. My method is to cook them at high heat at first then roast slowly. Unfortunately this thermometer can't take higher temps and never worked out of the gate. My old Williams Sonoma probe just went after about 8 years of faithful use. I carefully read reviews and went with this model but it was a dud for me. Maybe if you don't use high heat ever it might be okay but I can't envision that, it just is a better method that results in a better meal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Probe","review":"Bought this to replace a Redi Check thermometer. Used it one time and one of the probes is already defective.

I do like the dual probes and not having preset cooking temps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem Probe","review":"I feel cheated. The probe did not work even on its first use. I placed the probe in the middle of a brisket I was grilling and within a few minutes the probe read HH. I changed probes and within a few minutes it again read HH.

The unit was working but both probes failed, probably from heat, the first time I used it. Apparently the probes cannot take the heat of a grill.

Not only is 99% of the info in this book inaccurate, but making weapons is a very specific skill that takes decades of training.

In addition to following a totally unintuitive and strange organization, the information presented is superficial and, if I had to guess, 20 years outdated in many places. Also, the authors completely dropped the ball on providing references in the text, an oversight that is inexcusable in such a dynamic and ever-changing field as dive medicine. The only reason I gave two instead of one stars is that the chapters do include real-world examples of the material covered, mostly in the form of diving incidents and accidents. However, when I wanted to learn the latest and greatest about nitrogen narcosis, for example, the entry on wikipedia turned out to far outperform the chapter in this book.

Lyon, Christina and a few others from the first book made appearances, while introducing a few new characters to continue the series, Jade's brother Nathan and Caine's brother Colin.

It was one of the funniest romances I've ever read. I can't remember the last time I laughed outloud so many times. But it's more than that. The author hasn't forgotten to add very serious romance to this otherwise humorous novel. The romance is hot and sincere. And while I normally am able to predict everything that happens in romance novels, I have to admit, she got me on this one. I did NOT predict the turnout. Give this one a read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a big Garwood fan, but","review":"I found this story - and the related \\"Lion's Lady\\" -disappointing. And I rate them 2 stars because other Garwood books - The Wedding, Saving Grace, Gentle Warrior - are so much better than this. Part of the problem - Garwood tends to write in a very modern voice, with characters saying things that you and I would say today. Somehow, this works just fine with Scottish clans in 1100 - but it just doesn't \\"click\\" with Regency characters. Another problem - the non-romance plot gets muddied and rushed here, with characters thrown in to \\"solve\\" the mystery. The pirate plot could have been so much more successful. Both Lion's Lady and this book are very rushed at the end, trying to wrap things up. My recommendation - skip this and read Saving Grace instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glow-peak Pro","review":"This charger worked well for about two weeks.

It would play on my laptop, but no chapters, I had 360 as one big chapter, plus the time index was only up to the 24 minutes. so chapter 18, at the 24 minute mark, was for minutes 24-360.

Neither of the two features I need most from this Sony -- DVD player and DVD recorder -- work.The DVD player freezes all the time and there's no way to get past that point (FF, REW, etc. nothing works). Plus, with some DVDs all of a sudden there will be this extremely loud squeal or static sound and, well, that's the end of being able to watch that DVD. I've cleaned the DVD player several times but that hasn't helped.We have been able to copy one VHS tape. Other than that we've made a lot of coasters. The instructions are terrible, but even when you finally make some sense of them the end result is more DVDs that won't play. I've tried three DVD formats (+R, -R, R/W) and have wasted many hours trying to get this thing to work.So I gave up on trying to record but the aforementioned DVD player problems keep me from using it at all.

Moody gives examples from many different people who have experienced NDEs. This book makes a believer out of me that there is life after life on earth.

He doesn't try to sell the phenomena as brains deprived of oxygen; he doesn't try to sell any scientific reasons as to what really happens. He lets the peoples stories speak for themselves.

This is what comes to mind as I read the reports of Dr. Moody's patients. They speak of an experience outside of time and beyond three dimensions.For us to conceive of something requires that there be a prior three dimensional experience, in time, for us to develop a concept. That is what makes these reports \\"inconceivable\\", yet \\"believable\\", just like what is prior to the \\"Big Bang\\" wherein the Cosmos \\"emerged\\" from a \\"point of no dimensions\\". This also is inconceivable and consequently not a \\"fact\\" in the usual sense of scientific data.After Jesus said, \\"Metanoiesete\\", he went on to say that the \\"good news\\" is that the Kingdom of Heaven is \\"within\\" you, not conceivable but believable.Moody's small book is mind altering."},{"rating":"1","title":"somebody else wrote about it first","review":"I guess I could say I enjoyed this book.

Well readers, most all of Moody's works came from: The Vestibule written by Jess Weiss after his many interviews with folks who had out of life experiences. And Ross should know better as she spoke with Weiss many occasions prior to conspiring with Moody.

I can't help but get the feeling that Santana's ego is starting to get the better of him. If I hear one more contributor to a Santana album sing \\"Caaarloooos SaaaaanTANA,\\" I'm going to cut the disk in half.

Carlos jumped the shark with that last one and now it has turned into a monster that won't die. Please go back to the way it was, Carlos, PLEASE!

Santana's great talent is completely lost in a limp mix of forgettable pop tunes. I can appreciate the desire to reach a larger audience and continue his well deserved success but playing background guitar licks over a cattle call of second rate pop stars will not further his artistic vision or win him any long term fans. I think after two pop albums, Santana's diehard fans deserve a great album in the spirit of Abraxis. Sorry Carlos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has anybody seen or heard from Santana?","review":"I'm sorry but Sanatana's lost his way. I guess his record company dictates what songs he records and who records with him. Concerning his collaborations on these songs, it seems more like he's trying to mix water with oil and it just ain't happen'n folks. Better luck next time, maybe this great talent will get back on track. I sure hope so, otherwise he'll just fade away.

Adouma starts offpromisingly then the cd deteriorates into drivel. Musiq, Macy Gray and Seal could have been thrown all on one track and dispensed with they were severely underutilized. The other collaborations had absolutely no edge and were not distinctive orcontemporary. Santana uses the acoustic guitar a great deal throughout the cd which is not a bad thing, but I DO see a Santana Unplugged in our future. Sideways with Citizen Cope, One of These Days with Ozomatli and Novus with Placido Domingo are the highlights of a rather disappointing set."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT BAD","review":"I LOVE \\"THE GAME OF LOVE\\" WITH MICHELLE BRANCH WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS CD IS THAT ALL THE SONGS ARE DIFFERENT THEY DONT SOUND THE SAME IT'S A GOOD CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Santana: Se te extraña en el pasado.","review":"Santana fue, uno de los mas grandes guitarristas que pudo dar aqui mexico, desde Autlan, jalisco.

I was thinking, \\"Who is this self-important guitarist?\\"There's just this vibe on the song that the guitar is really important; I mean, how many pop songs have BIG guitar solos in them anymore? Not since the Eagles. :) Anyway, the guitar is featured in a big way, and Carlos totally blows it with this cheesy, uncreative, pentatonic nightmare. I guess you could call it Sanny G.

However, twice wasn't a charm with, \\"Shaman\\". Carlos' guitar work is SOLID, don't get me wrong. The downfall of this record was the guest lineup. The songs featuring Michelle Branch, Musiq, and Seal were pleasant to listen to. The rest were either poor singers OR decent singers taking part in a poor song. Macy Gray hurts my ears and Citizen Cope isn't the best there is. Chad Kroeger is a mediocre singer singing a bad song. POD's track didn't fit this forum at all. Most disappointing was Dido's contribution. She has a soothing voice, but this was an example of a singer singing a poor song. In retrospect, it may have been better for Santana to release a more traditional album, but I'm sure the label wanted to try to cash in more on \\"Supernatural\\".

And he has all these kids who were in Pampers when he was lighting up the stage, singing with him....I mean come ON!! Musically it is terrible. Carlos Santana you do NOT have to do this, your legacy is assured! I listen to everything, including pop and hiphop, but sorry, the few moments of decent redeeming Santana moments and maybe passable vocals on this album still do not make it worth it. It does NOT work. I live in Bangkok, Thailand. Santana is playing here on Nov 3 to promote Shaman. I would ordinarily have bought a ticket for a Santana concert without the hint of a second thought.

While his previous LP wasn't a true Santana LP by any stretch of the imagination, this release simply tries too hard to replicate it's formula and in turn, saps all the passion and fervor out of the music. Other than an old guy in a funny hat backing up a host of new-jacks, I don't know who the real Carlos Santana is anymore.

Supernatural was a fine record and had it's moments, but here, it seems like they're trying to capture lightning in a bottle. Am I the only one who hears Carlos just playing these uninspired blues cliches over and over again?

They ignored the business side of the recording industry to focus their energies on the music.Today, Santana seems to have completely reversed his goals. I don't hear an ounce of creative breakthrough in his new work. I hear the recording business money makers calling the shots, marketing Santana like a new pair of Nikes. And it works, he's more popular than ever, playing the least inspired work of his long career. What a sham, and a shame.

Where many of the songs on Supernatural were just original and great songs, on Shaman, the majority of the songs have guest singers on them, which isn't a bad thing in itself but I feel that the quality of the song and lyrics were sacrificed so to the draw of famous voices. The songs with Seal and Placido Domingo, for example, are not very interesting and the POD song, \\"America\\", is out of place on the album. Nonetheless, I can put this album in my player and listen to almost the entire thing without skipping a track so if you're a Santana fan of any age, this is a good addition to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Plan on Making an MP3 or listening to it on a Mac","review":"Nothing against the CD.

However, this CD is 95% pure crap (except for Victory Is Won). The Amazon reviewer was right on on that score. Carlos, we want more Soul Sacrifice, Jingo and Samba Pa Ti type songs. Forget this hip-hop, rap stuff. If any of you really think alot of Santana and gave this 5 stars, listen to Abraxas and Santana I. You will quickly realize that this is not at the same level.

I don't think \\"The Game of Love\\" with Michelle Branch is as solid a first single as \\"Smooth\\" with Rob Thomas was on Supernatural. I would say the best song on the album is \\"Nothing At All\\" featuring Musiq. This song is by no means great, but it's pretty good. \\"You Are My Kind\\" with Seal I would say is my second favorite song on the CD, but it has some cliques and can get repetitive after awhile. \\"Since Supernatural\\" is a good rap song, but it talks about stuff that happened BEFORE Supernatural, which doesn't make a lot of sense.

After Santana's previous album \\"Supernatural\\" was released, Carlos finally got the recognition he deserved.But it came with a price.The idea for Supernatural and this latest release \\"Shaman\\" was to pair the guitar legend with pop stars of the day, much to the bitter dissapointment from his lifetime fans. Gone were the 15 minute solos. Gone was the fresh originality that had been put into every previous album. And in it's place were catchy 3 minute singles that may have turned teenyboppers on, but left his aforementioned lifetime fans with a bitter taste in their mouth.And here we go again...So by all means, if you're just beginning to get intrested in Santana, skip this release and go straight to where it matters...

The band is relegated only to \\"Santana musicians\\" and the whole package and music is overloaded of the image of Carlos Santana.Come on Santana (the whole band), just play the truly Santana music. The only song that deserves some attention is \\"Victory is won\\" and by the way the live version of this song on the Supernatural Evening DVD is by far superior than this studio version (the drum play is horrible compared to Rodney Holmes and even the guitar solo is much more intense)In the meantime, I will hear Caravanserai,Welcome and Borboletta to try to forget this is happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old Santana","review":"Does Santana know how to play anything other than the same old licks and the Santana \\" note\\".?

There is not one bad track on the cd (Since Supernatural may be the only song that falls flat though, but its worth listening to). the three best songs on the cd are \\"The Game Of Love\\", \\"America\\", and Why Don't You & I. The rest are good but not the best though. Worthwhile and entertaining. Definately worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Supernatural","review":"I bought this CD based on the awesomeness of Supernatural and was hugely disappointed. The Michelle Branch song is good, but the rest of the songs are pretty blah, including the Seal song which surprised me since I also love Seal. Plus, the songs are have the Latin feel I would normally expect from a Santana album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Santana always excellent","review":"This cd has a lot of good songs with the proffesional touch that santana knows perfectly. One review says that the latin song Foo Foo is too long. I can tell this person does not know anything about latin music because salsa's songs used to be really long in '70. Therefore, Foo Foo is an excellent production."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an amazing record","review":"I've had this recording for over two years, and every song has grown on me, even the ones I didn't really like at first. My favorite track is Adouma. It's a hard driving latin rhythm. I don't have the liner notes, but it sounds like his old singer, Alex Ligertwood singing on Adouma. If you like percussive latin jams like Tales of Kilamanjaro, you'll like Adouma.When Santana first came out in the sixties, he was fusing rock and latin music. From there he added jazz, pop, r&b;, and finally hip hop to his bubbling cauldron.Some of the amazon reviewers don't get Shaman and don't want to get it. They're not getting an apology.I rank this as one of Santana's best. Right up there with Zebop. God bless arista records for letting Carlos be Carlos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical","review":"It's a bit of a strange CD. Somehow it manages to remain upbeat throughout the mix, without becoming repetitive. In fact, it's far from repetitive as the only consistent aspect between songs is the versatile Santanna strumming away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Follow-Up","review":"As an American living in Brazil, I hear a ton of latin style music, but this disk transcends the garbage I typically hear down here, and belongs in a much different genre than the poppy Miami sound so many Latin (mostly female) artists are tying to pass off as music. In my opinion, Carlos Santana is the second greatest living guitarist, behind only Clapton. This CD shows why. He consistantly displays his tight ability, and mixes in horns and vocals that compliment his riffs. Personally, I am not a huge Nickleback fan, but track 10, with Chad Kroeger \\"Why Don't You and I\\" was the first one to catch my ear. I also like the Seal track. I think Carlos came up with a good recipe on Supernatural, and only continues it with Shaman. He is already a supertalented guitarist, and surrounds himself with talented people to come up with a great product. Keep it up Carlos."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Celebration of Music","review":"I really enjoyed this album/cd. Santana embraces all musical forms and chooses not to force himself into a category. Some have said that he has lost his identity. However, I would say that his music reflects his growth as an individual and displays the broadness of his talents. Santana is a world musician who taps into his Latin, African, and rock backgrounds, flavors his compositions with hip-hop and manages to touch his audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear and thorough, an excellent reference for ESL students and teachers","review":"I refer to this book all the time when preparing English lessons for my high-level students, and my coworkers are constantly borrowing it, too. It explains hundreds of grammatical rules, including ones you use all the time but never learned about in school. (Why is it \\"big fat liar,\\" not \\"fat big liar\\"? What's the rule for that? Better check the OPG.) Also includes a concise appendix on the grammatical differences between British and American English. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing practical guide for tourists","review":"I was looking for a practical guide to choose and find hikes on a planned trip to Scotland. This guide does not appear useful to me. Information on length of hike and difficulty are buried in the text which often begins with a personal story. In order to follow the indicated hike, it looks like you need an ordinance survey map (different map for each hike). Instructions on finding the starting point for the hike often seem vague and are buried in the text.The guide might be useful if you are more familiar with Scotland and were interested in the personal stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID BUYING CELL PHONES ON AMAZON!","review":"I gave this a 1 since I couldn't give a 0 rating.

This fact has not been included (conveniently glossed over) in the product description. This means that being an Indian, I can use this watch only if I pretend to be a parisian, or if I have to add/subtract half an hour to the time on my watch every freaking time.

It has not been published on the site that this watch cannot be set for time-zones of Canada, Mid-australia, India, Newzealand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to see","review":"Be careful what you wish for. My wife bought me this watch for Christmas. She and I thought the watch had everything I wanted in a watch. But when I opened it up on Christmas morning. I realized that with all of the features I desired I could not read the watch. Everything is too small to read. All of a sudden I now feel very old because I had to use reading glasses just to tell the time. I also found that the watch does not have a back light. I really need a back light.

It keeps accurate time, is easy to change time zones as I travel around the world, and the alarm is usually loud enough to wake me up in the morning. There are two drawbacks worth noting:(1) As other reviewers noted, the crystal scratches easily. That said, four years later, I do not have trouble seeing through the crystal.(2) the two buttons and the stem stick out pretty far on the right side. As a result, I have developed a thick callus on the back of my left hand where the watch stem digs in. Also, the buttons bump into the back of my hand, changing the time zone for the digital time/date portion of the watch. Easy to change back (just push the buttons again to step back to local time) but still mildly annoying.But bottom line, it does what a quality watch is supposed to do -- keep reliable time year after year. And after four years, I am still on the original battery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch","review":"Brought it as a Christmas gift for my brother, he travels a lot so the multi time zone feature was more than just a gimmick it had very practical aspects to it.

The watch does not even give me a chance to use it, too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you make a sports watch you can't read in dim light?","review":"Before I reveal its critical flaw, let me say I love the way the watch looks.That said, the watch has no backlight!!! I cannot see the analog time at night and the digital display is completely unreadable even in dim light (have you ever seen an LCD display on a watch that didn't have a backlight?). Not having a backlight is an inexcusable flaw on a watch this price. And the phosporescent watch hands fade in about an hour, so that doesn't help much. Of course, you could just carry a flashlight with you.Because of this flaw, I rarely wear the watch. I wear a cheaper Casio with a backlight that I do not like anywhere near as much.If considering this watch against any other, just make sure you also consider how important it is to you to be able to read the time in the dark and to be able to read the digital LCD display when you don't have optimal light. If it is important, find a different watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding hassle free watch","review":"After researching a bunch of watches, I settled on the Skyhawk with a titanium case and band. I love it. I do a lot of travelling and a lot of calls with people in different time zones. This watch makes it so easy for me to manage time zones. I'm glad I chose the titanium because it's so light. I wore an automatic watch for several years before buying the Skyhawk and got fed up with having to check it's accuracy every week - I can now forget about that with the Skyhawk. It's been totally accurate since I bought it. And I love the fact that I never have to replace the battery. I'm hooked.Update: I first wrote this review in 2007. It's now 2010 and I still love this watch. I wouldn't swap it for any other."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great time piece","review":"This is a great piece of craftsmanship from Citizen. It is easy to use and keeps perfect time. The eco drive concept is great. I have two seiko's - one kinetic, the other automatic, and both ended up in a drawer when I got the citizen. My job is sitting at a desk most of the day, so my Seiko's would go dead. I'm too cheap to buy a device to move for me (watch winder) so I got a real watch and I'll never go back. Now, if I could just figure out how to use the E6B....One side note, it is a little larger than any other watch I've owned. That's not a problem, but the adjustment knob has given me a callous on the back of my left hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best titanium ever","review":"This is my fourth titanium watch and second eco-drive titanium Citizen.

All I knew of Amazing Blondels early works before I bought this one was their old album Evensong, which contains some songs I absolutely like, and when I saw they had reunited and got Restoration, I thought they had develloped in a nice way. I don't like all of the new songs, but two of them - Highwayman and Road to Sedgemoor are so great that they are worth bying the whole CD. The music may seem to be a little bit to heavy, meaning pompous, inflated, and there are some wonderful weird note in Sedgemoor that surely will not please everyone - in a way, it's like gothic music (=music for people who consider themselves goths), only it's baroque. I like it. And in any case, it's worth a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blondel reunites - they shouldn't have bothered","review":"First of all, the review above from Dirty Linen doesn't refer to this album. This is a new studio album recorded in 1997 - the band's first album with John Gladwin in about 22 years. Anyway, it's absolutely awful.

It was of infinite value to me that he did not throw out the babies of grace and honor with the skewering bathwater.

McNair's family dealt with the frustrations that come with an active-church life with humor, a method we could all use a little more! My only complaint was that McNair painted himself and his family as the heros at first, and everybody else was always in the wrong. Eventually though, he admitted to his family's mistakes, which made them seem very real and personal. I think this book would be great for anyone who is carrying around bad memories from a childhood spent in church, especially those who have left.

There is a lot of bad or indifferent drawing as well as bad or indifferent storylines.One could say that an anthology anthologizes the extant and that if gay comics of the past (most from the '70sand '80s) are average then the anthology must perforce be average.

I read this one after Honor's Splendour and I must admit I did prefer HS. Ms. Garwood really knows how to tell a wonderful story, I wish the characters could be a little bit different but all in all I still love them. I would recommend this book, it is very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"My absolute favorite Garwood novel","review":"Shortly and simply put, there's something so enchanting and utterly compelling about this novel that I revisit it over and over again. All of the characters came together masterfully and our couple compliments each other absolutely. Perhaps the epitome of everything Garwood?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Touching!A breath of fresh air","review":"Its simply great.Ms Garwood sends across a powerful message.A man can be gentle and tender and yet not lose his masculinity ,a woman can want not to merge herself as her husbands alter-ego and still not lose her feminity and a couple in love can definitely triumph if both are able to see things from the other's perspective.

I would recommend this book to everyone; Each of Ms. Garwood's books are well written and unique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comical","review":"I love this book!! The relationship between Johanna and Gabriel starts out one sided and then grew to an equal relationship. I especially loved the part where she aggrevates him on purpose because it is so hilarious!! You will love this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally riviting!","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book. I couldn't put it down, which only means that I was extremely annoyed when I had to do mundane things like feeding cats and cleaning house. The whole time I was doing chores my thoughts were with Johanna and Gabriel.I loved both Garwood's characters and loved how Johanna became self assured toward the end of the book. I hate giving away endings so I won't do so now, suffice it to say that Gabriel was good for her. I also liked her secondary characters of Nicolas and Clare.Aside from The Bride and Ransom, this is the best Garwood I've read to date. I have all her medievals except Shadow Music which I have coming and look foward to reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it 3 times","review":"I hate reading a book again when I already know the ending. However, I've made an exception with all Julie's books. I love Johanna and Gabriel. This couple didn't suffer from all of those unrealistic miscommunications that often lead to them believing their unloved. You will also see Johanna evolve as a person (from a victim of abuse to a confident and independent woman). I do wish Julie had made the Epilogue focus on The MacBain's new baby rather than the death of Bishop Hallwick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great love story","review":"This is one of JG's best! Right after Ransom. Gabriel was simply perfect - handsome, masculine, sensitive and yes, arrogant, but it worked well for him. It was amusing to me. Johanna was clearly the love of his life, and we knew this well. No silly games involved here. Thank God! As strong as Johanna turned out to be, I thought she came across as kind of ditzy in the beginning of the story, but I overlooked it and loved her anyway. I'm not sure why, but I always hesitate to read a book when the synopsis says the heroine was married before, but I'm so glad I didn't forgo this great book. But why on earth JG chose to make Johanna a 13 year old bride (first marriage) is beyond me. I was a little disturbed by that. The warriors constantly underfoot were magnificant! What a great job JG did with these guys! I love the way she does that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old Garwood","review":"OK so this is a novel published in 1993, and they keep on publishing it because it has got a lot of fans. Millions of readers must love this novel.I found it boring. IMHO, the humour was very silly. The characters only talk and talk, but they say nothing interesting. Certainly, it was not -for me- one of those novels you cannot stop reading. I had to make the effort to end it.If you like highlanders the Garwood's way (this is - very brigadoonish) then you will love this book, because it's more or less the same as 'The Bride', 'Honor's Splendor' or 'The Secret'. A beautiful Englishwoman, a powerful and sexy Scottish warrior... Nothing new or surprising, I'm afraid. Perhaps it was refreshing in 1993, I honestly don't know.I will not read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the book Not, I repeat, Not the tape!","review":"I want to make it clear that I am giving the audio version two stars but the book receives 4 stars. I will not go into the story because others have done it and made a good job of it too. However, I had to write this review concerning the audio tape. I have read the book but got the tape because I do a lot of traveling and I wanted to listen to some of JG's books to break the monotony of driving. I was very disappointed because the audio version did not do justice to the book version. The tape missed out on critical scenes that makes it so fun to read (does that rhyme?). Anyway, the listener will not gain any of the humor and poignancy that the book reveals. I'm just saying if you got to have the tape get if from your local library first, they give you three weeks on loan, then listen and make your decision. But my advise is to just buy the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best...","review":"I'm not sure what everyone else is jumping for joy about regarding this book. Yes, the setting is romantic -- it always is. Yes, the dialogue between the two characters can be funny, entertaining, tender and emotive. However, I don't think that either Johanna or Gabriel were well drawn, full characters. Half the time Gabriel's thoughts and speech indicated that he should be smiling or grinning, yet Johanna would turn to look at him and he'd have a \\"feroucious frown\\" on his face. Nothing Garwood writes lets us know why these contradictions between his thoughts and demeanor occur. Johanna is even more of a shell. We are never allowed into her head long enough to see if she has a complicated though, and I doubt that she does. Garwood relies compleely on dialogue to move the plot, and it just doesn't. To empathize with these characters, we need to feel like we understand them. Half of what they do is \\"out of the blue,\\" a bad, bad sign for us dear readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best book: a sequal is required","review":"Saving Grace is Garwood's best book because of the humor she injects into the plot. Poor Gabriel doesn't stand a chance when Johanna enters his life. She denies all his boasts about being a \\"hard mon\\" and a \\"good Laird\\" and brings him around her thumb. I see by the interview in the paperback edition of RANSOM, that Garwood is planning a sequal to this story. Great! I cannot wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best!","review":"I have been a huge Jayne Ann Krentz/Castle/Amanda Quick fan but have discovered other authors. BUT I must say that \\"Saving Grace\\" is my favorite book. I find that I pull it out often to reread and never tire of it. The relationship between Johanna and Gabriel is pure magic. And the situations both find themselves in, and the way the two find their way to love, is wondrous. I have read other JG books, including \\"Ransom\\", and have enjoyed them. But none, for me, have captured magic of this book. Thank you, Ms. Garwood!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This will always be my favorite book of all time.","review":"I first read this story a few years ago and just purchased a new copy because my original is so worn from me constantly reading it. What makes Julie Garwood's characters stand out in this story is the fact that I can see why Gabriel and Johanna fell in love. The reader is taken through every turning point of their relationship, the laughs and the tears. I have lent this book to friends who have never read a romance before, and now they own their own copy. So if you are a fan of 13th century romances or have never read one in your life, I definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Garwood novel","review":"I have read Saving Grace twice now. Both times made me smile and captured my heart. The loyalty of the people around the central characters and the humor was just great. Reading about people who are so capable of opening their hearts for the sheer generosity of it is inspiring. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saving Grace","review":"I thought that this book was poorly written. The main character, Johanna, is just not interesting. She is a weak, timid mess. And her displays of \\"strength\\" in the book are a joke. The hero, Gabriel, also dull. Also, the constant harping by the author on the hierarchy in heaven and earth was tiresome. This is the first book by Julie Garwood that I have read and will probably be the last. The author just didn't capture my interest. If you feel you must read this book, I would check the library first for it and save my money for a better book by a better author."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAME OLD THING!!!","review":"I don't know why most of you are jumping for joy because this books it the best. IT'S THE SAME OLD THING. Julie Garwood always write beautiful women that seems so innocent but actually dumb. I don't like the way she potrays that everyone hots for the leading lady. The guy didn't really fell in love with her! He fell in love with her beauty and body. What if she was ugly? Would he still love her? Gabriel seems so amused and fascinated. By what? By a girl who'se so beautiful and innocent at the same time. Saving Grace is the same old thing. There is no love at all. There is only lust. :( I'm dissapointed at this book and I wish Mrs. Garwood would at least write one love story that the girl isn't that perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU'LL LAUGH, YOU'LL CRY, YOU CAN'T HELP BUT LOVE IT!!!!","review":"I will admit that I have read this book at least 15 times and I enjoyed it every time. I cried with Johanna though all her trails and I laughed with her through all her triumphs. I fell head over heels in love with the McBain,who could resista man who wants you to rest? Not me.. This book get better and better with each page. I hope that every one read this treffic and delightful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Women are not at the bottom of God's list","review":"This is a delightful addition to Garwood's expanse of five-star romances. It is very interesting to watch how the leading lady (Lady Johanna) develops her own strength and courage and of course that is brought along by the leading man. I am an avid lover of any book that is put in Scotland. The Scots do have a way of making a lady burn and think naughty things, especially with those sexy kilts.This book is a must-read and I know you will enjoy as much as I did. Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"HEARTWARMING!!FUN!!MEMORABLE!!","review":"This is the best of the best. I have read it too many times to count. The relationships and interactions between all characters were amazing and spellbinding.

I recommend this to everyone I know who has been in an unbearable situation and triumph over it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four and a half star","review":"I love the relationship between Gabriel and Johanna, but still cannot say it was 5 star. I read it in a couple of days but it didn't leave me still wanting more. My favorite parts included her brother and her speech about Gabriel. I still Would recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Some of Garwood's others but not bad","review":"I have read almost all of Julie Garwood's historical romances have absolutely LOVED some of them, like Ransom, Honor's Splendor, Lion's Lady. Saving Grace wasn't bad by any means, it just didn't grab me like some of her other books. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but I felt like it dragged in many parts until about 3/4 of the way through. Julie Garwood is still one of my favorite romance authors though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my smut!","review":"Julie Garwood ROCKS. Always a good story with strong loveable characters. Her books are always entertaining with romance \\"smut\\", excitement, much humor, sinister villians and historic desciptions that take you back in time.Have to admit I'm much more into her historical romances...she does them so well! I have read some of her modern day stories and while they're still good, I don't like them as much.I hope she comes back with more of the historical stories that have her a romance legend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Air Filter","review":"This size filter cannot be found at any local hardware stores.

Not true size.","review":"The filter we ordered was quite a bit larger than the size it is marked as and didn't fit.

We couldn't find this size anywhere, so we were happy to find it through Amazon. But disappointed in the sizing which should be standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good filter, but the SIZE matters","review":"These are decent filters for the money. Unfortunately (for me) they decided to make the 12x25x1 filter 11x24x1 which proved to be too small for my unit. I tried shifting it every way possible but the only position it seems to fully cover and not allow dust and debris into the coils is shoved way down. Problem is the filter then gets soaking wet from the condensation channel that runs below it. Shame this company didn't decide to go ahead and make the filter the TRUE size stated on the package. I have no use for these now. Yes, I am blaming the maker for something I knew when I ordered them, but when I really think about it, it is the actual size that should be listed on the package.

For the substantial benefit of contemporary martial arts students, the old Chinese spelling system has been replaced by the new academic Pinyin system with Chinese characters being included in the text. Enhanced with 150 illustrative photographs, easily learned and integrated into any martial arts style, Analysis Of Shaolin Chin Na will be a welcome addition to personal, professional, and dojo library reference collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good intro work","review":"This is a good introductory work with a useful organization scheme since it is done by areas of the body.The methods are simplified, but then it would probably be impossible to do a book on truly complex Chin Na techniques. For that you would probably need a video.Nevetheless, I am a big believer in using the simplest, most effective techniques. The way to use a book like this, is to learn the most applicable, versatile techniques, perhaps no more than a couple of dozen or so (unless Chin Na is a specialty of yours). Remember, in the 1400s even a great Jiu-Jitsu master might only know a few moves--but he could apply them to an amazing variety of situations with great speed and effectiveness.Although Chin Na is one of my specialties, I think the same thing applies to the other grappling arts, Chin Na and Aikido."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought-provoking but inconsistent","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer that this book offers an interesting description of the spiritual experience of having \\"no-self\\" but isn't a particularly inspiring read. What was confusing though is that in the introduction we're asked to transcend viewing Suzanne's experiences pathologically, but in the epilogue she herself sees that she has been dissociated due to childhood sexual abuse.

One appears to be a suiciide and one is a murder, but neither one is straight-forward. In true Carr fashion, he keeps us guessing until the very end. But thank goodness crime fighter extraordinaire Gideon Fell is on the scene and he finds his way through the maze. This book has Carr's trademark black humour as well, and kept me laughing all the way through. The antics when the characters get into the famous in \\"Doom of the Campbells\\" (which happens to be a particularly strong whiskey)are incredibly funny! I love the way Carr plotted his stories.

It is a great story and a completely believable prediction of what might happen due to the conflict between personal liberty and the \\"security\\" of constant surveillance.

Frustrating and sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"ho-hum Masterpiece Contemporary production","review":"I'm surprised by the number of highly positive reviews posted here - from the start, I thought the story fell flat from its potential and I only hung in for the love story subplot. I suppose if you weren't aware of all the ways data about our every electronic move are being used, it could be a shocking revelation. But it felt like old news to me, and all of the twists and turns seemed like they'd been rehashed from other productions. The ending (spoiler alert: the bad guys win in every possible way) certainly did not make up for how long and drawn out the plot was.For British drama that's chock full of conspiracies and cyber-stalking, moves fast with a lot of tension, and has intriguing characters, I'd recommend the MI-5 series instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this possible?","review":"Good movie, BBC style all over it, a little freaky, considering this could very much be possible, a little depressing too ...Very scary and shocking ending ...I recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Believable Science \\"Non-Fiction\\"","review":"This fictionalized account of privacy in everyday life and how technology is changing things is right on the mark and very scary.

With 21 tracks, perhaps the producer thought that he'd make up for in quantity what the album lacks in quality. Quality is what is lacking in this album. The tracks are of poor acoustical quality compared to Duets 1 and 2. It sounds as though most of the tracks were lifted from TV and radio recordings - the sound quality truly suffers in the process. Oh, there are some brief rays of sunshine, but overall, the album only appeals to those who have to have every song Sinatra ever recorded.I do not recommend this album. If you can get it used or at a discounted price it might be worth it, but even then, it is an album that disappoints.Jim Konedog Koenig"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, poor writing.","review":"True, this is a good story. It is a factual and interesting history of the local area. However, the writing techniques of the author leave much to be desired. This book is filled with rambling sentences, and paragraphs of facts. The timeline jumps around, and it's hard to follow. It's obvious that the writer doesn't have much experience. The story deserves a better account. Still, if all you're looking for is newspaper and court accounts, you may like this book as much as the other readers who rated it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Distillation of teaching of greatest living Indian musician.","review":"The bulk of this book consists of notated compositions as taught by Khansahib in class at the Ali Akbar Khan College in California. The music is in the prinicipal ragas of the 10 thaats. Although this is a small fraction of the wealth of music available in this tradition, it is plenty to get started.

I myself am probably only up to about listen number twelve (to paraphrase author Eric Tamm). Of all the Crimson albums released from 1969 to 1974, it is by far the strangest and weakest (excluding live albums, which at least have versions of \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" going for them!) Of course Islands has its moments; \\"Ladies of the Road\\" is good bluesy fun, and Fripp beats the bejezus out of his Les Paul on the extended solo to \\"A Sailor's Tale,\\" but guess what? These two bright spots can be found on Frame By Frame, one of the greatest boxed sets of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"One gem among a pile of rubbish.","review":"Ladies of the Road is a brilliant rock tune, but that's it, the rest of this is a wasted effort.

Ladies Of The Road is OK, but it can be found on other compilations where you are spared the possibility of hearing any of the junk on this album.

This caused extra grief by leading to the unlistenable Earthbound."},{"rating":"1","title":"A blot on a noble discography","review":"Crim-loving friends of mine assure me that this album is a misunderstood masterpiece. I understand it perfectly well, and it's an embarrassment, quite the worst Crimson album ever and only not a trial to sit through because it's so boring. The lyrics are among the drivellingest Peter Sinfield ever committed to paper, the musicianship is no more than competent (Fripp's much-praised solo on Sailor's Tale sounds to me like uninspired thrashing fed through a reverb to make it sound more tortured) and the vague gestures towards classicism are frankly amateurish. In fact the only pleasure to be regularly received from Islands is the comforting delusion that one could have done better oneself.

In some senses, she could be seen as a radical post-modernist artist, as she abstracts the subject from social normality and removes any dignity from the development of the child, if that was her so calling in contemporary art. Yet it is frightening to be in an age where people will grasp such superficially degrading images.

I recommend using a CO2 cartridge based blower instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I purchased this item hoping to put an end to all the compressed air cans that I use to clean. This was a waste of money and time all the thing does is make noise and give a slight breeze. You could easily blow more dust off of your equipment with your own lungs, even if they are filled with tar, than you can with this blower, and you might as well just scoop up anything that you want to use the vacuum to clean. I was very disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The little engine that ... couldn't","review":"If I live to be 140, I know my last dying gasp will produce more suction than this \\"vacuum.\\" It is basically useless in other ways as well. The bristles on the brush attachment are far too stiff, rendering them incapable of curling around small components to loosen dust particles underneath. The exhaust vent (which doubles as a rather asthmatic \\"blower\\") is positioned in such a way that it actually blows much of what little dust is picked up back into the item you're vacuuming. And to top it all off, when I placed the unit into its charging station, it would not seat properly on the leads, so it wouldn't even charge. In short: just another made-in-China piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metropolitan Vacuum(R) DataVac(R) 3-In-1 Cordless Computer Vacuum","review":"The charger is very convenient.

After less than 6 months of having and using these (at least 3x/wk), I found one cracked, one chipped on the pour spout, and the other one is becoming discolored. I'm super disappointed with this particular product and would encourage you not to waste your money, and go with a Walmart or Target brand equivalent instead. More for you money and it outlasts--my Walmart brand ones (which I get FOUR of for less than this price) have outlasted my Kitchenaid bowls (and I've had my Walmart ones for over 6 years now--only one has become slightly discolored). Good luck--hope this helps save you some money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad for kitchen aide brand","review":"I absolutely LOVE Kitchen Aid products, but this one honestly disappoints me.

So it was in more ways than the body count. Shakespeare is not easy to follow because of the difficult language and hard to follow plot. But this film beats the Bard on both counts. After a few minutes we switched on the subtitles to understand the incomprehensible Bostonian accents. It did not help me understand what was going on but my son who had seen it before kept explaining to me. The story was not without drama and tension but it was too hard to understand. The language was fithy. I do not know why my son wanted this for his birthday.

My wife and I finally saw it. We simply could not finish it. The movie goes over the top with its reliance on vulgar language. There is nothing special about a movie that relies upon the overly gratuitous use of offensive language. The cursing and profanity laden dialogue simply gets in the way of the plot and, in fact, makes even the good characters, if there was one in the movie, unlikable. I've learned a simple lesson in life that this movie confirms. If the critics love it and Hollywood honors it, it is not worth seeing.

It is everything that is wrong with Hollywood today. The actors are the Lefty cadre of Babylon. You know them. They're in every IMPORTANT film, Leo, Matt, Jack, Alec, and Uncle Marty, the inner circle of the KGB. They rant off screen about poverty while unloading Hollywood gold into their vaults. They rant about environmental waste and drive a fleet of limos. But stop me before I puke. Can they act? Sometimes, but in the awful Hollywood school of the soulless-on-acid, I wish they would shut up and study old Humphrey Bogart films.Is this plot and the awful cop dialogue believable? NOOOOOO! And does that one love interest, Vera Farmiga, give you any skinny shivers at all? No! For a Harvard shrink, she comes off mousy and dumber than a brick. Who'd fall for her?

Leonardo Decaprio continues to amaze me - he isn't just that annoying kid from titanic anymore - this guy has become one of the best leading men of our time.. The plot twists are just classic Scorsese - he combines elements of the modern action/thrillers with the classic noir films that obviously have had an influence on his career. What a treat it is when you can go to a theatre and actually be totally enchanted by something - it must be art..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting!","review":"This is one of those movies that you have to watch two or three times to make sense of all the intense action. It is riveting and you can't take your eyes off the screen!I have been waiting for Leo Di Caprio to do a truly \\"manly\\" and tough role in a believable way, and this is the role. He is convincingly tough and does an incredible job in this movie. In my opinion Leo has been miscast in a number of films as a tough guy, most notably in Gangs of New York. He seems truly grown up in this movie.Matt Damon is excellent, although as one of my favorite actors I hated to \\"love to hate\\" him in this morally degenerate role.Jack Nicholson annoyed me. He does a great job, but I just found myself thinking that Daniel Day Lewis or Byrne, or someone of that ilk would have been a better choice for the role of Costello.I did not understand the ending.

Not much to say about this movie that hasn't been said. What does need to say is that the quality of the DVD during the first twenty minutes is inexcusable.

Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all good!In short, The Departed is a film definitely worth watching, though you probably might want to stop short of adding it to your movie collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good action movie, suprising ending","review":"This was a very entertaining movie, it had a surprising ending that you will either love or hate. I liked it, my wife hated it. But overall, it is one of the better police action movies I have seen recently. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that there were too many Hollywood actors trying on that Boston accent thing which triped me up a little, maybe if it had been filmed in New York or LA it would have been a little more genuine and believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Departed","review":"Why was everybody so hyped about this movie? My wife and I borrowed it from a neighbor who raved about it and we were both very disappointed. I was bored during most of the movie. I can't believe people thought it was so great.

Over-rated!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Easily the best movie I have seen in years and years. Maybe the best movie made since Boogie Nights (1997). Another Scorsese masterpiece so far above regular film making that it reduces the standard Hollywood release to be equivalent with TV commercials; that is to say mindless junkPerfect casting, acting, directing, screenplay - perfect everything. This is a movie you will want to re-watch for years. Maybe the best thing about this movie is that ending is not sappy and predictable. I could probably write 1500 words about this film but ultimately, it is a movie that creates a reality for the viewer and that is the goal of any film.

Some of the people I've seen posting have complained about the language, but for anybody that's actually been to South Boston, they'll know what's how most of them really talk (my Dad's from Boston). My only complain about this movie is that I think I actually liked it better when it was Infernal Affairs. For anybody that didn't know, The Departed is an adaptation of a 2004 Asian movie.While The Departed stays true to the plot, characters, and story, I almost felt that they just refilmed the same movie but with bigger names.

First, it keeps your interest from start to finish. The characters are quite good and the pace is consistent. There is no room for reflection unless you watch it again and you can watch this film repeatedly. I saw The Gangs of New York but The Departed is so much better. If you liked No Country for Old Men, you'll like The Departed. In both films the characters learn that there are no clean getaways. In this film the story ends when a bent cop finds a former cop in his apartment who promptly executes him. Undoubtedly the former cop received a copy of the tape between the crime boss and his rat and took justice into his own hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"action flick!!!","review":"Incredible tale of \\"protect and serve\\" gone mad and the choices made that result in way too much carnage of which the director is well known."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Directed, Action, and very well woven tale of South Boston...\\" Whitey\\" Who??","review":"One of my favorite Movies, by one of my favorite Directors, Martin Scorcese.

The good guy is Billy Costigan played by Leonardo di Caprio. Here he is driven almost insane by his role as an undercover cop - mental survival is his big challenge. The baddie is Colin Sullivan played by Matt Damon - He goes from success to success in the Police supplying his mentor/godfather and with inside information. The godfather in this case is Frank Costello - played by Jack Nicholson, perhaps over-played is a better description of his swagger and insanity.Damon is only mediocre in the role, di Caprio is great but the great player for me is Mark Whalberg as Seargent Dignam he is such a star in his minor supporting role. Whalberg is a highlight.Another great highlight is the very creative and inspiring sound track especially with Van Morisson singing the great Pink Floyd classic Comfortably Numb - Amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Departed","review":"This movie???

Approximately 10 minutes into the viewing of this movie, we gave it up.This movies is, in my opinion, one of the worst examples of how to destroy what was probably a very good movie. Hence forth and heretofore we will think long and strong about purchases of DVDs that include these actors. In all of my almost 72 years, I have been around a lot of people from all walks of life and try as I may, I am unable to remember anyone that uses such despicable language as was used in this movie........Please, don't patronize people that are involved in the production of this type and for sure, don't waste your money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Ugliness from Scorsese","review":"\\"Could it have been any nastier?\\" Those were my words upon walking out of the theater after seeing this raunchy, bloody mess of a movie that could just as well have been called \\"Gangs of Boston.\\" The killings got so absurd toward the end that many in the audience broke out laughing. Scorsese decides all the main characters have to die a grisly death and ends with a nihilistic image that I suppose perfectly ties together the nihilism of this film. Jack Nicholson's performance aside, there's very little of anything to recommend in this excessive, overdone, failed attempt at a thriller.

What she was saying is that it is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen, and that includes the Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!!! What a complete and utter waste of time! I cannot fathom what on earth the producer, director cast and crew thought they were doing! Rooting for good and expecting the bad guys to get theirs is a human pass time isnt it?

Accents come and go (hello, Jack? Martin?), the love interest is pointless/underdeveloped, and the Shakespearean ending, while jolting, is ultimately ridiculous. Just in case you miss the heavy-handed message, watch for the rodent in the final scene....

Well filmed and generally acted well, this film is nonetheless over-rated. The plot is excessively complex with realism sacrificed in the interest of making the stories of the 2 informants parallel. This allows a lot of well done cross-cutting between plot lines but strains credulity. Some of the dialogue verges on self-parody. Most of the principals and supporting cast do well but Jack Nicholson's performance as an evil Nietzschean egoist is rank scenery chewing.

In a star-filled cast, Leonardo DiCaprio shines as an undercover cop. Rather than play the typical cool customer of this genre, he portrays the sheer terror of a man playing a very dangerous game. Over time the lines in his face and tremors in his hands convey unbearable tension. His opposite number is Matt Damon, whose boyish good looks also show strain as he manages the investigation to find the traitor in the department. Nicholson is Nicholson; Martin Sheen wonderful; Mark Wahlberg is great as one of the more obnoxious cops to appear in film. Nice twists involving modern technology--text messages and cell phones. I'm not sure this film was the best of the year, but it was time for Scorcese. A little long, but highly enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"the terminated/ exterminated/executed/brutally jettisoned!","review":"While this film had a all star cast and is quite lengthy, it left me with a I want my money back feeling in the end.

He observed for the brightest and most vulnerable children and enticed them into the organization. I would not classify this as a thriller or action/adventure. This film was intended to shock your sensiblities, such as after shooting execution style a man and woman in the back of the head, the lead character states \\"On they fell funny.\\" If you enjoy lots of gore (head style executions) then this depressing film is for you. They all had the Boston accents but were a little thick."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was'nt THAT great. !","review":"I would personally like to thank the Academy for giving out the Oscar to this year's WORST movie. I'd like to thank Jack for giving out the WORST performance in his lifetime career for being so stupid on screen, To Leo, Matt, Mark, Alec, & Martin Sheen for displaying some weak supporting role performances, and to Mr. Scorsese for winning his Academy Oscar for putting the word F**K into the vocabulary. We're so ashamed of you! Also, I'd like to thank WB Pictures for screwing everything up, And evidentally, this film should've won The Razzies Instead. also, Ooops-music cues to \\"Mr. Movieman\\" Don Lafontaine-I have to go..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment, what a waste!!!! :(","review":"My wife and I purchased this movie with the expectation that it would be a great movie, a fun couple of hours. It was not. It was simply boring and tiresome. We have all come to expect a great deal from Scorsese. While these expectations are high and maybe unfair, they are fairly earned as Scorsese has provided great movie after great movie. With that in mind, one can safely say this was a letdown of epic proportions. It was a just a rehash of Scorsese's previous movies with a helping of \\"southie\\" accent thrown on top. It was slow and boring. Skip this one, unless you have a few hours and a couple of bucks to kill. Sorry, but it was this bad. Honest!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Boston","review":"You'll be able to watch this one again and again. Unlike some ensemble works, no one is slacking, all are at the top of their game.

Excellent cast with DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson, Sheen, and Wahlberg...Although, people failed to realize that it was originally, I believe, a Chinese script. Nonetheless, very good movie that has an excellent twist at the end. Not your average 90 minute long movie. This movie is 151 minutes long and it was perfect.Scorsese takes the audience from the beginning to the end of how crime and criminals don't go hand in hand and earning trust is a very big gamble. A cop (DiCaprio) is working for the mob and a mob (Damon) is working for cops. Both are under covers trying to reveal the \\"rat\\" before the other person does.The movie was set in Boston and coming from the East Coast, Scorsese was right on the money. The accents, attitudes, and back grounds were perfect. Not recommended for children.

If you want to see this story done properly then get the original (Infernal Affairs) rather than this pile of trash. Why do English language directors feel they have to dumb down Asian movies when they remake them. To me this goes in the same bin as The Grudge or The ring or just about every remake of a good Foreign language film.

Leo and cast were absolutely believable in their roles. Although, I must admit I would have liked to have seen Robert DeNiro play the crime boss' role. Him and Scorsese have always made a great combination. I have never really cared for Nicholson's acting and I felt that in some points of the film he was hammin' it up a little too much.

Watch five minutes of Taxi Driver or Raging Bull or Goodfellas and you know it. The Departed is not even close to what he has done before. It's a TV show. Of course, there's Jack Nicholson being JACK. I have to admit that DiCaprio is a great actor, but this isn't really worth the time to watch. It falls short in both narrative and acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie itself's great..as for the extra features....","review":"By now, you must know how amazing The Departed is and how many awards its piled up since it was release. So I won't bore you with what you already know. Rather, I'll tell you how disappointing the extra features were. For example, the 9 deleted features run from seconds to a few minutes long and after viewing them, you'd wish you never saw them. It's pretty clear why they were cut out, as the movie was already running quite long and these scenes proved unworthy of being included in the film. The other features including the short documentary about the inspiration behind Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello were not very refreshing either. My honest opinion is... save the extra 5 bucks and get the one disk version."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Departed\\" On DVD - 2/13/2007","review":"Warner Home Video has announced \\"The Departed\\" on home video which stars Leonardo Dicaprio, Matt Damon, and Jack Nicholson.

Disappointed because I could not follow the confusing plot at all. Flashbacks and generally choppy editing made it impossible to get drawn into this plot. Puzzled because I have no idea why Martin Scorsese got an Academy Award for this film, except (as popular belief holds) it was finally \\"his time\\" and they decided to give him one before he died. This movie made no sense and is full of pointless profanities and violence.To me, the movie mainly serves as a signal that Jack Nicholson needs to find a different part to play other than Jack Nicholson. In this movie, he just plays what he's been playing for 20 or 30 years now -- some sarcastic, bitter SOB who is totally evil. Then he collects his fat paycheck for another \\"acting\\" job.Avoid this movie! It's all hype and little payoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"You call that an ending?","review":"Well, I finally got around to watching this movie; had it sitting on the shelf for years.OK, the plot had some holes and the movie really leaned on cell-phones as an important plot device.But several times I muttered to myself \\"what a good movie.\\" Some really over the top acting by an all-star cast. Lots of tricky movie fun.Then, what, in the last 15 minutes the movie crashed and burned into arch silliness. I mean really dumb. What? Did the scriptwriters run out of paper, or something?Was this really Martin Scorsese? Of \\"Goodfellas\\" fame? I expected more; much more.Bang, bang, bang, bang. The sound of a painfully bad ending.

In fact, there was little use of language which was not streams of continually obscenity (not bothersome in appropriate doses from appropriate characters) but everyone in this movie seems to have synthetic Turret's Syndrome. There is hardly a sentence without a scorching stream of cursing until one wishes to turn off the sound.This makes it difficult to drum up any interest in the plot. The script writer seems to have confused the mafia with a Manhattan hip hop street gang.AWFUL MOVIE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible - nothing to recommend this mess","review":"From such a good cast and director I expected much better than this. Its unbelievable, poor dialogue, bad acting, and way too long. The movie doesnt explain what motivates an intelligent, highly motivated character (Damon) to be drawn into being a mob insider. There was a good story here but its lost in the poor dialogue and unbelievable characters.

Gritty, profane, violent, full of gallows humor and uncompromising in its depiction of moral ambiguity. A very adult story full of contradiction and complexity and a raw-nerve tension.A superb film that may not be wildly popular with a general audience but is welcome work for those who are ready for a savage and un-Hollywoodized tale of cops and gangsters and corruption.

But there's no character development, and the plot is weak, overly complicated, confused, and lacking in resolution.Worst of all, this film is horribly violent.

Aside from top-rate acting, this movie suffers from a number of issues regarding the speed at which the story moves, such as: slow, slow, and slow.

In the effort to destroy South Boston's Irish Mafia, the police send in an undercover agent. Unbeknown to them the mob has infiltrated the police department. This film, directed by Martin Scorsese was a multiple Oscar-winning crime thriller, and I would agree with them on this one. Every member of the star-studded cast gives a faultless performance. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the undercover cop at his best, the mob kingpin is Jack Nicholson, and Matt Damon plays a career mob member turned cop. The plot sounds simple and done that before, but this is a surprising movie with more twists, and suspense than you would expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Departed Delivers!","review":"While this is not my favorite work from Scorsese as I appreciated more his \\"Gangs of New York\\" and \\"The Aviator\\", this is a very solidly made film. It is very engrossing with both multi-sided characters and a facinating storyline. The film, like many Scorsese efforts, is visually stunning and graphic. DiCaprio delivers another awesome performance, his third with Scorsese, and Matt Damon and Jack Nicoholson are top-notch as well. Mark Walhberg's performance, while excellent, wasn't, in my opinion, Oscar-caliber. I scratched my head on how he got an Oscar nod for this film and none of the other actors did. The script is very original and I enjoyed the many surprising plot twists. The title should give away to you a lot about how the story ends, but I'll just say that it is a sad story in the end. Like real-life good guys don't always win and bad guys don't always get caught."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserving Of The Best Film Oscar","review":"This is a fantastic film. Scorcese's films are often too long, but they are always well made and he gets some fine performances out of Leo Di Caprio, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson. Mark Wahlberg also gets a fantastic small supporting roll. Whether the end is ideal, I am not sure, but the ride up to it is absolutely fantastic. I am not a big fan of Leonardo Di Caprio, he was miscast in Gangs Of New York, but he has shown a mature performance in Blood Diamond, and The Departed is probably his best role to date. Matt Damon is also excellent as the bad good guy.With the likes of Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin, also in this movie, there is a top cast to add to the fine story, with twists and turns based on events involving a Boston Police Department and Jack Nicholson's crime lord and his gang. Definitely, the film of the year, and the best thing I have seen since Crash & Brokeback Mountain, which won and finished runner-up for Oscar glory last year.

'the first movie I've made with a plot.'Save your money... unless you think you might enjoy 152 minutes of racial hatred between the Italians and Irish, vulgar language, and murders that make The Godfather and The Sopranos play like children's bedtime stories.

Geee it was all I could do to sit through it. Sorry to all in the cast...but if I had paid to see it - I would have demanded my money back.

I would not recommend this movie to anyone who has any morals. No, after about 1/2 hour of this DVD I pushed the stop button and turned on a basketball game on my set.

Whoever wrote the script needs to kick themselves in the nuts. Honestly. I think people like this just because of the big names associated with it, but I really feel like this was a big flop. For one thing, *spoilers* I feel as though the ending was ridiculous. Nearly everyone dies within a 5 minute period.

The story is pretty much the same with a few differences! The acting is grade A and the blu ray delivers spectacular sound and detail!!! Fans of the film will be pleased. Matt Damon gives and excellent performance. Martin won the Oscar for this film but it's nowhere close to being as good as some of his earlier work."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Raging Bull","review":"Another typical hollywood shoot em up ending where everybody dies. Scorsese had a great movie going until the end, but instead of coming up with a realistic or thought provoking ending he sold out for the easy box office cash cow and killed everybody off. Obviously his academy award win was more of a life time achievement award than it was for this movie. If you want to see a really good gangter cop movie rent Donnie Brasco. But I must give you fair warning; the ending may be boring if you're male and between the ages of 15 and 25."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless....,","review":"Well, one point for effort then!Ghastly remake.

This movie is a two and a half hour waste of time. From irrelevant characters to the cheesy scenes where un-needed music \\"busts in\\". The conclusion is nothing special, and leaves alot of questions unanswered. This movie is a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lengthy, filled with profanity","review":"I love Jack Nicholson, which is the only reason I picked up this film.The Departed takes much too long to get started. The first 45 minutes could be clipped down to 20 to improve pacing. The profanity was stunning. I'm not a prude, but after the first 20 minutes I thought about just turning it off.That's a shame, because the final 20 minutes of the film are fantastic - a bloody conclusion worthy of crime film fans. The camera work is good, and so is the acting. There were some plot holes that could have been filled had they focused on that, rather than winning the Guinness Book's record for using the \\"f\\" bomb.Jack Nicholson's character had the BEST lines, though. I got a good laugh out of several of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot Holes Galore","review":"The constant use of the foulest language was a real turnoff. I stayed with it to the end hoping it would have a satisfactory conclusion. It didn't. The film left me with so many questions I spent hours reading message boards hoping to find clarity. There are so many theories and contradictory explanations that I'm giving up. Some even suggest Martin Sheen's and/or Mark Wahlberg's characters were in league with the mobsters. I didn't get that impression at all. That people came away with different perceptions illustrates how poorly the plot was executed. I wish there was a director's cut with additional footage that would clearly define the characters and tie up all the loose ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"STINKER","review":"A relative with an interest in organized crime wanted me to watch this.1). You know, even the real crooks and police do not talk that way. For example, they are able to put together three words without one of them being an obscenity.2). Big name actors who are also, in their private lives, individuals with whom I would want no contact and it shows in this picture.3). Contrived plot.To call this production a film noir or police procedural is truly an insult to the ones of that type made in the forties and fifties which are worth watching.Another reviewer stuck it out for twenty minutes. I lasted fifteen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Martin, please stop making crappy movies!","review":"Once upon a time Martin Scorcese was able to do great movies like the age of inocence. But that time is long gone. Now he really just wants to make money. And money he did..The script of the movie is quite stupid. The movie sometimes goes from one scene to the other without much being added to the storyline. There is lots of pointless violence. Cops are depicted as irrational individuals that say f*** all the time, like to punch each other and make their own justice.Besides being stupid the movie is also boring and the shooting is crap.

The convoluted and multi layered plot seems to lead to a bit of needless confusion -- perhaps the KISS principal would have worked better.

And not just jamming or noodling around - these pieces were composed to accompany these specific films, and refined over the course of many performances, playing live while the films were projected for the audience. If you are a fan of Tom Verlaine's guitar playing, you need to hear this. If you are ready to hear electric guitar playing that uses rock, jazz, and classical music as a foundation for something fresh and new, you will love this.

It explains many theories and gets fairly in depth. The book is a nice reference to look back at now and then as Dr. Arons explores alot of situations that come up between two HSP's in love as well as an HSP and a non HSP. The book is not an easy read as much of the language is quite profound. However, it does bring HSP's better in touch with themselves. Also, some of the explanations can cue non HSP's into the world HSP's face everyday. The same people who can cry at the slightest provocation can also deeply appreciate the inner beauties of art and music. Its good that Dr Arons is in touch with herself and recognizes that these people have a prominent role in our society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Affirming and Enlightening","review":"This book offered so much insight into my own interpretations of love, relationships (successful ones and not so successful ones) and the spiritual all from the highly sensitive person's unique perspective.

It was amazing how deep the author went to describe how and what a Highly Sensitive Person feels and interprets about all the various realms of love and relationship. Her compassion for the overwhelmed \\"HSP\\" in love was astounding. So often we are told that our sensitivity is a burden but Aron reminds us that it is our greatest gift to offer another.

I'm in summer school right now as a high school student and watching this movie makes me wanna go . Well if summer school was as fun as the way school was in the movie than i would go to summer school everyday. The characters in the movie are the same different types of kids there are in schools today. My favorite character is MR. Shoop the PE teacher that has to teach during the summer to a bunch of misfit kids who don't want to learn, but who later on realize how the teacher is trying to help.

I bought this at a DVD blow-out sale and decided to take a chance as the price was a steal. I expected a typical teen gross-out comedy. However, this is well directed and very heartwarming. Carl Reiner did a very skillful job at creating a sometimes hilarious film with excellent characters. The chemistry between Mark Harmon and Kirsty Alley is terrific. The kids in remedial English are great and surprisingly touching. By the way, anyone who loves the Texas Chainsaw Massacre will get a real buzz (pun intended) out of the character of Chainsaw, a kid who is obsessed with that movie. Loved it. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUMMER SCHOOL was never this fun!!!.....Untill NOW!!","review":"This film is such a classic and is loads of fun.

That album sparkled thanks to Bell's sublime guitarwork. But that, unfortunately, is not the centerpiece it should be this time around. Instead what we have is solid blues, fine standards, and, overall, a weaker album. Another change, this time for the positive, is Bell's increased vocal prowess. But what I miss is that sweet guitar. A nice bonus is the addition of the final four tracks, all solo Lurrie Bell, practicing in the studio. They provide an interesting insight on Bell's raw talent, which, as he proved on his previous album and occasionally on this one, is tremendous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"As I was recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease, which plays havoc on the small bowel, I read that a probiotic would help.

The Spanx and Lipo in a Box are OK, but too jiggly in the bust. I hoped I'd get a firmer control at a lower price with this. Yikes. My breasts looked like they were being served up on the half shell. The extra firm control means the mid torso area has several layers of fabric, unbreathing, hot as hell. This thing offered not nearly enough slimming to justify all that fabric.

Her description of Montalcino's wine industry (particularly about Brunello di Montalcino) is very interesting and made me really regret not buying some of that wine while we were in Italy.

The rest of it, it's terrible. Don't buy this book. There are much better books out there, eg.

I recently noted condensation under the glass. I sent it back to Citizen and they indicated the case tube leaked. Now out of warranty, I can change the CASE and MOVEMENT to repair.

So I told them to send it again, once again waited another six months, watch came back, and still was not fix, instead the new module for the watch, was in the bag with the watch, less the hands, I had to take the watch apart my self and remove the hands from the old module and install them on the new one, because I didnt want to wait another 6 months? The analog part of the watch is notorious for jumping time. I wont wear it any more because I dont trust it to keep time. If you want a watch that looks pretty buy it otherwise, it is a useless overpriced piece of junk that wound up in my junk drawer. Its sure not work the big price, I bought a cheap $5 watch that keeps better time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Deal","review":"I had this watch about a month ago, and i am very pleased with it, it really is a good show by citizen, though the lack of half hour time difference is aggravating, for a costly watch this should have been taken care of. The titanium gets scratches easily and in my case it is no difference, within a week some scratches magically appeared on the dial, the chronograph is also good, people will say why you need all the airplane calculations at the bezel but thats the way it is, and it in fact syncs with the blue angel concept. all in all its a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its an improvement","review":"I'vehad other similar citizen watches, and this one is better.

No fading, no corrosion, no scratches on the crystal glass despite rough handling.CONS:* It does not support 30 min timezones. So for example, you cannot set India time(GMT + 5:30) in the world clock. Instead you have to choose Karachi time (GMT +5:00) or Dhaka time (GMT + 6:00). So when I travel to india, my watch is always 30 min slow or fast depending on what i choose* Daylight savings time needs to be set manually and for each time zone. So come summer or winter time, I have to manually switch it on or off in my watch. Secondly, If I switch on DST for US Pacific Time and I check the time in New York (US Eastern Time), the time will be incorrect unless I manually switch on DST for the US Eastern timezone too"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this watch","review":"I love this watch. Not sure how to use the slide rule, but sure it won't be hard to learn. No light and no glow in the dark hands suck.Tons of options make this watch great, but it is not easy to operate.

Also, I thought 4 inches was going to be thick, but within an hour of laying on the pad it is completely flat and does not offer any support. I've had the pad just over a month and I am considering throwing it away. The company put a \\"restocking\\" fee on the return of this product. They obviously did this so they are not as likely to have them returned.

I was disappointed by another canned predictable Disney plot. The evil oppresive king and his followers are eventually overthrown by an unlikely hero and his band of misfits. Characters are bland and without dimension, and seem over reliant on funny voices instead of any real character development. Unlike Antz, the ants in Bug's Life have no similarities with real ants.

Flik does find bugs but not warriors instead the bugs he found are circus bugs. But he doesn't know that. Flik was sent out by Princess Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfuss). Phyliis Diller voices Atta's mother the Queen. The Movie should have been rated PG for the one swear word that I caught... This movie also came out in the same year as Antz.

It needs some serious re-doing, and if there ever is a Bug's Life 2, I will NOT be watching it because this movie was just too boring. I couldn't believe it if people were to call it a comedy. It isn't funny one bit. And instead of rating it G, it should be rated SB, for So Boring. This isn't on my recommendations list, and it could never make my top 10 list of hits.

Flick is the main character. Dot is a little guy who is cute. The caterpillar and the ladybug are especially funny characters. The caterpillar likes to eat and he's funny cause he always is so excited to be a beautiful butterfly and he's funny when he says it. The ladybug is a mommy to all the little flies like Dot. This is funny cause he's actually a boy.Hopper is the bad guy. He is going to take away the food when the last leaf falls. The other bugs are trying to not let that happen.This movie would not be good for toddlers because the grasshopper is very scary and there is one part that is a little violent where someone gets hurt.This movie would be good for children ages five and up and brave four year olds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick service","review":"Ordered as a last second Christmas present.

Hooray!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good But lacks support for wide screen TVs","review":"Although this movie is one of the best I have seen in years, this version of the DVD does not have \\"Enhanced Support for Widescreen TVs\\" like most other DVDs have. There is a big difference between having a wide screen version, and the wide screen version supporting wide screen TVs. This is a serious omission for the serious video family."},{"rating":"2","title":"More kids-oriented than Antz","review":"Another Pixar classic, the only things that flaw this movie from a parent's perspective is some potty humor and a scene where a character getting burned to a crisp (but not killed) is considered funny. (Smaller kids may be disturbed by several threatening scenes with the bad guys.) Other than that it's a cute movie with outstanding animation and a nice message about standing up for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyble flick -- great in the DVD format","review":"This DVD is a nice light comedy with positive messages understandable by young viewers. The vocal characterizations are very good with many great \\"gags\\" that keep you listening. In the DVD format the picture quality is terrific and the availability of menus makes it easy to navigate to the clever \\"out takes\\" that grace two versions of the credits. My 12 year old liked it better than that other bug movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice of Jonathan Harris a welcome treat","review":"It was great to hear Mr. Perfect Diction, Jonathan Harris, a.k.a.

The outtakes a the end are one of the best parts.

It's not just a kids movie. Adults and teens will love it as well. Flik is a loser ant and sets out to prove himself and make the colony better. He messes up and the other ants get mad at him. Flik goes out to the city (a place made of boxes under a trailer) to find big and tough bugs to fight off the evil grasshoppers. My favorite characters are the catipillar, pill bugs, and the lady bug. One of the best scenes is the circus scene near the beginning. The animation in it is breath-taking and beautiful. This is what computers are all about. Mix computer animation with a good storyline and lovable characters you come out with a perfect movie. I also recommend the movie Antz."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bugs Life","review":"I think that this movie was extremely creative and exciting. It was very unpredictable. The protaganist Flick was a character that has made a difference in my life because he had the courage to stand up to the antagonists, the grasshoppers. The main antagonist was Hopper who was head of the grasshoppers and was taking food from the little bugs and when Flick made the plan to fight them off he just showed a side of bravery and courage. If I were ever a bug, I would want to be just like Flick and if I wereever in a situation like that I could be just as brave as him."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie! I would show it to my daughter.YEAH!!!","review":"I loved \\"A Bugs Life\\" when I saw it on the big screen.I saw it on a girls-night out and just fell in love with the cute little caterpillar.When my daughter is born,she will have this movie-FOR SURE-It wasn't violent like kids cartoon are getting now and days. I enjoyed sitting there and watching it. \\"A Bugs Life\\" and Winnie the Pooh are my my all-time favorites. My family will love it when it comes out. It is 'The Family Movie' of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT MOVIE FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY!","review":"My family and I saw this movie twice, I also have it pre-orderd. My husband and I took our 2-year old son, on Thanksgiving Day to see this movie on our family vacation, our son sat through the entire movie and loved it, so did we. Disney is know for great movies A Bug's is no exception. I, also saw Antz and was disappointed how it was geared to children with such adult humer and Woody Allen jokes. A Bug's life is no comparison to Antz. When we heard their were new out-takes we rushed out to see it again, it was just as fun, and funny, the second time around. Great movie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this movie- it was full of action and fun","review":"I think this movie is really great with all the different wild plot twists and a humorous, cheerful view on things throughout the story. It was based on a basic, save the people thing, but it really originated and grew from there. Plus it gives you the appeal of a hero who will never give up. I'd say it's one of those, really get into, action and livelyness packed, with a lot of humor and a touch of romance, good movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic video!","review":"This is an entertaining movie for kids, young and old. The DVD's video clarity is AMAZING, as would be expected from the disc's pure digital transfer from the animation computers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just For Kids - One of the funniest movies ever!","review":"We don't have any kids, but we've STILL watched parts of this MANY times. The only DVD in our collection to have been played so many times, due in no small part to the high production values, the excellent facial expressions (there is ALWAYS something new to notice), the infectious humor and the gorgeous use of color. Being a direct digital transfer, the quality of the images are exceptional. We'd buy this DVD for the \\"out-takes\\" alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyable film for all ages!","review":"Amazon's review pretty much covers it all. The plot is a bit wornout and unoriginal, but the humor, the characterizations (especially the characterizations), and the high technical level of color and animation make this one of the most enjoyable films I've seen in years. I just rented it last week and found it to be just as fresh and lively and even more interesting - so much is going on visually that it is difficult to take it all in on the first viewing. As a result, I've decided to purchase a copy of my own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning digital images","review":"Well of course I told everyone that I bought it for the kids - NOT ! This D.V.D. should be heralded as state-of-the-animation-art for several reasons :- the computer generated images actually look so real due to the excellent texturing and movement and even better due to the acurate effect of lighting. Computer animators have struggled for a long time to acurately portray the effect of lighting and with this one they've cracked it. Widescreen and pan-and-scan on the same side of the disk. Creative use of the 5.1 channel sound, and finally an amusing short story about one (?) man playing chess - sounds boring dosen't it ? Of course not, and again here the animation and lighting make the subject look so real you can almost reach out and touch it. This D.V.D. is worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better than Antz anyday","review":"AWSOME MOVIE! I LOVED EVERY PART OF IT! Antz was a good movie, but A BUG'S LIFE IS WAY OVER ANTZ!

Beware and prescreen all movies. This is way too scary for kids under 7-8+. It was even creepy to me. I guess older kids may like it.******************************************************************************************************************************ok, let me clarify. 7-8+ was probably too high of an age to start watching this movie. My son was 1-2 years old when we first started watching it and he was scared. He's a little bit better with it now but is still afraid. We recently tried to watch Antz too and he was scared of it. This is why the title of my review was \\"not for toddlers\\" I think by the age of 4, he could really enjoy this movie without being afraid and telling me to turn it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining for kids and adults!","review":"A Bug's Life is entertaining for kids and adults alike. This movie is a non-stop action fest that has been masterfully captured on DVD.The picture quality if superb, if not the best I've seen, for an animated DVD due to the direct digital to DVD transfer. In full screen mode, you will be amazed how clean and delineated the picture is; the detail is incredible!My big surprise was how amazing the sound is on this disc. You can use this to show off your Dolby Digital sound system to friends just as well as any action film. The surround effects are crisp and the bass is well defined.My only complaint would probably be that the action and sound is so non-stop, that it can tire out adults, albeit mesmerizing children the whole time.The extras are plenitiful and well done. The inclusion of the end-title outtakes is the highlight of a wonderful special edition disc you're sure to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing small about A Bug's Life","review":"This is such a cute movie and one that is fun to watch over and over again.

It is built around fear, bullies, aggression, and ugly stereotypes. This film is a bonanza for therapists and sociologists, and it goes a long way towards explaining some of the pathologies of this society. How about a movie that lets kids be kids, instead of this onslaught of cheap sentiments and terror? The calculated story uses every trick to scare kids. The limited imagination of the story writers is particularly insulting. Is everything just about good and evil and the fight for survival? For young kids?? In many ways the film is a throwback to Cold War films such as Red Dawn (1984), in which school kids fought a Soviet invasion (no kidding!). Is \\"A Bug's Life\\" how we are supposed to prepare our kids for the war on terrorism? In sum, this film is a toxic brew. Kids deserve better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too nice...","review":"Only a short comment from me. The film was too colorful and too \\"nice\\".

It IS possible to create a youth friendly film and yet entertain the parents as well. This film, in my opinion, only achieves the the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANTZ is better","review":"thius movie's story is unoriginal and boring.

He seemed fine during the movie, and even though I was uncomfortable with the language and the bad behavior of the characters I let him watch it. BIG mistake in parenting on my part. The grasshoppers were really scary to him and the abrasive language affected him as well. He fell asleep crying, and only an hour after I tucked him into bed and he already has woken up with a nightmare. We know a lot of kids his age and a little older who walk around calling people \\"stupid\\" and saying things like \\"I will kill you\\", and we always talk with our son about how that behavior is not ok. To have a disney/pixar movie reinforcing that type of behavior is sickening. And we wonder why kids these days are becoming less and less respectful, we are training them to be so. I will never let my kids watch another one of these so called family movies unless I have screened it first.

I guess the violence doesn't matter. My 4 year old hated it because it was too violent. I thought the graphics were well done though. I also thought it was a cheap rip off of the Grasshopper and Ant story. There were funny parts, but not enough to convince me to buy it.So over all, great images and pictures, but the story line could have had less cruelty."},{"rating":"2","title":"These lights made all the difference in starting from seed!","review":"The Hydrofarm lights are really easy to assemble and disassemble for storage. I have three of the 2 foot lights, which I like because of their versatility. I really need one more. I have one 4 foot light, which I have hanging from chain in my shed. It will not need to be disassembled and was very easy to hang with a few adaptations. The quality is good for my needs; for a professional gardener, they may be a little flimsy and expensive. Amazon was quite a bit cheaper than the garden stores or the seed companies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grow Light","review":"This light used with a heat mat and temperature controller got my seeds sprouted in about half the time as regular germination.

I have three 9\\" pots under this one light, and all pots are growing herbs/peppers well. I don't know what the one reviewer was talking about with the raising/lowering mechanism, it works fine for me. It's true though that the plants on the edges do grow inwards a bit, but if you grow in small pots like I do, then its not a problem, every week turn the pot and it grows fine. For the price it would be hard to beat this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works just fine, just fine I say!","review":"Not sure why Trilby O'Farrell \\"Truth please\\" is having trouble with their unit, but mine moves up and down just dandy.

But as winter set in again and the days grow shorter, my plants became droopy. I put the light back up and the plants are up and well again.

The package arrived promptly and the parts look well-made and sturdy. However, I failed at my first attempt to assemble the stand. The vertical bars do not fit into the base stand even after pounding with a soft mallet as suggested in the manual. In addition, the provided screws for holding the parts together are way too short. After nearly half an hour of trying, I had to give up and return the product. Then I went back to the Amazon website again and found several very negative reviews about this product as having \\" poor design\\" , \\" impossible to attach the light\\", \\"poor quality light\\" and so on. This has taught me a lesson: one should never only look at the positive reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"light bulb won't work","review":"I read ALL reviews and decided to buy it anyways, to add extra light to my orchids. The instructions are SUPER easy to follow.The structure is strong enough to perform its job: hold the light fixture. It's sturdy, slim, even cute. I loved it!The only problem is that the light bulb wasn't working. There was something loose inside of the light bulb that came with the fixture. I went to Home Depot and local hardware stores but none of them had the same T5 bulb size. I did notice that none of their light bulbs were making the same loose sound my was making.Amazon replaced my item but the problem persisted. Even though I loved the item, I had to return it. Have I received a 3rd light fixture, it would probably have the same light bulb problem.I gave it 1 start because if the light bulb doesn't work, then the whole system serves no purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, solid product - rotten packaging!","review":"The product is fine -- it did not take more than half an hour to set it up and get the plants under the light.However, the package was left outside my door, in the pouring rain. It had no external wrapping, just the very colorful box that held everything without any packing whatsoever. So the box literally melted on my doorstep.Although the product inside was OK, this was a very shabby way to mail it to me. It is only pure luck that everything inside was not shattered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Correct Invoice, Wrong Product","review":"When ordering the grow light system, I assumed that it would be shipped to me. After paying for express delivery I opened the box and found the correct invoice had been put in the box, but instead of a grow light, a TV wall mount system had been put in the box instead.

Opened box and reviewed parts. The support sections are reasonably solid and the frame for the lamp is lightweight but functional. The instructions are brief but understandable if you have some experience with putting together parts to form the structure. You screw two support frames to the two feet. Be sure to use two washers as provided and tighten. Then push two frames into square holes in the upper frame. You have to use a little force, but my palm of hand was a sufficient hammer. Then attach two clips to light frame and attach to support lines coming down from upper frame. Took no more than 10 minutes.Light works, plants seem to be happy. System is stable on table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works soo much better than regular lamps","review":"I had always just used a regular lamp and a south facing window. And only had limited and some what pathetic results despite years of trying. I finally decided to stop messing around. Put this on my Amazon Wish List for Christmas and was happy to get it. Combined with a seedling heat mat under my seedlings I am seeing faster and healthier growth in all of the seeds I planted. Many of those only sprout in full sun, and I do not think any of them would have come up without this lamp. Very excited, and have just ordered another one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea for starting seedlings.","review":"I would have liked a two bulb system better. Otherwise, the stand is sturdy and easy to assemble. The switch on the light is vert useful (rather than plugging and unplugging). The ability to raise and lower the light will be useful, I think, when my seedling get bigger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product for the price","review":"I live in the city and do not have a lot of backyard space to garden in so I do not need to start a lot of seeds but for my small space it is perfect. I wouldn't recommend for large gardeners but if you have a patio or small garden and want to start your own seeds and not buy small plants it is wonderful. I put it on a timer so that I don't have to deal with it unless I need to water the plants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works but cautionary tale","review":"Received today.Assembly couldn't be simpler as there are only two screws and washers that are used to attach the bottom to the two uprights. However one of the two threaded uprights wouldn't accept the screw. I can only assume that it either was not threaded or that the threading was done incorrectly.In my case, I had already started my seedlings and couldn't wait for a replacement so after 1/2 hour of trying to get the metal screw provided into the threaded rod, I gave up and found a wood screw that had an acceptable diameter near the head and managed to get the unit to work.The unit is now assembled and working just fine.

He called, very happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works ok, but ...","review":"I'm generally happy with it, but I'm using it for a single flat of seedlings, and the seedlings on the edge of the flat are bowing inwards toward the light and not growing nearly as fast as those in the center. I'd recommend a four-light system to provide better coverage of the entire flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't find working bulbs for this","review":"The unit is pretty flimsy and came with a burned out bulb. Can anyone tell me where to find replacement bulbs for this? Everywhere I look online all I can find is 24\\" bulbs and the one that fits this unit is 22\\" and about half as wide as the standard 24\\" ones. I'd really like to get my lights going! Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"no better than my window","review":"First of all, if you're checking out this 2-foot system, make sure you think about investing in a 4-foot one for just a few dollars more. Wish I had noticed before I bought. However, I'd probably be returning that one anyway, because the light is just too wimpy for even a standard-size flat of seedlings. The seedlings in the very center rows of my flat look okay but all the ones on both sides, i.e. half of my seedlings, are stretching in toward the center to the weak ONE BULB florescent light. So I wasn't very happy with it in any case for both of those reasons, and then the light inexplicably stopped turning on and would flicker off by itself. I could tap on the end where the bulb went into the light unit and it would turn on again, but then awhile later I'd notice it just turned itself off or shorted out or whatever it was doing. I definitely won't be getting a replacement, I'd rather invest in something stronger and larger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plants love this light","review":"My newly transplanted violets love this light - I've had it for a few months now, and I've never seen them look so healthy. It was easy to assemble and fits nicely on a shelf under a skylight that is covered with snow during the winter months. I was concerned about finding a backup T5 fluorescent light bulb, but found one at a local nursery. The fixture curves nicely around the bulb so that the light is directed down and not into your eyes or the rest of the room, and it's easy to adjust the height. Now there's a little corner of summer in the middle of the winter season!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for growing seedlings, plants, and cuttings indoors","review":"This is an excellent, very sturdy product that is easy to put together and use. It only took me 10 minutes to assemble the unit. Using a rubber mallet (as the instructions recommended) pushes the metal pieces together tightly so the legs won't wobble when the unit is fully assembled. The unit also comes with rubber padded feet so it won't mark up hardwood floors.I am using the light to grow fruit bearing plants, flowers, sensitive cuttings (such as coleus), and new seedlings during the winter months. After only a few weeks of using the light, I've noticed a big difference in how healthy my plants look. The light does not get hot so it is very safe, and the height of the lamp is easily adjustable (up or down) with the pre-attached cord. It is a great product for the price, and it really does produce a visible change in the appearance of the plants."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for planter","review":"We wanted a nice grow light that would keep our Basil growing all winter. The stand is very sturdy, the light can be raised up or down, and the planter fits perfectly between the supports. We were also happy that the bulb was included. We will definetly purchase this item again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the last system","review":"Overall nice product and better built than the previous one. I guess the only thing I don't like about it is the fact that I would have liked the actual lighting system wider so if covers the tray more completely, width wise.

I got mine in an amazon box in another amazon box then I got to the box with what i ordered and within are a separate box for the light and box for the stand so I got it with five boxes...

I am certainly glad I did not pay attention to those . It came right out of the box and snapped together quite easily . You only needed a screwdriver for just two screws . The light snapped in solidly as did the mounting clips . The item is pretty sturdy and I am very happy with it . I purchased a timer separately and that would be my only complaint that it would be complete if it had a timer included. For this type of product that is pretty inexpensive . You could probably make something yourself for less money Using PVC pipes and the light fixture . But because im disabled It helps that everything is easy to put together so that someone can help me get it setup ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very simple to use, and very easy to set up.","review":"The shipping was good, it seemed very well packaged. You can set the whole thing up in 10 minutes or less; ez peazy. Fits perfectly in the space I wanted it in. My only complaint is that the reflector is a little jank and the light doesn't quite fit in it right. So it may seem like the setup isn't working, but you just have to jiggle the light around a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hydrofarm JSV2 2-foot jumpstart","review":"Bought two of these Hydrofarm jump starts I start all my garden seeds indoors, middle of March and I keep them under the grow lights until time to plant garden.

The T5 bulbs stay cool, I've tried other bulbs, these are by far the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Light setup","review":"I purchased this light kit to start vegetable seeds indoors as to get a jump on the planting season. It goes together easily and is sturdy enough to hold the light with no problems. The light is bright and works well. While you can have several plants thrive under the light, I would like to see a larger light reflector with two or four bulbs instead of one. I do recommend this product and I would purchase it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jump Start for Bonsai","review":"I purchased this because I am just starting with Bonsai and I received a deciduous Bonsai tree for Christmas. I need the extra light because of my window arrangement. I read the writeup online and decided this had the right kind of bulb to boost my trees.This device is wonderful. It is very high quality. All the parts are heavy duty and they fit together perfectly. It is very easy to assemble and it works great. The cord and switch is heavy duty. The height of the light is adjustable and even the paint looks great! It was very well packed. I highly recommend this grow light. I have seen it in a local store for a great deal more.I was having trouble with one of my trees and this light was instrumental in helping me recover it this winter. I only use it in the day time to give my trees a boost.So now I bought some starter trees online and I'm going to order another one of these lights today."},{"rating":"1","title":"no help instructions","review":"Bought it last winter, or spring, and just now went to put it together.

During assembly I discovered the pieces did not fit together properly. I ended up scrapping the entire stand due to it's instability with not fitting together properly and just hung the ballast from my own setup.. The cord is not like the cord on window blinds. Its just a string with a tension nob on it that slips with extended hanging.Do not buy this product. It is worthless... it is cheap... it is a waste of time. Also only holds one bulb.

I believe there is a real argument to be made that ideology (on both sides) plays too great a role in the intellectual discourse among academics, who should know better. This is not the best place to find such an argument, however. The book's appeal will be limited to those few inclined to \\"fall for stupid ideas\\" themselves. The irony in the authors' lack of self-reflection does offer the reader some humor value, perhaps. But the thoughtful conservative reader looking for reasoned arguments to make among serious people might want to look elsewhere.

I thought, this was THE book that I had been dying to get my hands on - until I read the excerpts and found out how extremely partisan Flynn really is.He honestly believes that only left-wingers are engaged in the shallow-thinking trap while ignoring the fact that right-wingers can be accused of the same thing. Letting ideology dictate your beliefs without engaging in critical thinking is bad no matter what side you're on.

The first few pages contained a number of apolitical examples of hypocrisy, which gave me the impression that it would be a fair, academic analysis of how smart people end up subscribing to dumb ideas.It wasn't until I purchased the book and made it a little further in, that I realized it is not. This book is very politicized, and makes little effort to discuss the subject in an unbiased manner. I'm ashamed to say that I didn't realize where the author was going until his rant on W. E. DuBois, followed by his suggestion that atheists believe what they do because they're simply too arrogant to believe in anything more important than themselves. Of course this is absolutely absurd and intellectually lazy.This book is not what it pretends to be, and I should have done my homework on it before purchasing.

Yet numerous times he attacked people whose unethical means were self-justified due to some utopian end. Flynn thus attacked himself, go figure.When asked about the current Iraq war, he said \\"im against it\\", clarifying his position to a student. However, one reason given to invade by the U.S. was that Saddam was a dictator who killed his own people, and taking him out would naturally mean Iraqis would no longer be subject to his murderous ways, meaning lives would be saved.

There's no telling when or how it's going to react, and I wouldn't use it over better and cheaper spyware protection.

Even though I think the program works pretty well, if you think you might need occasional help, I think it would be better to look for a company that has cheaper phone support.

You Will Love This :o)","review":"Requiem For A Dream is the most enticing film I have ever seen. This movie has literally changed my life. The movie is brilliant as so is the original score of the movie. Some listeners feel that this remixed release was a waste of time. I feel otherwise. I can't get enough of this movie and by releasing a remix of the original soundtrack just made it even better! The remixed soundtrack features some of the best of electronic artists and the soundtrack has a dancier feel to it- it is much more upbeat. Track 2 by Plant and track 10 by Josh Wink and probably the best tracks- in my opinion.If you loved this movie-- you gotta own this CD and the original as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"It's horrible. I cannot believe I actually paid for it! I'm a big fan of the movie Requiem for a Dream and an even bigger fan of Clint Mansell's score, so the album of remixes caught my attention. After listening to the first two tracks I knew it would not meet my expectations. There are however a few exceptions, they are \\"Ghosts in the Machine\\" by Psilonaut and \\"Aeternal\\" by Paul Oakenfold. Those are the only DJ's on this album who, in my opinion, know what they're doing.This album is filled with mediocre mixing from substandard \\"DJ's\\" (also known as anyone with a drum machine and a computer). It's the equivalent to scribbling on Leonardo da Vinci\`s artwork. I do not recommend this to anyone who really liked the original score."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope","review":"I'd agree with the reviewers who gave this album 1 or 2 stars. It's NOT an homage to Mansell or Aronofsky's brilliant film. It's a bunch of club producers doing club remixes. You may hear it thumping over the loudspeakers at your local dance club, played by some well-intentioned DJ who think he's digging deep, but it's doubtful the fans of the film will find as much depth in this album as in the original soundtrack.As a footnote, I got hooked on Mansell from Aronofsky's first film, \\"Pi\\". Definitely a must-own album and a must-see film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Left Untouched","review":"If you're at all curious about this CD, then check it out before you buy it. I found it kind of boring.Some tracks seem only slightly altered (bits of dialogue thrown in, pulsing dance floor beats in the background, etc) while others are almost completely unrecognizable. And the tracks that are taken directly from the film (\\"Seacost Towers,\\" \\"112,\\" \\"Sara,\\" etc) are just outtakes from the first, superior, original soundtrack. They're incidental, at best.So my whole problem is this: why take the stellar Requiem CD & mess with it? Mansell's haunting score is practically perfect! Why ruin a good thing? If it ain't broke, don't fix it!If you're a fan of the film's score then do yourself a favor & just buy the original soundtrack. I think this CD is only for die hard fans of these DJs (Paul Oakenfold, A Guy Called Gerald, Josh Wink)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Requiem For Ravers","review":"Uh, I was very relieved to find that I wasn't the only person to be disappointed by this album, although the sheer mediocrity of it can be addicting on its own (I actually drove to some friends' houses and proclaimed: \\"listen to this garbage, you won't believe it!\\").This album has really reduced my faith in Clint Mansell's artistic leanings, and I refuse to believe that Darren Aronofsky had anything official to do with it. The thing most disturbing with the music on here is that it was once the score to a film that denounced drug use, but is now rebuilt as the ultimate soundtrack to a discoteque drug scene.However, the Kronos Quartet's re-rendering of \\"Tense\\" is haunting enough to download if you can find it. It was the only track I kept on my computer before ridding myself of the disc. What a shame, what a shame. I still write down lists of artists who could have remixed the score better. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful story of how modernization kills a civilization","review":"In many ways, this is Farley Mowat's most enduring book.

This laptop is very portable and is very sleek in design. One really good thing about the iBook is that it runs relatively cool (for a laptop) after being powered up for several hours. The trackpad took some getting used to, but it is really an innovative pointing device. Also, the iBook G4 features OS X 10.4 Tiger. I have to say that OS X is by far the best operating system in the world. (Please note that I am a seasoned user of computers. In fact, I am about to graduate college with a Computer Engineering Technology degree. I have had experience with a lot of flavors of operating systems.)

There is advertised a 40 GB hard drive. However, when I recieved it there was only about 25 GB of free space. Apparently the programs on this machine take up a lot of space, I'm not quite sure, but the amount of free space, I think, is what should be advertised, not the total.This isn't a problem for me because this is my writing machine. I don't use it for much else. The occasional song on Garageband maybe, or listening to iTunes. But a great product.

The built-in Airport card has better reception than my G3 version of the iBook that this one replaced. The slot loading combo drive is fast and quiet.I chose the 12\\" version over the 14\\" because I feel the screen is crisper and I prefer the smaller footprint for traveling and sitting on the back porch wirelessly surfing the net with the iBook in my lap.

I love the built in mic feature as well as the sleek clean look. However the one annoyance I've had with this ibook was that the latest version of Yahoo Messenger (the reason why I was looking forward to the built in mic feature) isn't available to Mac yet so now I am stuck with the old crappy version that doesn't support voice but aside from that it is pretty much everything I've wanted in a portable computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"i LOVE my lappy","review":"i bought this as my second computer, i have a PC, and i like it so well. it's probably my prize possesion. i would encourage anyone and everyone to have their very own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love is color blind","review":"Basil is a naive sap that any woman wish would fall for her! He completely falls in love with a woman who is only interested in his money but of course, he is blind to that....sounds like a silly romance novel, which I loathe, BUT because it was written in the 1800's, there are descriptive characters, fabulous use of the English language.

Basil is such a tragic hero that I found myself commiserating with him way too many times - his misfortune to fall in love at first sight, and the deal he makes with the woman's father, lead to disastrous consequences, and I found the writing incredibly believable from start to finish. I wish some brave publisher would take the plunge and re-publish his lesser-known novels at a decent price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basil by Wilkie Collins","review":"What can one say? Collins doesn't miss, and this is a good book. It's a little more strange than his others in his characterizations, but, like the others, I couldn't put it down until I finished it. The air of mystery in all his books keeps you reading - because you just have to know!! But, the movie?! Forget about it. No resemblance to the book, and I thought poorly done.

If anything, its probably showing its age -- it was published in 1852. Today, we don't expect our men -- or women for that matter -- to fall into a swoon at the drop of the hat. I think the subject matter is still very current -- I think too many people fall in love with love, or lust, and marry people that they haven't really gotten to know and all too soon they feel trapped in a marriage that is not what they envisioned it would it (and which rarely is achievable).

It's not that the musicians aren't talented; it's just that Duran Duran's music - or at least most of the songs chosen for this release - doesn't translate well to the string-quartet format. A collection featuring all Duran ballads (Midnight Sun, Michael, Pop Trash Movie, Land, Winter Marches On, Matter of Feeling, etc.) would have worked better. If you're one of those fans who feels the need to own every release related to Duran Duran, it's not a terrible purchase to make, but for the casual fan, it's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh, don't bother","review":"The first book, \\"Starfish\\" was amazing, just a great read. This last book is horrible! Confusing, pointless, and extremely degrading, I wish I had never read it. I agree whole heartedly with \\"aisian film c\\" above!

I appreciated the smart science (hey, gotta love SF with bibliographies!); I found the world riveting and the characters well-drawn. But I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this book. The sequence of sexual sadism, which stretches on for chapter after excruciating chapter, is simply too visually explicit to be worth experiencing. It's an image I just didn't need, and one I can't get out of my head. It includes an eroticized clitoridectomy, for goodness sake. For me, that sequence overshadows everything else in the book, and however much you may want to see the resolution of issues raised in the other books, be sure you're willing to have that image stuck to your eyeballs before you buy or read this volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"Otherwise trustworthy Bionaire has produced a defective model. I've been through two of them now, both with similar problems. They tend to shut off despite enough water being in the tank, and no other visible problem.

Stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Product","review":"I had just purchased the humidifier and followed all instructions to set up the system. After running for 15 seconds, the machine's reset button started to blink, which by the way should only be blinking if it runs out of water. Staring dumfoundadly at a full water resevoir, I followed their reset procedure only to have the same thing happen again...and again...and again. When I called customer service, they explained that the only time the reset light will come on is if there's no water left in the resevoir or if there is a mineral build up on the heating element. I explained that I had just bought the system less than an hour ago so there's no chance that there is a build up of any kind and that the tank is full. Their response was to return it and bring home another system and try that one. I am definately returning it, but will not be purchasing another bionaire system, or anything that has the bionaire name printed on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to clean","review":"In my opinion the reset problem and occasional burbling are not problems. My main beef is it's too hard to clean. A few weeks after replacing the filter the deposits start adding up. It has to be cleaned basically every time you refill the tank. Soaking in vinegar doesn't do much and requires a lot of vinegar as the entire bottom reservoir must be filled. The (phosporic-acid based) cleaner sold on the website is slightly better but in the final analysis you have to resort to hand scrubbing. And there's the hitch! You can't reach parts of the element, not even with a toothbrush. Why they couldn't center it just a little further away from the edge of the \\"wall\\" is beyond my comprehension. I spent more time last winter with the thing taken apart & trying various methods of cleaning than with it running.

I really wanted to get the Air-O-Swiss one but alas, it cannot be found or shipped to Canada... weirdly.So far, I am less than impressed. Took me forever to even get it working. The constant resetting is tiring. I did find a solution (initial anyway) - you fill the tank but also fill the inside reservoir (where the round filter is) and then it works.The noise it makes is NOT easy to get used to, no matter how tired you are.I am trying it for one night, then if I can't sleep I will return it. It's not worth the money. My advice? Save up and get the Air-O-Swiss."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does the firm get away with marketing this product?","review":"Several buyers/reviewers have complained about the tendency for this humidifier to switch to reset mode without any particular reason, requiring a manual restart. I incautiously ignored those warnings, purchased this model, and find it nearly useless. I have since purchased another brand of warm mist humidifier with a similar adjustible humidistat. (My more recent purchase lacks the relatively unimportant remote available on the Bionaire, but I'll take reliability any day over an added gadget on a machine with unacceptable and time-consuming random resets.)

The shadowdance was interesting in that the author compares it to martial arts kata ....The angel Zoel and demon Asdeon, creatures who should be capable of vast unimaginable powers, are reduced to a bickering sidenote to the story. Asdeon, especially, was disappointing, a second-rate dandy spouting unfunny quips at the stoic and beautiful Zoel. ....

With the exception of the opening chapter and a suprise near the end, the book was very disappointing. To sum it all up. This was the first book about Colin( the main character) but I felt like I was reading a sequel and was totally out of the loop.

Although multi-character story lines can be very rewarding, here they are just convoluted and muddy the waters. The (merciful) ending of the book was such a amaturish let-down I, truly, drove straight to Good-Will and dropped my copy of the book into the donation bin. If you want books on a very similar theme (I'm sure Reaves was attempting a knock-off), please try the novels of Neil Gaiman.

The author weaves the fantasy story quite well into our current time period. I'll leave the story synopsis to others, but if you like fantasy or demonology or sorcery, you'll enjoy this book! It moves right along, after a bang up beginning, and comes to a somewhat satisfying conclusion. Leaves you wondering about the circumstances, past and future, of some of the characters, particularly Colin and his interesting past, but that's a good thing.

When you are done draining out the water to make your sandwich, the chicken amounts to about half this small can. Also, it is a very milky white in color, even for white meat, which makes me wonder if it is not processed. There is nothing on the can that states it is not processed, or all natural, which allows Hormel, if this is the case, to use processed parts of the chicken. Just the mush and too much water is enough to say goodbye to this rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality; mostly water.","review":"I have opened 6 cans now. Each is primarily water with tiny, shredded bits of chicken meat floating in fluid. Sorry, but if you own a cat that's probably where you'll donate this product.

This was an expensive disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to give it 1 star","review":"Due to the fact you cannot give a 0 star rating I had to give it a 1 star.

It tasted horrible, which is surprising in just white meat. I do not know how they could have so thoroughly removed all flavor from the chicken and am not sure I want to know. I realize it's salt free but that usually doesn't seem to matter with other brands as I flavor it when making the salad. I usually like Hormel products so it was very disappointing.

The one time I used it, it wasn't noticeable and definitely not worth the price you pay by stinking. I would not recommend to anyone. Guess that's what you get for buying a product like this online.

Robinson, Joan Bennett, and Dan Duryea in a tale of murder and betrayal.To this reviewer the most riviting performance is that of the great (and beautiful) Joan Bennett.The way she deceives the naive Edward G. is a screen classic.Barbara Stanwyck, Claire Trevor,and Marie Windsor could also manipulate men by promising the moon and NOT delivering without a trace of remorse, Linda Darnell could also manipulate but, with at times, a heart of gold.(A LETTER TO THREE WIVES) but Joan here is unsurpassed in her greed.I don't like remakes of great films,but if a remake is made of Scarlett Street I vote of GINA GERSHON in the the Kitty March (Joan) role.GINA would set the screen on fire!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film, awful quality","review":"The quality of this DVD is so awful I felt ripped off. It's like a tenth generation VHS tape--muddy, full of skips and jerks, and does not do justice to this Fritz Lang classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie...Horrible film quality","review":"Why is it that at least 4 of Edward G. Robinson's high qualitymovies have been \\"preserved,\\" both in video and DVD, in horrid condition. Scarlet Street is probably the worst of the lot, but The Red House, Woman in the Window, and even The Stranger with Orson Welles are all available only in very bad condition. I would imagine there are many TV stations that own much better prints that could be used. Whether in the public domain or not, all of the above films except The Red House could be considered classics (Fritz Lang directing or original scripts and performances) and should have by now gotten a preservation treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, but this is NOT the copy you want!","review":"No one can dismiss Scarlet Street as anything less than one of director Fritz Lang's best films. A supreme cast along with fantastic cinematography and studio supplied atmosphere help to create a memorable standout in film noir. A classic film that has, unfortunately, languished in public domain hell for way too long.But, if you are tempted to purchase a copy of this film, DO NOT buy this edition. There is no restoration or remastering here. If you want the definitive edition, get the KINO edition mastered from a Library of Congress 35mm negative. You can find the DVD for around the same price and it is well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID annything from Alpha!","review":"Terrible transfer!

Kino Video seems to have this problem in quite a few of their movies. I have over 250 1940's in my collection and rarely run into this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Picture Punctures Pleasure","review":"Edward G. Robinson, Dan Duryea, and Joan Bennett are excellent in this prototypical film noir. Unfortunately, the picture quality on this DVD is so poor, it almost completely negates any pleasure one might derive from watching this very fine movie. For those who really want a copy of \\"Scarlet Street,\\" I would recommend recording it onto VHS tape, a hard drive, or a recordable DVD the next time that it's shown on TCM or AMC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lang's second best American film.","review":"Scarlet Street twists and turns all over the place and is a superb story about evil cons and their unknowing dupe. It has a lot of poignancy about the self-imposed prison that people situate themselves in, how unscrupulous people can prey on the weak and insecure. It is a thoroughly pitch-black film noir about the depths of humanity.I have to knock of one star though for a couple of reasons. First, the film sacrifices a modicum of reality for yet another plot twist, and Robinson's gullibility is just a little too played out; it gets redundant. Dan Duryea is not particularly good in his role either; too affected. And the ending was a bit trite.For me, Fury is the best film Lang made in Hollywood, for the clarity of its incredibly harsh message and its riveting drama. Scarlet Street is a wicked little film but doesn't quite scale the same teutonic heights."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY, A BEAUTIFULLY MASTERED PRINT OF A CLASSIC NOIR","review":"Having Fritz Lang's Scarlet Street in even a reasonably clean remastered DVD print once seemed like a pure dream, and living with a couple of acceptable prints was all that noir/Lang/Eddie G. fans could expect. Now, Kino Video has found the right elements to make what seems to me the best print we'll ever have of this great film. In remaking Jean Renoir's La Chienne (which also needs remastering for a DVD release), Lang had to deal with Production Code rules in the mid-1940s that forced him to make unwanted cuts in several scenes and change the ending for the censors. So viewing La Chienne will help to put the \\"real\\" story in its proper perspective. Beyond these comments, I don't want to be the \\"spoiler\\" for you. Just buy the DVD now, support Kino's further restorations, and watch it innumerable times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!","review":"The quality of the video on this DVD is terrible!!!

It's actually impossible to watch,the picture is blurred, full of artifacts and lines. There's a big white vertical line running though it. It looks like a copy of a copy of a VHS tape. Even the sound track is out of synch. with the actors. Horrible.

Only for extreme movie buffs who cannot live without this film. There doesn't seem to be a quality print to be found anywhere in any format. A real shame.

But they're both undone by one of the worst quality DVDs on the market. This company should be prevented from ruining any more good old movies with such inferior disks.

It was an engaging read, and I recommend it. It is broken down into different narratives, each 'written' by a separate character involved in the case, and all are fully developed and interesting, and it is also interesting to see how the different characters then appear when reflected in other narratives.

He did not use fluff, hype, or the jargon-of-the-day in an effort to promote himself. Rather, this humble servant sacrificed his soul-life to be used by the Lord to unveil His unsearchable riches to His seeking lovers. Through this brother's ministry I have progressed in my love and appreciation for the Lord Jesus and His glorious expression on earth, the Church, which is expressed practically in the local churches. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to all those who seek the Lord in sincerity with all simplicity and a pure heart. The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you. (2 Tim. 4:22)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good philosophy content, but the author is biased","review":"Although this book has much good information about the origins and reasons that philosophy came about, the author chose to use this college textbook as a springboard for his bias towards some of the great philosophers. Yes, maybe in today's society some of the views of the great philosophers may not be PC. This book is not the place to express your own views."},{"rating":"1","title":"About Philosophy","review":"This book does not explain in plain English the philosophical ideas. All you get summaries and direct quotes but no true explanation. The writer assumes the reader has a solid background on the subject. It was fustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Text Book for a Beginner","review":"This is one of the worst text books I have ever had to read and try to understand. Used this text for an online class -- tough subject to figure out on one's own and the text, laden with the author's opinion and stories, made it difficult to weed out what was important and what was crap. I had to use a different, older Philosophy text book as a guide to understand what Wolf was trying to convey in this text. I thouht I was going to enjoy philosophy--I'm counting the days until I don't have to open this book ever again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable collection of extremely fine images.","review":"This large format soft-cover book contains some truly stunning images. The plates are all B&W, a medium that conspires to allow the photographer to present his subjects without distraction.Some of the most startling photographs show men in conjunction with some amazing natural rock formations allowing the viewer to conspire with the view that man is a hard beast, yet as the subjects are totally dominated by nature one is also forced to accept how weak and small a man is.One striking fact about all the images is that they have a misty quality which works well and I hope is not an error in the book production. Well worth adding to your collection of male erotica."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"There is something in being able to write about your own misery with such a wit that it virtually infects readers not even remotely introduced to Belgrade and its people! Excellent book, excellent style and a sense of conciousness that is infectious. Now, all I want to do is go there and see for myself..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Satanik Black Metal From Hell....","review":"This is the new effort from Urgehal. Goatcraft Torment is a truly punishing release filled with Black Metal violence. The first track starts out with Trondr Nefas yelling \\"This is Satanic Black Metal.\\" From that point on, this cd will kick you in the teeth and tear your mortal soul apart. If you like extreme Black Metal, you need this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Well Loved Song Seen with New Understanding","review":"I know this song. I have sung it as a solo and directed choirs to sing it. The words and the music combine to make a beautiful sadness...a sense of being alone and yet peaceful. Gwenyth Swain has used her imagination and sensitivity to create a story of the song's beginning and Ronald Himler has added perfect illlustrations. The characterization of Annie Morgan and her Father is written and illustrated without a flaw. It is a lovely book, one to share with a friend no matter what age. It is sure to bring a tear to your eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"very pleased","review":"I was very much pleased with it.

Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"BY ALL MEANS....STAY AWAY FROM THIS CD!!!","review":"I really liked the first BoD CD. So, I was excited to buy this one when it came out. Now that I have it, all I can say is: Anyone who ever questioned Nikki Sixx's songwriting ability...just listen to this CD. His absence is GLARING!!! There are NO stand out songs on this CD. Every song just drags along with no hook or melody or ANYTHING you can hang your hat on. I've never been more disappointed in a sophomore release. All four guys need to move on now....the Brides have Destructed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brides of Destruction","review":"Not nearly as good as \\"Here Comes the Brides\\" - the first CD.

Everyone is trying to make a buck by trying to push the same generic crap.... Anyways my two cents...I think this album is good overall and is fun to listen to yes has more nu---metal sound to it than the other one with N.Sixx I do think Traci was crazy leaving L.A. Guns , I heard them recently in Detroit, wow they sounded real good, awesome guitarist got their autographs heard the whole Cocked and Loaded album live, thats a must see..... Well anyways I think this album is worth listening too and grows on you but needed a little something more.... Check out Kill Switch Engage.....cool and original..I think....."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as bad, but ain't that good either.........","review":"this was a disappointment. i thought their debut was one of the best albums in a long time. i was soooooooo looking forward to this one to see if the absence of nikki would be a difference maker. it was.... but not in a good way. things sound lost in the mix, the writing ain't to great, and london is all over the place. traci plays pretty good, and scott's drumming is great. but there just ain't enough hair on them balls like the last album. it's a shame corabi left before the band 1st album came out, and it's a shame ginger left the band before the second album came out. both of them could have helped the band overcome the absence of sixx. maybe next time london le grand won't be such a prima donna, and get help sharing the spot light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a \\"one hit\\" wonder.","review":"This is a great representation of the band's large body of work, including the song the whole world knows, \\"Take On Me\\", plus several other gems, including my personal favorite, \\"The Sun Always Shines On TV\\".The lads from Norway have unfairly been branded as a \\"one hit wonder\\" when in fact they have had a long career with a large body of good music. This albums covers that career wonderfully.If you loved \\"Take On Me\\", and remember \\"The Sun Always Shines On TV\\" as well as the theme song from the James Bond film, \\"The Living Daylights\\", then this album is well worth checking out, as there are many other great tracks on it. I bought it for the three previously mentioned tracks, but found many more tracks that I thoroughly enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen First","review":"I wish I could have found a snippit of each song when deciding whether or not to purchase this album. Instead I relied upon the other reviews and my memory of 'Take On Me' and 'The Living Daylights' from when I was younger. I decided to take a chance and purchase this album. I listened to the album once and have no real desire to hear it again. The music/lyrics stink (unless the listener considers hearing about broken relationships and lack of commitment to other people and oneself enjoyable). I would definitely listen to any of Ah-Ha's albums/songs prior to deciding whether or not to purchase them."},{"rating":"2","title":"America WAKE UP!","review":"Here in America, this band is seen primarily as just a \\"one hit wonder\\" from the 80's. Now, \\"Take on Me\\" is a great song, but a-Ha is NOT just that one song. I have all of their CD's (including Morton's excellent \\"Wild Seeds\\") and you cannot go wrong with any of them. The only one that is a bit spotty in places is \\"Memorial Beach\\" but that is understandable. This CD is a fantastic overview of the band and is highly recommeneded. From here, go to \\"Scoundrel Days\\" or \\"Minor Earth, Major Sky\\" and get drawn in. It is a shame that America is not able to grasp how Pop music can be done in a artful, interesting way that has meaning. a-Ha are the real deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"overlooked band","review":"Boy, I forgot about this band.

Great gift for that 80's lover, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Singles 1984-2004 by a-ha","review":"I knew a couple of their singles but I did not know the band. Until Amazon suggested I might like it (after having purchased some Trance music) I had not been aware of them. Having listened to the short pieces through Amazon I purchased the CD and have not stopped playing it since it arrived: in the morning, during the day, preparing dinner, going to sleep! Even though I cannot work out many of the words it does not matter; the quality of the voices and the absolutely beautiful strong sounds of the instruments, together with a great beat, are magical. This is one of my most favourite CD's to date. Just love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"reinventing","review":"This trio continues to reinvent themselves. They were packaged in the US as a hair band in the eighties. This was a big mistake as anyone, who has been watching their progress over the years, can attest to. While they are considered a one hit wonder in the US with their single Take On Me which was a world wide #1, this was only the beginning for this fine band. They are now a seasoned group with fine credentials. Check out the virtuosity of the groups guitarist, Paul Waaktaar-Savoy, an unrecognized musician with enormous talent.Check out their songs.

I guess I'm just a nice guy.This book is full of errors and has examples that are way too long to prove their point. It spends most of it's time demonstrating slick little features of VC++ 2005 express and not enough time teaching basics of programming. It's the type of book that DeVry or the University of Phoenix would pick for one of their classes to con you into thinking you're learning programming. I've gone to both, I know what I'm talking about.Also, vc++ 2005 express has a few bugs and lousy debugging. I could go into more detail about what's wrong with the book but the editors at Course should've done their job and I'm not going to do it for them.Even the quote from a reviewer for the Dr. Dobb's Journal on the front cover is deceptive. It praises the book series and not the book itself. That should've been a red flag for me but I wasn't paying attention.This book is a waist of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont even think about it","review":"Iam going to refrain from using certain words but this is the worse book i have every read.

He loves using this program. It is easy to use and the user goes through the program step by step. It doesn't allow to jump around or ahead.

Unfortunately, it is very disappointing. The story goes back and forth, and not in a very clear way. The plot has some holes and I kept jumping whole pages, which is always very frustrating to me. I thought I wasn't going to finish it. The beginning of the book- actually the first half- takes forever. The book starts to come together on the second half but by then I was bored to death. Sorry about this one but I can not recomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a disappointment...","review":"After having read 'This Heart of Mine' by Susan Elizabeth Phillips, I decided to read Fancy Pants next. I was disappointed. The book is very dated in the 80's. I lived through shoulder pads as fashion once already! The characters are rather easy to dislike. By the end I could have cared less if they got together or fell off a cliff. If you are trying to decide on buying a book, choose something else of Susan Elizabeth Phillips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wished I could give more than five stars.","review":"Susan Elizabeth Phillips is my favorite author and I have read almost every romance book that's been written in the past twenty years. I have read everything she's written and the only commet I can think of besides 'absolutely the best' is, please write faster. I can actually see the characters and not just be reading about them. If it takes me over a day to read one of her books, it means I've had many interuptions. My favorite one was 'Hot Shot\\". Her books are keepers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her Worst","review":"Hated the characters, especially our hero(?). In real life he and his friend would have spent many years in prison for kidnapping.

Otherwise, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me wanting more","review":"I wasn't going to read this book soley because my mother had read it first but I was so bored while visiting I decided to pick it up cause it had a cute cover and I ended up loving it. While there is a lot of background story I think it helps to give the characters depth and allows you to really undersatnd them. The only problem that I had with this book was it took so long for the characters to get together that once to book ended I didn't want it to I wanted to read more. Great book definitly looking forward to read more SEP books"},{"rating":"1","title":"A real bore","review":"Reading about this book in a Self Magazine article, I decided to read it for myself.I nearly didn't finish the book. By the second chapter I nearly put the book down as the characters were so repulsive to me. Still I forced myself to read on. Halfway through the book I finally had to just skim through the rest of it so that I could get to the end. Too long, too convoluted with rather crude characters and no where near enough romance or even sex for that matter. The sex that happens is some of the most mediocre I've ever read. The book almost redeems itself in the last couple of chapters by actually getting a little bit interesting but you shouldn't have to wait until the end of a book to finally get interested. Just overall a very trying book that I wouldn't recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Is \\"Hilarious\\" About Blonds Being Beaten and Killed?","review":"From the back cover:\\"Until I wrote Fancy Pants, I didn't know I could make readers laugh.

This was a stressful waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I totally...totally hated it","review":"I have read almost all of Susan E. Phillips books and was eager when her earlier ones are reprinted...Af far as Fancy pants is concern it should stay out of print. Dissapointment does not even covers it. The relationship between Dallie and Francesca left me feeling somewhat disgusted. If you want to read SEP's best try her Kiss an Angel and Nobody's Baby But Mine......don't even glace at this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the story","review":"I enjoyed this story. Yes, it is placed in the 80's, but I thought it described that era well. I had a hard time putting the book down, because I was rooting for the characters to overcome their imperfections due to their upbringing. I didn't expect to love the story because of the ratings, but I truly did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best..","review":"I've read about 6 of SEP's books and this was my least favorite. I liked the main characters, but only in the last 100 pages. It took a long time to get to Francie and Dallie's character development and I felt like SEP fast forwarded through the best parts of the story and lingered on the worst. I'm glad I read this book but don't start with this one! SEP is a great writer, very funny and imaginative. It didn't shine through in this work as it has in others."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It really takes the reader into a whole different perspective on love with all the trials and tribulations of Susan' s books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fancy Pants - a big disappointment","review":"This story was very long winded and proved to be a big disappointment. After reading Ain't She Sweet (which was hilarious) and \\"It had to be You,\\" I expected a story line with lots of humour and unexpected turns. Fancy Pants did not deliver. It was boring and predictable with attempts at humour, but it simply fell flat on its face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - a very \\"80's\\" book...","review":"Everyone knows SEP is a good writer, able to come up with interesting characters from wildly disparate backgrounds who somehow get together, but this book is not one of her greats. First off, it suffers what I consider an \\"80's disease\\" - a Sidney Sheldon/Judith Krentz - like obsession with designer names, foreign princes, descriptions of yachts, and lots of pre-AIDS catting around. Secondly, its characters are not all that endearing: our heroine is obsessed with looks, money, and success, and our hero is obsessed with bimbos and failure. He neglects to tell her he's married; she neglects to tell him she had his son. I had a hard time liking these people, wondering if it was worth the effort to sort through several relationships and lots of confusing flashbacks. I don't feel I'm giving away too much here--if you like SEP, you'll struggle through it anyway--I just wish someone had warned me what I was in for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, really bad","review":"I finally got around to reading Fancy Pants with great excitment. I have every SEP book and I had just finished \\"It Had to Be You\\", so I guess my expectations were high. FP is purely AWFUL! From the hero being a jerk (that I never grew to like) to his being married (yep ladies, and he doesn't get a dee-vorce in a hurry either). To the heroine being a moronic brat that well, 'finds herself' and therefore becomes attractive to the jerk. There are few likable characters, and it takes 13 years before they 'run' into each other again and actually have a 'romance'. If you feel compelled to read this book, do NOT buy it, check it out from the library. I sent my copy there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little dated, but enjoyable read","review":"I think this the only SEP romance that I hadn't read before. It's one of her first books and is longer and more detailed than some of her more recent works. It's a riches to rags back to riches story. The heroine, Francesca, is spoiled and annoying in the first part of the book. Several awful things happen to her, but instead of giving up, she rises to the challenge and really grows in character. The hero is Dallie, a laid-back golfer who has a strange relationship with his best friend/ex-wife. As always, the secondary characters are well developed and likable. This is the first story where we meet Teddy, the hero in the book she's writing now. The story is dated (similar to Glitter Baby), but I really enjoyed it. It is a good book to read or re-read in preparation for her new book which may be out in 2010."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow starter but worth continuing!","review":"Admittedly this might not be SEP's best book in terms of wit and fast pace, it is starting out really slow but it is picking up and is getting more and more interesting. It is different from all her later books maybe because it is focusing much more on character and less on snappy dialogue one is so used to in her other books. I therefore found it profounder and it had me so hooked I couldn't stop reading. If you give it a chance and don't get impatient with the slow start you might actually find out that it is one of SEP's most special stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible electronic edition","review":"I've read this before in paperback, and with SEP's new book,Call Me Irresistible: A Novelwhich is the story of the son of the main characters from this book, coming out I thought I'd go back and read this book again. What an absolutely HORRIBLE electronic edition. It's VERY obvious that the publishers ran an old paper copy of this book through an OCR scanner and couldn't even be bothered to proofread it. I've seen fan fiction written by 6th graders with fewer typos. There were numerous typos on EVERY FREAKING page! Unless you're dying to read it somewhere where there's no bookstore available, do yourself a favor and buy the paperback. Whatever happened to having pride in your work? If I were the publishers or SEP, I would be incredibly embarrassed by this edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlikeable \\"heroine\\"","review":"The protagonist does not have enough redeeming qualities. She is a one-dimensional, unlikeable character. She is rich, selfish, and beautiful--that's about it. Seeing her punished for being that way was not enough to keep me reading. The hero is more complex, and his job as a golf pro is an original one for a romantic hero. Some minor characters add interest, but not enough. This novel is not funny or entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring capital B","review":"I'm very dismayed, How could SEP release such a lacking novel?? I must admit I'm an avid fan of \\"the Stars series\\" I've read the first 9 chapters waiting for the humor, passion, etc that I've come to expect from SEP.--Save your $$ skip this one. Written very well, but just nothing in this to keep your interest.Good Day"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish It","review":"The back of this book says \\"Come enjoy the adventure of a lifetime, an irresistible story that's touching, hilarious and passionate, all at the same time.\\" I'm not sure what book the were reviewing but it sure wasn't Fancy Pants! I managed to get 150 pages into the book before calling it quits. I could not imagine trying to wade through 350 more pages of these horrible, totally unlikeable characters. Don't waste your time or your money on this book. I wouldn't even check it out of the library. I am going to go and throw this book in the trash, something I have only done one other time in 50 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly put this down","review":"The background story was too long and a tad too boring for this book. I nearly put it down after reading the first 100 or so pages and they haven't met each other yet. If I didn't peak at the ending of the book, I wouldn't have finished this book at all. The relationship of the couple is a little hard to understand, mainly because it seems that they're not together a lot. I think SEP could have done much better w/ this book, considering her writing skills in the other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After devouring all of SEP's other books, I had this one on order for over a month. I finally received it, settled down and was thoroughly disappointed.

The characters were unrealist and boring except for maybe Veronica and her crazy famliy. To me this book was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or your money","review":"The novel was interesting enough to find out what the over-the-edge characters would do next. However, the women, except Desiree, were mean, stupid, and/or unrealistic. We all know women that exhibit negative traits, but that's because no one is perfect. What's more, no one seemed able have a decent relationship with a Black man (unless the Black man was with a White woman). Instead the only positive relationships were made up of interracial couples. In fact the only Black male relationship explored was with a Black gay male who was involved with a man of mixed heritage. Not even he could have a relationship with an African American person, male or female. In my opinion, the author has major issues with Black women, and she may be a little color struck as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"I found the plot of this book very degrading to African American women. The author, who happends to be a woman, focused on to many different characters instead of developing fully 2 or 3 main characters. I found this book to be extremely wordy and I could never fully grasped where the book was going. I wish I would have read the customer reviews prior to buying this book instead of having to warn you about it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"WHERE IS THE LOVE?\\"","review":"Incomplete storylines, unrealistic characters, details we don't need to know about and your Snaps were numbered incorrectly. WHY ARE THE SISTERS ALL CRAZY? WHERE IS THE LOVE? WHO WAS THE EDITOR? :( As an avid reader of black writers I am truly disappointed and cannot understand how this book could have have been found worthy of publishing. The potential of this book has been LOST. Please before you publish your next book, DEVELOP YOUR CHARACTERS, BE SURE TO COMPLETE ALL STORYLINES and please, please, please EDIT, EDIT, EDIT. Don't get me wrong, this book has at least 3 storylines that could developed into books. So I hope Ms. Welch-Tyson takes this as constructive criticism from someone who knows what they like to read. Finally, if you really loved yourself and saw your life as a beautiful thing you would be in that all too short line of \\"FOLK\\" portraying sisters on a more positive note.PEACE OUT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Me!","review":"I tried several times to complete this book and I found it a waste of time, I wouldn't suggest this book.

The characters, except for Desiree and Aletha, were not well developed, the plot seemed very unreal, and with every character there seemed to be an issue of race in one way or another, mostly negative. I think the author should have left out the other four characters because, apparently, they lacked depth. Judging from the outcome of this book it seemed that she could not sucessfully handle all six characters in one book. It was truly pathetic! Ms Tyson needs think twice before she gives up her day job!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break!","review":"This book is awful to put it mildly. No plot, no point to it, no nothing.

Black women are not like this! We are not this insecure! The book had an interesting plot, but some of the chapters portrayed Black women as evil, petty and immature.

I'm glad that I bought it in paperback because I would have been mad if I bought it in hardcover( a waste of money).They were to many characters D.W.T. tried to elaborate on; the book should have been written about Aletha & Desiree because they were the main characters.

The author's portrayal of black men was typical, while white men were shown as kind, understanding, etc., etc., etc. And who was she trying to convince that Jewish people are not white? The objective of this book seemed to be to push Black women in the arms of any man who isn't Black. Shame on you!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hunh????????","review":"I am an avid reader, often buying books I feel will be worth it in hardback..Well this book was definitely not worth it. I finished it because whenever I read I feel the need to know what happened to the characters, I guess I get involved with their lives. Well Miss Welch did give me that satisfaction but it seems that in the end she said \\"oh my it's too long\\", and therefore skipped to the ending without popular develpment. Oh well I guess next time her book will have to be a paperback!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting, compelling, made me hunger for more!","review":"I thought the book was great. I could really relate to most of the women portrayed in the book, either myself, a friend, or relative at some point in our lives. At first when I read it was the story about 6 women, I figured I might get lost or confused. But , this talented author made it easy and interesting for me to keep up with everyone single one of them.

A friend passed it on to me. How happy I am I DID NOT spent the money on it. Snap One, Snap Two etc, reminds me of going to the bakery, buying a box cookies, but only to discover they were all broken and different flavors. It is obvious the writer believes she is the next great female author, as the she flung BIG words throughout the book. Is she REALLY trying to write a book or vent about HER life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I have the same opinion voiced by so many others here. This book was a big disappointment for me. I was so excited about reading it too! I just didn't get the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"The writer has a way to go. LONG way. Since this new upswing in AA contemporary fiction has come about, it seems like there is no standard for what's acceptable. This novel reflects that. Not all writers are great storytellers. This book was all smoke and mirrors. I pity the tree that gave its life in vain.And yes, I did notice all the (bogus) 4 star rating that came in Nov/Dec. (see below) Not only was the style of the reviewers writing the same, but did s/he have to use all caps each time? I hope that wasn't the author giving bogus 4 stars. That would truly be pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The American Sisters Have Similar Issues","review":"I found a copy of this novel and the author's other novel, Ladyfingers at the library during my vacation in Nice. When I started it I could not put it down. Athough, we women in Europe are not as confrontational as those in the States, we definitely have similar problems. Confusion about roles, a man's curious behavior in relationships and the homosexual issues are universal, just with a different flavor.I enjoyed the humor of the story. Being a Parisian, I especially appreciated the unique nuances in the relationships of the New York City women. The main flaw in this novel is that certain characters weren't developed enough: Louise Washington, and particularly, Debra Parker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This author didn't make black men or women look or sound very good at all. She seemed to imply that black male/female relationships are futile. A self-hating odyssey of an confused black woman. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Perhaps she should get to know more black men."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was totally displeased with this book!!!!","review":"I read this book last November thinking that I would find something interesting from a fresh, new voice in African American fiction. I was very disappointed as I read further into the book. There were too many characters in the story that I was left wondering about at the end of the book. However, even though I did not enjoy her first novel, I think that it will be interesting to see what her second novel will be like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating, Something for everyone","review":"I enjoyed the book, it took several chapters before I was hooked. I commend the author for the use of diverse characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"The reviews made it sound Oh, so Good, but it wasn't.","review":"I must agree with every reader who gave this book one star. I was put off reading about the Armani, Bill Blass, Chanel etc., etc., etc. chi-chi stuff. Who cares who wore what from whom and what color it was, I wanted something to get interested in. Skipping around with no end in sight is maddening. I was left cold in the attempts to create characters who went no where. They should have been more fully developed than they were. It took me forever to finish this book and then I found myself skipping whole pages to do so. I'm sorry Delorys, it really could have used some more work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, My Mind Was Snapping","review":"I really, really wish I read the reviews from here before I purchased this book. I couldn't even finish reading it, I thought I was going out of my mind with confusion and boredom. I thought the dialogue was too long,too pointless, with too many vague flashbacks. I felt the novel was more of the writers personal views on matters being voice through her characters than it was actually a \\"story\\". The characters were not well developed at all, and they were unrealistic to me. It's sad to think that forty year old women would act as childish and immature as she presented her characters to be. You'd think at that age a woman would be more mature and grounded. I'm sorry, maybe her next efforts will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gingersnaps revisited","review":"Amazing how a second read can change one's original opinion. The first time I read it I thought the author was insulting and condescending to black women. Just a lot of malarkey. Then I read it again, and realized that it was satire, and had some terrific dialogue and interactions between the characters. I began to wish I knew people myself who I could have those types of constructive dialogues with. The relationship between the two sisters was enlightening and fun.Gingersnaps is deceptive and I definitely recommend to anyone who has read it, to give it a second read. You might be surprised!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is awful","review":"This is one of the worst books I've read recently. The characters are so one dimensional and offensive, I don't see how the author could stand them long enough to write the book. Only Althea and Desiree have some basis in reality, although Althea is little too selfish and Desiree is a little too perfect. Don't waste your money on this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An okay read","review":"Ms. Welch-Tyson made the characters very real. Of these six highly successful Black women only one of them sseemed to have her head on straight. And that is very sad. However, this book was well written with characters who were as real as my right hand.Any book that can make me feel like the characters are my relatives, friends,or neighbors is a book worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much soap like a soap opera.","review":"This book was okay even though I had a difficult time getting into the read. Some of it was too Hollywood and pretentious. Aletha's and Desiree's parent's were quite humorous and should have had more of a role in the story. I would have enjoyed the book more if Ms. Welch-Tyson had not left the other characters hanging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk, Pure Junk wish I could get my money back","review":"This book had a good start, but after the first few pages I wanted to leave it in a New York City transit subway station but I was scared I would be fined for dicarding garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Greatest!!!","review":"I feel that the author included to many characters whose lives where entwined.

Can someone please tell me \\"What was the point\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF TIME!","review":"I thought this book was a waste of my time. The author devoted too much space to skin color, interracial dating/marriage, wealth, and Desiree. I thought that there were 6 snaps, what happend to the other 4 (I forgot about Althea). Someone said that the author was describing herself a little in the text, I think she was. She could have did better. I won't pass this book along to my friends or family, because they would think I had lost my mind reading trash like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Waiting for the Headliner!!!!","review":"This book kept me reading for \\"that big moment\\" that never came. I finished the book feeling like I just wasted several days of my time. It is not at all what I expected.

One would have to physically press it against the charger in order for it to make contact.

Some of my favorites are The Monolith Monsters and Panic In Year Zero. I'm sorry to say this one is just downright boring. The acting is good, and the special effects are certainly better than some other 1950s B-movies, so there's not much to poke fun at. The idea is good in the beginning - a satellite crashes in the jungle, and a Wasp on board was exposed to radiation, making it grow giant. But most of the movie follows the scientists on their trek through the jungle to find it, and is no more than a pointless safari movie, like those old black and white Buster Crabbe films.

Thankfully, our heroes bring their secret weapon along. I'll betcha didn't know that scientists were so handy with grenades, now didja?? MFGH is a true test of endurance.

However, the account of this girlhood was shocking to me. I think now I understand feminism much better then before. And even though I've spent some time in Bangladesh, I now feel like I understand life in Bangladesh much better than before as well. I feel it was extremely worthwhile reading this book. It taught me a lot about how most of the world lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling and Repetitious","review":"I usually enjoy reading books by women writers from the Indian subcontinent.

However, I did not receive iRobot filters! I received the Duogreen filters. The seller (iOttie) is selling the same filters on both listings, advertising them as different products, and charging different prices.The filters are not the same quality as the ones from iRobot.

They are exactly like the factory originals. On one of the other reviews I noticed a little discontent on the price. The price seemed all right to me. I use some tiny filters in a cpap machine. They are about 1 inch square, with no frame at all, just some material that looks like cotton. Replacement filters $25.00 each hello. I could cut up an old T-shirt and make a thousand of them. These filters are sold through Amazon, but come from a company called Deep Discounts.

But they are grossly overpriced on anybody's website for what they are; about 3 square inches of filter fabric sandwiched into a specialized plastic frame. There is not an easy way to just replace the fabric due to the design. So Roomba has engineered a very pricey maintenance part. As soon as our Roomba dies, that's it.

As simple as the new birth in Christ is to receive, the understanding of the realities of being a new creation contain a wealth of revelation. This book, as with all of Kenyan's books, contains a wealth of scripture to substantiate who we are in Christ, what being born again means positionally and vitally, and what that position in Christ allows us to realistically see ourselves as.

Oh boy was I wrong. The movie itself is barely OK, some good action scenes, but a pretty weak plot and the action scenes looked as if they were shot in the 70s and not in the 90s. But the quality of the DVD was terrible. The cover was cheaply done, not even printed right, and the DVD quality was grainy, worse than copying VHS to DVD, and the sound was horrid.

The plastic perches keep popping out. I just bought the house with two floors. I had hoped that a piece of thinwall conduit would suffice for the post since I don't really care if it telescopes.

It was very difficult to put together, taking 2 home maintenence teachers 2 hours. If the house gets invaded with other birds, it is almost impossible to remove the nest material without completely disassmebling the entire house. You cannot open the front without unscrewing the attachment to the next box. (I will probably have to disassemble the entire house to clean at the end of the season.) The perchers fall off and I have yet to figure out a good way to secure them--it will be raining baby purple martins. The two levels don't stay together well so the lower level tenants might get rained on. The cupola does not stay on so it had to anchored with a screw after this was discovered--naturally after it was up on the pole.I have another house by a different manufacturer that is sooooo much easier to work with.

Of course, they include three warnings that all the metal pieces are sharp and they are, so be careful! I sat in front of the television watching the football game while assembling.

I tried to follow the physics but it seems that Tipler is just throwing formulas down for no other reason than to confuse the reader into agreeing with him. (Oooh, look at these complex formulas, Tipler MUST be on to something here!) There are absurdities abound. I do not know how the Times and other respectable book reviewers came to give this book such a high rating - no sane person who reads this book could come out with such glowing praise for stupidity.

Any author who has to labor their verbiage to such an extreme extent as Professor Tipler is struggling with his own believability. The professor spends more time telling us what it is he is going to tell us than he does telling us, then contradicts what he it was he told us.For all its academic intensity, it boils down to a nonsensical and unsubstantiatable theorem.

And if you have a scientific background, you will probably want to incorporate that into your world view. Tipler tried that.

I felt light I discovered that a highly respected teacher has gone a little senile."},{"rating":"1","title":"You should not believe what you read in this book!","review":"Tipler's book is seriously misleading. It claims to present conclusions based onmodern science; in fact it is fantasy. He himself does not believe inthe veracity of his own theory (which he admits on page 305), so thereis no reason that you should. It abounds in absurdities (for example,Tipler believes that automobiles are alive) and the wildest speculation,claimed to be scientific results. He claims that science implies yourresurrection is inevitable as a simulation in a computer beyond theedge of space and time (that's resurrection??) - and that then your (his?)wildest dreams will be satisfiable, for example men will be able tohave sex for ever with the most beautiful woman conceivable.This is based on physics??

I also have to agree with a previous reviewer: I fail to see how a programmed emulation of myself has anything to do with my immortality. How can a machine emulation be considered a resurrection of an individual? And why would anyone have a reason to create this emulation in the first place? Sadly, I am afraid this book argues for mortality rather than immortality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking in its scope, this is an amazing piece of work.","review":"Tipler's thesis is that one day all that have ever lived will be resurrected. He argues this soley from a scientific point of view. A word of caution, this book is not for a first time reader of cosmology or quantum physics. (You may want to read A Brief History of Time by Steve Hawkings as a warm up.)Tipler's faith in what the average layperson can grasp is a little optimistic. In some parts the reader will have to stretch their brain to fathom the concepts presented. I encourage the reader to push on! Once past those parts, the summation of what Tipler's thesis means to all that have come before, and all those that willcome after us, is staggering. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Philosophy under the false guise of hard science.","review":"Tipler presents some intriguing ideas and tips his hat toscience (with a wide sweep across biology, physics, computerscience with a selective use of history and creative use ofmathematics.)

One of the things that makes this book so impressive is his complete mastery of all these areas, when mastery of a single one would be a real achievement for any one person. Even if I am not in a position to cogently critique the theory presented, I will tell you that many people will find reading this book a tremendously powerful experience, especially if you would like to believe (as I would) that death is not permanent."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging ride","review":"WOW! If nothing else, my hat is off to Tipler for assembling this great literary adventure. It was a fascinating read straight through. From the beginning, I opened this book with great anticipation of seeing how in thw world anyone was going to get from Physics to God without being hokey or insulting. Tipler did it. Sure, there is some speculation and a couple leaps in faith from one logical premise to another, but it was never enough to turn me off.I would recommend this to anyone and think it would be a great mind-opening book even if you didn't buy into to any of the arguments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously Messed Up","review":"This guy is seriously messed up.

Costume arrived very quickly and I had no problems with the company, at least not yet. Down side is the wings are clearly not the ones that are in the picture. You can look at the edge of the wings a see that the ones pictured are significantly larger. The wings pictured also curve more and come to points, giving it that bat wing look. The wings that come with the costume look like purple and black butterfly wings. The remainder of the costume is identical to what you see in the image. Disappointing considering the thing that makes this costume appear so adorable are the wings. The other problem is the head piece fits me, and this is supposed to be for a 0 to 6 months child.

My only complaint is that the book is very Winchester heavy, and although Marlin is somewhat represented, there is little about other interesting lever guns such as Savage, Whitney, Burgess, etc. But Winchesters and Marlins are the most likely lever guns that the reader may have a chance to play with, so the coverage is appropriate.

This movie is a classic action-comedy movie that I recommened to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The One And Only","review":"The best of the three movies made based on the Beverly Hils Cop theme. Its intergration of comedy and serious drama was excellent. Beverly Hills Cop II & III were not good, with III being the absolute worst of the series. Unless they come out with a Beverly Hills Cop IV that is as good or better than the original, then I guess I'll just own one of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"East force meets the West force","review":"This movie is a slick 80's film about a cop from a rough town vacationing in sunny Beverly Hills, but he's really there to find the truth about his friends death that he witnessed. Eddie Murphy had good stance and puts a good pace in the film and doesn't let your eyes droop from any of his actions to find out some clues to the death of his friend. This movie is a must have for any fan of the comedic/crime blend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beverly Hills Cop (Special Collector's Edition)","review":"Beverly Hills Cop (Special Collector's Edition)~ John Ashton is a great Eddie Murphy. The plot is well written, the music is the typical 80's movie music and the special effects are just on the mark. Eddie Murphy is amazing in the role as Axel Foley and this is one of my favorite Eddie Murphy movies of all time. The movie sure has a lot of 80's references like German Marks, and could be tricky for kids that did not grow up during the 80's. Highly recommended indeed. The plot is so much better then the sequels and I rank it as one of the better made 80's movie. The clothes , style and art are all a total hoot. I give it 5 out of 5 stars easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Eddie's Best Film!","review":"From start to finish, Eddie Murphy keeps you laughing out of your chair with his wise cracks blended with his F*** words as a brash, maverick Detroit detective all the way to California. The involuntary truck ride with the illegal cigs around Detroit kicks it all off to the tune of Neutron Dance and the ever-classic banana in the tailpipe are some of the scenes that make the film memorable. Enter Taggart and Rosewood, who aid Axel in finding his friend's killer, along with old friend Jenny, who is an employee of the man who ordered said killing. Some 20 years later, I watch this on regular TV and I find myself filling in the filthy words, which were heard on demand throughout the film yet kept the film from being offensive; the storyline and the many funny scenes helped that. They don't make movies today like they did in the 1980s, that's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat uninspired","review":"The cat just ignored it. Not enough catnip I guess so that he could smell it. Disappointed in the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatally Flawed","review":"Sockets are well made, well plated and fit well. The problem is that the square drive end doesn't have the required divots in it so that the sockets can attach to the ball retainers of extensions or ratchets. They are only held on the attachment by friction which isn't much. I find this a fatal flaw. Other than this they aren't bad but that's a deal breaker for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"low quality","review":"I am disappointed from the low quality of the product. Tried to use the 10 socket and it expanded while tightening the bolt of my front disk brake. I did use another snap-on wrench and did the job, but the sockets are made of poor quality steel. Money lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"seller is horrible!!","review":"I ordered the product thru Amazon.com. After several weeks went by without hearing anything about shipment, I contacted seller by email. No response. I called, no response, I contacted Amazon, they contected seller and was told it will be shipped. I still got no info on shipment and afte 3 days i contacted Amazon again. They called seller and got no response. Amazon stood by thier A-Z warranty and refunded my money. My child never got the table. I would have given them a worse rating but that's as low as it goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very responsive seller","review":"THE SHIRT ARRIVE IN TIME AND THE SELLER WAS VERY KIND TO PRE-CHECK THE ITEMS BEFORE SENDING, AS SUCH SOME SPOTS WERE DISCOVERED ON THE OTHER SHIRT AND I WAS NOTIFY PROMPTLY FOR A CHANGE OF ITEMS THROUGH PHONE..GREAT AND RESPONSIBLE SELLER :)As for the shirt it was quite plain than I expected but anyway nice to have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"cold surf","review":"Surf music from Montreal? - though surf is hard to find on the St Lawrence, the music is none the worse for it. This CD contains 33 tracks of classic surf sound of the highest quality. Whilst perhaps lacking the more innovative element of some recent California surf rock bands such as the Aqua Velvets, the Mel-Tones have clearly internalised the genre to the extent that I would say if you buy just one surf music CD, this has to be the one. Apart from anything else, with this number of tracks it is excellent value for money with each track worth a listen. In fact you wonder why the Mel-Tones did not issue it as two CDs. Perhaps they thought this was their only chance and we benefit from their efforts to give it their all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gizmo's Favorite","review":"These are definetly our shih tsu's favorite snack. We call them \\"Best Boys\\" because he always gets 2 when he has been home alone and has been a good boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One to ponder","review":"The author manages to evoke gut wrenching emotions she tellsthe tale of a young Alaskan woman,Kate, who seems to attract ill fortune wherever she goes.Filled with baited suspense, a hint of humour, some actionand a touch of romance, Dana has you \\"eating out of her hand\\" beforelong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jerry Rocks!","review":"On page 260 you mention one of the most beloved pastors I have ever known, casting him in a bad light for saying abortion is murder. I have not seen him for years, but he was always a person of real intelligence, grace, integrity, and compassion. Does the unborn have intrinsic value? Does the unborn child deserve rights of protection? Does human life have value??? Pastor Prevo would say it does. Why? Because we are created in God's image. Also the abortionist is a person of value made in God's image and Pastor Prevo would never endorse in any way killing an abortionist...and he makes that clear. This excerpt in your book which I read here online does not give enough context for me to know how you will resolve the situations in your book. I hope it is not just a rant against religion...that the character on page 260 is not speaking for your own views. Since I don't know and am not going to buy it and read it I will end my comments."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"I received this item promptly and in good condition. Dana Stabenow is a good mystery writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Her usual Stuff","review":"I don't like this author much but this particular book was not too bad. It deals with censorship and fanatics in a wilderness community."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Preaching; Too Little Mystery","review":"In this book, Kate Shugak finds a body while picking mushrooms. It turns out to be the body of a person who has been missing for quite awhile, but whose father never reported him missing.Kate is always arrogant with her beliefs, but this book really goes too far. I fully agree with Dana Stabenow's views on religious fundamental extremists. However, she goes too far when she starts trashing all religion and people who believe in them.I really liked Kate's remembrances of her first year of college and of the professor who turned her on to literature. But none of this makes up for all her preaching against religion, people from other states, people who listen to different music, etc.The mystery itself is unsatisfying, too. I agree with the other reviewer who lamented the lack of suspects, red herrings, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try another of her books","review":"Dana Stabenow writes good mysteries so this book was a surprising disappointment. There is no mystery, barely even an attempt to write one. There is only one suspect, a group of people the author doesn't like, and that's who did it. No red herrings, no other suspects. What kind of a mystery is that? If you do read it, be prepared to be beaten over the head with the author's prejudices on nearly every page. Skip this book and read some of her actual mysteries. I've read four others so far and liked them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"these reviews are too preachy!!!","review":"If you like Stabenow and you like Kate Shugak, don't let the reviews scare you off! Yes -- Stabenow takes on creationism and fanatical christians. Do you really think that an Alaska Native, like Kate, would find such beliefs appealing?The story is interesting and the glimpses into what makes Kate tick will please devoted Stabenow fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad.","review":"I started reading Dana Stabenow in a short story. Thought she was interesing, read two more novels then came to Play with Fire. Man I almost couldn't stomach this drivel. I had three other books in her series but didn't even touch them. They went straight back to the library. We as Americans are allowed to have our own views of religion but this really goes to far. But then again I could do just exactly what I did and not read them. So if you are reading this and even remotely believe in God (how could you not if you have ever been to Alaska) then don't read this book or it will really piss you off. All she came across is narrow minded, simple minded and hateful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best","review":"I was disappointed in this book, she trashed religion in general and made comments that people who believe in religion are basically lazy people who do not think on their own, I would say writing a book and taking this viewpoint shows laziness and lack of creativity in her writing.It's so easy to take the religious extremes and equate that to all religions and pass that off as the truth when it's far from it. Her characters point out how many people have been murdered in the name of religion, a fact for sure, but she doesn't mention how many more millions are killed in the name of non-religion, communists like Mao and Stalin, not to mention Hitler. It's not even a close comparison at all, but again I guess Stabenow is too lazy to look at the facts.All in all I like her writing although of course it's all fantasy what Kate gets herself out of but then this book was boring throughout, from start to finish with a dud of an ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best of this series","review":"I have liked all in this series up to this one. The subject matter (fanatic religionists) wasn't my cup of tea. And then the fact that in the end nothing was done about it was strange. I say skip this one and go on to the next. I haven't yet but it will most likely be better than Play With Fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kate Shugak-best character I've read since Ross Mc Donald","review":"Another chilling story of life in a harsh, beautiful environment. The plot is intriguing, but what really beguiles is the gritty, intelligent, wild Kate Shugak and Dana Stabenow's talent in bringing us right into the landscape, letting us all become Alaskans for a time. The writing is visual and clips along, the supporting cast memorable and empathetic. Kate's world stays in my mind long after the book is finished. Stabenow can't write fast enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine story.","review":"I enjoyed Play with Fire from the start to the finish. Her discription of mushroom picking in a burned over area is right on! Also, I fully agree with stand on religions, and think she made some very good points about persons who decided they know what beliefs everyone else should hold to. In my humble opinion she has taken a brave stand against the zealots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agenda-driven","review":"It is unfortunate that Ms. Stabenow has written a polemic instead of a novel. Her assault on religion, particularly Christianity, overtakes any plot or character development. This is truly a shame since some of her novels are actually quite good. But not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"preachy, preachy, preachy","review":"Kate Shugak is getting more and more arrogant and more dislikable. The mystery seems insignificant in comparison to Stabenow's seeming need to preach. The book is about 100 pages longer than her previous books and most of it can be attributed the preaching arrogance of the main character, Kate Shugak. Her arrogance and high-mindness are a real turnoff. For example, she disses all people in organized religion as not being able to think for themselves, declares all states that end in a vowel to be redneck states, disses all music that she doesn't like, and if someone isn't enjoying the outdoors in the manner that she doesn't see fit they really don't deserve to be outside. It is all just a little too much for me! This will be my last Kate Shugak mystery. (As an aside, the love angles are just a little 8th-grade for me."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],M={key:0},B={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",N,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(O,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-dfa956e1"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/4.md","filePath":"glossary/4.md"}'),W={name:"glossary/4.md"},j=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{L as __pageData,j as default};
