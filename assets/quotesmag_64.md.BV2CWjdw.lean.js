The water was boiling in no time on my electric stove. The clean up was sooo easy. Just washed in sink with water and a soap sponge. I was finished in no time.

I do plan to buy more of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"In general, I have been very pleased with Cuisinart products and came to believe that Cuisinart was a brand I could count on to deliver durable products that made being in the kitchen pleasant. So when I saw these pots and pans I purchased them without much reservation. I have to say that so far I have been very disappointed with these pots and do not feel that they are worth the money. For one thing, I find that on my gas stove the handles get extremely hot (despite claims to the contrary) so potholders are an absolute must. Also, I have only had these pots for 2 months and have found that their durability is less than adequate. They scratch very easily, they dent easily (I gently hit one pot on my faucet acidentally when washing it and it dented), and are sometimes difficult to clean (food seems to really stick to them). Maybe my expectations were too high. Regardless, I find myself wishing that I had spent a little more and bought the All-Clad pots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Composition of Stats","review":"This book contains an amazing and thorough collection of facts about the National Association.

START ELSEWHERE.","review":"Although this book is written on a fairly obscure topic, if you are looking to gain a better understanding of the National Association, I would suggest you begin elsewhere. Of the 329 pages, 70% of the material is of line-scores and box-scores. I was disappointed with the lack of insight and was left with a regurgitation of numbers. I think the author loses the historical context of the league by writing a book purely on numbers. If you are interested in the National Association, I suggest you start with Daniel Ginsburg&#65533;s The Fix Is In. Scandal and the National Association go hand in hand. Not only do you see how the league functioned, but also why it soon failed. I would also recommend William Ryczek&#65533;s book on the National Association. I found more substance in both cases than with Wright's book.

Of special note are the quotes from a variety of people ranging from Henry Kissinger \\"Nobody will ever win the battle of the sexes.

The effect is empowering and motivating, especially for early learners. Watching three-year-olds bring text to life by making it speak at their command is kind of eerie.After using Foniks, it seems needlessly hard to go back to a silent, paper book, where little can be learnt without the presence of a human teacher or a tape. Foniks also has a well-organised syllabus covering all the usual phonics sounds plus many more sounds from phonics' parent, phonetics. Make no mistake, this course will take you all the way from total illiterate to sentence-length reader.It's my guess that learners will love the simplicity, transparency and immediacy of this very effective learning tool for aspiring readers of all ages and nationalities.

(Why even Bother asking us what make and model our car is, right?!)It is Completely ridiculous how expensive these mats are, and you still have to \\"Cut\\" them. And what doesn't make sense to me, is that if I cut them, then it loses the \\"barrier edge\\" which is supposed to hold the stuff in, else dirt and liquids will just run off the sides making the mats COMPLETELY USELESS!!!Even with trimming it wont fit, and I feel so unsafe using them as the driver-side mats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"Be very careful with these mats.

Not satisfied, I attempted to return them and they will not since they have been slightly used and cut. Customer service had no sympathy and kept quoting that the mats are \\"approximate\\" and \\"universal\\" sizes, even thought it pulled up this specific mat form my make and model.

I paid nearly $100 and basically received a universal set of rubber mats that had to be cut-down with scissors to barely fit in my car. Even after all the cutting, they still didn't fit quite right. The worst part was that last night, my accelerator pedal got caught under the mat lip and was stuck in the floored position. I was going 60mph in a 25mph zone. I quickly had to throw the car into neutral, slam on my brakes and reach down to dislodge the pedal from the mat. Had I not done this, I could have seriously injured myself or others.

This, his second novel, is an incredibly moving book about an unforgettable, yet forgotten, incident in our past. In 1917 the US Army sent a regiment of black soldiers to Houston, Texas. As could have been expected, trouble eventually occurred. Big trouble. A riot between white Houston police and the black soldiers which resulted in the deaths of several people. The result was the largest murder trial in American history, followed by the largest mass execution. This is an emotional book, written in the heat of righteous anger. But, Mr. McEachin never allows his obvious sympathies for the soldiers to descend into maudlin sentimentalism. The soldiers are fully rounded men, often troubled and flawed. Their actions are not made out to be more noble than they were. It is a book that reminds us of how far we have come in America, and how far we have to go. Most highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Literary Treasure","review":"I am a writer. After reading this book, I feel like a fraudcalling myself a writer.

That says a lot about the quality of this book. The pieces don't sound like flamenco and do not adhere to any of the flamenco forms, e.g., soleares, tangos, etc. Nor is there any emphasis on rhythm or accent, which is necessary to flamenco. Skip this book and get one of the many excellent books instead, such as \\"Play Solos Flamenco Guitar with Juan Martin Book, CD, and DVD\\", Gerhard Graf-Martinez's \\"Flamenco Guitar Method\\", and Juan Martin's flamenco guitar method \\"El Arte Flamenco De La Guitarra\\".

I have given up using the whistle attachment for two reasons: first, it is not made of Cuisinart's stainless steel (it appears to be made of plastic with a silver plastic coating), and so it has cracked and peeled from the heat; and second, it is impossible to remove the whistle when the kettle is hot so you are unable to pour your boiling water (often all that comes off when attempting to remove the whistle is the decorative ball on its tip!).

Also, it was as if the authors went out of their way just to pepper the book with historical characters but they never were really relevant. The Patton exchange was pointless. Plus, it was evident that the authors used the movie \\"Patton\\" for the line \\"paperhanging...\\"Newt's other book about Pearl Harbor was much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read","review":"Excellent page turner! An alternative version of WW2 revolving around a daring German attack on the US Atomic facilities... Really enjoyed it, very detailed and lots of 'what ifs...' The sudden ending really needs a sequel.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT bother with this - you will hate the unfinished ending!","review":"Being a history buff, I read this and really do not care that Newt Gingrich has his name added to the authorship. What I DID like was the premise and setting.What I HATED was the incredibly bad prose, poor character development, and implausable plot twists. Sure, the military hardware was well researched and the hsitorical figures are all resurrected but the overall result is an embarresment.And - the incomplete ending \\"to be continued\\" WILL NOT BE PUBLISHED!Go read a romance novel and stop wating your time with this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD BOOK BUT WHERE IS THE D*MN SEQUEL!?","review":"A very good read, but also very frustrating. If this book was written in '95-96, why has it taken so long to write a sequel?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book to read on a plane or the beach.","review":"I truly enjoyed this book, not so much for the escapism, but rather for the message it tells---we all must face up to our responsibilities, as people and nations. Perhaps this was what Newt intended, but I doubt it.Anyway, I did enjoy the story and I would really love to get the sequel. HOWEVER, as we all know, none has been published yet.Would Baen Publishing Enterprises please ask Mr. G. and the others to complete the sequel? If Mr. G. does not have the time, would he at least collaberate with the other authors to get the book written? It seems to me that Mr. Forstchen is eminently capable to write the sequel.How about it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read, but should be finished by now.","review":"The premise for this book, that Hitler does not declare war on the US in 1941, and then goes on to win the War in Europe, makes for an interesting scenario. My only real objection is the lack of a sequel; I suspect that after this long, one will NOT be forthcoming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Alternate History Book, Sequel Please!","review":"Nice start for a book that appears to have more editions coming since the ending is open. This distracted a bit from the book but overall it was well written with plenty of action. Good detail of military technology and strategy helps those who are not entirely familar with the jargon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimmicky plot, and historically a real stretch.","review":"The characters of York, Patton, Marshall, Halsey, and MacArthur were gimmicky. Patton and York were based on the interpretations of George C. Scott and Gary Cooper not the real thing. Even some of the lines are straight from the movies.As for the plot itself, not likely. The Soviets and the British were by no means done in '41. The Germans were caught. If they fight through the winter, then you get what actually happened. If they stop and wait, the Russians get the time they need to regroup. The winter helped beat the Wehrmact, but the Russians did the lions share on their own. I give Rommel, Patton, Montgomery, and the other generals their due, but the best mind in that war was Zhukov. The Soviets would have been fine without the winter or the United States.This is sentimental fiction, not historical, but if you're willing to susepend your disbelief, not a bad way to spend a couple of hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Both authors' first attempt at alternate history","review":"This is the worse book written by Gingrich and Forstchen. Later novels were much better,with the Civil War trilogy the best of them all. I excuse the two authors for 1945 asthey were just getting their feet wet with alternate history."},{"rating":"2","title":"As prolific as Forstchen is where is the sequel?","review":"The authors did an excellant job of capturing the lax security that was commonplace in the U.S. at the time. They also captured the political mood of the time by portaying us as very isolationist. It took Peal Harbor for America to awake. My only major problem with the book is that after two years, where is the sequal?"},{"rating":"2","title":"1945 is one of the best alternate history books out to date.","review":"I found 1945 an exciting alternate history with agood prehistory explantion and excellent story line.

The cable just did not work, not in any of the HDMI ports and not with any known good equipment. It does not look damaged and the ends fit snugly into the ports. It was just a bad cord. It was too cheap to be worth returning; I knew at this price a bad cable was possible. The single star was for the dud cable but bargaincell/eforcity delivery was prompt and the item was appropriately packaged. If I were rating the store and not the product, I would give more stars.Probably the only thing to take away from this review is that if this cable is going to ordered for a \\"must work\\" situation (e.g. you are ordering for the Super Bowl) order a multi-pack or a backup cable.

I used it to connect an older Sony HDTV set that does not have HDMI, only DVI or component video for HD programming. I was able to connect my PS3 and am now able to get the maximum my set can produce 1080i. The only difficulty is audio but I was able to use the PS3 included analog audio/video cable and found a setting on the PS3 under Sound Settings for multi output meaning the RCA audio cables give me sound and this cable the video. HDMI unlike DVI carries both video and audio and the PS3 sees this as an HDMI cable so by default it disables the analog cables. I highly recommend this for anyone with older HDTV sets that have DVI inputs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cable","review":"I bought this cable from thecellphoneshop. When I bought it it was priced at $.98 plus $2.98 shipping. I just happened to look again after receiving mine and they raised the price to around $3 for the cable. I can see a possible reason for that... The cable I received was wrapped in black and blue striped mesh. A nice heavy-duty cable with gold connectors... The cable is fantastic.

The hero's adventures are endless -- he ends up pursued both by MI5 and the Soviets -- but he exercises his unique ability to adapt and improvise, so that he navigates these perils like a champion surfer riding so many waves.

If the K-Tel label is there, you have to expect re-recordings. And just because the artist/artists have been dead for decades, don't presume that the recordings will be the originals. What you get here, even though the CD is marketed as an \\"import,\\" is re-recordings of 35 of the 60 songs. Even most of the older \\"oldies\\" are re-recordings. Additionally, numerous of the 25 originals are unfamiliar versions (covers or album cuts) by familiar artists.

On one side lies the funky, creamy goodness of Cinematic Orchestra, Funki Porcini, and Amon Tobin. On the other lies trite, easy-listening, grocery-store jazz fusion.Unfortunately, this album falls on the latter side. Seriously, listening to this disc makes me think of supermarket aisles full of Tide and cereal boxes, or sitting in the waiting room of my dentist's office, flipping through old copies of Newsweek. When soccer moms want to let loose, they put on a CD like this and break open a bottle of cheap domestic Chardonnay. It's strictly by-the-numbers lite jazz, with about as much authenticity as a Twinkie. It makes me cringe."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the move- Count Basic- More than the Best....","review":"Super good quality music. I am addicted to SAX IN THE CITY.

The plot and subplots are all intricately intertwined and come together neatly at the end. The characters easily come to life and are vividly drawn. A real page-turner, for sure. Repairman Jack is a likable, flawed, irreverent guy, who comes through when he needs to, even though you wonder at times if he will."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"Like lots of people these days, I'm busy. Get up, exercise, shower, get myself and the kids ready for work, go to work, get the kids......But somehow I finished this book in three days. It had been sitting on my shelf for months, waiting for me to succumb to the bait, and when I finally did I was definitely hooked. The story moves along briskly with well-drawn (almost like a comic book) characters, scenes of suspense, romance, humor, and mystery. The only thing holding me back from giving the book 5 stars is that there wasn't enough mystery. Too many key points were revealed early on, but I'll forgive the author and buy the next two in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRET BOOK ONE OF THE BEST!","review":"Repairman Jack is one of the coolest and most orginal characters I have read.

Paul Wilson is a brilliant writer, and this unusual novel is the best example why. Originally written in 1984, \\"The Tomb\\" is not the least bit \\"dated\\" (except maybe for the charming absense of cellular phones which would've have been a great help for the characters involved). Once you get used to the really unusual mix of down-to-earth detective story and supernatural phenomena, this book is great entertainment. Repairman Jack is a likeable, very human character with a knack for revenge - a bit over the top generally, but very nitty gritty in other aspects. The storyline feels like a sometimes crude, but always exciting mix of the Big Screen's Indiana Jones and TV's Spenser character.I have just bought all of the Repairman Jack novels in one order and will read the other three instalments in the coming weeks. \\"The Tomb\\" was a very promising start to a supposedly unforgettable series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introduction of Repairman Jack","review":"F. Paul Wilson introduces Repairman Jack in this thrilling novel about ancient Asia demons, a secret necklace, revenge and love. Full of likeable characters, action and horror, this is a great entry into a long-lasting Repairman Jack trilogy, which has been running for years. Exciting frompage one to the the very last, this is (in-a-way) a sequel to The Keep (one of the best horror novels ever written). You will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, what a great hero!","review":"When I first heard about repairman Jack I thought, what an odd concept. Who is his partner I thought to myself, Larry the Cable Guy? It just sounded so odd, but F. Paul Wilson has created a wonderful protaginist. I cannot believe that there is not a billion dollar film franchise starring this character. I guess after Michael Mann directed his only awful film from a Wilson novel, that Wilson developed a bad taste in his mouth concerning film adaptations of his work. Whatever the reason I'd sure love to see the rakosh on film. Wilson takes a hindi folk tale monster and makes it his own. At first when the creatures were introduced I thought the novel might be silly, but I was so wrong. It was a thrilling page turner. We also learn the origin of Repairman Jack and it is so well presented. I loved \\"The Tomb\\" , and I look forward to reading all his novels. My wife just finished \\"All the Rage\\" and said that it is even better than \\"The Tomb\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping. Multiple story lines. Can not put it down.","review":"I have read and re-read The Tomb at least 10 times from cover to cover. I have a tendancy to want to totally consume and enjoy books as well written as Wilson's The Tomb. I look forward to a movie release but hope that the story can be preserved reasonably intact (the movie version of The Keep was a disappointment). Repairman Jack, the hero, has all the makings of a serialized hero (a la Bond) but Wilson's treatment of Repairman Jack in subsequent writings were a little disappointing (Wimpman Jack). In any case, judging The Tomb on its own merits: It is superbly written, great story line, very graphic - you can \\"see\\" the action almost as if it was on the screen. Recommended highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good thrills","review":"I read this book mainly because it is part of F. Paul Wilson's Adversary Cycle, of which my favorite horror novel The Keep is also a part. First off, I must say that I didn't find this novel to be anywhere near as good as The Keep, but it definitely did have its moments. One of those moments (or should I say a few) were with the back story, which takes place in the mid-1800's. I actually preferred this to the main storyline. What can I say? I'm a big fan of period horror. Anyway, The Tomb is a very entertaining book and I recommend to fans of horror novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous plot . . .","review":"thought about not finishing book at 27% . . . then, again slmost stopped reading at 52% . . . finally, couldn't take the absurdity of the plot and clicked my Kindle to a new story.Wish I had never started reading this one.

I was puzzled that I found this book to be quite awful.Wilson's writing is clumbsy; his characterizations are one-dimensional (focusing on appearance, mostly); the characters' motiviations are muddled; the events in the story are not writen to be convincing or compelling. I read until page 110, hoping it might be a \\"good\\" bad novel, but it just got too embarrassing. Some readers might enjoy this book, having first set low expectations.

Due to this, I found myself hoping the plot would improve, that the rough spots in the storytelling would disappear. Unfortunately this did not happen. Jack's love interest and on again off again girlfriend is a poorly constructed character that is impossible for me at accept as real. If you're really interested, try jumping ahead to one of the later novels in the series. Maybe they improved with practice. I could not bring myself to make the investment of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have found a new favorite author!!","review":"What a powerhouse storyteller!

Paul Wilson, and I honestly had no expectations going in beyond knowing that Amazon was recommending it to me based on the Dresden series. This first book felt long, but it did turn out to be a really good introduction to the Repairman Jack universe. The reader, like Jack, and in stark contrast to Lovecraft's stories, is slowly being introduced to a world full of incredible and terrifying things. I don't want to give anything away, but I'll say I'm glad I stuck to it through to book 3 (Conspiracies), where everything really started coming together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept picking it up when I should have been doing chores!","review":"This one kept my attention all the way to the end.

Orignally, we loved the colors and how heavy and thick the plates are. However, like many other reviews say, the plates and bowls chip very easily resulting in useless ugly dishes. We had chips on some plates within a few days - even though we were careful with the new plates. It is kind of sad because we have had other Pfaltzgraff patterns over the years that lasted a long time, even with young kids. We love the huge dinner plates although they are too large to fit in the dishwasher or microwave. The cups are very nice and have held up much better than the plates and bowls. I'm not sure what makes these chip so easily but it makes my leery of purchasing Pfaltzgraff again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty for about a year","review":"I wanted something durable.. yet pretty.

They chip very easily and do not wash well because of their design in the dish washer. I called the customer service and complained about the chipping after several of my pieces were chipped from only a couple months of gentle use. She said that it was not a defect of the product, but one of how it was handled. She also said that ours was an extreme case. She eventually relented and sent out some replacement pieces for our set (5) of them. I use to own a set of very inexpensive dishes that costs a fraction of the costs of these. They held up for years and years with no chipping or problems and the name of the dishes stayed printed on the back. The Pfaltzgraff name washes off or squiggles up on the back like it was never sealed properly. Do not waste your money on these dishes."},{"rating":"1","title":"You will get burned two ways!","review":"My husband got burned severely after putting the microwave proof mug in the microwave.

The dishes chipped. I called the company and customer service claimed it was my fault. I should alternate the height of the dishes in the dishwasher so they don't bang together. First, I never had this issue and have had Mikasa, and other brands. None chipped. Anyhow I alternated the sizes as they suggested and they still chipped. Further, some of the serving bowls have some red enamal edge on them, and after TWO washes the paint flaked off. For this, I called again and they did replace that piece only.

Other reviewers are absolutely correct -- Napoli dishes can NOT be used functionally in the microwave...they get scalding hot (can't pick them up without potholders) while your food stays cold. It is also correct that they chip incredibly easily. I've never had a problem with any other dishes, yet 50% of mine are chipped after less than a year.

I usually check reviews, and did not check before I purchased these dishes. Boy, I wish I would have! I have had these dishes less than 90 days, and 7 pieces out of 32 are chipped, some large and some small. We haven't handled them roughly, and Pfaltzgraff said while they are \\"chip resistant \\" , if you bump them \\"hard\\" enough they will chip. I can tell you we have not only not bumped them \\" hard\\", they have not knowingly been bumped at at all. My husband handwashed one last night, this morning I picked it up off the dishtowel and a huge nickle size chunk is just laying there.

Within a few months of simple use, they started to chip. We have a higher-end dishwasher and we separated the dishes (as the cust service rep recommended when we complained. After the complaint, they sent us some replacement dishes. I should have asked for the entire lot, because by the time the new ones got here, the other ones had chipped!) And believe me, we do take care of our stuff. But this was RIDICULOUS! The dishes are an embarrassment and we cannot even put them out with company. This, by the way, happened with the regular Napoli dinner dishes, the small bowls, and the milk dispenser. DO NOT BUY THESE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good looks, bad quality","review":"I have to agree with other reviewers here about the quality of the Napoli 'dinnerware'. This Chinese made stuff looks great, but is only good for target shooting. When used as dishes, it chips and breaks so easily, that it is mostly useless. On top of that, it will not work in a microwave, as the only thing that heats is the dish, not the food.I just wish I had read the reviews here, before I bought the stuff.

It's the perfect look I wanted. We have had our set for about one year. Many of the pieces now have chips in them. These dishes get extremely HOT in the microwave before the food even gets heated enough. They will burn your fingers if you don't use an oven mitt to pick them up. The soup bowl is huge, I would like it to be smaller. The coffee cup is gigantic. I have read several other reviews that detailed similar disappointments.

This set is however slightly different from most stoneware. I have been in many stores and the stoneware usually is very heavy and you can tell it's stoneware.

I accidentally turned off the display, it took 1/2 hour to figure out how to get it back. For example, I have not figured out how to use the tape monitor function yet. Even simple things like changing a station, you have to go through a seek function, it takes forever to get to the other end of the numbers (maybe there is an easier way, but it is not obvious). The instructions are not helpful. This thing is very annoying because it is so hard to figure out how to do anything.

Also, regularly I have had to 're-initialize' the device simply because it stopped working correctly. The manual assures me that this is 'normal'.Stay away from this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant problems","review":"I've had nothing but trouble with this receiver.

The band was centered on Augusto Daolio, whose voice does not sound affected here by his fateful disease. Many are the unforgettable tracks on this album, and as usual \\"Auschwitz\\" (Song of the child in the wind), Francesco Guccini's tribute to the victims of the Holocaust, \\"Primavera di Praga\\", dedicated to Jan Palach, and Io Vagabondo (Me, the Wanderer) are a touch of great music with lyrics piercing straight into the heart. \\"Suoni\\" (Sounds) is perhaps the most remarkable of all. Augusto's most impressive \\"la-la-la\\", obviously accessible to those not familiar with Italian, sounds like a legacy a few months before his death, suspended between his serene acceptance of fate and a melancholic farewell. This album is a jewel, but I would get it just for that song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud but cold","review":"Very powerful and cools well.

I purchased a WA-1200E in June 2006 and it died last week (end of June 2007). This unit was lightly used (less than 10 hours per week during warm months only) . I contacted their support staff and, although they were prompt to reply, they indicated that the unit was out of warranty and that nothing was covered. They gave me the option of shipping the unit (85 lbs) at my own expense back to their warehouse in CA. They would then determine what part(s) failed and charge me for the replacement parts, labor and return shipping. Their other suggestion / advice was to take it to a local repair shop of my choice and have them find out the problem...then order the replacement parts from them. Either way....TERRIBLE! For a costly unit like this it should last way longer than 12 1/2 months. DO NOT BUY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PIECE OF JUNK SAVE YOUR MONEY","review":"I was shocked at how useless this thing was. I would turn this unit on immediately when I come home from work. The initial reading on the unit would say something like 95% (house was all closed up). The unit could not even drop the room temperature below 90%. After about 1hr the exhaust hose would radiate so much heat into the room that the unit made a better heater than air conditioner. The vents blow upwards as if to cool the ceiling. You cannot adjust them vertically. The unit is also very loud.I returned the unit after giving it a try for about 3 weeks. The other pain is returning this. You have to put it back in the box it came in with all the paper work and then carry this 85 pound box to a fedex place to have it shipped back to the manufacturer. You have to pay shipping to send it back and you are not refunded that amount.

Closed off the 2 drain plugs and the compressor tanks pressurized. It cut off and held pressure for an hour so I guess all is well. Its not horribly heavy, but neither is it a lightweight. Its somewhat quieter than my old 6 gallon pancake. The noise has a different tone, so its not nearly as annoying as the pancake was.

I strongly recomend a oil-type compressor. the first one I owned was oil-free and it only lasted about a year. as long as you check your oil level and color before every use and change when you notice the break down of the oil (brown in color don't wait till it turns black) you compressor will last a DIY a life time. where oil-free compressors piston rings naturaly wear down over time and will require a rebuild. Not a good compressor for a crew it will not handle more than 2 framing guns (cfms to low)but 1 gun or 2 if not going nuts, will keep up all day.

DeWalt bought out Emglo, which was an amazing compressor. Too bad the DeWalt isn't near the machine the Emglo was. Pros - This compressor does make a lot of air quickly. That's it. Cons - It won't start! Even on warm days, you have to \\"play\\" with it to get it to go, often tripping the overload or a breaker. On a cold day, it may never start until warmed, even using synthetic compressor oil. Once it goes, it will usually run for the day. Even plugged directly into a receptacle beside a panel, it won't go. It is also a noisy pump, not as noisy as some we've heard, but right up there.

I controlled the sink dept of my nail with the pressure from the compressor - worked like a charm.This compressor was pretty quite for its size, it held it's air very well and it got to the required pressure needed very quickly. As mentioned - I'm no professional, but I'm not sure how this tool could have performed any better.Only downside, it's a little heavy and the \\"tote\\" handle could be a touch higher -- you're hand will almost hit the pressure gauage when you grabbing it.Would buy again with no hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great versatile skillet!","review":"I purchased a set of Cuisinart pans that included this fabulous skillet.

Please look elsewhere if you want a room larger than a small closet cooled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"For its size and BTU rating I had expected much more from this unit. It is a pain to drain the collected condensed water tank, several times a day. It operates very warm, which makes this more of a heater and less of a cooling device. Even with the remove and clean filter a lot of dust still gets into the case, and instead of using standard philips screwdriver for the body they use several different head styles some of which are expensive. In addition, when i first got it, it did work but only if you stood in front of the vent, meaning that when it does work if you want to benefit from its use you have to sit in front of it.

Coming out is an individual thing and personalities vary. Lives vary. Every interview was preoccupied with whether the guy was \\"out\\" or not. The problem was that the related stories showed no correlation with sexual status. The book was badly preoccupied with this one fact.Gay Men; Straight Jobs was a very poor attempt to interview a group of interesting men. Mr Woog seemed to have a set formula (a very poor formula at that) which he followed with each man he interviewed. The book provided little insight into the interviewed men's lives and provided a very dull read. There was no attempt by the author to tie threads of commonality or diversity between the different people.

As far as I know, this is the first group to take traditional Italian folk songs and fuse them with dance electronics. Rather than being just another entry in the often tired worldbeat arena, this album sings, pops, bounces, and sparkles. The female vocalist, Fiamma, is excellent, and the musicians with her are equally as talented.As is true with the most sophisticated and skilled worldbeat practitioners, the group does not limit themselves to their native melodies and instruments. Inspiration is drawn from sources as diverse as Finland and the Celtic world.

But here, Fiamma Fumana make it exciting and interesting by combining their dancebeats with traditional instrumentation such as accordians, fiddles and bagpipes. The mix works, also because of Fiamma's own unique voice and the melodies that she weaves throughout.Tre Sorelle is the standout, but this album contains much more to love, such as 1.0, Di Madre in Figlia, Mareoceano, and the giddy, infectious L.I.L.T.If someone who didn't know a thing about this Italian group (or its language) were to hear the songs for the first time, they would bet money this was a group from Ireland or Scotland, as F.F.'s roots in that style of music are strong here.All in all, its a fun album, a refreshing burst of beats and hooks that should delight all who hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good speakers","review":"i needed some sound for the school programs. did not want to spend much because its was only being used by a preschooler.these speakers surprised me with good quality sound. i wish they had a volume knob.i recommend these speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST in the WORLD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Always having been a Major Fan of The Amazing Race I decided to purchase the DVD of series #1.

That's why I am so happy to see this set of DVDs -- no commercials, and all the extras!I am not a reality show watcher; I've tried most of them and become quickly bored with the 'popularity factor.' It's wonderful to see a true competition, where skill and luck rather than the most votes determine who wins and loses.The race doesn't always end the way I would like, but it's never boring and I love to watch episodes over again.Seeing the broad range of contestants (especially in Season 1) is also fun. When most shows seem to cast all models, would-be actors, and 'pretty people,' the Race goes for a wider slice of Americans, at least in the first few seasons.

Offers some insight into the mind of a serial killer who exhibited the classic signs of animal abuse and arson, and may have been beaten by his father. The killer seems to have a better life in prison than he did on the outside, and seems to very much enjoy his celebrity status (as well as being co-author of this book). Little information presented about the investigation of the crimes, the evidence that was used to convict him, etc. Mostly just the killer boasting about what he did (in great detail) and how he managed to avoid the death penalty.Overall very distasteful and not much of value here.

I have found other volumes on serial killers fascinating such as Bernard Headley's excellent \\"The Atlanta Youth Murders and the Politics of Race,\\" as well as more bubblegum fare such as Ann Rule's \\"The Stranger Beside Me.\\" I believe serial killers are interesting subject matter, but something this insane is better served by someone outside the psychopath's twisted field of vision.

I also want to see the ads featuring the cast along with bloopers. This is what I wanted on the first set. Those crafty folks know how to lure us back for more.When I was a kid growing up on US military bases, I saw a general explode on a Major who jokingly asked how realistic Hogan's Heroes was - turned out the General spent a little time in a POW camp - and he didn't have a Col. Klink to make the time such fun.But this was one of those great syndicated shows of your youth along with McHale's Navy and Sgt. Bilko (when will those two get the DVD treatment).

The book is easy to read and in fact reads extremely well. Even the font is pleasing. It is concise and the topics are very useful for day to day primary care disorders.If you're a primary care doc or a student, PA, NP and you're looking for a very useful and succinct book on woman's health care you will not be disappointed with this book.

I like working with a thick pen, and this does fill the bill in the regard. However, it is a slippery pen that is somewhat hard to grasp. But the fatal flaw for me is the lack of a clip. From the photo, there is the impression that this pen could be clipped into your shirt pocket. But no.. that is simply a design element. This pen fell out of my pocket so many times that I eventually left it at home. If Cross wants to make a smooth pen without any clip, that is up to them.

Zooming out enough to eliminate vignetting gives you a narrower angle of view than not using the adapter/lens at all. I couldn't get the supplied adapters to mount the wide angle lens at all.

It is one of those books you can't wait to see what happens next but you don't want to finish because you like the people. I will buy her next E-book, \\"Once Upon a Dream\\", that has just been released. I am looking forward to enjoying that also.

In a way, one could argue that MBM, more than just about anyone, paved the way for a generation of electro-breakbeat with the single song \\"Helter Skelter.\\" That said, this disc lacks much of the trademark noisy bluster of some MBM releases - not entirely a bad thing - but still leaves the foot tapping. Parts of the non-stop mix tend to drag a bit, but on the whole I found the combination of crisp breakbeats, bongos and weird vocal samples to be quite engaging. More importantly, one can hear Dangers' signature on the work. In a genre of music that is often cookie-cutter and/or anonymous in its presentation, 'Hello Friends' reminds you that, at its best, electronic music has a detectable heartbeat underneath the cold machinery, particularly in the hands of a mixmaster like Jack Dangers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever happened to Jack Dangers?","review":"A few years ago the man could do no wrong. Everything he touched was great. MBM material and his remixes were so inventive and engaging. But this stuff is boring and pointless. It meanders without a direction. Some of the really dubby stuff has that old spark (and some of these aren't even done by Dangers) but nothing leaves an impression. I know this is a mix CD but nothing on this would get me dancing-maybe head nodding. Maybe if I was in a club and this was on I'd be really happy but at home it's kinda annoying.

While coming at the text from an academically critical perspective, she also incorporates her faith into the material setting her work apart from other scholars. The book also serves as a good introduction to feminist exegesis, exploring different approaches to reading the text and, in my opinion, finding a good and fair approach to reading the text faithfully. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Old Testament studies as well as those interested in getting started at looking at the bible from a feminist perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Orthodox","review":"While this author makes his case for ecumenism at the cost of Orthodoxy, his proof texts from the scriptures and the Holy Fathers are taking out of context and actually speak against this new teaching he is putting forth in his work.

I was not disappointed! \\"Borrowed Angels,\\" composer Diane Warren's contribution to this CD, is proof that a good singer can make a song better than it probably is. Very few can do this--Judy, Barbra, Audra McDondald. Though I've never seen Kristin live, I own most of her recordings and she never disappoints! Kristin could sing anything and elevate it to high art.

Seen her in everything she's done on Broadway. Own her first CD. You gotta love the voice but buying an CD also includes actually wanting to listen to the songs. When she announced a new CD at her Carnegie Hall concert, I was expecting somthing different, and this is certainly something different. The fact that -- as one of my fellow reviewers noted -- Chenoweth announced her intentions to do a Christian gospel-like CD, does nothing to improve the collection of actual songs which have a ton of reverb added. The final \\"Latte\\" song seems as if it were added at the last moment just to hold out hope listeners like myself that there' still hope that Chenoweth can come up with a CD that you'll actually want to listen to more than once! Ah well, maybe next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice bad musical choices.","review":"I always enjoyed Kristin Chenoweth and when I had the luck to experience her live at a charity concert I was hooked for life. She told us about her new \\"spiritual\\" C.D. but told us it wouldn't be full of \\"Jesus Songs\\" as she called it. I don't have a problem with Christian themed music. Some of the greatest music ever written was on Christian thought. Kristin unfortunately fell into the \\"Contemporary Christian\\" trap of syrupy cliche. I wouldn't have been pleased if she had just retreaded her last c.d. either. Her voice is what redeams this recording and I respect her artistry to explore new themes in her music as opposed to simply singing a variation on a theme. The song \\"Talylor The Latte Boy\\" which feals tacked on as the last track is funny and showcases her fantastic comic timing. I'll run right out and get whatever she releases but this recording will not be in hi rotation for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Buy","review":"When using the additional adapter there's a high pitch sound that comes through the radio.

I changed from a cassette tape based interface to my iPod and the sound quality is virtually the same. Around cell/microwave towers you get some limited interferance, but the flexibility of not having to have tape plugged in is great. Also, my wife's car which would not accept a tape cartrigde interface works great also. Based on the other reviews, I think any problems are probably related to the ability of the car stereo to pick up the signal properly. Great value especially as compared to the other high priced alternatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"This works great! I live outside Philadelphia, PA so there aren't many unused stations around. This unit actually blocks out some weaker stations completely. I highly recommend this.

I have to keep my player rested on the middle console of the car, be very careful not to move the player when it is connected, and mute the stereo when not in use. Otherwise, this horribly loud noise comes through the speakers when the cord is moved. It sounds similar to the sound of someone blowing into a microphone. Maybe I received a defective one I don't know. Otherwise the sound is ok, not great. I have to turn up the volume on both the player and the stereo quite a bit. If i forget to turn either of them back down before using individually it's a deafening surprise. My husband has the iriver AFT 100 and he loves it. Spend the money and get a decent one the first time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Regular","review":"Referente a la sintonización funciona bien pero cuando se trata de la señal, la misma no se pierde pero se le mete todo el ruido producido por el motor.

Also it does not transmit both speaker channels. The passenger side cracks loudly every once in awhile but will not play. This has to be the unit because it works fine on regular radio or cds.

Maybe it'll never ship. But if it doesn't, I'll have STILL saved 7 or 8 bucks (what it would have cost more to order it from someone with the item in stock), since I ordered this, Steve Jobs has died, a new iPhone has come and probably already gone, and for all I know, my iPod is no longer supported by apple and may have an update that makes it incompatible with this Coby Car Transmitter with Digital Display and DC Car Cigarette Lighter Adapter.

I have two cars (Honda Civic, Toyota Prius), and spring blades on the sides of the barrel that are supposed to press against the inside of the socket don't go in far enough and it doesn't maintain a firm connection - I think that's why so many people complain that it blinks off.So Caveat Emptor - it may simply be the luck of the draw if it fits your 12V socket or not... maybe domestic or European cars have deeper sockets. However, I can't drive down the highway holding it in the socket to maintain a connection.

Unfortunately I never got much use out of it because it was plagued with problems. The unit looks nice but never sounded good. I tried switching to many different frequencies but the static was still there. My car has a rooftop antenna so maybe that is part of the problem. I think it might work better if your antenna is on the front of your car so the signal doesn't have to go through the roof. Also if you touch the cord while in use the static would get much worse. The sun also caused it to crack in several different places after only a couple of weeks.

It was a difficult choice, because some FM Transmitters seem to get bad reviews. I'm glad I chose this one, because it has worked perfectly for me. No static. Very easy to configure. Five stars.UPDATED REVIEW: After using it about 20 times over 10 months (and when it wasn't used, it sat safely in my glove compartment), it now makes a horrible static sound anytime the wire shakes, which means anytime the car goes over a slight bump. It's pretty worthless now. Two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works better than the the more expensive unit I own","review":"Awhile back I bought an FM transmitter for my i Pod. That unit was over twice the price and does have a charging dock and it holds the i Pod securely in place but just doesn't perform all that well. Where as the Coby holds a station and works with great with my Zune and more importantly my 16GB Walkman NWZ-S739 very well.As others have mentioned I've had no problems with it dropping a station or picking up white noise or any other interference the way the other unit does. Then the fact it works with pretty much any MP3 player really makes the Coby CA-745 wireless transmitter a great buy.So over all if you want an easy inexpensive way to play your MP3 player through your cars FM receiver, save some money and give this unit a shot, I bet you be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"sound was good while it lasted","review":"sound quality was great in my Ford Ranger, but it died shortly after recieving it and i dont know whats wrong with it.

Although I liked the fact that I could plug in an extra device, I was afraid of using it. Yesterday I used it for the first time to charge my iPod at the same time I was listening to it. This morning when I went to use it again, it just did not work at all. I guess my gut feeling was right.To be fair, the quality of the sound was very good, and up until this morning I was very happy with it. If you still want to buy this product, just make sure you don't plug any additional device to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got a dead one.","review":"I got one of these as a gift. It was dead on arrival. It doesn't transmit on any FM frequency. It never worked.The Colby warranty says you can send it back with a receipt (but it was a gift so I don't have one) and $6, after you visit their website and call their support service,Buying this product appears to be a matter of luck; if you get one that works it's a good deal. IF you get a dead one, you've just bought a headache. Who wants to spend time on the phone trying to get a refund? Is your time worth it?I wouldn't buy this if I was you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"The product worked alright for a about two months and then began literally falling apart. When it did work it was always static-filled sound and never fully clear.

I however, would recommend buying a more expensive and higher quality transmitter as its what i did finally after using this product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I have a Sirius radio in my car, the built in transmitter was not strong enough to listen to, so you constantly had to keep finding Fm frequencies that were not being used. I live in the NY City area and that's difficult and annoying to do. I bought this unit because of all the good reviews and the price was right. I have to say I was very impressed with the signal strength and quality of the sound.This unit will allow you to use 87.7mhz which is never used by anyone. Excellent product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after two months","review":"The Transmitter had a problem connecting with my MP3 player from day one. It had to be secured with a rubber band to stay connected (I have an Ipod Touch and Sansa MP3 player and it had the same issue with both. After two months it stopped working altogether.

The company would not accept the return since it is over 30 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reception if the antenna in your car is on the back","review":"I was very excited about using this to connect my android phone and listen to Pandora in the car. However, the sound quality was very poor (and I picked a frequency that had no interference whatsoever). Based on other reviews, I thought the sound was going to be much better. I can only think that the antenna is on the back of my car, and the transmitter does not have enough power. If your antenna is closer to the transmitter you might be luckier, but for me it does not do much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well w/ minimal interference","review":"Works will in the greater NY/NJ metro area.

To make it worse, the FM receiver is in the back of the car, and it goes digitally to the dashboard... And my car stereo cannot be upgraded. So I decided to give this modulator a try and was very happy that I was able to get a pretty good signal so I can enjoy my music and podcasts in the car from by iPad/iPod. We also use this in our Saturn Vue which we have had problems with in the past with FM modulators, and it works really good there as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of the product","review":"Just want to say, if you want to spend your money. There is better way to spend $20 than spending here. Trust me you will end up losing your money. Never had a transmitter that lasted only 2 months. Seriously!! And even the paper that comes with the product says warranty on parts is for 1 year, when contacted for replacement the company says it does not need parts to be replaced. It comes as a whole. So in a nutshell they deny replacing the product or parts. So buyers, please beware. Never had something that was so short lived. I wish I had done something meaningful with $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete garbage","review":"bought this because it was cheaper than many other fm modulators and had overall positive reviews. my expectations were realistic. i know it wont sound as good as a direct connection or axillary port but I didnt want to buy a whole new radio so i got this instead.it worked fine for about 15 minutes before the lcd screen failed, making it impossible to change the station and try to fine one that wasn't completely static-y. since we had just started a 6 hour road trip we ended up stopping at walmart and buying an overpriced belkin product that worked well enough for the duration of the trip. this garbage is on its way back to amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"Works great for a great price.

We figured this would be preferable to having the kids hassling with the wires of headphones and the worry of whether they would have the volume too loud. NOT using anything wasn't an option, since the DVD player is mounted to the ceiling right between the driver and passenger, and to have it loud enough for the kids to hear it was driving my hubby and I crazy! We had a different FM transmitter but there was too much artifact noise and that bothered us a lot. The Coby transmitter is perfect; great because it piggybacks the DVD plug and there is such a minor amount of artifact noise it's canceled out by the engine and road noise. I can't say enough about how satisfied we are with this product, especially since it was among the least expensive transmitters. Thanks, Coby!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent reception","review":"An order of magnitude better than the Belkin transmitters.

It completely drowned out any radio interference. The sound quality was OK, but I'd recommend the Monster Transmitter for a richer sound even though the Coby transmitter sends out a stronger signal.My problem is that the Coby died after 3 days. Part of its appeal is that you can plug another device into its Cigarette Lighter Adapter. When I plugged an air compressor in the socket to fill my tires, it blew out the Coby transmitter which won't even power on.Since it was still under warranty, I could send it back to Coby if I include a money order to cover shipment. This annoys me. Why do I have to pay even more for a defective product? I'll eat the shipping cost to return it, but Coby should eat the shipping cost to replace it.In any event, I bought the Monster transmitter which is performing better IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died 4 months in","review":"Great transceiver but mine died about 4 months into use.

I only gave it four stars because the product contains lead in the wiring otherwise it is a five star product. (The first unit blew a fuse or something when I tried to use the plug pass through, Amazon return service was amazingly fast and courteous, five stars to them!)(Update: This product self destructed after about a good six months of use, this time it just sort of split in half. I would like to officially revise my initial review and give it a two star rating.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I've had two of this brand and one of another brand.Pros:- You can set the transmitter to any frequency. It covers all FM frequencies.- Price; it's pretty cheap.- Easy to use.- Fairly strong signal.- Decent sound quality.Cons:- After just a few days, some of the wiring started to have problems and caused static in the transmission. Any small movement of the player would cause it and sometimes it would become louder than the mp3 player. This occurred on both.- The metal parts that insert into the cigarette lighter started to break off after 3 months. This means it didn't stay in very well and would often power off if not at the correct angle.- It completely stopped working after about 18 months.So, the basic summary is that it's cheap and works ok, but it's fairly low quality and doesn't last very long. However, it lasted longer than a more expensive model I bought six months ago. Be prepared to hear a lot of static."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken out of the box","review":"I thought I would give this product a shot since it seemed like the only people who weren't happy with it were the ones who recieved defective items.

I tried on a couple other occasions and got the same response. The power light would turn on and I could choose the frequency easily but there was no connection what so ever to the radio.

You can't listen to music if your phone/ipod/mp3 player is also charging (MAJOR interference). The cord is also very short. My charging port is down on the other side near passenger foot space instead of in the middle on the console. I had to plug my phone or ipod in and leave it on the floor most of the time which meant I also couldn't change any songs. If you're looking for a cheap product that provides so-so quality that won't get used ALL the time, this is decent enough. If you're looking for something that you will use every time you're in the car, keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"good enough i guess","review":"works as it should. have to find a station with zero reception so there is no interference. kind of hard in a city."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete distortion","review":"I bought it to listen to audio books and it is so full of noise you can barely understand the words.

That is thanks in part to how simple the design is, bright easy to read frequency setting in the front and it has a pass through for the power outlet so you can still plug in a charger or what have you while the transmitter is plugged in as well. The only reason this didn't get a perfect score is as with any FM signal the audio quality is poor, but don't let this keep you from buying; the quality compared to any other transmitter is the best and the thing that makes this one even better than others is I have had no signal drop out or weakening signal."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the price, it is performing well!","review":"I wasn't sure what I would really get, but this little gadget works well with my Droid Charge Android phone and the FM player in my older car. You will have to play with the volume on both devices to get it where you want it, and then you will need to turn your car radio down before you switch to another regular FM station or it will be too loud. On some channels, I do get some interference from the car, but this device lets you find a channel that has no or next to no interference. It works for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"Husband is very happy to have his iPod working in his work van as it only had a radio. Very easy to use and set up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor electrical noise filtering","review":"I purchased this product hoping I could play my song downloads from my smartphone to my factory radio.While the product does the job, it has an annoying shortcoming. It allows electrical noise from my car's engine be audible through my FM radio. Since I enjoy listening to classical music, this is a big problem to me.If I am accelerating, I can hear an annoying high-pitched \\"whirring\\" sound through the radio. I can also hear other \\"whirs\\", whistling, and popping noises especially during quiet moments. The noise is not present during normal radio operation - the noise is only present when tuned into the frequency the transmitter is set to. My car has all stock components so the noise is not due to some modification or add-on.Might not be a problem with some cars since different car models have different electrical components with different degrees of electrical noise, but this product is not so great with a Jeep '06."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy","review":"This item works great and I can't believe how great the price is!

I have to cut it a little bit to make it fit. I used a CD based mp3 player to feed the music to it. The problem is the CD is also powered from the cigarette lighter, put the power source at the FM transmitter generate a lot of interference. Latter I found the CD player has to be put away from the FM transmitter or it will generate extra back ground noise which is not tolerable to me. I also tried use my phone to feed music to it, because the phone is powered by battery, the interference between the FM transmitter and phone is much smaller, but it is still there. Unless the unit I bought is faulty, the unit is very sensitive to outside interference.I compared cassette adapter to the FM transmitter, cassette adapter has better treble and not sensitive to any outside interference, FM transmitter has more bass. I prefer cassette adapter because it is closer to CD quality. It is unfortunate that my cassette player only works when it is cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud hum when headlights are on","review":"This item seems well built but has average FM transmitter sound. I could hear static and a slight hum when I first used it. When I turned on the headlights, though, a very loud hum came through the FM transmitter. Totally unacceptable sound with the headlights on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh...","review":"I liked this thing at first, even though there was always noticeable distortion, which was especially grating when I'd drive over a bump or pothole. It got pretty frustrating because the distortion became progressively worse the longer I had it, until it finally just stopped working completely, wouldn't even turn on, after only a year. Also annoying how the cord is so short. But for a while, it's decent, and you can have some good time together, just don't expect them to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so device","review":"Ordered and got it in the mail as expected. Just plain so so quality when the sound is just overly distorted. I had to tune down all the low & high frequencies on the player to get less distortion...(boost up mid-range) once that is set, the next hurdle is to try and ignore road noises. The darn thing transmits volume just not that loud. Receiver volume has to be cranked up double compared to regular FM channel and still annoyingly soft. Sometimes it has static but it's okay as long as you don't move the player around that much. Not gonna recommend anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fuses","review":"The transmitter part of this operation was great only it never worked because its fuse always blew. I went through so many fuses.

Sure I had to change stations every now and then, but that's the nature of FM transmitters. To reduce crackle I sometime had to adjust my mp3 player volume level as well, but I could always find pretty high quality sound on a station. I know there are a lot of junk FM transmitters out there. This one works great. I've only had it for a month though so here's hoping it lasts awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muffled, mono aspect to the sound","review":"I didn't expect the sound quality to be impeccable, but I did expect it to be decent and it is not. On a scale of 1 to 10 I'd give it a 3, pretty bad. The volume fades in and out and the sound has a muffled, mono aspect to it. Not worth more than $10 in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"I purchased this for my boyfriend as a birthday gift.

It works great...the only problem I'm having is that it's hard to get my stereo to stop at the stations. I finally got it to stop and just saved the station. I highly recommend if you are looking to play your ipod and don't have a stereo that works wiith that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Wire makes it useless","review":"I had an experience like a lot of people so I should have known better. I started with an IRiver 100 which worked great but died after 6 months. I decided to try the Colby after reading so many good reviews. I also liked the price. At first I thought that it was having trouble locking on to a station. When I finally touched the wire I found out that all of the trouble is in the connetion to the plug that plugs in to my mp3 player. The signal pops or snaps with every tiny road bump and if the wire is bumped, it will cut the signal out completely. The wire is defective and I am returning it. I may spend the big bucks and have a box hard wired between my antenna and my radio. I don't think any of these transmitters work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for a couple weeks","review":"I was really excited because this FM transmitter worked great .... for about two weeks.

I read the 5-star reviews here (which look suspiciously like they were reviewed by the product's marketing team) and thought that this product might actually work. Didn't. No matter where I was on the dial, I had to turn my volume up 3 times louder than normal to hear via this device. Guess what happens when I change the source to a real FM station? An explosion of sound in my car! Tried multiple cars (and various iterations of FM transmitters) and they've never worked well.I finally did purchase a cassette tape adapter which works great (until my next stereo which will have an alt-in for iPod!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this thing! Easy to use and fantastic quality.","review":"I've used this Coby FM Transmitter for many hours now (probably about 20 or so) and it's rock solid. Very rarely do I have interference from some outside source (I use 89.1 for my signal) and I've traveled over 1300 miles with this all over central and southern Colorado. The sound quality is a crisp or better than I'd ever expect from FM radio. There's no distortion when listening to my MP3 player. I'm also really impressed that they were thoughtful enough to have a pass through power adapter. That worked out great, too!Zero complaints here. I'd buy this item again in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short lived","review":"This device only last for approximately 2 weeks and then it stopped working, this was shortly after my mom was using the port to charge her phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just great","review":"Good inexpensive way to listen to my iPod in the car.

I really should have read the negative reviews first. As many of those have also claimed, my transmitter worked great--for a few days. Then suddenly it stopped working. It would turn on, but it wasn't transmitting a signal. Sometimes I could get a very fuzzy sound for a few seconds, but then it would go to complete static again. Don't buy this product. If you bought it on Amazon, don't return it to Coby as they will charge you $6 for shipping. Amazon lets you return it for free.

It's one of the simplest transmitters out there, functionwise, but it looks very nice, although it would've been even better if it were all entirely either black or white, I find the contrast slighty evegrabbing - not a desirable thing.It tends to produce a high-pithed whine in my car that actually complements the whine of the supercharger when the engine is being revved - at first I thought something went wrong with the engine, but then I realized Icould control the noise with the volume knob. Some might find it annoying, but I actually found that kind of funny - it makes driving without music all the more exciting. This came very close to being a 5 star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big bang for the buck","review":"I bought this from Amazon and it came two days later. I haven't tried many other MP3 FM transmitters so I don't have a comparison. But, I can tell you this one works very well. I live in a Radio Frequency jammed Southern California and no matter where I went, I received clean MP3 audio. It actually sounded better than my FM radio! There are naturally some spots where the signal would fade for a second and the unit likes to be in the line of site of the radio antennae. Nice feature is it has a 12 volt pass-through so you don't loose an outlet in your car. I am sure there are better ones available for more money. But overall you can't beat it for the price.

The cable has to be bent a certain way or else it sounds flat instead of stereo. I have gotten tired of messing with it.

The worst part was the plug never had a stable connection with the outlet. I had to frequently wiggle it back and forth to get contact. Then if you drove over a bump you would lose the connection. That was very frustrating and maddening. Second, it was hard to change the channel because there is little tactile feedback, it is hard to see the readout, and also because pushing buttons would invariable cause the plug to lose contact without me knowing it. As a transmitter, you could always hear a hum in the background of whatever you were listening to so I would have to turn up the volume of my device and turn down the volume of the car radio. Overall this provided marginal usability, but was frustrating to operate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"The adapter did not work in the plug: it never turned on.

However; based on the reviews for this and other brands I decided to give it a try. Since many people seemed to have trouble getting reception I didn't want to spend a lot of money and have the same problem. Plus, since I use my Garmin a lot I liked the idea of the extra port.The set up was a cinch. The quality was great and it proved to be pretty durable considering is was plugged in and unplugged twice a day and thrown on the floor and most likely stepped on.Then one day for some dumb reason; when I plugged it in; I decided I needed to jiggle the plug like you sometimes have to do with adapter plugs and it just stopped working. I don't know what happened but I blame myself for it and at 17.99 a pop I decided that I could try another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor audio quality & very low volume","review":"This device did not work well with either my Droid Smartphone or my iPod Nano. The signal was very weak playing to the FM radios in both of our cars. There was lots of background noise. I tried as many blank frequencies as I could find throughout the FM dial. The sound quality was so bad that I'm going to return this item. It is totally unusable. This may be due to the distance from the device to the FM antennas in my cars, but it should be strong enough to reach to the rear window or rear mounted antenna. For me it didn't live up to the reviews I read on Amazon before I ordered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work... bad warranty","review":"Out of the box, my FM transmitter didn't work. An intermittent connection inside the 1/8\\" stereo plug caused terrible noise every time the cable was touched or the car hit a bump. I tried connecting other MP3 players and confirmed it was a problem with the Coby. After two days, the unit stopped powering up at all. The fuse is intact, so there's something wrong with the device.The warranty requires me to file a claim, pay for two-way shipping ($12) and wait 4-6 weeks for repair or replacement. However, for less time and money, I can run to Walmart and buy a competitors product today. Worthless warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good look, good price, but bit noisy","review":"It's nice that it plugs into the car jack, and that you can plug in an additional jack if you want. The fact that you can change the frequency over the FM range is nice. The blue back light looks amazing. I have a problem with a high pitch noise coming from it though.

I have tried it with both my tape player and MP3 player and it has yet to have a problem. The sound is clear and consistent, despite my driving all over the county. The only extraneous noise seems to come from my tape player and a small buzzing when I turn on my lights. I highly recommend this product. The only problem is that the coating on the front almost immediately started falling off. However, this is a small price to pay for the great sound quality you are receiving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coby CA-745 Wireless FM Transmiter Problem","review":"The problem I had with the Coby CA-745 Transmitter was that it will not stay plugged into any of my three vehicles Cigarette lighter outlets. It finally blew the fuse in my Corvette. The Transmitter keeps popping out of the outlets. If I held it in by hand the Transmitter seemed to work O.K. I am in the process of sending the unit back."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK For Awhile","review":"This is a very \\"no-frills\\" type of transmitter, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's easy to use, and you can still use your cigarette liter (say to charge a phone or something) while you're listening to your MP3 player over the radio. It's easy to use, and I didn't have any trouble receiving the signal loud and clear over my stereo. However, it developed a short in the wire that connects to your MP3 player after about 7 months. The cord is hard wired into the device, and cannot be replaced. The short got very bad, very quickly and the whole thing was all but unusable after 8 months. I leave my FM transmitters in my car, so perhaps the fluctuations in temperature played a role. In my opinion, this is not a good buy. There is an FM transmitter made by Soundfly on Amazon that I've had much better luck with."},{"rating":"1","title":"works, but the wire breaks internally","review":"Eventually after a year or so, the coiled connecting wire will break down internally and one of the conductors will short out. This cable also includes a wire that serves as the antenna. This results in nasty intermittent alternator noise and audio cutouts that are quite annoying to listen to.The audio quality before this happens is quite good. I think the PVC insulation gets brittle in the sun and starts cracking internally, based on my wire & cable dissection.Also, the connector would be much better if it was a right angle plug, rather than a straight 3.5mm male stereo plug."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional","review":"I ordered this transmitter after reading reviews others had written. I have had it for two years and am thrilled with how well it works. My boyfriend has a different model, it has a small black channel changer, and it can barely transmit. This has just reinforced the value of my purchase two years ago. The Coby transmitter is powerful enough that in a three state trip, I only have to change stations once and while on a good channel there is no breakthrough static. My boyfriend has asked for this transmitter for Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"After an exhaustive search for a good FM transmitter, I thought this product was a good choice: it seemed to have a good quality and a reasonable price, but it doesn't work so well after all.The pros:-No batteries needed, just plug it in the cigarette lighter. Also you still have the plug available because of the built-in outlet-Easy-to-read, blue-color backlit screen-Long pigtail cable. To give an idea of how long it is, a person sitting on the rear seat can use the player while connected to the transmitter on the front-You can choose almost any station you want-It can be retracted to take less space when stored-The materials are fine - FM transmitters are not the sturdiest devices anyway, but this one seems fineThe cons:-The worst one: lots of interference and noises. It's hard to find a station where the audio listens properly.Bottom line: Choose a better one if possible. This one is not the worst, but as I said, it's not so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow - works great!","review":"I was amazed how well this worked. Sound is as good as it can probably get through one of these. It's kind of big physically (twice as big as my Sansa Clip) so that was kind of a pain, but excellent sound.The first one I bought had a bad connection inside so the audio cut out.

The price was certainly right. It did work great for about 2 months. After that it would gradually work loose and lose conection. You could reseat the adapter and it would work for a while before you would have to reseat it again. After about 4 months the only way it would work is if you held it place. Not very practical while driving."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is should be","review":"The Colby CA- 745 worked perfectly out the box. Seconds to set up, find an open station and that's that.

You also won't see this warning unless you use a magnifying glass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well...for a while","review":"Well, seems like this is a common problem with this device. Mine worked flawlessly for about 6 months of almost daily use, and then one day I plugged it in, it lit up blue as it always does, and then turned off...forever. The case smells like burned electronics, so I'm guessing some component inside just gave out. They need to use some higher-quality electronic components in this thing! I know it's relatively inexpensive, but I expected more than a few months of use out of it! In effect, my $20 basically went towards \\"renting\\" this unit for a few months. Quite disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but the best FM Transmitter I've use so far","review":"It's hard to please people in his product category because there are some many variables that can affect sound quality that are are to blame on the product. The degree of radio frequency crowding is certainly one of them. That being said this Coby works fine. I have it tuned the quietest frequency I could find in L.A. which is 88.3, but I still get some minor popping sounds. That does not bother me that much. Other than that the build quality is excellent. I like the blue glow from the LED display."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as FM transmitter gets","review":"At the time of purchase, I was quite skeptical about this FM transmitter. Few year later - still works great.The only part that could be better - the 3.5mm headphone jack. I live in San Francisco Bay area and commute on peninsula. Interference is a very rare event in spite of numerous local FM stations."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a piece of junk","review":"There is a high pitched whine when the car engine is running.

The only other thing that I would have wanted is for the product to work as a charger as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed!","review":"Really like this transmitter. Works great for what I need. The fact the you can plug in another device at the same time was key - It doesn't charge my iphone so I just plugged in the charger at the same time so it worked wonderfully. It is a bit bulky so I couldn't have a drink in my cup holder since the transmitter took up too much room but it wasn't a big deal. I also couldn't read the display very easily in the day - but once I found a channel it didn't really matter. Great product - good price - overall happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last.","review":"It was never fantastic, but it did the job. Unfortunately, after owning it for a few months, I ran into the same problem at least one other reviewer did: Every little bump in the road would jostle the connection, and even the slightest bit of that caused obnoxious loud crackling. This made it completely unusable in very short order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very high quality FM trasnmitter!!","review":"WOW this FM transmitter is the best ones I've owned so far and for only like 22$ it works extremely well, the build quality is good and the jack wire is thick and well built. and the actually transmitting is great, i plugged it into my evo 4g, and ipod and played songs from my car to the radio and the quality is great. differently recommend this to my friends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great ... until it died","review":"This has good transmission power for a low price. It did well on open bands and I had very few issues with the device in the first 3 months of ownership. Then, right outside of 90 days, it died. No warning, nothing. I treated this unit well and there is nothing in the way that I treated it that would have contributed to its early demise. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied Customer","review":"I am extremely pleased with the Coby Transmitter. other transmitters have had lots of static, but with this one, there is none at all. I travel a lotfor work and for fun, and have had no trouble with it. It worked on the first station I programmed it to, and I have yet to change it. And the price makes it even better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"Only used it one day around town and it works great. I tried it on my wife's 2GB Sansa mp3 player. It also played my mp3's off my cell phone and transmitted my internet radio which I have installed on my cell as well. I had to purchase a 3.5mm to 2.5mm jack adapter for about $4 to connect to the phone. The extra port on the Coby allows me to charge either my cell or mp3 player at the same time.I was worried because every radio station where I live as some sort of signal or static, but it seemed to block that all out (Atleast on the weaker channels I tried).You do have to crank up the volume on your mp3 player all the way. But once you do that you can turn up the volume on your car stereo as loud as you want and it sounds great!Definitely worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work","review":"I plugged it in to my cigarette lighter in my car and it didn't work. My Mazda has two different power outlets and I tried them both - it never turned on.

Unfortunately this was one of the worst. I was so excited that it had the adapter-within-an-adapter so you can plug both the transmitter and something else into the port. However, this unit did not have enough power to transmit my mp3 player music clearly. The sound was very static-y on multiple stations, even with the volume on the MP3 turned way up. I have a suspicion this has to do with the fact the Pathfinder's antena is in the back windows. Just for kicks, I plugged it into the port in the trunk area. The sound was better, but then you can't control the device. Had to return and still looking for a solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality","review":"Technically, this product works.

The first day it began to short out on me, but figured that it was just a little twitchy. But after 2 weeks it just completely stopped working. The postage to send it back is not worth the money and frustration I spent on it. Don't waste your money. From my experience, all the positive reiews are misleading (if not deceitful)... Are you guys on something?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 1 week","review":"I took a chance on this mp3 despite the mixed reviews, it started out great, for about a week. After that it wouldn't stay on while plugged into cigarette lighter, it would go in and out, when I would get it in the perfect position if i hit a bump in the road it would shut off again so annoying.

Yes, there's some very minor static (if you REALLY pay attention), but just ignore that and enjoy the music. I only wish this item charged my iPhone while in use, but that's being quite picky. 5 stars for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than nothing...","review":"This modulator works well but does not produce near the sound quality I originally expected.

I had it in my Amazon cart for a while, then my satelite radio went out, and then this became a necessity. Works right out of the box, I just plugged it in an set to 87.9. No static or any other problems. (Only if you put the mp3 player too close to the adapter) The extra adapter is a life saver. I've used it to charge my phone or run my GPS system. I also have a separate DC split adapter and can use three products at once (kids dvd player, GPS, and charge my phone). I have a Sansa clip (1G), and it works just fine. I do have to turn the volume up high on the Sansa clip. The the quality of the music at times, is even better than the satelite radio. I've had it for 5 months, with no problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice product, that does what it's made up for!","review":"I bought this product 3 months ago from Amazon, 2 of them, one for me and another for my brother. I looked at few products, cheaper ones, around 10 bucks and little expensive ones, over 20 bucks. I took a chance by going for this product, with one positive feature, of plugging one more charger into this while this is plugged into car. And this worked pretty good. Transmission is very clear and crisp, no noice at all (except when it comes out slightly), even when another one is plugged into this. I tested it by receiving with multiple FM receivers, no noice / interference on any. It's worth buying it, one can blindly buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My first Coby worked ok for about a week, then stopped working. It would work for 10-30 minutes, then stop transmitting. I returned it and exchanged it for another one, which was dead on arrival. I plan on trying the Aerielle i2i next."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works, but the FM signal is too weak.","review":"The device works as described. However, there is a major drawback: the received FM signal is very weak, and I have to turn up the volume of my car radio very high. When I drive on highway, I have to turn up the volume to the full scale. Doing so causes a lot of problems: including high circuit noise and I will hear huge interfere sounds when I touch the buttons of the device.The radio antenna of my car is in the front. The situation may be improved if the antenna is in the back of the car. I believe that if there are no metal frame/sheets in the path between the device and antenna the received FM signal will be much stronger.Also, I suspect that other FM car transmitters of this kind would have the same issue in my car: weak received FM signal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived defective, and I was told to pay to send it back","review":"I purchased this mainly because my wife has one, which has worked well for the year she's had it. Once I received my own, I plugged it in, only to find it didn't work. I set it up the exact same way as my wife set hers, and no sound came through. I used her transmitter in my car, and it worked. Switched back to mine, and nothing.I called Coby to exchange it, and they said I need to ship it back to them and include a money order for $6. Why should I have to pay for their mistake? $6 plus shipping? I tried to get around these charges, feeling like I shouldn't be penalized for their defective merchandise, but they refused. So, I threw it in the trash, and Coby lost a customer for life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Work","review":"The CA-745 worked for about 30 seconds & then refused to turn on again. I purchased it because of the price. It also looked cheap - the face was scratched & peeling. I returned it and purchased the Griffin iTrip FM Transmitter for Sansa, which I am very happy with. Also note - The CA-745 has a large unit/plug sticking out from the power outlet in the dashboard, (others like the iTrip are separated by a wire)I could not plug it in or easily access it when my car was in park because the shifter is right in front of the plug in my dashboard (Nissan Pathfinder)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit in 12V Car Power Outlet","review":"The Coby CA-745 head is too wide to fit the 12V power outlet in my 2005 Toyota Corolla, it only inserts halfway. I have been reading reviews for a similar Coby FM transmitter and this appears to be a recurring problem. Other people have said that it will fit into a 'cigarette lighter' but not into a pure 12V power outlet. A possible workaround for this problem would be unscrewing the head and slipping it in fast enough that the fuse doesn't fall out--but the hassle isn't worth it. I am returning this for a refund.

Much better than the iTrip I had before, and cheaper than the Inno radio car adapter system!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FM Transmitter","review":"This product works pretty good. There is a little static sometimes, but I hardly hear it since I have my music so loud. The only problem I found is when I used my car vacuum through the transmitter.

I've copied it onto tape twice and dragged it from state to state as we moved. The Sandpipers had a mellow blend of voices, and there is a sweetness to their arrangements. The soprano background on several numbers is a lovely counterpoint.The selections are so varied that it is never boring, even the changing of language adds interest. The nursery song\\"Inchworm\\" takes on a whole new meaning. There is a fascinating song \\"Glass\\" , which I have never heard elsewhere. Every word has meaning in their hands.

They take the Beatles Michelle and give it a samba-tinged sway, which works quite well. The French Song comes from a live recording. Of course, the group's top-ten hit Guantanamera is included. All in all this album is 24 selections done in a folk-pop style meant to turn off no one. It's all very mellow listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Casual Clutch, Good Quality","review":"Cute clutch. Slightly bigger than I would like, but it fits all my essentials nicely. It even fits my 7.25 x 4.5 inch wallet. The material is kind of canvas-like which makes it more casual than I thought it would be. It's more like a day clutch. The quality is good, not great.

The reviews were great and the bamboo fiber mix was a big benefit for me (fights mold/bad smells on the towel)... so I decided to roll the dice and buy 2 towels and try them out.WOW. First off... can these towels be any softer?! Soft, plush, luxurious, one towel will dry every square inch of your body including all your hair, dry quickly when hung, no issues with the typical funky towel smell (I wash towels once a week)... they're just great towels! I've seen some people on here complain about the colors fading over time. I can't comment on that issue being I ordered plain white towels.Great price, amazing towel.... can't lose!

However, I think that to someone who is not a fairly regular practitioner of zen meditation it may seem very strange. For those who DO practice zazen on a regular basis, this book has a lot to offer. It's a very pleasant, quasi-poetic extended meditation on many topics. Don't want to try to pigeonhole it much beyond that.

But after 4 chapters, I was bothered by the prevelant prejudice slurs - racial, social, physical. Even the \\"hero\\" makes these comments about a black baby, overweight man, pregant woman, and people who \\"wear white shoes after Labor Day\\". These comments combined with the lack of character development and predictable events made the book nearly impossible to finish.Granted the end was a mild surprise but after they tested everybody's DNA for the countless time and the court battle was 50 pages too long, I just didn't care anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It","review":"I don't understand the positive reviews for this book.

Total waste of money. Wouldn't cut even the smallest of branches under 1/2''. Would not recommend this piece of junk to anyone. The pole saw works well for the money.

Indians, famous outlaws, and banditos were everyday challenges. Gillett, while not a trained writer, was a vivid observer of his world. A terrific chronicler of life on the frontier of Texas in the 1870s.

About half way through the book I began to wonder when he was going to present some \\"blockbuster\\" pearls of wisom. It was then that I began to realize the Dell model was nothing more than a highly developed \\"kiretsu\\" style organization (on the supply side). Interestingly, he seemed to have developed this style on his own, which, in and of itself was pretty impressive. His basic business philosophy of giving the customer exactly what they want, when they want it and at a competitive price is no great message. The true message he delivers is, always always follow the basic principals, never be afraid to change and execute at the highest level possible. Pretty good book for reinforcing the basics but I think that most people with a graduate degree may get a little bored if they are looking for something \\"new\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"the man, the company, the stock, the shareholder, nature","review":"Firstly, the person who gave this book one star is probably a sad shareholder of Compaq or another PC maker. Dell has done what few ever do in their lifetime: revolutionize the way business is done. He has created a company that has forced not only members of the PC industry to change, but MANY industries. The stock price over the past 10 years reflects performance and as a confident shareholder, I remain bullish. In case anyone wants to read a great article, go to your local library and check out the Harvard Business Review March-April issue 1998 and you can read McKinsey's #1 ranked article for all of 1998 on Dell.Remember one thing, NATURE IS ALWAYS CORRECT and once Dell continues to perform, it's only natural that shareholders and business on the whole will be more successful.Cheers Victor"},{"rating":"2","title":"His 'Touches' leaves the competion in 'Crutches'.","review":"After I finished reading, cracked a Dom P, and sparked a Cuban cigar. I leaned back on my chair, and looked to the sky. Suddenly Micheal Dell's face appeared. He said: \\"Marten, you were destined to Revolutionize the Face of U.S\\".I smiled contently. Knowing what I must do. Not for the love of money, but for the passion that was instilled within me.The book gave a good overview on the company Dell, sadly it didn't give any top secrets , or anything new.I've been watching Dell since Day 1, and as CEO: he has built himself a superb international 'Business System'.If any CEO is reading this.....feel free to become a mentor to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING at the very best","review":"I really was expecting an Andy Grove's \\"only the paranoid survive\\" and was dissappointed that it was so dry and internal looking , with all the PR fluff and lack of personal perspective.Too narrative ...not enough focus on the external environment, what the market was doing at all those moments, how competitors tried to react, all the decisions and factors considered at various inflection points etc...Just a bunch of PR. Personally its a shame since its THE greatest success story ever, yet it lacks any juice for the million Dell fans. If the entire company functions like this with strong internal focus and execution I doubt this army of parochial worker ants , as successful as they have been, will be able to survive the impending sea of change he talks of in his book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading, but don't expect a business plan in it.","review":"While it can be argued that this book serves as a promotional piece both for Mr. Dell and his company (which isn't a bad and unnexpected thing after all), there's real knowledge to be gained from it. If only Dell Computers human resources is run like the way he describes in part II of the book, his company is light-years ahead from the competition just by using a really down to Earth strategy. Add the kind of efficiency and speed they achieved, and you've got a \\"Star Wars Episode I: TPM\\" company against \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" competition (sorry couldn't resist, I'm in a SW mood eheh).

But this was pretty light coverage of the facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality control","review":"In the copy I bought, one of the signatures (pp. 173-204) was bound upside down. Not sure if this makes the book a collector's item, but I sent it to the publisher for a replacement. Normally I would not mention this in a review, since it is obviously not Michael Dell's fault, but a major theme of his book is how Dell maintains quality control, especially from suppliers of subsystems that have the Dell name on them but otherwise do not go through Dell's physical hands. So it is relevant after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Blase' - Dry Corporate material written for PR purposes","review":"90% of this book discusses the successes of Dell Computer and the lessons learned along the way. It was almost as if it was a 200 page advertisement written by a PR firm in the form of a book.There is almost nothing into the personal side of what he did, the ups, downs, thoughts, emotions of what he experienced along the way to building a huge company from virtually nothing.It is difficult for me to understand how one could get an \\"inside \\" view from this book.

This falsely restricts creativity.He is by far, in the realm of notority with: Abraham Lincoln -Fameous Laywer- NO Law School Thomas Edison; Mark Twain; Charles Dickens never finished Grade school.This is a good \\"101 guideline\\" to how a man created a Status; Not the Status a man."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book about one thing RESULTS!","review":"Dell's book isn't motivation it simply is cold hard basic know how with the one thing that counts in business - Results.

This man is absolutely incredible!!What is really interesting is that you would expect these accomplishments from a man well into his 50's or 60's. Mike is only in his 30's. The kid is just getting warmed up.Direct from Dell is a living testimony of the American Free Enterprise system in action.Mike Dell; the man who set his goals high and then surpassed them in record breaking time.This book is a great read.

He responses them saying that the legislation is not the tool to reconstruct the people and the economical relationships between them, but it is the method to explain the irrationally and naturally developping law more clearly. Additionally he argues the cartesian method of thinking because of its results which refuse the social evolution. Therefore Hayek finds the philosophical base of totalitarian thought in the belief that \\"we can create the welfare with law, if we arrange it logically\\". That's why he calls every kind of totalitarian thought as \\"constructive cartesian rationalism\\", because all of them want to reform the whole world, law and order from the beginning to realize their specific outcome like in DesCartes' method.

It's just not as incredible as Mark II. Nonetheless, it is an engaging collection, not only from a conceptual standpoint but also in terms of its advanced use of electronics. I most certainly recommend it.Actually, one of the things I was disappointed with is the fact that the lyrics appear in English only.

This one, III, is moodier and emphasizes the more modern aspects of their sound moreso than on Mark II, but still mesmorizes, especially with singer Ulla Bendixsen's breathy vocal stylings. You almost forget the lyrics aren't even in English as the soundscapes that the band creates wash over you.The best tracks include: Roselil Rose, Lordagskvaeld, Volven, Ramund, and Tor af Hafsgaard. A couple of the slower tracks verge on hip/pop, but the band maintains their dark mood throughout, ensuring that the album doesn't drift too far from center while still keeping it all accessible.Even if the album on the whole is not quite as good as Mark II, it is still a wonderful disc and shows that Sorten Muld hasn't slumped."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great","review":"Great fron cover an internal cover, but that is where all the fun stops with this book, unfortunately.

At 14 pounds, it is heavy and built to last. He has now happily started juicing his fourth box of oranges. He also used this juicer on the pomegranites they grow and it worked beautifully.

The heavy parts don't fit together well, and the juicer is wobbly and unstable, despite it's heaviness. I am sending this back without using it once, becuase there's no way to adjust the parts, and it's too unstable to use as is. Also, it really is almost impossible to pick up and move, due to the weight, without straining your back. Finally, like a reviewer of the orange-x large-size juicer, I find the industrial chemical smell of the parts unpleasant, and the enamel paint is chipped and scratched in many places.

We have had several juicers (manual and electric). This is the one that really works. Just slice the orange, lemon, lime or small grapefruit and gently pull on the handle.

An easy to use manual juicer. I should have realized that the handle which I thought would provide a mechanical advantage and make juicing easy was longer than the base. As a result you have to use one hand to hold the juicer to prevent it from tipping and you have to apply a lot of downward force on the handle. So much so that my wife . . . I admit she is not overly strong . . . cannot even juice an orange. I'm very disappointed and have sent the juicer back. I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I think it is unstable, prone to tip forward when you press down on the handle, requires excessive force to juice, and provides ample opportunity for you to pinch your fingers when the handle finally reaches the bottom of its swing. This is the only the second item that I have reviewed. The first was because I was very impressed with the product. This one because I think it's a bad product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sketchy Design","review":"I expected better performance for such an expensive juice press. The biggest issue has to do with the fit and finish of the cup and strainer cone. The cup and strainer cone fit very loosely and as a result they frequently separate on the upstroke because of the suction created between the press/fruit skin/strainer. A lot of time is spent reassembling the cup and cone while juicing. Also, the cup needs higher walls to contain the squirting juices. Some of the suction and squirting issues are remedied by cutting the fruit into quarters instead of halves. It works best with small to medium sized fruit (no luck with large grapefruit). Be sure to pull the lever down not toward you or the juice press will want to tip over. That being said, I will keep the juice press as it works reasonably well when the fruit is quartered and it is easy to clean. For the cost they should work out some of the bugs though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter juice","review":"This juicer is a big disappointment.The juice is consistently very bitter. To mitigate the bitterness, I place a cotton cloth over the back of the orange. Still bitter. In spite of its heft, it is still necessary to hold it down while operating. I agree with those who complain about the danger if the handle is left in the upright position - it's easy to forget to lower it. It should have some sort of catch that will not allow it to fall. This is a simple fix. It's inexcusable not to take care of this. The reamer and tray are rather flimsey and don't stay put very well.I could put up with the other design problems if the juice was good. But this juicer makes bitter juice. Period.

It spits a fine coffee dust during grinding since there's not a tight seal around the ground coffee catcher.

I have mixed feelings about this one. While there are some really nice improvements in the design e.g. better feed hopper and reduced noise, the overall quality of the materials used in production appear to be inferior to what was used to build earlier models. Specifically, the most likely components to break ie. the hopper lid and the removeable coffee bin are made of a very light plastic polymer that appears to be fragile. I believe that this grinder will have a much shorter lifecycle than its predecessors.Post Script: This grinder self-distructed in July 2010. The electrical motor just quit. The useful life on this grinder was very short as expected. I replaced it with a Black & Decker Burr grinder that is far superior in design and overall product quality at about half the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This Lapavoni grinder has been a big disappointment. While it is supposed to have 19 grinding settings (from 19 - very coarse- to 1 - very fine), the selector wheel will not turn lower than 3, producing ground coffee that is still too coarse to make really good espresso. If you want to grind coarsely ( say for a French press), the Lapavoni will produce very favorful coarsely ground coffee. One problem on all grinding settings is that the grinder tends to spew small amounts of ground coffee on your countertop while grinding.

I will probably be returning it to the importer for warranty repairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Espresso after tweaking","review":"As others have commented, this grinder does not grind fine enough for espresso out of the box. However, it is fairly easy to tweak the grinder to go finer. I can now grind fine enough to choke my espresso machine.To tweak: simply undo the three screws inside the bean hopper. Lift the top off. Adjust the setting to 1 (finest), then lift the adjusting wheel out and reposition to a new setting (I used 7). Reassemble the machine, and now you can go several steps finer. I use a setting four or five steps past 1 for my espresso.I am not a coffee snob, but I do enjoy the taste of the 25 second espresso shots that I have achieved with the tweaked grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for French Press- but otherwise okay","review":"I bought this burr grinder in order to avoid the coffee mud that you get with a French Press. Unfortunatly, I concurr with an earlier review by saying that this grinder gave me a lot more powdery grinds and hence a lot more mud than my old blade grinder did.

This grinder mixes in finely ground coffee with the course grind. I get accumulation of fine ground at top corner of the collection bin, on top of the coursely ground coffee. This makes icky coffee using a Fr. press. Whereas coffee ground in a store results in properly course ground coffee for my press.Pavoni tech support (in New York - not Italy) (okay he had a NY Italian accent and tried to be helpful), tried to convince me the problem was my choice of coffee (i.e. large coffee retailer whose roasting makes their beans too oily.

Maybe the best thing about that machine was it didn't over-promise -- the only thing you could adjust was the coarseness of the grind, and that worked fine.The La Pavoni promises to grind the \\"right amount per cup\\" and has settings for that but unfortunately those are totally fictitious! It's \\"fine to coarse\\" grind scale is equally ridiculous, all it manages to produce is coffee ground medium-fine to dust-fine. It also somehow manages to spray ground coffee on the counter.

At the time, I only used it to grind beans for a drip coffee maker. Since then, I have purchased a nice pump-driven espresso machine.

The problem seems to be the plastic parts. Very soon after I started using it, the lower plastic container devoloped cracks, which eventually broke off. I tried to patch the holes up with tape, but that was pretty ineffective. It really bothers me to have to discard a perfectly good grinder because apparently I cannot replace the broken plastic piece. I suppose that's called the 'American Way', so I'm forced to buy another grinder even tho the one I have is not actually broken. I find this to be extremely annoying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Service","review":"This grinder has been fairly good to me. However, it's very difficult to change courseness settings (espeially from course to fine, since the burrs themselves are moving against residual coffee grounds) amd I would prefer to have numbers on the dial instead of different size dots, since it's easier to remember the number, e.g. for expresso grind, than the exact size of the dot. Also the courseness setting has a tenedency to move itself over time to other settings, due to the machine's vibrations.Now I am trying to get a replacement bin for the bottom, which has been gradually chipping apart form the least 3 years. The distributor, European Gift of Mt. Vernon insists that I order from a list of retailiers, all of whom do not stock the parts.

The Amazon review also talks about grapefruits and efficiency with large quantities of fruit. I love sweet Texas grapefruit - they just barely fit, with pulp and seeds easily passing into the juice. The extractor insert doesn't lock in place and comes out after several squeezes with the rind. And only short glasses fit underneath to catch the juice. Large quantities (more than one small glass) are a continuous stop and pour and put the extractor screen back in, and then strain the end product process. If you are only doing a few oranges, than it is just ok - so call it a really expensive not very efficient orange juicer. I'm disappointed.Ps.

But the massive, retro-industrial design is not enough to earn a place on your countertop. My juicer arrived with several dings in the paint. The stainless steel dome that the fruit is crushed on had a black greasy substance on the underside. It took a lot of scouring to get rid of this material of unknown toxicity. The shape of the squeezing surfaces is conical rather than hemispherical. The effect of this is that the discarded rind always includes some unsqueezed pulp. But the worst feature of the unit I received is that two of the painted surfaces of the mechanism rub against each other during use causing a fine powder of paint flecks to fall into the juice.

Like the authors, I have experience with medical practice, as I'm a professor teaching medical students, but encountered the same frustrations that Dr. Kane describes. The lists of questions to ask and things to be cautious about at the end of each chapter are great resources for anyone who is, or may become, responsible for the care of an aging relative . Dr. Kane's sad, but engaging, story of his mother's experiences during her declining health illustrates the many difficulties in changing a system of care for the elderly that has depended too much on the good will and dedication of underpaid and often inadequately trained staff at assisted living and nursing homes.

Step no 6 provides the code to write in an HTML page. The problem is the code is wrong. What's even more funny, just next to it, in figure 6.23, there's a visual example of the code, which doesn't even match with the one in Step no 6. The worst part of all this is that not only is the code on that page wrong but also on the previous page(203). The code there also has mistakes. But if you go to Macromedia's web site, look up \\"popup window\\" and you'll find a page which tells you how to create a pop-up windows with all the correct code, and it's free.I don't understand how Macromedia can print books like this. Yes, it's a Peachpit Press book but it's printed in association with Macromedia Press. If there's one thing that a Flash book shouldn't be is be filled with mistakes when it comes to the coding.

You can spend more for a machine that measures the coffee, tamps it, pulls the water through and steams the milk for you, but you can tip the kids behind the counter at Starbucks and they'll do the same thing. Making espresso should be a little art and a little science and this machine an impeccable balance of the two. If you aren't the kind of person who takes joy in mixing the perfect martini, making a risotto that whispers with flavor, or whipping a meringue to impossibly tall peaks, this probably isn't the machine for you.The La Pavoni is for the person who will find tremendous joy in going to the lengths required to make a perfect cappuccino by hand everyday.

He didnt want to play a serious and fearless character like bruce lee's was. On the bright side this film allowed for him to become what he is today. In my opinion if you want to see a Bruce Lee style kung fu movie (aka a fearless hero who is an undefeated fighter), see the orignal Fist of Fury (called The Chinese Connection in america) and if you want to see a Jackie Chan kung fu/comedy movie (his characters are usually trouble makers that dont want to fight) i would recommend both the drunken master movies and snake in eagles shadow."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the Jackie Chan you know and love","review":"This is his first come-back film, a sequel to Bruce Lee's Fist of Fury.

Secondly, the grounds sometimes stick to the inside of the plastic hopper, which was never a problem with my old Braun. It causes a mess sometimes. But the main prblem is that I notice no difference whatsoever in the taste of my coffee versus using the old blade grinder.

It allows a variety of grinds (and I use all of them -- for a French press, Melitta pot, & electric drip). Cleaning takes about 30 seconds using a pastry brush over the sink. The unit grinds rapidly and completely, with no jams.Cons: Makes a bit of noise, but, hey, it's a GRINDER! For me, the timer is virtually useless, since I brew a strong cup and always use the maximum time. There is a very small amount of leakage around the edges while grinding, but it's easily manageable -- especially if the unit is taken apart over a sink. Really no big deal.Summary: I rated the unit 4 stars only because it's not perfect, but I think it was a good value for the price and I wouldn't hesitate to buy another. By the way, I recently saw a similar unit under a different brand (the name of which I don't recall)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grindes great coffee, makes a mess while grinding","review":"Grinds at many settings and makes terrific coffee with the proper settings.While grinding, residue, etc. flies out of the top and has to be cleaned off the counter after using.It's easy to use and grinds terrific coffee.

The first was with the shaft that goes between the motor and the attachment. I used the trimmer to clear some brush (with a blade installed) and the aluminum coupling stripped out. My fault because I was trying to do too much with it. I swapped the shaft from my old Ryobi (direct replacement) and it worked fine. The second problem was when I tried a first use of the season and it would not start. The fuel line in the tank had broken due to the exposure to the fuel.

The company (called MTD, but still uses the Troy-Bilt name) was no help at all.

I had no problems dealing with the store.

Also, I dropped my chopper containter and it's being held together with tape!

When it did work it did a decent job on the onions but it had trouble with the icecream in the milkshake. The icecream had to be melted or it wouldn't work. It acted like a car stuck on ice, it kept spinning and doing nothing. Even with liquids added it didn't improve. I wasn't able to return it because it has been a year since I purchased it.

Unfortunately, it just stopped and wouldn't work again. I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of the 200watt version, as I'd read that it ws just as good as the 400 watt and the extra wattage was not necessary. Although I have no problem with the function of the lower wattage motor, I did find that the workbowl was too small and ingredients spilled onto the countertop when I tried to put them in it. This didn't happen with the workbowl of the larger one, as the mouth is wider. This may not be a problem for other people, but I prefer the larger equipment to make things more streamlined in the kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD ITEM","review":"THIS ITEM IS GOOD.

I use it almost every day to make pureed fruits and veggies for my infant. It's also great for soups. The only thing is that if you're making something thick in the measuring cup that the blender comes with, sometimes you have to take the blender out, mix the food a little, and then continue to blend. Otherwise the stuff at the bottom gets a little liquidy, while the stuff at the top stays chunky. Overall a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elderly food masher","review":"I had this sent to my elderly mother as she is taking care of her mother. She needs to mash her mother's food now.

The mixer wasn't made to do heavy mixing but works great otherwise. A lesson learned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give the designer of this product a prize!","review":"I use this product while preparing almost every meal. The machine is really versatile - making blending, chopping and mincing of wet or dry ingredients really easy. Its a breeze when it comes to cleaning - whether by hand or in the dishwasher. The blender part of the machine is heat tolerant to the extent that you can use it directly in the pot where food is cooking. And you've got to love the compact size! Be careful of the whisk though - due to the high speed, I've sometimes had ingredients spilling out of my mixing bowls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful but...","review":"You can read the pro from other reviewers. The con about this gadget is that the handle gets hot within 30 sec of used, but not to the point being burned. Braun should have included an on/off button. It is very tiresome to have to constantly press the button. The button on mine has to press firmly. The reason I gave One star is because it stop working less than 3 hours of total used (about 1 month).Don't get me wrong this is an awesome product when it worked. I will be ordering their professional version (MR5550MBC-HC) and hope it's more reliable. This time I'll remember to save the receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't ask it to work too hard","review":"I have owned two of these over the past two years or so, and both died. The gear that the motor drives is plastic, but the blade shaft this gear drives is metal. If what you're mixing is too heavy or thick, the blade shaft will start to strip the teeth on the plastic drive gear, eventually stripping it so the motor won't drive the blade anymore.The second one I had just died while I was mixing a smoothie. It just started slowing down, then died, accompanied by a faint burning smell. I think I burned out the motor on this one.If you're just mixing protein drinks and they're not too thick, your might be OK. I made mine very thick and I added ice. Ice does not make it happy.In general, I'm not impressed by the construction and the fact that I've had two of these fail. I won't buy another Braun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy little gadget!","review":"Cleans up easily (most parts go in the dishwasher).

The chopper portion of it is okay but I found it difficult to chop vegetables the way I wanted it. You have to cut up the vegetables beforehand and then only put a small amount in the chopper for it to work properly. Other than that, I've had it for several months now and it is working great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good hand blender, good price.","review":"Works great, mounts on wall nicely. I docked it a star because it is messy, I have to hold a towel over bowls or cups so it doesn't splash everywhere,,also the beater attachment is long and messy and will splash. It takes awhile getting used to so you don't make a huge mess. It has a hard time chopping up ice, but does it. This works best in a long, tall container, if you prepare in bowls, it's messy. And when you first use the chopper, watch out for plastic peices that you will accidentlly chop up, it's a packaging that covers the blades inside the chopper/dicer attachment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for quick mixing, chopping, whipping and blending!","review":"I had an earlier model of this mixer that I had to replace (not any fault of the mixer - I had a fire in my house) and ordered this hand blender. Braun improved this hand tool by having all tools detach from the motor handle - original design had a blender which would fit into other attachments. Everything but the handle can go into the dishwasher. I really like this for quick blending, chopping or mixing - especially when I make pea soup in my crockpot - I can mush up those peas and vegies in nothing flat! I did have a splatter accident when I lifted the blender out of the bowl one time, but if you are paying attention, you shouldn't have a problem. Great alternative to a large food processor or a two blade hand mixer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Execellent blender","review":"this is the best hand blender, i used it yesterday and it chopped chillies like in few seconds, the blade of the chopper is very sharp and the whole assembly is very easy to use and clean, each part can be separated for cleaning.a very good product for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for the things I do in the kitchen","review":"This blender was exacty what I was looking for.

I was trying to chop raisins (bad idea, however no word about that in the instructions... they tell you to not chop cheese, but nuts are said to be OK) and after a couple of seconds, a spark came out of the button where I was holding the blender(since you need to press the button to have it work, you have to hold it there).If you do not stress this thing too much, it might be useful, however know you cannot rely on it -- it could break at any given time that it decides a job is too hard for it.

It will not do ice cubes and frozen strawberries are a little challenging, but not impossible.The chopper attachment is just as great-you will never need to pull out your food processer for small jobs again. Although you do have to observe the max capacity marker, as my husband found out.The whisk attachment is pretty useless though, but only because it spins so fast that it flings whatever you are whisking right up out of the container. Also, instant pudding takes 2 cups of milk and the container that comes with it has a 2 cup capacity, so that is out of the question.Over all- it is a fantastic tool and eminently useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Multi Kitchen Tool","review":"This is a great product, does exactly what it says it will and great power.I highly recommend it if you use powder drink mixes and chop herbs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"weak and flimsy","review":"I had the earlier design of this model for 15 years before it died.

Our first one served us well for years. We used it for chopping onions, nuts, and sometimes to ground meat. We used it for years until the motor died. I've decided to purchase another one strictly for pureeing baby food. I boiled yams, apples, and green peas before I make a puree. It worked really well. However, after 4-6 uses, the motor died. I called up Braun Customer Service and I was told that they'll send me a return stamp and I am hoping I'll get a replacement as I just bought it last 13 Sept. It's probably an isolated case. I'll wait for the replacement and hopefully we get to use it for years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes very little space and very useful","review":"This is a very functional product from Braun and offers the conveniences of chopping, whisking and blending.

My friend recommended this one and said she'd had it for over a year with no problems.I mostly use it to make smoothies and make puree style soups (e.g. pumpkin). The main blender piece works great, is super easy to clean, and the motor is good enough to hack up the frozen mangoes for my morning smoothies. I don't use all the extras.

Back then, it only came with two attachments... the hand blender and food processor. Both work great.I've used this for many things. It's wonderful when making mashed potatoes, and saves me a ton of effort when making pumpkin pies from fresh pumpkin. Rather than shoving all of the pumpkin through a strainer, I just puree it with my Braun hand blender. Everything comes out without lumps and to my desired consistency.Moreover, it is extremely easy to clean. Just detatch the hand blender and rinse it in the sink, or even throw it in the dishwasher!I would recommend this for anyone who has frequent need for pureed and chopped foods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to get job done","review":"I bought this one for my wife to prepare baby food.

I gave this movie a 1 star rating. I bought this movie out of curiosity and was expecting something a little more tam","review":"I gave this movie a 1 star rating. I bought this movie out of curiosity and was expecting something a little more tame. The story itself wasn't bad but, (even though the camera angles leave it to your imagination) the sex scenes are extreme! The women in this movie are treated like objects and are beaten unmercifully and are forced into extremely painful sexual acts. In a couple of scenes, I would say the woman was raped.If you are attracted to Japanese women this movie won’t disappoint you, but as I said, in this movie they are objects and I found this movie’s subject matter distasteful!This movie wasn’t to my taste, but if you are into extreme hardcore porn, this movie might be more to your liking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Quality; Computer generated music","review":"Would not recommend buying. Computer generated bagpipe music. Very flat, not of good quality.
