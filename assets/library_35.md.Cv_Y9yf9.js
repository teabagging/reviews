Many of the reviews here said that it was too depressing. While many of the events that happened to the characters could certainly be deemed depressing, for some reason I didn't find it so. This book is very beautifully written, and I found myself devouring every word, unable to put it down. The author really depicts \\"the fine balance between hope and despair\\" in his story."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most depressing books that I have read","review":"This is one of the most depressing books that I have read in a long long time. The main characters in this story go though one trouble after another for seemingly no reason. In fact they hardly have anything good going for them. Surprisingly they behave really well for their circumstances.People unfamiliar with India may believe that this is the norm, which isn't true. This is a fictious story created by amalgamating the worst conditions possible for different people into the lives of all the characters of this book.The story about the beggar master having a step brother is one of the most dramatic fiction created to bring out some more NEGATIVITY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent !","review":"This is one of the best books I have read. Mistry has proved to be a master story teller. For his characters, life is a fine balance between hope and despair. Only one of the characters, Maneck couldn't maintain that balance. But the story is masterfully narrated. This book reminded me of other great books like \\"One hundred years of solitude\\" by Gabriel Garcia Marquez and \\"The good earth\\" by Pearl S. Buck because it captures the lives, culture, political climate etc. in all its richness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, come on!","review":"I obviously missed the point of A Fine Balance. Other readers here have raved about how this novel captures \\"that fine balance between hope and sorrow,\\" etc., but what I read was an incredibly depressing story about a few characters with hopeless lives who are subject to endless acts of pain. In the beginning it wasn't so bad -- I thought, \\"Okay, here are a few nasty things that these characters have to deal with. It's all part of the character and plot development.\\" But IT NEVER ENDS, and eventually any progress that the characters or the story actually achieve comes crumbling down under the weight of the ridiculous events that the characters are made to endure. Near the end, I started skipping the acts of torture out of sheer annoyance. I wish someone would enlighten me about what really makes this book so wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the honesty portrayed in this book. I felt for the characters. I enjoyed the life they all shared and felt educated after reading it. I honestly knew nothing of this culture prior to reading it and feel differently now that I've completed it. I highly recommend this book if you enjoy reading about different cultures. The only thing I can say is it was not necessarily the best book to read on my vacation on the beach in Antigua."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dickensian","review":"Contrary to other people's beliefs, this book is easy to turn: sure the details can be gruesome, or a little hard to stomach (it's probably the best way to experience the sounds, sights and smells of the slums of India short of actually going), but the way it is written is exquisite: Mistry is a brilliant writer, and his prose is at once evocative and expressive. Read it for the inherent humanity that underlines every terrible event, and they way it's all brought together. You will love this book, even if you have trouble stomaching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardship and Humor in India","review":"This novel tells the story of how four individuals came to live together in a very cramped apartment in India. The author is very descriptive about the extreme hardships and poverty, but there is also a lot of light-hearted humor. I really felt like I came to know the personalities well (especially Om, yaar). However, I felt that Maneck was the weak link in this 600 page novel. When I was reading about Maneck, I felt the book dragged on a bit. I was also very disappointed with his ending in the book. This book almost needed a glossary to explain terms one wouldn't know if they haven't lived in India. (various castes, etc.) If you are an Oprah fan, looking for something light, with romance or a battered woman story - this is not the book for you! It is the men that take the beatings in this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleeping Gem.","review":"I read this story about 5 years ago and was completely enraptured. It is very long. I felt like I was in India. I could almost smell the smells, and taste the foods described in the book. The characters are so real they reminded me of old friends. It is a great historical novel and teaches many things about the psychology and consequences of colonialism. Rohinton Rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Midnight's Children by Rushdie","review":"if you want to read an exceptional book saying the same things as this one but MUCH, MUCH better.Mistry should be embarrassed to be writing, or rather re-writing, Midnight's Children with less spark, creativity, and far less to actually say. It is unoriginal!Although this book is good, I frankly couldn't get past that I had JUST read the Rushdie previous to this book and felt like Mistry should have been chastized rather than lauded for putting this book out.Oprah should pick up the Rushdie too."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried--I really, really tried","review":"I had a vague idea of what this book was about when I first started. But I had heard such wonderful things that I decided to give it a shot.After several agonizing weeks of pushing myself to keep on going, I quit halfway through. I think the author's intention was good. But the writing style was hard to follow, and included so much extraneous information that it was hard to keep the characters straight. The author wrote extensively on the history of so many character's lives that they began to blend together. What I think would have been an amazing story about the human spirit got lost in tedious writing and unnecessary information."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF YOU LIKE READING ABOUT MUTILATION,","review":"starvation, hopelessness, mistreatment, and abuse, then you will love this book. It makes Les Miserables seem light and fun.I appreciated the skillful writing and learned a lot about India but towards the end of the book, I was thinking to myself, what the hec else can happen to these people?? And, sure enough, worse things kept coming. Became rather funny in a sick way."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of 600 pages !!","review":"This is by far the worst book i have ever read !! I would never compare this to the \\"Kite Runner\\" because that book was a wonderful journey for me. But this was a series of \\"3 steps forward, 4 steps backward\\" with every character ! And never did any of the character reach any of their goals or dreams....how depressing !! What a waste of time... I kept hopeful throughout the book that in the end they all would be fortunate enough to rise above all the tragedies in their life and not one of them ever did...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbalanced","review":"As I waded through page after page after page, I began to think of a group of Hollywood scriptwriters sitting around a table. Each is trying to top the other by dreaming up more outlandish and depressing situations for his/her characters.\\"A Fine Balance\\" is totally depressing, one tragedy after another all the way to the last page (601). By the end of the book, I was convinced I was reading the screenwriters' list crammed into a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow and depressing","review":"I thought this book was terrible. I read maybe the first 100 pages and had to force myself to read that far. My friend finished it and said the end was just as slow as the beginning. Basically a lot of terribly depressing things happen, with no bright or meaningful moments to draw you into the characters. It is not worth reading at all. If you want a book about India that is awesome read \\"Necter in a Sieve\\". Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, education, and disturbing","review":"On countless occasions since finishing this book, I've told people about this book and the lives these characters lived in India - in 1975! I had to keep reminding myself that, while I was living the life of a teenager in rural America, there were people living this life, under these conditions, on the same Earth! I became intrigued and got caught up in the characters - their triumphs, their sorrows, their simple pleasures, and their suffering. I would love to talk to someone else who has read it, but have found it difficult to recommend this book to my friends. Most of us live hectic lives and, when we do get a chance to relax and read, this is not the \\"recreational\\" reading we think we want. Nonetheless, I'm richer for having read it - and appreciate Oprah and her bookclub for bringing it to my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"Even if you think you know a lot about India's caste system, \\"A Fine Balance\\" will tear at your heart like no other. I have never ever read a book where I was too afraid to turn the page until I read this. I was fearful that if I turned the page, the character(s) would, yet again, encounter misfortune.The story revolves around 2 untouchables, a student and a widow and how in 1970's India, their lives are intertwined. In the menagerie of the times, they play out their days. Though their sufferings are numerous, their joys are meaningful. And what struck me most is despite their despair, they can still express compassion for their fellowmen.If you want to read about a different culture played out in modern history, read this. It is absorbing and thought-provoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star might be harsh, but...","review":"I feel that I need to balance the scale a bit (There are way too many 5-star ratings for this book!). Mistry is a fine writer who creates memorable characters with great depth...however, this book left me utterly numb. I've read books about sad, depressing subjects before (i.e., other Oprah books), but Mistry definitely takes the prize. As one reviewer puts it \\"...what the hec else can happen to these people?? And, sure enough, worse things kept coming. Became rather funny in a sick way.\\" This is absolutely my thought. I can remember coming to work while reading this book and telling my officemate the latest misery. He was so amused that to this day he still asks me about the beggarmaster. I'm amazed to see that so many people enjoyed this book. To each their own...."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Fine Balance Here","review":"Mistry's ability to interweave several heart-breaking stories in detail is prodigious. However, looking for balance is a relentless grind -- this novel is entirely too long, depressing and bereft of hope, despite the 'fine balance' between hope and despair it purports to represent. The concluding chapters are especially contrived and frankly, unbelievable. The story grinds to a halt in much the same inexcusable way as A Man in Full, leaving this reader especially vexed at wasting so much time reading it. The attempt to associate this tale with Balzac's Pere Goriot is hubristic at worst, wishful thinking at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a plot?","review":"I give this book 2 stars only because the author has some skills in the craft of writing (but not as a novelist. There is no plot, no theme, no message (unless you count hopelessness). The book is depressing, miserable and endless. It is also unecessarily scatological and gross. Believe me I can read ugly and miserable as well as the next reader if there is some point to it but I sure couldn't find it. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"flat and didactic","review":"\\"exotic\\" location, the terribly suffering poor, the conniving rich... sounds like mistry really hit the jackpot in terms of stirring the hearts of western readers. this book is a complete flop - the story is flat, the characters are completely under-developed and it's page over page of didactic diatribes about the plight of the untouchables. it's neither art nor entertainment. do yourself a favor and pick up rushdie instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistry has a lot to learn","review":"I agree with the reader who offered \\"Nectar In A Sieve\\" as an antidote to this book. Sad, but poetically written. About F.B., I disliked the writing, especially...Is it really necessary to compare someone's necktie to a samosa just because it is a book about India? The book could have been trimmed by at least 200 pages. The story would probably make a passable screenplay.Also look at R.K. Narayan's novel, The Guide, which puts Mistry and those like him, to shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long boring soap opera.","review":"For people who buy their books by the pound. After 140 pages, I found no wit or wisdom at all. Reviews about it being like Tolstoy, Dickens, or 19th century novels must be just talking about its length.I will be more careful about my next from Oprah's Picks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling read - don't let its length put you off","review":"A long book, and certainly not \\"light\\" reading, it's a book where the characters really get under your skin. I found myself reading this book with my breakfast before I went to work to find out what would happen. I was sorely disappointed by the characters' sad endings, but the humor and ultimate grace and humanity showed by the characters give some hope. It reminds us all of the unfathomable circumstances that many people's lives contain, and not just in faraway countries. Hightly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrelenting Horror","review":"This is a wonderfully written book. I have learnt so much about India from it but have overwhelmed with the unrelenting horror of the lives of the main characters.

Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch.","review":"Yes, yes, it is brilliantly witten but the outcomes of the characters absolutely destroyed me. Not a happy ending to speak of...And you become so immersed in the characters. You care so deeply about what happens to them that when their lives come to a conclusion, it feels as though you are suffering as they suffer. And that's just not fair. It's too brutal, devoid of hope, leaves you in utter despair. I sponsor 4 children through World Vision India and this book made me want to fly there immediately and retrieve them all, families included. The horrible thing is, this book is the truth about India. It's what the people have been and are dealing with, trying to live through, it's all true.So if this book makes you want to do something, then by all means do it. Even if that means supporting one child through World Vision India. This book served as a further call to action as no human being should ever be faced with such destruction and indignation. Bless all sentient beings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing characters","review":"I don't like it when books rely on anthropological details to provide interest -- just the different customs of a place (India) and the constraints placed on characters' lives is not enough to make a book interesting, imo. I need to really see inside the characters and see how their lives and growth are informed and constrained by what their situations provide and do not provide, and I didn't feel this here. These characters were not much better than types to me, the penny-pinching small business owner, e.g."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Until I read this book I didnt realize how much I missed descriptive writing. Even though it was a long book I really hated for it to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Balance...","review":"The character plights are thought provoking. The characters from different castes and how they interact with each other will rouse you. It makes you feel grateful for the state of the US government, although we often complain about it. Our worst fears are revealed in this book, as we observe the adventures and survival strategies of these people. Perhaps, because we know that although the story may be fictional, the plights are not. You'll enjoy the relationship between Karma, and how it relates to fate. The story is provocative, sad, and exceptional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisitely told","review":"Mistry is truly a storytelling genius. I was completely engaged from the very beginning and was never let down. The characters are interesting and their story is so unique, so heartwrenching, and such an example of what human beings are capable of -- good and bad that I was sorry to see this long book end.Don't read this if you are really squeamish, because you will be upset. But highly recommended for those who love a good story told by a master."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding India","review":"This is a really good and well written book aboutIndia. Anyone who is going to travel to India should read itin order to understand the life and customs ofHindu families in the cities and and rural countryside of India,"},{"rating":"2","title":"An antidote to thinking everything will work out","review":"As I came closer and closer to the end of this book I read slower and slower. The four main characters, Dina, Maneck, Om and Ishvar had a hold on me and I didn't want them to let go. I wanted Dina to be happy, Om to get married, Ishvar and Dina to build on their growing friendship, and Maneck to do well in school and work. But, things don't always work out. In this book, it seems nothing works out. Four people lost at the bottom of a corrupt society and dysfunctional government didn't have a chance.A Fine Balance reads well. It has the feel of a 19th century family novel, Tolstoy without the sermon. Get a good glass of wine (or a case), a comfortable chair, and enjoy a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Balance","review":"Wonderfully written, A Fine Balance is one of the best books Ive read this year. In an unnamed city by the sea, four peoples lives become entwined together for better or for worse. These four have different backgrounds and different futures, however at this short time in their lives they are bound together out of necessity.Rohinton Mistry shows the stark reality of their struggles to try and make a life for themselves. Often quite depressing, this novel also allows you to share in the small victories that are won.With wonderful characters and superb writing, this book reads quickly dispite the high page count."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, intense, funny and ultimately depressing..","review":"I finish this book overwhelmed by wonderful writing about how misfits in several castes in India fare in their lives. The writing is excellent and stories woven intricately despite the tragic and depressing tone. It is Dickensian in nature but more riveting and when I finished I just felt overwhelmed by sadness and am planning on discussing this with my Indian friends--is it REALLY like that? REALLY?Not uplifting but certainly enlightening and a great read. Could hardly put it down. This is a book which you do not forget or dismiss."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece in many dimensions","review":"This book is a true masterpiece. A greatly told-story, a fabulous exposure to life and culture in India and a saddening and realistic exposure to the tragic turns of life for many of its citizens. I was fascinated by the historic perspective, the clarity of the descriptions and the stressful, sometimes desperate lives of its main characters. The book is hard to take and it affects the reader tremendously. So, it may take a while to finish it but every word is worth the agony of watching the characters' lives unfold the way they did. Lastly, Mistry's use of humor in the midst of such wretched situations is truly superb. I have rarely read a book that accomplishes so much in so many fronts. Unforgettable and a sad awakening to the reality of millions of citizens in India."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Mystery: Mistry Writes Best Novel of the '90s","review":"Maybe I'm just a sucker for the exotic, but somehow familiar, feel of India--two novels about India appear on my Top 5 list, this one and The Raj Quartet. \\"A Fine Balance\\" moves ahead from \\"Raj\\" by about 30 years to the Indira Gandhi era of the mid-70s. Mistry, who lived in India as a youth before emigrating to Canada, describes the breadth of the country (at least of its middle class and poor), both geographically and demographically, with a loving attention to detail and respect for his characters, no matter how difficult or ironic their fates seem to be. The beggar's funeral that occurs late in the book is one of the most powerful expressions of human dignity that I've ever read. A fine balance refers to the balance between hope and despair, something that everyday Indians have to deal with on an everyday basis. Highest possible recommendation to the best book I've read that was written in the '90s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book is an compelling tale of poverty in India during the mid 1970's.This is a long read, but not boring. There is enough detail to keep track of the story and there is no overload on unnecessary information.The characters are easy to like or hate and the lives are as incredible or mundane as anyone you may pass on the street.One thing I did not realize until finishing this book is that many of the events that take place are true, such as the prime minister being murdered by her body guards. This only adds to the richness of the story... knowing that many of the hardships likely happened to millions of people.A sad story, but there are many moments of small joys. It is amazing that some people can find hope in such miserable conditions. This is a wonderful novel and I recommend it to anyone, especially those who may assume that all homeless persons are just lazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart wrenching but important","review":"This is an incredibly vivid story of the harsh reality of India during Indira Ghandi's \\"State of Internal Emergency\\" in the mid 1970s. The author is incredibly talented and draws you in emotionally to understand things like the caste system and the corruption that was so rampant during this time period.I wouldn't say I \\"enjoyed\\" this book because it was absolutely heartbreaking and bleak. Definitely not a \\"feel good\\" book... but important - so I am glad that I read it.This book also made me think a lot about issues like overpopulation and poverty. There are no simple answers. Knocking down slum areas to beautify an area may sound good but where are the people supposed to go to? Forced sterilization as a means to control the population was India's answer to a huge problem but it just isn't that black and white. This heart-wrenching story gives one much to ponder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragedy, Tragedy, Tragedy","review":"This book is so tragegic, it is depressing. One unspeakable tragedy follows another this entire book, where's the happiness? The happiness described in this book is when you are not enduring an unimaginable tragedy. You can not imagine how bad these characters lives are until you read this book. And you think, well now that they have all had such hardship and struggle, now there will be a little happiness, a little hope for things to come, NO- in this book, more tragedy. Although it is well written, with beautiful characters, it overwelms you with heartache, to the point where you can feel no more pain for these characters. You have no hope for them and your at a loss of how to feel when faced with more tragedy, to the point where I am numb from it. I wanted to finish this book to end the suffering of all of the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply \\"unputdownable","review":"The one thing that strikes most while reading this book is the reality of everything - the characters, the situations presented, etc. I could not stop reading this book once i started it. The description of every scene is very vivid and you feel that you are actually seeing the scene / situation enacted for you as a private performance! One of the best books i have read in recent years."},{"rating":"1","title":"good read but depressing","review":"It is certainly a good read. At the same time, it stereotypes the squalor and poverty of India.Although technically well written, I will never read it again. Nothing good can ever happen to the characters.

It is the most depressing book I read on India so far and I read quite a few."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murphy's Law","review":"This book is the epitome of Murphy's Law- what can go wrong, will go wrong. It is so needlessly depressing. I am not one to only read books that are filled with sunshine and rainbows, but like many other reviewers have said, the problems faced by the characters in this book are SO numerous that as I read it, I became jaded. This book exhausted and numbed me and towards the end, the misfortunes of the characters had no affect on me.I do feel like the author stereotyped India and Indian citizens to some degree. I feel like non Indians or non South Asians who read this book will walk away with an image of India that is not particularly accurate.While his writing style is quite good, it gets a bit claustrophobic. Overall, the depression just makes it unbelievable. I did not enjoy this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird, Different, Excellent ending","review":"This book was weird while reading it. I love being exposed to new things but...this was a little strange. However, I still think about things in this book, just little things that happened during the book's journey pop into my mind at the strangest moments. While reading this book I could just see the characters climbing up the hill, only to slide back down, but they kept getting back up to climb the hill again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Written, Horribly Depressing","review":"Read this book if you believe that great literature must be depressing. Rohinton Mistry, as others here have pointed out, is certainly a capable author. However I personally do not subscribe to the literary ideal that great literature must be a study in the misery of human despair. That is a theme accomplished with vigor in this novel. A Fine Balance is an informative piece on a period of terrible human tragedy and it is equally morbid and depressing. With each horrible misfortune suffered by each of the characters you will find yourself reading onward in hope of some resolution but you will be disappointed, there is none. Mistry's character Maneck often laments that everything ends badly. For the characters in this novel everything does indeed end badly, don't waste your time finding out how."},{"rating":"2","title":"compare to Tolstoy","review":"Probably the finest novel in English published in the 1990s. A pickup \\"family\\" of four strangers weathers Bombay in the 1970s as best it can."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Balance","review":"This is absolutely the best book I have ever read. It is very well written and has memorable character with whom I became very close to. This book has left quite an impression on me with a new understanding of life in a third world country and how cruel life can be. My only complaint is that it seems as though Rohinton has speed through the ending and lacked the increadable detail that was through out the rest of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting-- this one will stick with you","review":"This is a beautiful, magical, haunting book. It's not an easy read, so be prepared to spend time with it. Mistry's descriptions, plot, and characters are deep and complex. It's worth every minute, though- by the time you're finished you'll have learned quite a bit about Indian culture and yourself, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable and powerful","review":"I read A Fine Balance 4 or 5 years ago and have recommended it to many people. It has a dark Dickensian quality that weighs on my heart and makes this book unforgettable. The characters are vivid and well drawn, and their plight is both horrific and moving. Mistry has made human faces that tell the story behind the political events of this period. As with Beloved by Toni Morrison, the effect of A Fine Balance is to enrich and sear you forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before Slumdog, Before Oprah had a book club...this book existed.","review":"Some may say this is not possible-it's too difficult to believe to be credible. Believe you me, it is real, so real and written so beautifully it will make you cry. You will become totally invested in these characters. You will cheer for them, laugh with them and hope (against all odds) for them. It's like a great first love. You will love it all and bemoan the end. It will shock you that you came to love these characters so much and now the book is over as you sit, stunned, staring at it in your hands. And, you wouldn't take back a minute of it! I'm thrilled Oprah chose this book so it is exposed to more people."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Depressingly Good Book I've Read in Years","review":"I think the title to my review says it all. I had the book on my shelf for quite some time; I was not sure that a book about India in the 1970's was going to be interesting. But once I picked it up, it was hard to put it down. The lives of the characters are richly detailed, their struggles heartfelt and at times unbelievable. This book shows how human beings can be the cruelest species on Earth, and how kind we can be as well. It's hard to believe what these characters endured could really be based on reality, but I imagine that it's not far off. It's an eye opening novel. You will enjoy the characters and feel greatly for them. Don't skip this book, but make sure your Paxil or Prozac has kicked in first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long-winded and unconvincing","review":"Having thoroughly enjoyed Mistry's book of short stories, I was expecting a similar treat when I bought this book. Mistry should stick to stories about Parsi communities in Bombay--there he is most convincing, irrepresible, humane and enjoyable. The portraits of the 2 tailors challenge credulity, as does the plot structure; the \\"lower castes\\" are basic stereotypes. Since the novel takes about 150 pages (Section XIII) to wind down without any major revelations or denouements, it becomes an anti-climactic tedium."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Just finished reading this book; while well-written, it has only made me hate the entire country of India and humanity in general. The theme of the book is that \\"everything ends badly\\" and this book was no exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fine balance","review":"I agree with the overwhelming consensus that this is a beautifully, masterfully written book. And I understand that it's an expose at it's heart. And I read it thoroughly and gave it my full attention, but I have one big glaring complaint: it's unrealistic. Really? All of that to those 2 people? Really? Really? Om and Ishvar are all of the poorest, most wretched of Dicken's characters rolled into 2 and never redeemed. For me, it would have had a bigger impact and a richer reception if he had spread the tragedies out a bit (or even just let up a some on the molten metals poured into ears, the deforming of children, the bodies trampled by cars and trains, the hangings and finger nail extractions). I don't need a happy ending, but I'm more revolted right now than transformed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enchanting slow moving river...","review":"Found book to hit all human emotions. Would also suggest you read Family Matters which is an outstanding novel as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reaches beyond the heart and mind to transform the soul","review":"Set in India, A Fine Balance brings together four people from varying backgrounds to create a story that transcends time and culture leaving the reader a bit more appreciative of the little things so often taken for granted. As the four main characters grow and change, lose and win, fight each other and bring joy to one another, mourn life changing losses and celebrate fleeting happiness, the reader can't help but feel a connection that makes one wonder how human beings can allow such suffering to exist in the world anywhere. Mistry's words accomplish what fiction does at it's best reaching beyond the heart and mind to transform the soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"devastating","review":"As an India afficionado, i must tell you that this is just about the best book with an Indian background I've ever read.It's written in staightforward, yet eloquent language, and gets into the Indian \\"issues\\" without shoving them down our thoats so that the reader becomes aware of the problems in this country while staying focused on the characters.The four main characters are all delightful in their own ways, and I felt acutely their hopes and dreams, and suffered with them.The climax was so devastating I found myself screaming no - no - no - and still it manages to have a happy ending. A must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This was a very good book. It took me a little bit of time to get into the book, as the characters names were a little hard to follow. But once the story got started this book was really good. It was a bit depressing though."},{"rating":"2","title":"an outstanding novel","review":"This is a beautiful novel, totally engrossing, written from a profoundly humane perspective on the human condition. Terrible things happen - that's life - but throughout Mistry is careful to tell the truth about people: that even in moments of despair and degradation, human beings differ dramatically in their ability to love, to share, to recognize others as equals. My only regret was when the novel ended - I could have kept reading forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly depressed","review":"I have just finished reading this book and had to go online to see what other's have written about this excellent novel. I am so surprised I could finish this book because I normally don't read something that is 600+ pages and secondly because I found it to be so depressing. However, in a strange way I am pleasantly depressed. You really start to realize what crybabies we can be sometimes and this book brings you right back down to reality and shows you what is important in life. The important things in life are friendship, love, and loyalty. The book slaps you in the face at the end when the one person who seems to have the most going for him decides to end his life while others less fortunate some how find a way to trudge through their harrowing existence. The book \\"A Fine Balance\\" is a must read in my opinion, it can almost be compared to a life changing experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult subject, but compelling and hard to put down.","review":"This novel is so full of sadness and injustice... but sprinkled with humor and hope. The characters became so real, I felt like I knew them.The author has a way of initially steering the reader into a dislike for the characters. Then he slowly enriches each person with a life story that brings the reader in. You gain a powerful understanding of the reasons for each person's actions and reactions to their world. Most characters end of being very likable.What a depressing story of India's horrible 1970s. I can only hope nobody really suffered as much as the characters in this sad story."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you think things aren't going well for you..READ THIS..","review":"...I had to share this with someone..my friends haven't read the book yet so I can't even begin to describe or explain the emotions that I feel with them.

It takes a great talent to craft such memorable characters, to allow us to live in their shoes, to write with such clarity and honesty about human suffering. This is simply one of the best novels I have ever read! Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching story which is beautifully written.","review":"Rohinton Mistry is a talented author.

A book doesn't have to be lighthearted and fluffy for me to enjoy it but I wanted to throw myself in front of a train after almost every chapter. I read each chapter cringing in fear of what was to come. That said, the book is extremely well-written and vividly describes life in India during historically tumultuous times. I would give the writing ***** but only gave the book ** because I just didn't enjoy the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, entertaining, and thought-provoking","review":"Oprah didn't sell this one very well when she announced it on her show. All she said was that it was set in India and that it was good. And it is, but it is so much more than that. I was sucked into it from the beginning, despite having misgivings about whether or not I wanted to read it. Many of Oprah's choices seem to be depressing, so I was wary. Although there are some awful things that happen to the characters in this book, it never left me feeling depressed. I felt for the characters, but I also felt that there was hope and happiness just around the corner. I really liked reading about the daily life of the characters. It was a glimpse into a world that I had never really thought about. It made me grateful for what I have. It made me respect how hard it is just to survive in other places in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exhilarating!!!!!!","review":"It's been almost 2 months since i read this book, but when i came across this chance to post a review, i couldn't hold back.

That song should have been permanently retired when Robert Calvert left the band. Brock's attempt at it is stunningly bad. Silver Machine is too short to be enjoyable, and Brainstorm is extremely mediocre. There are good versions of \\"Shot Down In The Night\\" and \\"Levitation\\", but there are two or three better versions of those songs available elsewhere. That leaves us with only one real reason to buy the album: Tim Blake's keyboard/synth instrumental \\"Lighthouse\\", but do you really want to buy a whole CD for one instrumental? Only buy this album if you are a completist Hawkwind collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For","review":"I bought these a while ago so this may not reflect what the vendor is currently shipping. The hooks I got were crooked and of smaller diameter steel rod than the others in my shop. And they don't have rubber tips, which would have been nice.

What a bummer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book by the Best","review":"The Warrens are the top of the field. They have done over 7000 cases including leading the ONLY investigative group to go into the Amityville Horror house.

I like it because it is the best compilation I have found of deep, proven ideas about managing people. It focuses on what really works, not just what the dot-coms did - and this is good since many of those ideas led them to die. This book is especially relevant given all that is going on in the world since 9/11.

The DVA-RAM re-recordable media is fairly esoteric, expensive and not compatible with most DVD readers. The other recoding media; DVD-R, has a hitch - after you record your 30 minutes of video, the disc needs to be \\"finalized\\" before it can be replayed in a DVD player. This takes at least 7minutes. You can't use the camera during this time and it must be plugged into its AC adapter. If \\"finalization\\" fails, you've lost all of your video on that DVD and it can't be recovered. Just happened to me so I thought I'd share the experience with others. At present, miniDV tape seems like a safer and more reliable option. This particular camera would only be useful to people who already own a device that can read 8cm DVD-RAM discs and copy them to other media."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unable to intergrate with Vista (NEW PC)","review":"The camera functioned well, but is in no way compatiable with Vista or and newer systems.

The discs are working fine and then they come up with an error and that's it. Throw away your disc and your memories. I have used two kinds of media and both have had the same problem. Go to Panasonic's support web and site and there is NOTHING. Their FAQ on camcorders is a short marketing piece, so you're basically on your own. There must be a thousand better products than this one. Don't buy it unless you don't mind losing your video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average camera in its day but now obsolete","review":"The VDR-M50 was an average camera around 2005, but is now obsolete. If you are buying this second hand then be warned that Panasonic supply no drivers or tools for Vista, so you need third party tools such as Roxio Creator to extract your movies from the DVD-RAM disks - probably not worth the trouble. Picture quality is just OK even on the highest quality setting. The VDR-M50 has some nice features including in-camera editing facilities but these are not enough to redeem it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shane is interesting as always...writing is horrible","review":"This book was a major disappointment for me, I write annoyingly. It seems the \\"author\\" had a deadline to meet and threw this trash together at the last minute, I write this time frustratingly. If you like reading an adverb at the end of every sentence this is the book for you. The author has an amazing subject to work with here and chooses to simply mail it in.

The problem is, the author (MacGowan's wife) is not a good storyteller and the format makes it impossible to get to the point of any story he tells. The writing is atrocious. I'm pretty sure the author thinks that the more adverbs you use, the better writer you are. Every other word ends in \\"-ly\\". Horrible.I could listen to Shane tell his story and understand it better than trying to follow this book, which says a lot if you've ever heard Shane MacGowan try to speak!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful!","review":"I was elated when I stumbled across this book. As a huge Shane Macgowan and The Pogues fan I could not wait to hear the insight and drunken ramblings that awaited. What a disaster of a book! The question and answer format is painful as his wife (or 1st year Enlish lit. groupie) delivers tone setting (I guess) descriptives of the scene by annoyingly ending each sentence in an adjective. Totally pompous writing. Besides the style, there is not much meat here either. The Pogues and Shane's fall out with the Pogues is virtually glossed over. Besides some the ear biting incident at the Pistols show and some often heard before recounting of life as a drunken teenage punk there is not much more. If any of you have seen the BBC documentary on Shane entitled \\"The Great Hunger\\" this book adds nothing more. Although nothing could lessen my sense of awe with Shane's songwriting, the book (like \\"The Great Hunger\\") only reinforces the pathetic nature of Shane's life outside of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock and Roll Paddy","review":"\\"A drink with Shane MacGowan\\" is a series of recorded interviews with Shane by longtime girlfriend Victoria Clarke. It is an interesting approach and Victoria gets Shane to open up in ways the media, of course, would be unable to. The beginning of the London punk scene, family, drugs/drink, racism, religion, authors, the end of the Pogues and his life's philosophy are just a few of the many topics covered by Shane and Victoria. Also included are some handwritten songs and drawings which were a cool touch and greatly contribute to the book. The only downside to this book was Victoria's overdone, heavy handed (and self complimentary) chapter introductions. But these will be easily forgiven, for this is a fascinating conversation with an amazing songwriter. Definitely recommended for any music, Pogues/Popes or punk fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful approach","review":"I quit this book less than halfway through, due to the endless inane inserts from his wife.

I understand the ability to actually try to \\"interview\\" Shane MacGowan must have been tough, even though she lived with him. It's a swirling stream of drunken conscienceness that at times made me feel like I was losing my own brain cells.

For others who want to know, it's slightly over 5\\" long. My search was for a comb that is going to last without having to replace it every year because the tines started breaking, and I believe this one is going to last.It's stainless steel and it combs through most junk dogs, even little dogs, get on their faces. Mine is a Maltese, for instance, so he's got the brown stuff from his eyes that white dogs get and this comb gets through the gunk without too much fuss, especially if I spray it slightly first to wet it a little.The Christensen line is expensive but the quality is there and the tools are made to last."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tribute to friendship for teenage girls","review":"Divided into short chapters by themes, such as best friends or sisters, this small book is a good bedside read.

A very well thought out story line with lots of details, great character development, rich in sub plots and story.This book kept me so interested that I didn't want to put it down.

I'm still thinking about characters and situations I met in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all like Gideon Oliver!","review":"I have read all of Aaron Elkin's Gideon Oliver series, and this is nothing like them at all. The character development is minimal and the forensics are ridiculously gory. This is definitely NOT a book you want to be reading while you're eating your lunch. It's much more comparable to the television series \\"Bones,\\" but with more gruesome details.I bought the second book in the series hoping it would get better, but so far, it isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as the Lindsay Chamberlain books","review":"I had waited eagerly for Ms. Connor's newest offering, but I am sorry to say that I disagree with previous reviewers. I found this book to be a disappointment. The writing just isn't as good as in her earlier books. The things that happen are too unbelievable, even for a murder mystery, and the characterizations are contradictory. I won't give anything away, but some of the main character's actions make one wonder whether she is really as smart as her forensic background and position indicate. There are several side stories going on, each of which is more boring than the last except for the titillation of possible violence. The story doesn't seem worth the 383 pages it takes to tell it. Better luck next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One plot to many ??","review":"I was a litte disappointed. This book feels as if she wrote it in a hurry and some of the plots are just unbelievable. The heroine, Dr. Diane Fallon, gets beat up two times in this novel and yet she still insists of \\"i'm going to be fine, just need a full nights sleep alone in my apartment\\". Is she Indiana Jones or what ?? Also, I could never get into the characters, they were just not outlined enough. That's what I like about Patricia Cornwell and Kathy Reich, their heroines are human and clearly outlined with emotions you can almost feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"This is the first time I have read one of the Diane Fallon books. I really enjoyed it. I will be watching for more..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedantic","review":"(spoiler alert) I found the writing in this book to be stilted. The conversations were robotic, and the plot was boring. The whole point of the forensic work performed was to solve the case of a victim whose story takes up about 1/10 of the overall plot. The rest of the mysteries are solved by one of Fallon's employees stumbling upon some important information. That's it. The 'subplot' is really the main plot, and I'll tell you, it's a snoozer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Green Tea","review":"This green tea is reasonably priced and has the smokey taste I was looking for.

This young lady feels the emotion and raw energy of every song that she belts with convincing clarity. From the amazing vocal techniques of \\"Angel\\" to the soaring balladry and emotion of \\"Angel (Acoustic Guitar Version)\\", not one track misses the mark here. I can't wait until \\"I Pray\\" blows up and takes the music world by storm. Amanda is an inspiration for all lesbians to just be themselves and let God show you the way to true happiness.

I am a TRUE music lover and I appreciate the talent and hard work of those in the industry. But to regurgitate the same tracks over and over, same message, same flow, same beat. Where is the creativity, where is the talent, how many people have wasted there money on this album? With the occasional contagious hooks (I Pray and Angel), this cd is a complete waste of time. I am all about giving EVER new artist (or so called artist) a chance, but this was overall a disappointment...Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good single......bad album","review":"I bought this album because of the songs \\"Angel\\" & \\"I Pray\\". I also bought it because I do like Amanda's voice. But the album as a whole is a dissappointment!!!All of the songs sound the same, except the last couple tracks. The problem is you don't ever get to them cause you fall asleep within the first few songs.I do believe that Amanda has talent....but the songs on this album covered it up!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL!","review":"Amanda Perez is truly a musical genius. She not only sings, raps, and plays piano; But she also produces, writes, and arranges her songs. She's a unique talent on a level all her own. This album proves it. I hope she has many more years and albums in her because she truly sets an example for female artists. \\"I Pray\\" is definitely an album you DON'T wanna sleep on!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Impressive","review":"Well I've been a fan of Amanda Perez for over a year now, and contrasting the two albums Angel and I Pray. I Pray has definetly impressed me! Her beats are very good! However, her chorus are just so plain, i feel lyrically wise, she needs to add more to her chorus, to make the songs more alive. The album is worth your money, but I just wish she would add more adlibs during her Chorus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, where's the talent?","review":"I am totally horrified that this is in the mainstream music scene. Sure, there are plenty of pop stars with minimal talent, but she tries to sound like she has talent with her attempted runs but really it just makes me cringe. There is nothing unique and exciting about her voice, it sounds like she's trying to imitate the popular sound today and she's not even close..pitch is off, tone is boring, songs are a drag. As a fan of comtemporary R&B and some pop, this is exactly what is wrong with the music industry, artists making money that have no talent and nothing new to offer. Sorry Amamda, I know you did your best but I don't think it's any where near good enough to compare with your competition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality fell apart in a few months","review":"I would not purchase this product ever again.

Morris is so convinced of the literal accuracy of the Jonah account, that he fails to see the forest for the trees.The POINT of the Jonah account has little to do with what species of fish might be able to swallow a man whole and alive and a GREAT DEAL to do with the love of God for mankind, and the desire of God to see the repentance of the wicked.

To label Monsieur McKenna a one-man-band is to miss the point... for he is no one trick pony. Nuance, Emotion and Shade are just as much his stock in trade as that Stomping Left Hand. This collection goes to prove that a cohesive concerto-like whole can be made of such disparite tunes which only share in common their titles/themes. Invidious to attempt to pick out one track, although the McKenna originals 'Shadowland' and 'Dream 'n' Blue' are outstanding. This is an imaginative and refreshing set, typical of the touch of Dave McKenna. All familiar tunes, yes, but touched by The Master's Hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"In my opinion, this cd is not the jazz style that i enjoy","review":"This is not one of Daves' better cds. It is alright, but no cigar, thank you.For this cd there were some birght spots, but not enough to really satisfy me. Dave played well on some of the songs, but then played poorly on some of the songs. There was no consistiency of a performance on this cd.Well, i'm looking forward to buying more of Daves' product in the hopes of finding that home run.

I don't mind that in some places but I wanted a fan that looked nice in my livingroom and did not stand out too much. Well this is the one! It has a nice base that looks like a piece of furniture and the fan itself is even a matching brown. As for the way it works I would rate it as good for it's size - which at 12\\" is fairly modest. But it does come in a larger floor model and if I decide in the future I must have a larger one, I will likely buy it as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like the company but hated this fan","review":"The fan that was shipped appeared to be a return that they shipped to me. It also appeared to be a company second. The color didn't match, it was incomplete and broken. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap imitation","review":"I had owned this model already, which was well made and the base (floor version) was a deep cherry/brown wood. I used mine every night for approximately 3 years and the motor finally gave out. I ordered this to replace it. The fan looks like the same style but is completely inferior in all respects. The base seems like a painted metal/wood composite and is scratched up. I had to used pliers to bend the connecting plug as it was warped and also remove a piece from the lower end of the cord which wouldn't thread through the base. The fan itself has a couple nicks. The controls and connections are completely different from the one I own. This one is obviously a cheap imitation of the original. Very disappointed but after having to bend/reform some pieces and putting it together I felt I couldn't return it. Bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Diasppointed for the Price","review":"When I pay over $200 for a decorative fan vs. the $50 imports readily available at Wal-Mart, I expect fine-furniture quality. This fan instead reminded me of something from a third-world country that you would find in Cost Plus for far, far less. This post of the fan and fan motor were scuffed and scratched. There were visible grinding marks on the base and it looked like it had been repainted. The wires on the cage were bent around the perimeter and I had to straighten them. And a part that secures the fan to the base was missing.We saw the fan in a local store and the quality appeared far superior, so I'm hoping this was either a sample defect or a badly refurbished return and not representative of the quality of all Deco Breeze products. If the latter is the case, Amazon should stop carrying them immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a novice","review":"I would say that I am a novice at yoga.

Unfortunately, scrimping on a director was not a good decision in this undertaking. They needed an old pro who knows how to work fast and get decent shots that flow, have meaning, allow the actors to present a character etc. Inept staging of scenes leave the cast floundering over and over. Statues standing and saying lines, over and over. Many look grim in their scenes simply because they know the captain of the ship doesn't know what he is doing...and this film will be a mess. There is a good cast, and the skeleton of a good story...but a good recipe does not make a good cook."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice Lee Van Cleef movie","review":"good western not up to the original but good anyway. Lee Van Cleef did a nice job. he always does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Il Magnifico Siete","review":"More of a cold spaghetti western (as they are called) than a true sequel to the American western original. Lee Van Cleef is found in other 'spaghetti westerns' like The Good the Bad and the Ugly with dubbed English translations over the Italian. This film is a lot of action with limited character development and amiable characters like Ronaldo the loner who in the original gets 'adopted' by a couple of the village boys only to die in their arms later.Good action, but personally I liked it less knowing that it was somewhat cold and not very true to the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here","review":"The book is about the fall of socialism.

The one of 1929/30. It ends with the 'triumph' of neoliberalism in the early 1990s; that makes the authors look a bit out of inc after the most recent world economic crisis (2008).

The style is journalistic (always the same type of non sense anecdote to open a new chapter). There is too much raw stuff and not enough presentation of ideas. Chapter after chapter you will go from one country to the next but the sum of the parts does not add up to a very powerful demonstration.A decent book. By no means a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The book describes quite interestingly the development of what now has become the mainstream in political thinking, specially as to the background of the \\"Thatcher revolution\\" in the UK; the rest of the book is, however, rather thinly spread, providing a broad catalog of the changes in all regions of the world, without really providing any deep or novel insight; overall I believe the authors would have better done to focus solely on the US and the UK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle buyers beware!","review":"This review is not about the book but the fact that I purchased the Kindle version which was the 1998 edition, NOT the 2002 as pictured and indicated for the book version.

This book was informative, interesting, sense-making, and thought provoking. What more can you ask for? Particularly from an economics book! I recommend it, particularly to the general reader with scant economics in his or background (like me). Two objections: was it necessary to include so many countries in the analyis and discussion? The going slowed a little after the third or fourth \\"tiger\\" or South American example. Second, the authors make a compelling argument for free markets, but slight the down side, although the George Shultz quote, page 374, with the authors' elaboration offer a nod in that direction; and in closing the authors fairly note criteria by which the open market could be judged in the future: does it deliver the goods; ensure fairness; uphold national identity; protect the environment. Big picture history at its most insightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent overview of how free markets came to dominate","review":"The Commanding Heights by Yergin & Stanislaw does a great job of presenting how free markets came to dominate the post World War II world.

After reading this book I was convinced there was more to Jones' death than an accidental swimming accident. The book flows nicely and leaves one quite sad to see the effect greed, fame and fortune can have on some people."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Strange Death Of An Evil Genius","review":"Rolling Stones biographies are plentiful, yet the release of this book in 1994 increased the speculation that Rolling Stones founder Brian Jones was murdered soon after he was dumped from the band in 1969. Padded out with early details of Brian's teenage fatherhood to three bastard offspring by separate girls, his self-absorbed behaviour and violence towards his girlfriends, this update makes you wonder how the unlikeable character made it as far as he did. After revealing little of note in the first half, the book gets juicy when recreating Brian's final days spent in the company of celebrities including Maurice Gibb, Steve Winwood and John Mayall at his country home. Theories about the guitarist's pool drowning remain a little haphazard, but Who Killed Christopher Robin? offers some sympathy for the little devil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick Read","review":"Peter Cameron's Leap Year was a disappointing read.

If you only have one Herb Ritts anthology, this would work, but for one glaring omission: his work with Olivia Newton-John is not at all represented.Well before Madonna began reinventing herself, Herb Ritts' work with creating the iconic \\"Physical\\" images for Olivia are what put him on the map.

The basic premise is that you can learn a great deal about a society by the way they talk about and treat the land around them. I must admit, it made me look at my surroundings differently. It is a bit slow in places, and after a while I started to loose interest. However, overall I would say that this collection of essays is rather good. You should check it out if you have any interest in the field of landscape studies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meditations upon the meaning of 'landscape'","review":"I was attracted by the title of this book; there's so much to be learned by observing the suburban or rural landscape, which most of us drive through without really noticing or reflecting upon it. Someday a wonderful book will be written on this topic, but this is not it. Instead, John Jackson presents us with a series of 'musings,' for lack of a better word, about the vernacular landscape. At times, the writing takes on a stream-of-consciousness quality that leans too heavily toward personal reflection. Topics include the grid-road network of the US midwest, placement of county courthouses within town plans, the history of the 'box house,' evolution of the Arts & Crafts style of architecture, and the author's experiences in the US Army in Europe during WWII. Intertwined among these topics are passages in which the author reflects upon the notion of 'landscape' and what it means to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Synopsis","review":"(From the back cover)Casper's high-spirited courage and daring deeds help those in need - and win him brand new friends in four thrilling cartoon adventures.Lonesome Giant - Everyone is afraid of a gigantic giant until Casper helps him make some little animal pals.The Absent-Minded Robot - When a rejected robot finds himself all alone in the world, Casper fixes him up with some friends.Greedy Giants - Casper braves some shadow-casting 'giants' to give a little weeping willow her place in the sun.Red Robbing Hood - A young prince's scheming uncle wants to steal a kingdom's throne, 'til Casper gives him a royal scare!For children of all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Art of Painted Furniture","review":"Was looking for techniques and colors used.

Also, the best song I ever heard from Mad Kap was a really great track over a Michael Jackson sample that did not make it on the album, and that I've never been able to track down in digital form. I just have it on a recorded tape from the Friday Night Flavas (Baka Boyz-KPWR)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destroy Like Nazi's","review":"Fight Club is shocking, colorful, Matrix like, full of technical magic, but it stinks. The whole idea that Corporate America stifles freedom is bogus. Most folks put in 8 hours and go home to kiss the wife and kids, smoke pot, or ride their motorcycles. In truth, human activity after 5 in America is diverse. Wasted, gray lives, that's what its like in Socialist countries. So what do these fighting young men do to combat Corporate Fascism, they kill and destroy like Nazi's. Clear thinking there, hey! Yeah, Brad Pitt is believable as a handsome, cocky, cool guy. He had to use all his talent to stretch for that role. This movie is everything that's wrong with the Left Wing Intelligentsia on the East and Left Coast."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...?!...But...?...How...??!!!","review":"Don't get me wrong.

Those who love linear, mindless and stupid movies, like \\"Die hard\\", will hate this film. This is a film. This film takes you on a mans journey into himself. This is a story of self-realization and what lengths todays society makes us go through to strip away prescribed modes of behaviour. All I ask is to listen to the the statement that this film is making and not to expect a \\"Bloodsport\\" type movie. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great, misunderstood movie","review":"People see this movie and generally think the main theme is the philosophical parts during the middle/end, but I think another theme that is just as prominent and more important is Edward Norton's character's search for companionship, control, and identity. I don't want to explain everything but I think it's hilarious what he goes through to get these three things. Old people generally take the violence and philosiphy too seriously but the point is for all of it to be absolutely absurd. This is the only movie besides Requiem For a Dream that I think is perfect and I will stand by that forever. If you don't like it it's because you don't understand, or your close minded, plain and simple. Every facet of this movie is polished to a fine sheen, and has left me dissapointed by almost everything I have seen afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS MOVIE IS AWSOME","review":"THIS MOVIE IS AN EXTREMELY DETAILED POINT OF VIEW OF A LOSER'S MIND AND HIS LIFE TRANSFORMING INTO AN ANARCHIST STRONG IN BELIEVE, IT HAS A STRANGE TWIST TO IT, SAD BUT TRUE MESSAGES, AND ENOUGH HUMOR TO KEEP YOURSELF ENTERTAINED"},{"rating":"1","title":"An objective review","review":"When it comes to films, I am pretty open minded. But having had to sit through a disturbing two hours of this film, I have to say that it is terrible. It started ok, as the one redeeming feature (Norton's acting)was pulling it thorugh. However with the introduction of the ever wooden Pitt (why won't directors sacrifice popularity for talent?)it took a decidided down turn. The writer of this anti-consumerism tosh is obviously so pleased with himself, so smug, that he has tried to produce something which he expects us all to stand back and say \\"wow\\".

That's not bad. That's why they pay megamillions to startlets; because they know they magnet attraction to young audiences, that have money, and can go twice(?) to see a movie. That's why Bradd Pitt is here: to get that audience.But where's the film? What's the morale? Get punched, humiliated, try to do the same and then feel better?Or: Let's don't care anymore, just bribe our bosses, get some easy money and travel thru the world creating clubs where human beings are denigrated constantly.This is a dangerous vehicle.

It's about feelings of alienation and the search for real meaning amongst the superficiality of modern culture, summed up neatly in its recurring line\\"'cause I'd rather feel badthan not feel anything at all\\"It's a pretty good song (more of a rant, really); Zevon's a great songwriter and this is about par for him. It's currently available on his \\"best of\\" CD.Which pertains to \\"Fight Club\\" in this way only: in about 3 minutes, Zevon manages to make the same point that the makers of \\"Fight Club\\" waste two hours of our lives to ham-handedly try to get across. Zevon's take on the topic has the virtues of wit and brevity, while the film offers up only pretentiousness and incoherence. Lots of able talent on hand here, but the net result is unwatchable dreck.

Lastly, THIS IS THE MOST OVERRATED MOVIE OF ALL TIME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughts on Fight Club Film","review":"This DVD was by far my greatest purchase ever :]I had trouble finding this movie in my small town so it was relieving to find it online at a desirable price. Fight Club has become my cult-classic movie of choice, due to the great story line and acting, and because it also led to my current relationship. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys Chuck Palahniuk's works, whether by book or film. It's a wonderful film for Brad Pitt lovers as well. With its many quotable lines and talented actors, Fight Club can teach everyone something; \\"Sticking feathers up your butt doesn't make you a chicken.\\" If I could make any sort of difference by giving my rating, I'd give a five out of five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under the incredible violence","review":"Under the incredible violence is a well acted, directed, and very thought-provoking entertaining movie. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are surprisingly good in lead roles. Great ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Films Of 1999","review":"This film was the most underrated of 1999 and I don't know why. I thought Fight Club was very well written, directed, and acted. If you've seen this film only once then you can not say that you've seen it becaue the first time around you're like \\"What? What? What?\\" But if you've seen it at least twice then you're like \\"Ohhhhhhhhh I see.\\" I am dead serious.There are so many little things that are in this film that are meaningful and for that, Fight Club is the most inventive, most brilliant, most creative film that I've seen by far. I say forget films that don't make you use you're brain. I say use your brain and I say use it while watching this film. I beg of you to not look at the title, Fight Club, because I think it does throw you off to thinkning that all this film is just fighting and. . .fighting. It's much more than that I guarantee you.Overall, Fight Club is a surprising masterpeice that's funny, thrilling, and original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edward Norton is a very good and underappreciated actor.","review":"This movie is very strange. It had a very wierd start. But once he(Edward Norton) met Tyler(Brad Pitt) the story started to pick up and get more interesting.

I recommend it to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fight Club","review":"If you haven't seen this classic movie at least take the time to rent it.

Trust me, the name tells you there is fighting, this is a fun movie that will keep you guessing the whole way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie with a great twist","review":"First off this movie is not about fighting. It plays a small role, very small. The movie is much larger than that. The story is great, acting is great, filming is great. I will say this though, the movie is unusual. An the ending is one of the best I have ever watched! You will be setting there in disbelief. You really should give this movie a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"One you keep thinking about after it's over","review":"This movie is incredible. From what I heard of it when it was in the theatres, I wasn't interested. I'm more of a chick-flick movie person at times, ya know, like Steel Magnolias. Not that this movie is a chick flick at all, but it was a lot different than I expected. The plot is so drawing, the characters are very interesting that I actually kept thinking about them after the movie was over, thats something that never happens anymore. The twist in the end made me think for days about how it must have been to be the main character, and then I noticed that they never mentioned his name. I'll say no more about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fincher does it again!","review":"Past the action filled commercials, through the title of the film, amd seeping within the extreme violence, there is a message. A message that most everyone will feel but try to avoid further action. Edward Norton does not avoid it, in fact, he actually enjoys this venture into a world of excitement, danger, and anger management techniques. Unfortunatly he is as the movie progresses, clearly insane. He creates a character he needs, someone to help him discover who he is. This movie never fails to be boring, repetitive and certainly not predictable. But hey, what can you expect from the amazing directing of David Fincher of SE7EN? Dialogue can be very clear and ingenious if listened to carefully. Watch this beauty with full attention and surely more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISLED BY AMAZON AND OTHER REVIEW SITES","review":"THIS MOVIE IS NOT IN DTS!!UNFORTUNATELY THIS DISC WAS NOT PROPERLY REVIWED BY AMAZON,IMDB,ETC.THIS IS THE SAME SET AS THE EARLIER TWO DISC SET.I'M MAJORLY DISAPPOINTED.I HAD TO OPEN IT TO FIND THIS OUT AND WON'T BE ABLE TO RETURN IT.THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME AND DESERVES TO BE DONE CORRECTLY WITH DTS SOUND.BUYERS BEWARE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still great movie, even better picture and sound quality","review":"If you like this movie, you will like it even more on Blu-ray.

It has a fantastic premise and you never really know what is going to happen next. The characters are fantastic and the message itself will make you think quite a bit. After seeing it once, you will want to watch it again. Or about five times in a row. It is that good. My only complaint at all for the movie is the bit of hypocrisy in the message of the film. Besides that, Fight Club is still one of the greatest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie I've Ever Seen.","review":"Ever get those movies you get tired of the 3rd or 4th time you see it? This isn't one of those films it can be watched numerous times and you won't get sick of it and you will catch something new everytime you watch. This is the best book to movie adpation I have ever seen Chuck Palahniuk brought us into the demented world of Tyler Durden and David Fincher hit the nail on the head with this film. It's about our beloved Jack who suffers from Insomonia and is searching for himself. He begins to attend Group therapy groups where he meets a just as derranged Marla Singer. After his condo blows up his calls a soap salesman he met on one of his flights and we enter the world of Tyler Durden. Fight Club isnt for the weak of heart and will not dissappoint. Watch this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am Jack's jaw dropping","review":"This is the best DVD ever (as of right now). Not only is it a great movie, the special features are awesome, director & cast commentary insightful (although Helena Bonnham Carter's was obviously recorded elsewhere and edited in), there are cool special features on the second disc such as deleted scenes and alternate scenes. As many of you already know, this is not just a movie about fight club. Ed Norton plays a nameless character (well, he makes up names in the movie, but his real name is never revealed). Brad Pitt plays Tyler Durden, Mr. Cool, tough guy, doesn't care about worldly posessions. Meatloaf plays Bob. And don't forget about Helena, who does a fantastic job. This is a really good movie and an especially great DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freakin' Awesome!!","review":"Fight Club is honestly the most underated movie of the 90's. After I first viewed it in theaters I was completely in awe. And then I watched the DVD commentary and it only solidified my belief how layered and complex the movie really, truly is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great DVD","review":"There are some movies that can only be enjoyed on DVD. The kind of movies that retain a certain level of theatrical magic the big movie houses hold. Fight Club falls deep in this category. The resolution and sound quality during the film are extremely high. The first disc includes four audio tracks ranging from the director alone, to the cast together, remembering the movie as it runs, giving a behind-the-scenes play-by-play.The promotional material on the second disc is worth the purchase alone. In addition to mini-documentaries on different topics from special effects to the over scoring during the opening tittle sequence. This two pack combo can help you start a Fight Club of your own, in your living room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great DVD Package, OK Movie","review":"I wanted to like this movie so much. I really did. I caught onto the plot twist early on, and had no problem with it. The acting and the direction were good, I just felt the story itself was just ok. I dont want to give too much away, but in the end the movie was just ok.The DVD package is awesome. The extra stuff is great. But the movie is not. Three Kings was a Great Movie with a great DVD package. Fight Club is a Ok movie with a great disc full of extra stuff.I say rent it, don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save the money","review":"I have no complaints about the translation to DVD, but this movie had so much potential that it just blew. It's the first movie that I've ever seen where for the first half, I was blown away and completely drawn in, but by the end, I wanted my money back. They blew that bad. It had some many things that it could have dealt with, but instead, it relied on a ridiculous plot twist that ruined the film.

The reason I'm keep watching it is this: I became addicted! David Fincher has made a fantastic movie! Many people thought this \\"I'm not going to see it because there's too much violence\\". But that's NOT the point of the whole movie.I think that whoever watches this movie will be very surprised by its theme and its stars and of course by the Master of CG=David Fincher. And the DVD-package is awesome. It's a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"You DO talk about Fight Club.","review":"A potential classic! Alright, maybe that statement was going a tad bit overboard, but the oddness and dark humor contained in this movie will keep you thinking about it long after the credits have rolled. It's basically about a person determined to change our materialistic and commercialized world with the help of a stronger person to latch onto. Brutality is shown when the change begins with shirtless guys getting the anger off their chests by beating each other up. Then it moves onto something greatly larger... see it for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMNNNNN!","review":"What a great film! It was totally not what I had expected, and the last 20 minutes of the film were simply amazing! This is by far Fincher's best work, ever better than seven, which was also a great film. Brad Pitt, who I despise, was really great as Tyler Durden, and Helena Bonham Carter was totally cool as Marla. Edward Norton, who made the poor \\"American History X\\" film, truly redeems himself in a fantastic starring role. The film also boasts a PHENOMENAL soundtrack by The Dust Brothers, and I highly recommend that you pick it up if you liked the film. As for the movie, it was quite entertaing, and not at all what i had expected. I was surprised that there were very little fights. The plot truly carries the movie, not the brief, and bloody fights. I think that fans of the movies \\"Roadhouse\\", and \\"Lionheart\\" will enjoy this, but be aware that this film is ten times more complicated than those two put together.

You may like this movie if you like lots of violence, lots of blood and a boring story. At the end the movie make more sence, well a little bit but it's still very boring and another \\"Cliché American Movie\\" that people will say it's cool because big names are in it, well even if \\"Movie Stars\\" are in a boring movie it's doesn't make the movie great, well not to me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"That's some hip shiitake you got there","review":"You want to watch a boxing movie, check out Rocky 3.

I watched the second time and found it to be even worse than the first time. This movie has no real plot and what the movie trys to use as the plot is about the worst plot possible.

I tend not to discriminate when it comes to violent content in movies. For example, Saving Private Ryan used violence to send a sincere message. Unfortunately, I cannot right-mindedly suggest that Fight Club had the same purposes in mind. The violence seemed quite sensationalized and the movie seemed not to emphasize the negative aspect of the 'Fight Club'. One example of this sensationalization is when they are destroying the businesses of various people through mischief. The music says, \\"Laugh, this is funny!\\" but it is obviously not. Perhaps the director went astray from what the author of the book had in mind, because I saw little seriousness in the subject with which \\"Fight Club\\" supposedly grapples with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid movie!!!","review":"Fight club is one of the most over hyped movies that I have ever seem.Stupid plot.

Take a look at the spelling, grammar, sentence non-structure, etc. in the one star reviews, then compare them to the five star reviews. Does this tell you anything? I don't think those one star reviewers are the brightest stars in the sky. Seems to be a little left wing vs. conservative thinking here. As usual, it's mostly the left-wingers that don't understand what's going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Still Good","review":"This is my second review for this film, the first I gave it 5 stars. But I had to remove that to get this second post.Why - because I couldnt leave the offensive, rude and stupid remarks of some of the people who didnt like it. Why does it need that rudeness. Ok so let me reply for the people who thought this movie was good, well acted and means something.A cursory look amongst one or two of the people who lately branded us \\"retarded\\" and are \\"clearly are lacking any substantial intellectual horsepower\\" tell me all I need to know. These intellectuals gave Reservoir Dogs and Platoon zero star reviews whereas one actually gave the Hillary Duff album a fantastic review.So I respectfully say that if these are your yardsticks of quality I would recommend you stick to JLo films and dull vacuous books about locomotives. Leave the energetic well executed films for us boys and girls who have some life in our lives. Can you do that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highest Marks for Making Us Think","review":"Any movie which stirs up as much thought and reflection as seen in these reviews is doing something right. Too violent for my tastes, but you'll be chewing on the plot long after viewing the movie. The DVD special features are superb though they will give your DVD player and television a workout. I've got a \\"smart\\" television and it had a hard time with some of the frame splicing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mischief. Mayhem. Mindblowing. Soap.","review":"Fight Club is the best movie that is out there right now. Not only is it so keen on its timing, but everything that is involved with it is superb. Edward Norton is one of the best actors in the world right now and he plays his part brilliantly. Brad Pitt is funny and gives life to his character. Helena Bonham Carter is great as the eccentric womam who just doesn't care. Another aspect of this to be examined is that Fight Club was directed by the best director in show business, David Fincher. He is a genius and this movie only hightens that status. Every \\"frame\\" of Fight Club is interesting to look at. The DVD is truely great for its picture quality and the sound depth of the movie. In the end (and I won't spoil that for you) Fight Club is a smart, brilliant, funny, and suprisingly moving black comedy that only a few will be able to recognize the intensity of this movie on a higher level. Enjoy it and don't be a space monkey."},{"rating":"2","title":"sometimes funny, sometimes unsettling, never weak","review":"This movie was recommended to me after it was released in the theators. After watching the previews for it in the theators, I didn't think much of it, assuming that it was simply another piece of trash that hollywood puts out every year. Little did I know that I would wind up ordering the video tape and thinking about the profound messages that it sent. I think virtually everyone can relate to the main chracter regardless of income and social status. The main theme of the film is that life is a constant struggle to discover who you really are.I think other reviewers have written quite enough on the film so I'll cut my review short. I leave you with a quote from The Qur'aan: \\"Verily, we have created man in toil\\" (90:4)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of action, some comedy and very interesting plot","review":"This was a great movie. I removed 1 star because it was a little hard to follow the first time around... You really have to watch it a couple times to totally understand the whole plot. When I realized what was really going on I couldn't believe it and I had to watch the movie over again from my new perspective which made things all the more funny! Some of the material was a bit graphic but very realistic and kept me believing that the fights were real and that what was happening could really happen and may actually be happening as well. I loved Brad Pitts role in this movie and think that his character was chosen very nicely. I also loved the character that Meatloaf played. This is a great movie to watch again with different people around because the different commments that are made during the movie will change how you see it... and it will seem different each time. It is very much worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try to find another like this","review":"I have been looking for another movie like this since I first saw it. I CAN'T! This one has no comparison. It is truly one of a kind. If you enjoy a slightly demented, action movie with many interesting twist, try this one. You will not find a similar movie that is just plain FUN."},{"rating":"2","title":"A View From the Precipice","review":"\\"Fight Club\\" is a bit more than you would think by watching the trailers or looking at the packaging. Think about \\"Memento\\" when you watch this. The overall message is about freedom, from ideas and material things, and about anarchy. The story itself will cause you to do a double-take.Brad Pitt and Edward Norton give intense performances. This intensity adds to the graphic nature of the violence in this movie. As gory as it is, you will still have trouble turning your eyes away from it. It is a bit disquieting.The movie also has Helena Bonham-Carter and Meatloaf. Neither one had a part really large enough to get inside the character.I would recommend this movie more for rental than purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a new high in American Cinema","review":"This movie is one of the best movies to come out in 1999, along with Dogma. This movie is really thought provoking and makes you wonder if the writer of the original novel lived through something like this because this seems so lifelike. It's very farfetched, but for some reason it's still very believable. The DVD is full of great extras and worth the extra cash. Buy the DVD and you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best DVD packages out there!!","review":"I skipped seeing this in the theatre, but I am glad I waited to see it on DVD.

I am extremely happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely Overrated Dreck","review":"An interesting beginning gives way to pointless violence, childish pranks and plot twists for the sake of plot twists. I could kick myself for sitting through the entire mess. I hated this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"i ha-ha-HATED THIS MOVIE","review":"okay, lets get to the point. the first is that the message and tone and personality of the movie is that we are living in a comsumerist society and everything is manufactured including who we are. yeah, yeah. thats cool, good point. but then to have THIS horrible movie illustrate what men need to do to confront who they are and what their true values are? PLEASE. this movie was so, so lame and drab. the story is very boring, then it turns absolutely ridiculous within the last 30 minutes. ugh! i cant believe i wasted my time on this stupid film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repulsive Garbage -- The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen","review":"Avoid this waste of tape and time at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Senseless Violence","review":"I'm not one to shy away from movie violence... I loved Gladiator, Braveheart, Seven, Terminator, Silence of the Lambs, etc., but in those movies the violence was a realistic and necessary part of a compelling story. Nothing could be further from the case here. People are reading way too much into the value of the senseless violence and destructiveness in this movie. Granted, the last time I was in a fist fight was the 5th grade, so maybe I'm missing some kind of erotic thrill that these characters get from beating each others heads in, but the only way this story reflects the \\"destructiveness of our society\\", is if you live in a prison. The quality of the film is fine, but the grossly exagerated story is offensive to both the mind and the eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fight Club is a GEEK show!","review":"Brad Pitt, as America's most underrated actor (could it be because he's looks the way he does?), does a wonderful turn as Tyler Durden in this purile film. And Bonham Carter, Norton, and Meatloaf are all good as well. (I don't know why Pitt got so excited about this project. I surely don't know why he would file his teeth down to perform in it.)Come on, I'm a guy and I'm over thirty, and I couldn't bear to watch the screen the whole time - and it wasn't because it was scary - it was because it was GROSS! This is a gross out film. Watching it is like being forced to watch THE FACES OF DEATH over and over again - and liking it!While Tyler wants to reach \\"rock bottom\\", I don't think we need to see it in all it's detail.The same moral and message was in The Portait of Dorian Grey and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but without the gross-out factor.I went home and took a shower after seeing this film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fight Club is crap for Suburban Wannabes","review":"I gave this piece of crap one star becasue the site wouln\\\\dn't let me give it less. \\"Fight Club\\" is the movie for you if you're into the closet bound, homoerotic fantasies of a schizophrenic who is not capable of having sex with a woman unless he imagines that another guy is doing it. What really scares me is that the whimps that like this garbage are allowed to walk the streets wihtouth a keeper. If they're so into fighting why don't they put on gloves and get into a ring. Because they'd get the life beatren out of them, that's why. This kind of junk-- and Neil LaBute's \\"In The Company of Men\\" are supposed to be \\"real guy\\" movies. Real eunuch movies is more like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie with plenty of extra stuff on the DVD","review":"This is in my opinion, one of the best movies of last year. The acting is superb and so is the writing. Protests of over-the-top violence in this film leave me a bit confused. Yeah, so there is a lot of fist fighting, but for the exception of one fight, everyone is a good sport whether they win or lose. I'm sure a fight could be a liberating experience because most of us go through life trying to avoid confrontation for whatever reason. That is beside the point, however because there is much more going in in this film and repeated viewings are almost required.The DVD has some great features. You can listen to four different commentaries while watching the film. There are deleted scenes, storyboards, concept art and other cool stuff. This is the way that all DVD's should be made. All of this can be purchased for a good price, considering that there are two DVD's in this edition. Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Deep and Well Thought Out Movie-One of the Best","review":"This movie for some reason has been regarded as a violent movie about some men angry at each other. If you think this then you are far from right. This movie is increbibly deep. Its one of those movies that makes you think about life after you leave the theater(or your tv room in this case). This movie adds comedy to a powerful, insightful, and dramatical story line. I dont want to ruin the plot by telling you it but all i have to say is that brad pitt has the preformance of his carear(as that cool guy you girls all love) and edward norton delievers yet again another perfect insane individual. GO BUY IT......you wont be disatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very much worth seeing!","review":"Fight club is everything you expect it to be and everything you don't. I just finished viewing the video and had to come here to see if everyone else loved it as much as I did. I'm not going to tell you about the story and ruin it for you so all I'll say is that this is one of those films you will need to watch a second time to take in all that you missed the first time. I usually agree with a lot of the movie critics out there but this time they were way off the mark!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is, infact, nothing to do with underground boxing","review":"Although the actual \\"fight club\\" itself is a kick start to the premise of the film, it is not the basis of Fincher's finest as many people have misinterpreted. So for the people who haven't seen it on this basis, this is what it is really about: The fighting that I believe it refers to is the fight against corperate and social control. It is a story that provides a way to combat the people that provide the comforts that we don't need. The fact that it is told through the eyes of a mentally unstable character is almost irrelevant although it is an integral part of the tale. As the un-named Norton slowly turns into what can be be described as a \\"freedom fighter\\" along with the psychotic Tyler Durden, we relate to - and understand - all the acts of vandalism they carry out. Suberbly shot, edited and performed, this is a text that film students will be studying in the near future as I'm sure it will eventually achieve classic status."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL.... REALLY BIZARRE.... MINDLESS VIOLENCE","review":"I'm sorry folks, I just didn't \\"get it.\\" The acting was great and the story was original, and for that I give this movie 2 stars. But other than that, why watch this movie? It's just a bunch of bizarre, mindless violence. Is watching people beat each other's faces into a bloody pulp for fun supposed to be \\"art\\", perhaps?Don't get me wrong - because I like actual boxing. But this wasn't boxing. This movie was just plain sadistic. Or masochistic, take your pick. It was one of the strangest and most outright bizarre movies ever.Sorry people, I just didn't get it. NOT RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Worthless","review":"Despite a few key scenes and decent one liners, 'Fight Club' is simply self-indulgence at its peak (until Donnie Darko of course). Perhaps it would have been more interesting if they neglected to include direct quotes from the book (written by the god-awful king of pseudo intellectuals Chuck Palahniuk).Though I did think it was funny when Meatloaf's brains fell onto the floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUBBISH!","review":"This movie wants you to believe its message is that if you are if you are dissatisfied with our superficial, materialist society, you can find relief in squalor and violence. It is actually a movie for people who are entertained by pointless violence, but who need to believe that they are looking at something with artistic or intellectual merit. The movie is arresting, with good performances, but it is basically shallow and manipulative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware, this is not a truly \\"fun\\" movie","review":"My adult son recommended American History X, a movie I would never normally watch, but he reommended it so highly that I watched it and loved it (violent, yes, but such a great story and so well done). He also reocmmended Fight Club -- um, not the same thing! Certainly well done FOR WHAT IT IS, but not a fun movie, hard for people like me to follow the story or see the point of the story (like The Matrix, and American Beauty)and brutally violent and unpleasant.

Then graft onto a good deal of violence, followed by a weird psychodrama where the main character is really a projected other person, tougher and more charismatic.Young men seem to like this movie, but it is both banal and ugly in its violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Blow","review":"A good looking movie. Edward Norton is always watchable. The plot is absolutely different. We're rooting for this underdog theme. But in the final round,the audience is hit with a low blow that can only be vocalized as disbelief on a grand scale. If you watch it at home, it's an interesting failure. But for me at ringside, I was robbed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fight Club - What's not to Like?","review":"Consisting of a handful of great actors, an incredible audio experience (thanks to the Dust Brothers) and visual effects which, in my opinion, rival The Matrix, Fight Club has captured the very essence of a non-normal person in a non-normal world. Edward Norton brings to his character a depth that, I don't think has been matched in a long time. Brad Pitt's character portrays the ideal alter-ego of Norton's, and their on-scene chemistry is immense. This movie's complexities will keep you from realizing the truth until the very end. The title may lend itself to a false impression of the movie's content, however. Granted there is fighting in the movie, but the theme carried out is not based on aggressiveness or brutality, instead on true self-realization in today's world. As the story unravels, you will find yourself questioning an elusive reality built around a self-created destruction plot. You gotta see it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Film; Amazing DVD","review":"I'd first like to say that Fight Club is not for all tastes. It was very controversial when it first came out, and many people aren't going to like it. It's an extremly disturbing film. But I loved it. I thought it was an insightful look at a lost generation and how they have to outlet their frustration. The DVD is just spectacular! It has boundless extras like 4 different commentary tracks (I think this could be a record), documetary features, and many different advertising features (I loved the Public Service Annoucements). Although I recomend watching the film before you buy it, it is an amazing item to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I watched this at the cinema, and one misfortunate idiot two rows infront of my took it upon himself to leave 40 mintues into the film. No. This film isn't about fighting! Although you'll have to 'endure' a lot especially at the beginning. It is ONE film that conveys so many different and complex ideas that it left me thinking! Its about men's primal instincts, and fight for self respect, and for spiritual freedom. Its about the longing we feel to escape from the materialism of the world, about anarchy and the price it brings. How we can never escape comformity, even when seeking anarchy. I was puzzled by some aspects of the film that didn't make sense. But i passed those off as silly parts of the film, and as it was a film, I let the unbelieveable bits go. But suddenly, at the end, it all came together and made sense! Above all, the twist at the end knocked me sideways, and even left me questioning my own sanity. The strangest of things can happen even to the most normal people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I haven't watched Fight Club since shortly after it originally came out and let me say this was amazing.

My problem is how incredibly annoying Helena Boham Carter is in the commentary. Everything she says is off topic, pompous and.. incredibly dull. Every time she talks, its like ..\\"SHUT UP!!! Let Brad or Edward talk, GEEZE!!!! They are the ones actually talking about the movie!!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best films of '99","review":"Fight Club was discredited by many of the film industry pundits for being to surreal, and lacking a true plot structure. That's just plain ignorance of the traditional Hollywood reviewer. This film got mixed reviews simply because the plot structure and the themes were \\"too complex\\" for many to understand. And that's the point! This movie is one of those types of movies that has to be seen more than once to fully appreciate. So if you've already seen Fight Club, do yourself a favor and view it again.

The acting is awesome, the direction is marvellous, the screenplay is ingenius and the editing is pefection. This film is a big hit with the critics and one of the few films that deserves all the praise it gets.Edward Norton deserves praise for his role as a young man who is continously attending 'groups' at different countries. When he meets a soap maker on his plane called Tyler Durdon (the marvellous Brad Pitt) they start up a fight club, which is successful, but turns dangerous and dirty.Fight Club is so awesome and so breathtaking that it is now ranking at #20 in my top films.

The movie was not logical, but it did make me admire the strange story of those silly people: Through fighting, what comes out is not just blood and tears, but all those emotions that you have been hiding, all those things that have made you unable to sleep; By unleashing those forces, the man is reborned, with nothing but that animal instinct that releases the sinful world of its deeds with a sense of a new found justice. Watch the movie, and you will understand what I am talking about. FIGHT CLUB>>"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody seems to get the hook of this movie","review":"You need to really pay attention to the dialog in this film. There is so much symbolism and themes in this film that it is easy to miss the bottom-line. That is the only reason I would'nt give this film 5 stars, it trys to do too much. If you like movies that make you think and leave you feeling uneasy, this is for you. You think the movie is about men finding liberation through violence. The irony is that the movies not about that at all. You have to watch it yourself, but most people miss the point. If you can't handle abiguity this movie will really irritate you. Especially disturbing to me was the dialog between Ed Norton and the female character where they are discussing which days they will attend the victims groups, spooky. Remember the old saying its ok to talk to yourself as long as you don't answer back. Watch this movie twice and again, pay attention to the dialog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mayhem on DVD","review":"This has to be.. the best movie ever.

They did not do the movie justice. And once you see the movie you'll understand why the trailer was lousy -- they couldn't really tell you much otherwise they would give the story away. And no, it's not a movie about a bunch of guys fighting.From the first scene to the end I was hooked, especially after the first plot twist. It was one of those \\"what the...!\\" moments. If you are not offended by violence and sexual situations this movie is worth a shot, but pay attention to details. I can't say more without giving away the very complicated plot. And after you've watched the DVD check out the extras. It's loaded with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This DVD kicks you know what.","review":"This Fox edition of \\"Fight Club\\" is the most interesting DVD ever put together. Beyond the film itself the 2 Disc set has 3 commentaries and several special features.The film is a strange buddy/action/comedy-drama. The film's stars are Brad Pitt and Edward Norton who come together, they are both disenchanted with society and decide to vent their frustrations by beating eachother up. Soon this catches on with other people and they soon form a \\"fight club\\" where men who are really unhappy grown boys get a chance to let the world know how unfair the world has been to them.The performances by Pitt and Norton are Oscar worthy as is the film itself.

No scene is wasted - every shot is perfect and meaningful to the story. The amount of violence is much less than what was portrayed in the media and what is there is essential to the storyline. I must admit that this IS a guy's movie - it may be THE guy's movie. I have the VHS and can't wait for the DVD. David Fincher rocks as \\"Seven\\" and \\"The Game\\" are almost as intriguing - but this is his masterpiece. Great acting, great screenplay, great concept, great musical score, and a haunting movie that will be remembered long after you see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Classic - A Movie To Base Your Life On","review":"This movie continues to increasingly strike home for me each time I watch it as I've gotten older and closer to the age of the main characters. As I've depressingly realized in my own lifestyle, material possesions tend to define my entire self image at times. And as this film tells us, we have to fight against that urge to conform to what our society would otherwise tell us to embody: a productive worker-bee drone that spends and consumes as much as possible while at the same time thinking as little as possible to accept the status quo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fight Club","review":"One of the best movies.

Brad Pitt and Edward Norton were both excellent in their roles. I have to say that I'm glad that Pitt is finally getting the respect he deserves from the male audience. I think that before this film, he was viewed as a \\"teeny-bop heart throb,\\" which I always believed was an unfair description. After his performances in such films as \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" and \\"12 Monkeys,\\" I think he proved himself. But apparently \\"Fight Club\\" is the movie that has earned him the respect he deserves as an actor.I respect the way the film followed the book closely, and I think it actually worked even better on the sceen. And besides from the movie itself, this DVD is also one of the better \\"Special edition\\" DVDs out there. It contains lots of nifty extras, that are very entertaining all alone.Excellent film. Excellent DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie that fights for it's right","review":"A excellent movie about Jack(Edward Norton)a man who finds an escape from his insomnia in support groups for illnesses. Even though he has no illnesses it's helps him and he can sleep again, until a chain smoking witch named Marla Singer comes along only for the free coffee. He cannot concentrate with another faker around and the insomnia starts again. It soon unravells into him meeting Tyler Durdon (Brad Pitt), a man who's free will and care for nothing leads Jack to follow him. After a late night of drinking Tyler starts a fight with Jack and this realeases pressure aswell. But it soon turns to a giant club that fights every day of the week. A very well done movie so dark and disgusting you feel like taking a shower. Excellent acting on all parts and the fight scenes were gross but beautiful. The end will leave you stunned and a second viewing is almost necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't watch it for the fights","review":"At first I didn't want to watch this film because it looked like a poor excuse to exploit violence. I was forced to watch the film, but after the first ten minutes, i was hooked. The plot line follows an average joe-shmoe (Norton) who's life is going down the sewer. He then meets Tyler (Pitt), a do-it-yourself kind of mentor. Together they create \\"Fight Club\\", a free organization of beating. But this is just the start. Fight club contains great plot twists and every scene is AMAZING.The acting is top-notch and David Fincher (director) keeps the same satire-yet-drama feel as the book. A must see for everyone. Men, women, and...well maybe not children."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie... great dvd","review":"this has to be Dave Fincher's best work yet. if you never got to see fight club at the cinema then i feel sorry for you. i dont know why there arent more movies made like this one. the acting is unreal, the soundtrack is awesome and the story is one of a kind, and its all nicely presented on dvd. im a huge fan of the director's commentry so i was in heaven to find out that the dvd contains 4 seperate commentrys from cast and crew. if you had any choice in the next dvd to add to your collection then this one is it... but you should already have this anyway. fight club is one of those rare movies that wont die out or be forgotten. also look into Dave Finchers other films such as \\"the game\\" and \\"seven\\", both worth owning on dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fitch Club packs more than just a punch","review":"Desite the bizzare and rather brutal fight scenes the movie is excellent. The acting and camera angles are amazing. Fight Club is one of those movies you realy have to sit down and watch. The only thing i did not like that much was that the end didn't fully explain the situation (which those of you who have seen it would understand)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Order limit?! WTF Amazon?

The idea that all working class people can expect nothing good out of their miserable little lives and that we all need to be reduced to nothing but individuals who are truly no better then everybody else doesn't sit well, nor does the sight of men with large breasts or stealing liposuctioned fat to make soap. Elements like this are true signs of the 15 minute fame mark. Had it been kept with the premise of fighting to work out tension it could have been better. Brad Pitt also makes for probably the most tetched character in movie history. This movie is hidious and goes on WAY too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulp Fiction all Over Again","review":"This movie was a stylish version of a baby throwing a hissy fit, and suffers from pulp fiction syndrome( which is having no story and wasting a would be good movie on whatever the director was thinkin that day). Nothing made sense, it had no good fights( and a movie called fight club should have good fights), and it was loaded with smut. O yeah it also had a twist at the end which was unessasarily stupid. Overall its a 2 out of a 10. What a waste of talent."},{"rating":"1","title":":-(","review":"i was kind of liking this movie until the end, when you find out that the whole movie was just an illusion.

Butthen about halfway in, the structure starts breaking down, the moviegets very slow, plot holes get bigger, the story's tone changes from satire to pure fantasy, and the twist at the end is inexplicable and ridiculous....its use of sex and violence is no holds barred and unabashedly in your face. So what? I see that kind of stuff all the time. It's not what makes a movie good. This movie is so disorganized and flawed--a mess, a mess, a mess, I can't stress how much of a mess this is."},{"rating":"1","title":"best flick I've seen in the lasrt 4 and a half years","review":"This movie kicks some serious butt, if ya know what I mean. I mean really. It's the sobering slap in the face for moviegoers everywhere, from New York City to Paris to Philly, PA. The fab HELENA BONHAM CARTER, straight out of England, is a real treat to behold, so check her out in FIGHT CLUB as Ed Norton's main squeeze. Ed norton is great in the lead role as Tyler Derden, and BRAD PITT lights uyp the big screen in his hunky superstar way (and the small screen too) in the very same role - that's right, the same role!! This movie movie really makes you think about hoW THE HUMAN BRAN REALLY WORks and how sometimes each all of us feel like wer'e someone else sometimes. Who is Tyler Derden anyway???

Perfect partner for Ed's character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable package and awesome sound","review":"There is a gloomy wet pavement feel to this movie. Those seeking a romantic angle will be disappointed beyond a bizarre relationship with the female lead.Violence is throughout the movie...its about fighting...so consider yourself warned. Something lurks in the subtext here; are we ultimately seeking leaders who can think for us? Rebuild us into something bigger and stronger?Many of the laughs are guilty laughs...we hear jokes about men's breasts, support groups, the terminally ill seeking physical interaction. May be a little tough on some folks. You were warned.Edward Norton is a compelling actor, and the disc set really provides everything you would want. The commentary is useful and powerful. Great set.This movie is clearly too complex for most theatre patrons who prefer pokemon and gladiators to plot and substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am Jacks Review of Fight Club","review":"Wow! The DVD Special Edition is a Gem! The movie kept me on the edge of my seat the first time, the second time and yes, even the third time. Brad Pitt and Ed Norton are a dynamic duo.

I HIGHLY reccomend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, provocative, and downright adrenaline-pumping!","review":"No letup from start to finsh! The best musical score!

This is one of the most under-rated brilliant films I've seen in a long time. The directing and editing style is top notch that keeps pace with the interesting characters and ever-developing plotline. -- People hated this movie, yet LOVED the \\"Sixth Sense.\\" I don't get it. -- \\"Fight Club\\" is a wonderful satire in the age of \\"Men are from Mars.\\" Over-the-top violence seems to be consistantly misunderstood (see: \\"Natural Born Killers\\" as an example) and it appears to have happened again here. A great story, snappy dialogue...plus, Edward Norton continues to demonstrate himself to be one of the greatest actors of his generation...This movie is a must-see for anyone who loves movies. I can't wait to get the DVD so my friends and I can end the raging debate about all the flash frames in the beginning 20 minutes of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding...one of my favorite movies ever!","review":"Before you read this review please take to heart that this movie is not an \\"action flick\\" nor does it contain mindless violence followed by an incoherent and awful storyline, i.e., Arnold Schawrzenegger movies...David Fincher is a exellent director showing off superb Camera work from start to finish. Acting is also pulled of extremely well by the likes of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. While I was sceptic to see a movie with someone as \\"trendy\\" as Brad Pitt starring, his acting overshadowed my doubts.As not to spoil your viewing pleasure, I will not reveal any of the story and I encourage you to watch this movie whether on Movie, DVD, Cinema, etc..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe","review":"Yes, I'm a dude, and yes, I did see past its violence. And yes, I do believe a lot of what the movie says (about how products consume us, how we live by what we have) but the most disturbing part is that the characters use VERY poor judgement to let out their anger. This wouldn't be that bad if the film had bombed, but the fact that it got so popular is by far more disturbing than anything this hurls at us. Why there are so many people that think what they did is justifiable is horrible. I'm not the kind that'll say this such-and-such can effect our lives in evil ways, but yes, this has done that.

But don't talk about it! People who are impressed by this movie might want to read a few books instead of trying to learn life lessons from bad movies.If it weren't for prepubescent males with more testosterone than brain cells, this movie would have received no attention at all. A nice performance by Norton, but nothing else to recommend it. Those individuals who have written reviews stating that this movie is thought provoking or intellectually intense clearly are lacking any substantial intellectual horsepower.The book, while nothing special, is infinitely better than the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time.","review":"A lot of reviewers who like this movie tell people who didn't like the movie to read the book. Why read the book when we are trying to watch a good movie? Let's be honest here. The movie has a lot of fans but it is a bad movie to an average person who is happy with life.

It was way under rated at the box office. It has a brillant beging then keeps getting better and better as the dark humor is released. With the best twist ending I have ever seen, although you have to think about all the events in the movie for it to make complete sense.

Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not horrible if you understand....","review":"First of all, let me respond to the reveiwer below- if you like this movie- you are not a bad person whose judgement should be questioned.If you liked this movie you are an intelligent person who understood the message it presents. Fight Club is not about violence and those who like the film do not necessarily like the violence. This violent content is however necessary to deliver the point of the movie. Fight Club is not advocating anarchy and does not want you and your drinking buddies to go out to the nearest bar and start pummeling each other. The movie in fact wants just the opposite.Now, some people may not be able to get past the violence but if you can- you are in store for quite a ride. Good acting, score, and quite funny jokes for those who think enough to get them are all great aspects of this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"underrated and brilliant!","review":"Fight Club takes you through a surprising world where nothing, not even fight clubs, are what they seem.

Instead, I found it mean-spirited and confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 15 Year Olds Objections to Fight Club","review":"Fight Club has all the right messages, but it delivers it in all the wrong ways. This movie is meant to be a social satire, supposed to make us think about our society. What we own owns us, not the other way around. Corporate America controls our lives. These are true messages, ones that I couldn't agree more with. The problem is, you can't degrade corporate America when you ARE corporate America. The great message in this film loses it's genuity when the movie is so hypocritical. 21st Century Fox produced this movie to make money, which is everything that this movie opposed. Open your eyes people. This movie is a fraud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big, loud, gratuitous, and not as smart as it thinks it is","review":"This movie claims to be philosophically deep. Yeah, right. You're not fooling me, Mr. Fincher. The philosophy here is quite shallow. Some interesting surface points are made about commercialism, but it's all just an excuse for Fincher to show off his 875 different camera angles and blow stuff up on screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tyler would have wanted it this way...","review":"Tyler would have wanted me to give this a 1 star review. So I did. ;)Apparently, all of the other serious 1 star reviews, have no understanding of irony. Or, they cannot understand that there's a difference between portraying violence, and condoning it. It's sad that people with such sophisticated vocabularies have such a limited perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not everyone will understand this movie","review":"Ok for all you who didn't like this movie. I completly understand why. Its the kind of movie that plays with your head and makes you think and makes you feel. The first time I saw this movie, I didn't quite get it. I liked it, but I didn't get it. The second time I began to see the subtle intericusies and ironic twists about the movie that I missed the first time around.I've seen this move about a dozen times, (every time it comes on tv.) its a clever movie that has reached cult level status and it deserves it to. But be warned. THIS MOVIE ISN'T FOR EVERYONE. Its violent. Its antagonistic.

Now that I've graduated my friends have taken turns dropping their jaws at my pop culture ignorance. Every week one of them exclaims, \\"How have you not seen that?\\" Which is how I ended up viewing this movie. I won't deny it's a little odd, but oh so quotable and one really can't beat Edward Norton. In my book he's a better actor than Brad Pitt, and he's no slouch either. If you're into psychology at all or beautifully unpredictable movies, you'll love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie...","review":"... Has given me more to think about than any other movie. I'm quite serious when I say that this is the best movie of all time. NOTHING is more visually striking, involving and fast-paced. It may be 139 minutes, but it has so much to say, that it goes by quickly. It has ideas and talks about them. And then it goes and adds a psychological twist, that I think, does not negate the picture but adds one more layer. I can't begin to express my admiration for this film, so I'll say this(again): Nothing is as wonderful as this and I highly doubt that anything ever will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does that come in cornflower blue?","review":"Yes, yes it does.

The better the film, the more convincing. This film forces/allows the audience to not only feel good, but inteligent and scholarly in their enjoyment of senseless violence.

This movie was billed as being about fighting, but its really about the human soul and the box of conventionality in which we keep it locked. Here's what Tyler Durden has to say: 'We are the middle children of history, with no purpose or place. We have no great war, or great depression. The great war is a spiritual war. The great depression is our lives.' For Durden, consumerism and the American dream is the enemy. The film asks whether there might not be a crazy free spirit, an urban terrorist, an unabomber, in each of us, and if there is, what we are going to do about it. If cancer sufferers can have their own self-help groups, what about modern-life sufferers? What will allow us to actually feel the pain of modern existence?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fight Club - dies fighting","review":"This is a movie (as somebody said) that you will either love or hate. I, for one, didn't like (won't say hate) the movie much. I still think Fincher made an awesome movie in Seven, however Fight Club doesn't even close. It's about mindless fighting (so what if a bored idiot wants to vent out his anger by swinging fists) Very little acting required on part of actors. All they do is deliver witty (but uninspiring) dialogues. The background commentary gets annoying after some time. The movie is devoid of plot. Watch this movie only to learn that it's your own sh#t that you use to wash your face. Waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Nihilism","review":"This film starts out with an interesting premise about a guy who's searching for meaning in his ordinary, boring life of conformity.

This DVD does what DVD's should: give you an in-depth look at the filmmaking process. It also makes good use of the angle and audio button on you remote, (yes, those two - the ones that were collecting dust) giving you shots of scenes from all possible angles. The commentary tracks (plural!!) are good, but my one beef is that some seem spliced together, creating a weird listening experience.

It was marketed by trying to sell viewers to see Brad Pitt, which doesn't work for me - I need more than star power to see a movie. I believe its very hard to advertise for without giving away anything that makes it so unique. But I caught it late night on cable and LOVED it. I love movies that suprise me, and this one did.I can't get into too much detail for fear of giving any of the good stuff away, but suffice it to say that both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt deserve Oscars for their roles. Norton as the quirky, mild-mannered, easy going guy who has allied himself with the exact opposite outlandish Brad Pitt character.A definite must see for anybody wanting to see a movie different from most of the mindless, heartless, and plotless movies made today."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best movies of the 90s","review":"I remember walking out of the theater after seeing fight club around midnight.

Well, perhaps not EVERYONE. So maybe I can change a few minds with this review...?WEll, this movie starts off looking nothing like a thinking movie, if you base your opinion solely on the titel and a lot of the trailer info that they gave. But as soon as you start watching it, you realize how much thinking the cast and crew did in it, and how much thinking you need to do to pick up on everything. And trust me, no single viewing will reveal everything! Also, this movie is borderline psychotic. And you feel THAT, too. By the end of this movie I was beginning to feel just as insane as our hero (played by Edward Norton). And the ending. Well, let's just say that the ending... Well, not to be stereotypical, but you have to watch it for yourself. And watch it you will. But remember, \\"The first rule of Fight Club is never talk about Fight Club\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fight Club rocks!","review":"Fight Club was one of those movies that you either liked or you hated. There is no in between. It is either too much or just enough. If you like excessive violence, twisted story lines, and demented characters then Fight Club is for you.

The whole movie confused me and I loved it. Its one of those rare movies you want to see over and over because you keep learning more each time through. Now I'm about to buy this movie and add it to my DVD collection so I can show it to all my friends who didn't expect it to be good. THe only problem I had with this film was that I couldn't just watch, I had to think too. I love thinking, don't get me wrong but my head hurt from trying to figure out the plot in the begining.

From the very first frame to the last this movie pulls you in and doesn't let go. It has the best TWIST at the end that forces you watch it again. The Camera angles are unbelieveable and the song track is good, if you like the PIXIES it has the song, \\"Where is my mind.\\" I've bought this movie and I've watched it at lest 5 times, IT'S THAT GOOD. It's full of Pharses and Quotes that are unforgetable and Eye opening. This movie is definately in my TOP 5 favorite movies.If you like this you'll love AMERICAN HISTORY X also staring EDWARD NORTAN. I would also recommend the author, I don't know his name, but his books are awesome.THIS MOVIE WILL CHANGE YOU"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, it's that good...","review":"Fight Club is a superbly crafted hyperbolic attack on american consumer culture, and will eventually be looked upon as one of the best films of the nineties. Witty dialogue, an unpredictable plot, and incredible sound and visual editing make this a DVD worth owning- and watching over and over again. It takes a good home entertainment system to do this film justice, which is in a way the ultimate irony..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Late than Never","review":"Not only was it a great movie, but a great cinematic experience as well. Well written, acted, filmed. A couple of spots seemed to drag just for a bit, but they picked right up again (or maybe I just missed something, which would have been easy to do since this movie was an a visceral assault on your mind.) I feel this film deserves a second viewing to catch it all. Not at all what you expect from the trailer. Theatres need to strictly enforce the admittance of minors to this film so ignorant teens dont start up fight clubs all over. This is not about fighting in the usual sense. More about fighting for your sense of self. If you don't understand parts, ask someone who saw the movie with you. Talk about it. It will come to you. If you still don't get it, it's too late for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to FIGHT not to eject the tape in the first ten minutes!","review":"FIGHT CLUB was the worst movie I saw so far this year (2000).

What was wrong with the cover that was the same as the ads? You know the one I mean with the soap with \\"fight club\\" on it above and head shots of Pitt (on the left) and Norton (on the right) below? This new cover is horrible. Did they think Pitt's face wasn't visible enough? This was looking to be like one of the best non two disc DVDs ever and now every time I look at it I must gaze on that wretched picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bars of soap and people who talk to themselves","review":"Ed Norton is the bomb ya know, but he is talking to himself in this movie and it makes no sense. Then this whole soap thing, is this a prison movie or is Brad Pitt just wishing he had not cheated on Gwen Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston and thinks that washing his skin with a bar of soap that says fite club on it will wash away his sinning ways? Norton is a great actor he is one of the best around that is for sure. I think that this movie needs help though it is boring and you don't need to be in a club to fight and kik someone's azz in a new york city basement people!!!! Ridiculous premise that does not hold water, or if it does it is like any bladder, soona or lata it give outta!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not 6.1 Sound and about an hour too long......","review":"I purchased this special edition thinking it would have 6.1 sound to drive my rear speakers. Even though many sites indicate there is 6.1 sound, it is not so. This movie runs about an hour too long. The twist is given away early in the movie on the airplane \\"Hey, I have the same briefcase\\". I found this movie boring and resold it used, at a minimal loss. I could barely make it through the movie and did not waste any time on the commentaries. This rates with The Mexican on my sleep list. Seven is much better and has much better sound...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've heard better pseudophilosophy from bums","review":"Dear people,Do you do things as part of your job that are probably wrong?

As a hobby!!When this movie became a cult classic, every old railroad tyrant from the gilded age probably rolled over in there grave and said \\"Dang! Why didn't I think of that?\\"And of course, after the making of this movie, some people even started thier own little imitation fight clubs.

That's the real outcome of a sadist fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fakey, but still really cool","review":"So, my basic thing is that this movie left you hanging in all kinds of ways...how did the fight club organize itself. How were policies and rules determined, did everyone just listen to brad pitt whenever he talked? That seems a bit unrealistic, was there a treasurer, how did they pay for club events, or advertise?In all fairness, however, obviously this is about more then just the club, and the fighting was really cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really can't discuss","review":"If I was talking about this movie I would say it's excellent, but I'm not...

I am Jack's raging bile duct.Awesome in it's scope and unflinching under scrutiny,Fight Club simply is a treat for the scores of burned out consumers to hemmed up by all the bs to do something about it.Escapeism at its best!!!The only reason I deducted one star was for the main charecters flip flop in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Psychological Film For The Angry Ones","review":"When I saw this movie I was shocked, I definitely wasn't expecting it to be a exhilarating ride as it was.I thought it was just about fights and lots of violence plus Brad Pitt and Ed Norton in it, wrong!Those who feel angry at the world and the culture of massive consumers will identify with this flick.This isn't just fights and blood, it's a look at the anti-social persona, the things we do to feel okay with ourselves and the way we lose control and let someone else think for ourselves and tell us what to do...we become followers and we don't even know what we're following.This film is not gonna be enjoyed by everyone, this isn't a film you watch with the family, it is a good psychological drama more than an action film, highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"where do I begin","review":"This is one of those movies that has all the hallmarks of being a classic, but fails on every level. Although stunning in a few sequences, the direction is flawed. Long periods of pointless film making split scenes of pure genius. Unfortunately these scenes span ten minutes of film max. And then there's the story. As I see it a story is good if it can be real. This fim could have been but then we discovered that brad pitt is an imaginary character. At this point the whole fim collapses due to the large nuber of holes that have formed in its structure. Lastly, the story is a pointless one. There is absoultely no reason why this plot needs to be told. I can't think of one. maybe you can. You must see this movie. It shows how a great idea can be ruined by bad direction, disgraceful acting and a moment of pure stupidy in story telling"},{"rating":"2","title":"love the movie; not so much the Blu-ray","review":"To make myself clear, i love this movie, saw it in theaters, owned it on dvd, lost it and have seen it more times than i can remember;i just recently got a Blu-ray player and fight club was one of the first ones i bought; they only problem i have with it is, when you turn off the player it does not remember where you last left off; maybe its just me and my player, although this doesn't happen with other Blu-ray disks;\\\\not really a complaint, more of an annoyance since i listen to all commentaries but have seen the movie so many times that i dont need to watch the entire movie in one sitting.thanks for reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Author & Book is Awful","review":"Whatever you do - DO NOT READ ANYTHING THIS AUTHOR HAS WRITTEN NOR WORK WITH THIS AUTHOR.June Rives also owns a company that helps Americans relocate to America.

Neither should religious beliefs. I, for one, am perfectly happy to have my religious beliefs kept out of science classrooms. I don't need science to tell me there is a God.

In Japan, one very important tradition is the tea ceremony, and the ability of a foreigner to appreciate the role it has played in Japanese society can be a key to business success.This book contains descriptions of the history of the ceremony, the role it has played in Japan and many of the ways in which it is conducted.

THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE GOT. it reaches very far, is exceedingly powerful, and it kills them on contact, so they're not still flying around after you've sprayed them.

My only real regret was that the end came too soon. I wanted more, much more. Hopefully Mr. Judson will give us more in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"This interesting novel by a new writer intrigued me. It is a story of frustration, humiliation, hunger, and horror set in of all places, central Wyoming and the Pacific theater of World War II. Tom Wedderburn is a survivor, simple and uncomplicated by definition, but complex and deeply introspective in reality. I'm still not sure I understand all of his motives and reactions, but I admire him and believe he is worth knowing. His ability to subjugate his desires and ambitions baffled me until I came to know him at the end of the novel as a fulfilled, satisfied man . I may take up sheep herding myself.

It is better than pictured it has a nice covered surface on it perfect for bare feet. The hinge reassesses so it does not dig into your floor, my floor is linoleum so that is very important, it does not tear my floor.

Thanks you Big Brother Government for once again messing with my life! The new \\"safe\\" cans are anything but. No vent so they pour slowly meaning you get tired holding it and sometimes slip and spill. The lack of vent also means they sometimes explode with the buildup of pressure when they get warm in the summer heat. Whoever invented the safety switches must be an alien with 3 hands! This can is GREAT. A nice long flexible METAL spout that doesn't require a funnel. An easy to hold release and a vent that opens when you pull the release AND releases pressure buildup. Plus it's made of heavy gauge metal. Yeah, it's expensive but now every time I use it I remember the junk they sell in the home stores and smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Safety Can","review":"When I received the can there were a few very minor blemishes (mainly small dents near the top) as noted in some of the other reviews. Nothing major and certainly nothing enough to consider sending it back. The can is a little lighter weight than I was expecting and the handle mechanism to dispense the gas is a little clumsy to use in my opinion. Once you've done it a few times it becomes easier to manage. It is nice to be able to get the can into position before starting the flow of gasoline.

In my opinion, this is the only way to carry and store flammables.The plastic ones are just good for emergency situations.

You don't have to be concerned with puncturing or rupturing the can, like you would with a plastic container. If you are looking to fill up and empty in a relatively short time, then I would say go with the less expensive plastic containers. If you are looking to store gas for an extended period of time, then spend the extra money, and have the piece of mind knowing that this container will do the job safely and effectively.

Nice change from allthe products we buy from china that we have to keep replacing every 2 years.Definitely worth every penny. I so recommend this can.

Had I been able to do so, I would have taken a pass.I am totally baffled as to how Eagle could manufacture a gas can with such poor ergonomics.First, the pull handle is placed so close to the lift handle that, if you have normal sized hands, you cannot readily squeeze the pull handle more than a small distance while gripping the lift handle.Second, the rear loop of the pull handle extends so far back that it contacts the fill spout preventing the pour spout plunger from opening more than a fraction of its full travel. As a result, the pour rate is very low.Third, and the worst, the lift tab on the fill spout gouges your wrist as you try to squeeze the pull handle.No, let me take that back. The worst is that this gas can is not returnable.If you are considering buying this can from Amazon, be sure to check one out at a store to see if your hands are the right size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid can, accurate pours without spills after learning how to use","review":"Wow what a difference from the cheaper plastic cans with spouts that really do not work. This can feels extremely durable. Handle for initiating pour fits four fingers so it is easily pulled. Have to be careful not to open the rear latch too much if you have overfilled the can...gas can spill out from there for a couple seconds. Only takes once to realize this for you to learn. After this operator error, can worked flawlessly. Very happy with purchase.Note after 2 years: I still spill gas with this design, even at 3/4 full can. I was filling up snowmobile with my mittens on yesterday and out comes gas, soaking the thumb of my mitten. Frustrating and this after I have had plenty of experience with can. I have found their slightly cheaper version works better for me. The cheaper version comes with a big yellow spout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gas Can","review":"This gas can is very durable and safe. The only things I find difficult to do are: filling it with gas and dispensing it. The handle must be pulled and the vent must be opened at the same time. I was unable to empty the contents into the gas tank of my car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dented - poor shipping.","review":"This is an expensive gas can, and it is non-returnable. So I am not amused that it arrived damaged.The box that this can was shipped in was a single layer of cardboard -- not nearly good enough to protect the can. The box got slightly banged up in shipping, not even enough to really notice when I received it -- but the can has a nice substantial dent in it. Also some of the paint had flaked off the bottom rim, and that part of the box was completely fine.This makes me think that (1) the steel isn't a heavy enough gauge to make the can as tough as I would expect for this price level, and (2) the paint isn't as well bonded to the steel as it should be.So how long will this can last, even if I get one that is *not* damaged in shipping?I'm starting to think that the only way to get the quality I wanted is to go into the past. Buy something from Ebay that was made in America in 1950."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"This gas can should be great considering the price and reviews, but don't believe it. The handle is strange and can not be fully opened. If that was the only problem, I'd deal with it, but its not. I went to fill this can up for the first time which I would be using for my landscaping business. After adding the ethanol shield, I started to shake the can to mix it. Gas started flying everywhere. I added plumbers dope and tape to the nozzle threads and tightened the nozzle tight thinking this was the problem. Nope, upon further inspection while trying to put gas in my lawn mower, the factory nozzle connection started dripping gas.

Well, while I had no dent, it absolutely does not leak and has a positive smooth flow of fuel when you pull the flow handle back. Yes, it is stiff and if you are pretty weak in the arms and/or hands it is not as easy as one of the cheap plastic ones with two handles on them to pour.However, this is the highest quality gas can I have ever had and it does exactly what it says....It pours with a smooth no splatter flow and it does not leak. If it had a second pour handle on the edge of the can to help hold a full can while pouring I'd give it 5 stars and it would be perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good but expensive gas can.","review":"While this can seals very well, it is a bit awkward to use at first as it requires the operator to hold the can and simultaneously pull another handle that vents the can and opens the valve to allow gas to flow. After using it a few times however, one becomes accustomed to using it. If you want to empty the entire 5 gallons of gas it will take some time with the smaller nozzle that is provided with the can. I understand a larger diameter nozzle can be purchased but the price was high, about $17 plus shipping.The can arrived with the dent (only cosmetic) as mentioned in other reviews. More than likely the dent is the result of the nozzle which is allowed to run loose inside the box containing the can. The solution is simple but it appears the manufacturer has not been apprised of the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eagle 5gal gas can","review":"Finally I\`ve bought a gas can that doesn\`t leak when pouring fuel!!

Only negative I have to say is that when I received the can it came with the infamous dent that other reviews have noted,thankfully that doesn\`t affect function....I can\`t believe it is due to quality control...maybe it\`s the packaging...all in all very satisfied with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have this on my computer(Kindle version) and use it all the time for review","review":"I like this book.

He's knows what's worthy and what's not. He knows right from wrong. His occasional reverence is fake; only his self-regard is real. He never mentions that he might have merely right-timed, right-placed into his pile of money, but instead presents it as the inevitable result of him unconquerable will and boundless intellect.

The fact that he was part of a dot-com start up that actually succeeded seems to have gone to his head though. Somehow the fact that he was in the right place with the right idea at the right time enables him to declare Lisp as the uber language, and everybody who doesn't see that is a dullard?The title suggests a book which is whimisical and fun.

Good for him. To be sure, this earns him some credibility in discussing languages and start-ups. Unfortunately, he takes it upon himself to extrapolate from this single data point to universal laws of what makes you successful. Moreover, he seems to think that his success as a geek entrepreneur somehow lends validity to whatever unsubstantiated thoughts, feelings and prejudices he may cook up, including some completely ridiculous views on the general superiority of geeks over regular people. The only reason so many of his readers seem to accept these views must be that he's preaching to the choir: certainly his geek audience would dearly like them to be true. His arcane and naive notions of art and aesthetics are too embarrassing to even discuss.

Basically, he's Batman without the costume and with more explosive gadgets. The women in the story (a doctor and a diplomat) gush at his patronizing remarks about their good looks and hurl themselves at his feet (and into his bed). The best thing Clive Cussler brings to this story is his experience and knowledge of deep sea operations. The story boasts plenty of action, but it's all a little too unrealistic to hold my attention. I also disagree with the jacket's comment about Clive Cussler being a lot like Dirk Pitt.

I only finished the novel because I'm a completist. Many of Cussler's interests just do not interest me at all, which leads to large sections of the novel devoted to things I really don't care at all about (i.e. antique cars).Also, I just find all the Dirk Pitt hero worship to be nauseating. There were many parts of the novel where I found myself just rolling my eyes at how the other characters were slobbering over the greatness that is Dirk Pitt.I guess these novels are just not for me.

However, this version is not well executed. It is way too small to have much utility. You can get a single small pork roast on it, but that's about it. You won't be using this for baking poultry pieces, pork chops, etc., and don't even think you could put a turkey on it. Somebody needs to take this idea and make a big version of it.

I have been trying to find similar books that make me feel the same way and nothing has even come close, including recently popular works like Waiting, the Hours etc. This book along with a Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Love in the time of Cholera and The Winter of Our Discontent will always be the best--though I am hoping for something to replace them.

A truly Catholic novel, it is a joy to find something that takes spiritual issues seriously and yet is hardly preachy.

I could prints sheets of wallet size photos in minutes verses hours with old HP. This printer is so new to the market that ink refills are only available online (9/05). This is bad because this printer also eats ink. The color cartridge lasted about 128 (2x3) photos (30 pages of 8 photos each) In 3 weeks, I've used 4 cartridges at $20@.

We have a Linux/Mac home network (No Windows!) and this printer does not play nice with either OS. I can not get it to work at all under Linux, and with the MacBook, much of the advanced functionality is crippled (grey-out in the menus). I expect much more in the way of cross-platform support, especially from a major vendor like Canon. If I had known in advance, I would not have purchased.Add to this the fact that a set of ink refills cost $45. Does Canon really expect people to spend $45 on refills for a $50 printer?Go with Espon.

Not only are they expensive, but the color cartridges are all in one cartidges. What this means is that you run out of one color and you have to pay 25 dollars to replace the whole cartridge! When you get a flat tire you don't replace all four tires do you?! That would be rediculous and expensive. That is the same idea with this printer, it is a much better buy to pay an extra 50 or 60 bucks, the amount you would pay for two ink cartridges and go to the IP4200. I do not recommend this printer, instead go with the IP4200 you will be saving money in the long run. The color cartidges are seperate in the IP4200 so you are not paying 25 dollars every time you buy an ink cartridge. I don't recommend this printer.

That Jim Thorpe was a real person also makes it more entrancing than fiction.

It is written by two amateurs, who know very little about geography, or warfare at sea. They are \\"politically correct\\" in an archaic way (ca. 1941) in praising the \\"British race\\" and making essentially stick figures out of the \\"wicked Nazi\\". But, when you are PC, I guess you don't need to know the difference between latitude and longitude, or the First Lord of the Admiralty, and the First Sea Lord (page 109). Page 109 is practically a Keystone Cops scene in confusing who was what.Although they did the research, their amateurish confusion invalidates the book as a serious historical account.Not recommended at all unless they do a re-write of the amateurish passages.

(Also tedious was the author's frequent mention of her relationship to Dr. Phil McGraw.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly done","review":"I have to agree with the reviewer below who said this was a good story poorly told.The premise was good, which is why I picked up the book. Unfortunately, the execution leaves much to be desired. The author repeats herself often, particularly the parts about how admirable and wonderful and peaceful and strong she is. If she'd spent more time telling her story than waxing rhapsodic about herself, this could have gotten lots more stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent journey","review":"This was a great book!

Quite to the contrary, it's about a town and family that was distraught, destroyed and full of despair. A town that let social structure diminish it and yet it still held a firm grasp of the hearts of those who lived there. For those that want to be touched by a story of a homecoming that's both enlightening and frightening, pick this up and read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't this guy have an editor???","review":"The grammar in this book is the unbelievable! I could not make it past the first page without getting dizzy. By the second page, I was already lost and just gave up. Isn't somebody supposed to edit a book before it is published? Almost everyone I know who tried to read the book put it down very quickly. I know of only 2 people who struggled through out of morbid curiosity, as this book is supposed to be about the town where we lived. What a shame! If you are looking for other fiction books set in the Catskills, try Andrew Neiderman. As he is a former English teacher, his books are a much easier read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice remote","review":"This remote is great, except for lacking mouse control functionality.

We will pass the allusions to Jesus and his forty days in the desert. We will pass the hypocrisy of all those who come to the foot of the column to get the force Simon is supposed to conquer by his personal sacrifice that does not cost much to these hypocrites. The morbidity of this long description of years in the desert and temptations from Satan are finally ridiculed by projecting this ascetic monster into the younger generation of 1965 dancing the twist or some other crazy dance. He is the one who sits at a table, smokes his cigarette but does not dance. In other words he is the Fool who will never get the Fun and will Fancy he is Free and Famous if not Funny whereas he is nothing but F***D up.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"},{"rating":"2","title":"Edición con sumo respeto al original.","review":"Es muy buena edición, con sumo respeto, creo, al original.

En fin, Buñuel se habrá quedado muy bien con esta edición."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satirical, irreverent & hilarious","review":"Simon is a wise and healing ascetic who stands on top of a pillar in the desert. He shouts out his prayers, amusingly at times. On one occasion he starts a prayer, and then half way through says, \\"I forgot the rest\\". He also cures people. He gives a handless thief some new hands, the thief's wife then says, \\"Now you can do the gardening\\", and the man announces, \\"I can now spank my son\\". Some of the scenes reminded me of Monty Python's Life of Brian. Throughout the film Simon is visited, and tempted by Satan, who masquerades as a beautiful blonde woman. She entices Simon, and he repudiates her. The film draws to an outlandish and abrupt conclusion, probably because the funding dried up. A very funny and irreverent poke at religion from Buñuel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reminder of what we have lost.","review":"Luis Buñuel's Simon of the Desert reminds me of Don Quixote. He is a man of antique beliefs but behind his eccentricity we sense his nobility of soul. The final scene brings it into sharp contrast with the hedonistic self-centeredness of people today. We have lost something precious and have forgotten it. This film reminds us."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Jesus I Never Knew","review":"The book was very good in setting the stage for what many may believe now, but have not considered what the life style, politics and social issues at the time Jesus was born.

This may be one of the worst movies ever made, but it is also, unquestionably, one of the funniest! In this ridiculous sci-fi horror flick, everything is atrocious: the script, the acting, not to mention the special effects. Who could forget the film's \\"monster\\" being nothing more than a siloutte of a lobster! One of my favorite effects are the flesh tearing ray guns the aliens use and leave nothing but the victim's skeleton (in one scene the editing is so bad that you can actually see the metal screws holding the prop together!) Fans of \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\", \\"Attack of the 50 Foot Tall Woman\\", \\"Eegah\\", and \\"The Creeping Terror\\" will get a kick out of this film.

I started reading late in the evening and at some point fell asleep. I woke up at 330AM and knew that I had to finnish the story and read through the night. Tired as I was, I had that good feeling you get when you have just seen a good movie or finished a rewarding task.The story was mesmorizing. So many twists and turns, and I found myself engaged in the characters as much as the story. Y2K will come and go (we hope), but the characters should live on.This timely story has all of the makings of a movie. It is thought provoking, and somewhat unnerving since we really don't know what to expect with Y2K and it certainly doesn't lack credibility.Although this is her first book, I suspect we will see more of this author.

The only drawback is if you live in an apartment, and you are not on the first floor--you may need someone to help you with this item, it comes in two seperate boxes--a large box, thats very heavy and tall, and a smaller box that contains the legs to the tables--other than that, its well worth it.

He obviously wrote this while the C# language was still in Beta 1, because many of the classes and methods he uses were removed, replaced, or renamed as of Beta 2. I can't believe they published a book written about a language before the language was officially finalized and released.

I recommend you find a newer and more accurate book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Explanations are far too difficult to comprehend.....","review":"An earlier reviewer said he had trouble with delegates.

The Kane/Beth-li/Brigid triangle is a riot and is the best feature of the slow start to this novel. After the opening gambit things don't let up for a second, this is a 'read-in-one-night' book that's for sure!The ending sets up what sounds like a great new direction for the series which seems like it could be along the lines of one of my personal favourites 'Omega Path'.Consistently quality stuff in a genre that's not normally known for such things.

I was excited to see an animated version, and hopeful to share it with the youth group that I lead at church. I decided to preview the movie at home before showing it to a group of pre-teens. Yes, the message is excellent. However, the voice-over acting is boring and bland, using the same actor for many characters. The computer animation looks much like a video game from the late 90's. When Christian is met by Apollyon, the animation reminded me of meeting a \\"boss\\" while playing Zelda. I was also disappointed that there wasn't any closed-captioning or subtitle option in the DVD menu. The idea to produce an animated version of this was good. I regret that it didn't come close to standards that would highlight Bunyan's writing. There must be plenty of Christian actors, directors, and artists in this world who would surely like to put our pilgrim, Christian, on the adventure map with Frodo Baggins, or our friends in Narnia!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets a lot of play at our house","review":"I am delighted to have this product. As another reviewer mentioned, this production *contains the Gospel,* and it does so with great clarity and faithfulness both to Bunyan's work and, more importantly, to the Scriptures themselves. None of the poetic license taken is a problem for me; one caveat is that it does depict Jesus in a few scenes--I consider that a 2nd Commandment issue, but I recognize most people would be fine with it. All three of my kids like the DVD. We've had it for a few years now. Our 9 year old still enjoys it after countless viewings, and, to my delight, our 5 year old girl asks for it all the time. Yes, we recognize it is the product of a small budget, and it competes in our house against all the other films Pixar has to offer, but this one ranks right up there in entertainment value. When you add in the well-articulated Gospel presentation, it ranks right at the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best cd's!!","review":"This is one of my favorite cds from freddie.

Although the general theme is about the public domain, the concepts are specifically illustrated by discussing how copyright laws and, to a lesser degree, trademark laws, are implicated in the making of a documentary. The explanations can be a bit confusing because of the level of detail, but I think that this is more because of the nature of copyright law than the authors' ability to put it into writing.My problem with this book is with the Kindle format. First, the scans make the writing tiny and I couldn't make out some of the clippings that they used.

She draws upon past evidence in a clear and concise manner and updates the material as required. The author has a casual and comfortable writing style that is appealing to the reader. The excellent photos and illustrations add to the attraction of the book, and I would say that she presents her case very well. She avoids the pitfalls of dogmatizing but asks all the relevant questions and ponders the evidence at hand in a fair and balanced review of the material.I rate this work highly for the serious student of the subject and for the casual reader. This book deserves a four star rating and possibly five!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A non-edited scan?","review":"This kindle edition has so many typos and errors where parts of the text are misplaced that if has the feel of a totally unedited scan.

It's a grab bag of (to put it kindly) highly speculative ideas without a shred of verifiable evidence to back them up. Any author who quotes the Vatican, as Ms. Olsson does, to back up her contention that aliens were somehow (and I could never quite make out how) involved in Jesus's mission and his sojourn in Kashmir is difficult to take seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reference Book for Matthew's Gospel","review":"The Sacra Pagina series on the New Testament is an outstanding reference work for any student of the New Testament. The book on the Gospel of Matthew is written by Daniel Harrington. I was introduced to this series when I took a graduate level course in the New Testament. The professor recommended this series as excellent New Testament reference books. I lead a weekly bible discussion group and I have found this series to be of immense help. I am able to review Mathew's gospel line by line and receive the benefit of knowledgeable Catholic bible experts.

P Thompson's classic work \\"The Making of the English Working Class\\". Firstly, note that the hardback is a 1966 edition. This means that is does not have Thompson's 1968 postscript, nor his 1980 preface (it probably also misses the author's 1968 revisions, but I have not checked this). Secondly, this is not an organically produced hardback: the picture on the cover is glued on, and the spine does not have the author's name (instead, it has the name \\"Peter Smith\\" - so who the hell is Peter Smith?).

It is a softer, more ballad-heavy album - more like Steve Perry's solo material than a Journey album. It may not rock, but it does have a few upbeat moments, like the band's cover of the Blackeyed Susan song \\"None of It Matters\\", their cover of Glen Burtnik's \\"Every Day of My Life\\" and their version of Supertramp's \\"Give a Little Bit\\".I personally preferred Hugo's more rocking work with Valentine, but it's hard to deny this album. I'm sure the metal gods will strike me down with lightning for using the word \\"pretty\\" to describe an album, but it really is appropriate for this album.

The first one (a Digital Advantage) suddenly stopped working whilst in the middle of ironing. It was less than a year old but we couldn't find the receipt so resigned ourselves to buying a new one. Hoping that the first faulty iron was just a one off, we purchased another Black and Decker, this time a D1700. It managed 9 months before doing the same thing, although this time I could get it to work a couple of times by wiggling the cord. There was obviously a fault in the connection. I sent off the plug and a cheque to cover postage, as requested by customer service, on January 21. As of April 24 they have cashed my cheque but I am still waiting for the replacement iron.

If you are looking for a ridiculous show with an implausible plot that you can kick back and laugh at, this is IT.The basic premise is that this Japanese wrestler comes back (they first said he died, but he switches back and forth later) as a calamari (squid). He then tries to gain the title as champion wrestler of Japan, and win back the heart of his lady love. His antagonist is another wrestler, and the legend of the greatest wrestler of all time.

Some of the definitions around this subject area need clarification and this has not satisfied this requirement. There's little doubt that there is a growing and exciting research area here but I feel this book is rather premature and does little more than try to be a \\"first\\" in this area.

Had Rhinos, Winos and Lunatics, but saw that this two CD version had a live bonus disc, so I spent the money and picked it up. Well, I got to say that there are many Man live CD's that are better. Its not that its bad, it just don't compare to some of the others. Live CD's that come to mind are \\"Live At The Patgett Room\\" & \\"Maximum Darkness\\". I only just gave it a spin the other day when it arrived, so I will have to listen again. But first impressions did not shake me enough to say it is fantastic. Fortunately, there is plenty of music by this band that just kills!

The flavor is a subtle buttery tangy one, not at all hot or spicy.This stuff is somewhat of a paste (there is an inner packet) and a bit difficult to use. I found the best way to use it is to squeeze it all out in a large bowl, then toss your meat in and mix it up that way. Trying to pour it on or mix it up on a flat surface isn't going to give you a good result. One issue is that the oil separates from the rest of the paste and no amount of kneading the packet is gong to get it back, but mix it in a bowl and the oil does its job.The directions say it is good for 2lbs of meat, I'm a bit skeptical on that. You could do one pound and feel that it is not wasted.Flavor is good, easy to use once you know what to do.

It's rather misleading to call this a \\"book\\" and say it was \\"wriitten by\\" and author, it is really more of a large sales brochure dressed up as a paperback book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stand","review":"I bought this for the Sony Grand Wega KDFE42 and it works perfectly. Assembly was eay and I love the way it looks. It is a great stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Built to last","review":"I can't add much more than other reviewers have already stated; it's built like a tank, sharp, durable, light, has a good grip and is comfortable to hold. I'm not worried about needing to use the safety because enough force is required to open it which should prevent any accidental openings. I typically wear cargo shorts/pants and keep my knife in the side cargo pocket and since this knife is lighter, it doesn't have that tendency to flop around and bang against my leg as I'm walking like my other knives do (can be really annoying on long hikes). SOG definitely got it right with form and function on the TF-7. My only wish is that they also had a Tanto version available with a 40% serration with a maybe a slightly smaller size like a 3.3\\" blade (would also have purchased on the spot), but that is getting overly picky. Overall this is an outstanding knife and a tremendous value and will be my utility knife of choice. If anything happened to this one, I'd buy a replacement in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock solid knife.","review":"This is quite a nice knife. The handle is made of a very solid plastic that feels more akin to nylon fiber. The spring assist is nice because the blade is so large and heavy. The lock that holds it open takes some getting used to but it is possible to close it with one hand. All in all, a quality knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome knife!!!!","review":"this knife is literally so cool and the flip action is so smooth and sweet and the blade is sharp and very durable!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic knife!","review":"I bought my SOG trident tanto a little over a year and half ago, and since then its seen some heavy use. The Trident has stood up to the abuse with no problems whatsoever, the edge and finish have both held up through all sorts of various uses, from cutting rope to cutting wood. Even the assisted opening hasnt aged a day. This knife is fantastic and has served me well."},{"rating":"2","title":"exellent blade amazons service is very fast","review":"great blade holds egde for a long time. still razor sharp even after a month of hard abuse. would recommend and give it 9/10 handle could have a little more grip."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid value","review":"Great knife for the price ! With a little file work you can tune the opening force to what you like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big knife..","review":"This knife has a really light weight feeling handle. I feel like if I drop this thing on a rock, it will shatter. I'm sure it won't really, but it has that kind of a feel to it. It opens great. It locks open obviously, but it also can lock closed - which is great! I haven't field tested it at all really, just cut/stripped some cat5 and stuff like that so far. It is massively sharp! When folded closed, it is still huge. The handle is really long - My hand is average sized I'd say, and this thing still has plenty of handle sticking out of both sides of my grip. This was my first SOG folder, so maybe I'm just gonna need to let it grow on me. It's a great knife - just a different feel than what I've had before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sog triton tanto","review":"Only one thing to say about this knife: awesome 10/10 quality and lifetime warranty.

You can take it anywhere and everywhere and its light enough that you forget it is in your pocket. Its held up fine for everyday use including diving, fishing and boating in saltwater environments and is still sharp enough to handle any task. I highly recommend this knife.The above was my review before I tried to use my knife and the blade broke in half. For the price, I wish it were a little more durable. Before that happened I was very pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great knife","review":"This knife is VERY sharp and very strong. The grip feels very sturdy even though it is extremely light and the lock is a nice feature. I've carried this knife for months now and haven't had any problems with it even though I've dropped it on MANY occasions. My only problem with it is that it's starting to get a little dull and the blade is starting to get little nicks in it and is not nearly as smooth of a cut as it used to be. That's most likely my fault though from dropping it on a steel floor at work. If you're thinking about this knife, don't hesitate. Get it now. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Knife","review":"This is a great knife! It has been my every day carry knife for over two years, I use it everyday and it is still in perfect shape. I was a little worried about its size because my last knife was a lot thinner, but I got used to the thickness very quickly. Mine is not the tanto style blade but I'm considering getting another one in this style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Lightweight Knife","review":"I normally carry a Cold Steel Recon 1 Tanto and have gotten used to the weight of that knife. When I picked this one up, I thought it was going to break due to being so lightweight! It didn't, it hasn't, and I am very pleased with this knife. I wish they had this particular knife in a half-serrated tanto blade. I look forward to many great years with this knife as I got out of the Cold Steel."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Failure rate","review":"I have purchased three of the DWL-2700AP.

Boring, self-conscious... basically, not worth a look. If you like the subject matter, I highly recommend Jock Sturges (for some very laid-back, pretty pictures) or Sally Mann (for some slightly more disturbing overtones.) But skip Hamilton, he's a waste of paper"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is really funny.","review":"This is a story about two kids who take a trip to Japan. The writing style is really humorous, and yet it is not not silly. It uses puns and a wonderful descriptive style in ways that are really original.

This is a good book to read out loud at bedtime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encapsulated creativity","review":"Maira Kalman does a wonderful job of capturing her reader's imagination and eye. She has a very playful graspe of the English language. Her style is envigorating. Children and adults are captivated by the rhythmic storytelling.

With little or no explanation to the hokey 'monster', you spend the entire time not understanding how it exists, how Rooker came to the lake his whole life and never saw it, why it waited until it was stuck under the ice before hunting humans, why it wounds first or sometimes kills, why why why....Sure, some creative license is understood in a low budget horror flick, but this one just goes to far - wait until the ending if you are not convinced I am correct. You reach a point of not caring about the characters or whether this creature lives on to kill another day. Dare I mention that the creature is a modern ripoff of the Creature from the Black Lagoon..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually Masterful Underground Cinema","review":"Visually masterful underground cinema. The bleak, but beautiful setting of the frozen lake is warped by a minimalistic luciferian score. The pacing is hypnotic, at times slow, but meditative.I enjoyed the plot, which was a tongue-in-cheek combination of fishing, family drama, and horror. It was a weird mix of exactly what you'd expect and complete ridiculousness. It could use some more tits and more gore, but maybe that will happen in part 2.The acting is b-movie camp outside of Michael Rooker and Amy Chang. You've got to listen closely to grab some of the bizarre stuff the characters say with straight faces.It seems that swimming below the traditional genre flourishes there is a subversive social message. I definitely didn't watch it for the relevant message, but instead enjoyed it for the eerie tension and creepiness.This is my favorite McKenney film with Automatons trailing close behind it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...","review":"I wish I could have given this movie a negative star.

Unfortunately, the film takes itself way too seriously including a creature that is an actor in a silly looking scuba diver's suit!Venerable character actors Michael Rooker and Blanche Baker give adequate performances in cliche-driven roles and there is a certain eeriness in the snowy landscapes.

I have been monkeying with computers since 1985. I wanted to get current in a hurry. The book looks well put together and easy to understand with good pics. I like the way the information is presented. It looks like it was written with great care and honesty. Not a bunch of BS. You need the buyers guide to go with it. It's cheap, more up to date and a great reference. The writers admit that the book needs a supplement and the buyers guide does that. It is probably not possible to put everything you need in one book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book!","review":"I found this book to an excellent tutorial on building your own PC. The book actually goes through building 5 different machines optimized for 5 different applications. It explains in clear understandable language the requirements for each system and the components chosen to build each one. The authors explain why they chose the parts they picked and the tradeoffs they went through during the constuction of these systems with enough detail that the reader can build a similar system with different priorities on the tradeoffs and wind up with the perfect system. I am an experienced PC builder and I found the information useful and I learned somethings I didn't know. I feel the book is well written so that even someone with no experience building a PC could successfully complete any of the projects described in the book. There are many useful constuction hints and lots of pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book is an excellent overview","review":"\\"How to Build a Perfect PC\\" is a very good overview, but PC's and components are forever changing - so to be entirely pertinent, this is the type of book that requires frequent updates. If you're building your own, you'll find that with all the accompanying instructions and manuals, you go into sensory overload trying to determine the proper way to do your build-out and then make everything work. The most difficult aspect of building a new computer is your wiring and cable management. Make a wrong selection/choice and the system undoubtedly won't work, as expected. This book helps to make you think you can do it, but later on you may find yourself treading dangerous waters. I'm at that point now with my system, and I'm going to have to do a lot of serious reading in the component manuals before I complete my final wiring hook-ups and venture to plug it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed Novice Builder","review":"I am a fan of Make but was dissapointed in the book because it is so out of date. There is a long lead time between completion of a manuscript and publication of a book. The parts lists, price information, and even some instructions are out of date and inconsistent. The overall ideas in the book are good, but maybe this is a project that should be published as an online guide where updates are dynamic. As a novice builder, the first thing I did was flip back to the budget PC parts list, log-on to NewEgg, and discover the parts are not available. I was dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good yet NOT PERFECT","review":"I like the book, thought it was very readable and gave good advice. But I was often disappointed in that none of the PC configurations in the book worked out to be \\"perfect,\\" as the title suggests. In almost every instance -- from the mainstream PC to the gamer's PC to the media center -- the authors ran into a major glitch and had to revert to using other pieces of hardware or operating systems. Don't go out and buy any of the components they recommend in the beginning of any chapter, because by the time the machine is built at the end of the chapter, either there was a problem with the operating system or a piece of hardware that wasn't originally part of the plan. In its first edition, it really needs a good edit. Buy the book, hold onto your receipt, read it, then return it. It has some good advice but not enough to keep on the bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!","review":"This book is a very thorough guide that will encourage you to build your own PC. It is simple and comprehensive and leaves nothing to the imagination since it is packed full with color photos. You will be able to see and recognize even the tinniest components and you won't be confused by long text passages of instructions that try to guide you blindly trough complex assembly operations.The authors tell you how and why they chose the component parts of the different systems they graphically build in front of your eyes. What's more, they give you the necessary background so you can make changes according to your needs/wants. Even for experienced technicians it can give you a different perspective on the hows and whys of choosing and assembling components.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I have found this book to be the one, when it comes to understanding the key elements for building your own PC or for getting in to building PC's on a regular basis. It focuses on the direct requirements and doesn't clog up the pages with useless information. They also provide information regarding the quality of different components and recommend brands that they have had success with over the years. The book also has great pictures and illustrations for each step of the process.The part that sold me the most was the fact that it is current (or at least as current as it can be for being a published book), they continue to provide new volumes of these books that are current with today's technology and this issue includes Windows7 OS info all the way up to Intel i7 technology. I have been working on PC's for years and I would highly recommend this book over any other one out there today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unavoidably Outdated, but relevant...","review":"Let's face it- any book written on PC technology will be outdated before it even goes to print. When it comes to assembling a PC, however, it matters very little (from an installation standpoint) what the technology is. Most motherboards install the same way; as do hard drives, video cards, and memory modules- regardless of the tech involved. This book thoroughly explains the essential functions of all of these important components, and how they are installed. If you need brand recommendations, they provide these as well. Each well written chapter contains excellent photos of all of the installations, too. Overall, this is an excellent place to start if you are thinking about building a new PC and never have done so before. New technology can easily be applied to what you learn from reading or referring to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Time Builder - Great Resource","review":"I had never built a computer before, but decided to take the plunge. After a lot of research I bought this book and never looked back. It covers the basics and points you to online areas to round out your information. The chapters are really good in covering from buying, assembly and software. I especially like the straight forward commentary on why one would want one sort of machine or component over another.My computer was built in a day and a half, works perfectly and I am ready to help friends. The advantage in do it yourself is the much higher quality you get in the final product. This book is the only one you will need. It is easy to read, follow and gives lots of good advice.

The illustrations are on heavy glossy paper and are magnificent. There are very nice, free readings of this work online, and so I purchased the book for my young children to enjoy - to read while listening to the narrator. My only complaint is the book is abridged. This is not evident from the description. I think most editions of this work are abridged. When the book ended, I was left wondering what became of Friday, as he is not mentioned again after the final battle. The author did not seem like one who would leave out that detail, and so I discovered the unabridged story is longer.

DeFoe's ability to conjure up the day to day survival struggle in such great detail was the epitome of creative inspiration. To understand Robinson Crusoe's journey and motivation is to appreciate one's own and even on a broader scale, to understand human nature. Personally, the lesson it reinforced in me is that self-esteem stems from overcoming obstacles and attaining wisdom as a result. And his being grateful to Providence is a celebration of divinely or spiritually inspired action that cannot come from without but has to come from within."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adventure","review":"Robinson Crusoe By Daniel DefoeThis book is about adventure and survival. About 300years ago, a man called Robinson Crusoe was shipwrecked on a desert island. This book tells about how he lived there for about 30 years. The character, Robinson Crusoe, is very clever and resourceful. The book describes how he hunts goats and how he built a house and how he makes a boat. This is well written and easy to understand. The setting of the book is on a desert island. The Author describes this island as beautiful and big. Robinson Crusoe was able to survive on this island. When I started reading the book I thought it would be a good book. I was so excitied when I was reading this book. I would recommend it to anyone who likes survival and adventure. Since it's written in so many different versions, a person almost any age can read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"???????","review":"Obviously a classic.

If you are, Fine by me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Robinson Crusoe readings.","review":"Everyone knows the story...so the issue is who can read theliterature in a compelling way. Clearly, Martin Shaw has the touch. My only criticism is that this audio Cassette should be made into an audio CD for most modern listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crusoe is the Best!","review":"Robinson Crusoe is one of my favorite books that illustrates in some detail what it would be like to survive on an island alone after a shipwreck. The are some similarities to the Classic book Swiss Family Robinson but this book does a good job placing the reader's mind on the island."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something we all feel we ought to read.","review":"As the first English novel ever written, Daniel Defoe's novel is perhaps worth reading merely as something that all cultured people ought to have read. However, the book has few literary merits on its own - it's alternately abrupt and tedious, and has a poor plot. Evidently, authors improved at writing fiction in English over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literary Analysis of Robinson Crusoe","review":"This wonderful saga of survival and self determination is about an English gentlemen who was only looking for adventure on the high seas, but found himself shipwrecked and alone on a deserted island to live almost a half of a lifetime in a solitaire world with only the prescence of Daniel DeFoe's excellent penmanship to follow him. {Backed by great historic and geographic knowledge for the time (1719), DeFoe adds perfect setting, and sets moods that add realistic life to the story.}"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performances.","review":"Many of my of you state side will no doubt recognise Miss Routledge form \\"Kepping up Appearances\\" in which she played the social climbing Hyacinth Bucket \\"Bouquet\\". These poignant and touching monologues demonstrate the range of her acting skill.Originally shown as part of a series called, \\"Talking Heads\\" and \\"Talking Heads 2\\", they are enthralling works.I would recommend you see all these works featuring other actors such as the late Thora Hird, Penelope Wilton and Julie Walters. The plays were considered so good and important, they now feature on the national school circulum in England for English studies."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed . . . to say the least","review":"I am a fan of Patricia Routledge but have to say that I was very disappointed in Three Portraits.

I like her interaction with other actors much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"For what it's worth","review":"\\"There's something happening here; what it is ain't exactly clear\\" is how a lot of people felt by the late 1960s. What I liked about \\"Circles\\" is the way Baker catches the zeitgeist of the time: the intensity of the way people felt, the confused struggle for some kind of clarity and improvement -- in society, in themselves. What I also liked is her sense of humor. The book is peppered with throwaway lines like this one about middle-of-the-night anxieties: \\"You start with a single bill that you can't pay till the next paycheck and end up keening over the fate of all abandoned kittens everywhere.\\" I think this writer has a real eye for the cinematic, too. - There's a big scene toward the end where some plans start to unravel for the characters that reminded me a lot of that scene in \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\" where Al Pacino is working the crowd with cries of \\"Attica! Attica!\\" The whole book is very visual, funny, sad, idealistic -- a lot like the times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up Up and Away","review":"I saw this back in 1991, it was originally titled \\"The Blimp Is Back\\". It has nothing to do with flying the blimp, but actually tells the resurgance in interest in blimps from the military to hopeless romantics building dirigibles. Features Roger Monk, the modern day version of Hugo Eckner. It's very good and entertaining. The first half deals with the early history of airships. The second with the modern era of blimps. There are more blimps flying today than ever before, but the military still isn't interested, and probably never will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Action Pack Game","review":"This game is excellent a wide range of weapons available there are tons of codes u can get for this game there are real weapons they use in the army and one of the best games ever made there are so many army games u can buy out there i hope u order this game its at a great price.

By focussing on specific concepts and themes throughout each show, children learn the basics through repetition and creative playing.

Kids are positive and big grins on their faces when they are told they are \\"smart\\" and \\"excellent\\" etc, by Steve. We have a 2 year old and she absolutely adores these videos.

During combustion, the manganese is liberated from the compound. This manganese vapor is then deposited on your spark plugs and in the fine mesh structure of your catalytic converter. The deposits in the catalytic converter can significantly obstruct exhaust flow and impede the ability of the cat to do its job wrt NOx emissions.That's unfortunate, since I've tried a variety of other (cheaper) brands and store-brands of octane booster, without much improvement -- but this stuff actually works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going through the eye of a needle","review":"For those of us that recognize the need to change, this book is a must read.

For a seminar style class focused generally on how to maintain a moral compass while practicing law, I thought the majority of the articles within this book to be very out dated. For example, when reading in 2009 about the advancement of african american attorneys in the legal profession, I don't want to read arguments written in 1990 that are based on studies from the 1970's. I suppose that's not the book's fault, but rather a problem with the pairing of this text with that specific class.

I found that my dog could be allergic to corn or chicken and it would be best to cut that out of his food all together. I found this brand at Petco and ever since we went to this vegetarian formula he has been *basically* allergy free!! He's like a whole different dog!!! Clear eyes, clear skin, lost a bunch of weight, runs around with his brother like they were puppies all over again, doesn't smell and hasn't needed to go back to the vet for his ears!!!

This food was recommended by a friend so we tried it out and my beagle loved it. Granted, he's a beagle and will eat anything. But, I noticed huge improvements in his health after eating this food. He would often vomit after eating when he ate an omni diet and have digestive issues. He was never a dog that could eat meat straight up without getting sick, so perhaps he was sensitive to even the high end food with meat in it I had him on before this. He has rarely thrown up since having him on vegan food, if at all. It's been so long I can't remember. His weight has been easier to manage, and he has a nicer coat and even better smelling breath! All his vet visits have been great. I totally recommend vegan diets for doggies and specifically this brand of food.

I now feed them a mixture of Natural Balance Vegetarian and V-dog food.

As implied from the title, it manages to set quite a stage for the UN being the mastermind behind all American mishaps. While the facts were one-sided as expected, they were very sensational and some of the chapters were a bit overly dramatic for my taste. The UN is obviously not the most perfect organization in the world, however, the half truthes and twisted facts are not a fair description of the UN or its place in the world.

Nonetheless, Minneapolis-based Connie Evingson pulls off this difficult task, and does it with grace and aplomb. This should be no surprise given Evingon's enormous talent. While she uses similar arrangements, she doesn't try to sound like Lee. Her voice is deep and sultry like Lee's, but it's also somewhat lighter. To her credit, Evingson's tribute is not only to songs that Lee sang, but to also to those Lee wrote, reminding us that the multitalented Ms. Lee was also a composer of note. This is good stuff and should be on the shelf of everyone who enjoys and appreciates the vocal art."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Well-Crafted Tribute","review":"Connie Evingson's cd, Fever, is truly a tribute to Peggy Lee that foregoes the notion of imitation being the sincerest form of flattery. While not straying far from the jazz style used by Ms. Lee, Ms. Evingson puts her own stamp on these classic tunes, singing them with the high level of craftsmanship they deserve. Evingson does an excellent job in enunciating the lyric and bringing across the mood of the song whether it be soulful, sultry, or sunny. Her musicians provide excellent backing, in particular Dave Karr on the reeds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tribute to Miss Lee falters","review":"Miss Evingson's lithe, restrainted, clear voice is a nice listen, but she falters in this tribute to Peggy Lee , who was a perfectionist when it came to just about everything on her recordings. Everything from the song selection to orchestrations seems off on this outing. \\"Is that all there is?\\" comes across as a plodding hokey reworking of Lee's life long question and it lacks Lee's ambivalence. \\"I'm Gonna Go Fishin'\\" included here is also out of place and the Peggy-penned \\"I Love Being Here with You\\" comes complete with a clunky clarinet solo and lacks Lee's easy going sultry styling. Evingson, however, should not be faulted for paying tribute to Miss Lee, though her attempt, while admirable, doesn't measure up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imitation vanilla","review":"Blonde hair and pipes does not a legend make. Ms. Evingson has a voice, yes (more cabaret than jazz).

Actually, I'm surprized Weber's book isn't getting more attention for its post-modern, writerly-conscious antics. At first I thought I'd hate those shennanigans but, truth to tell, they grew on me and I came to thoroughly enjoy this bifurcated, multi-conscious, novel.That po-mo stuff aside, this is a fluidly readable novel that pulls in the reader with tenaciously fascinating hooks. Finest kind of reading. Save it for a good time, or read it right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, original novel","review":"Katherine Weber is a novelist who successfully and miraculously achieves both depth and humor as she combines sophisticated fictional ideas with a story full of moving, compelling characters. This is not only a terrifically fun book to read, but skillful and profoundly intelligent. A lively romp somewhere between invention, playfulness, and very real sorrow. As a contemporary family story unravels, so, too, the reader is taken on a journey through allusion and time, back to the orginal \\"Little Women\\". The effect is mesmerizing. What a gifted writer. I can't recommend this highly enough! It is so rare to find a book that is erudite, full of luminous language and turns of phrase, and, at the same time, an engaging, lively, and brilliantly-constructed read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upscale 'Chick Lit'","review":"This is an often boring piece of upscale \\"chick lit.\\" It is sprinkled with all too frequent bits of literary reference to encourage the reader think she is well-read. The characters in the family are stereotypes. The narrator Jo is 17 and writes like a smarty pants juvenile. The story is interrupted periodically by comments on the plot from the other sisters. After much scene setting the plot begins on about page 90. It ends more or less happily on page 240,."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to sympathize with snotty brats","review":"I wanted to like this book, but it's hard to enjoy when the whole concept just irritates you to no end. Blech. The sisters were snotty, pretentious, brats who were butting their noses in a place they didn't belong. I had no sympathy for them at all, I didn't care what happened to them. It's hard to enjoy a book wheen the whole time you're shouting at the characters to stop being babies and start acting like adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Names and Dates...","review":"I was very disappointed in Mr. Lewis' recap of Argentinian history. It read much like a high school history text: with all the key dates and important political figures but very little context and no depth to keep the reader engaged. Dry in tone, nothing but the facts and not much to keep the reader engaged. Ugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Edison","review":"Written 45 years ago, this biography is still the best we have on the great inventor. Josephson focuses as much on Edison's work as he does on the man, and the book can be somewhat technical at times. It is natural to compare it to Neil Baldwin's EDISON: INVENTING THE CENTURY, written in 1995, and Josephson's Edison is much more solid than Baldwin's. Baldwin sacrifices the inventions while dealing mainly with the man; Josephson is much more rounded and deals with all aspects of Edison's life. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet little soul keeper this one","review":"The opener In this little Town is like a cute little short story, with a heart to it. It will stay in your head nearly forever, because it has some universal human elements. A narrative structure in story telling that realy hit\`s you in theheart. Restless Heart in a way, as we all some times feels.The other tracks is variable, but worth listen to anyway. It\`s a form for light country rock, which really kicks in gear sometimes like Love Train. There are ballads that Mind of Matters of the heart which really tell universial stories about love and relationships that give every one hope for a better world for all of us. Track 8 Hometown Boy has quality written all over it in the same quality as In this little town has.Restless Heart gives you feed for your soul and your heart all in all. To sum it up with a tempo up beat song Id\`\`cross the line, really gives you something for every taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful!","review":"Trite, hackneyed plot.

With the exception of \\"All That I Am\\",Spinoutdoesn't really have any good songs on it. But at least \\"Stop, Look and Listen\\", \\"Adam and Evil\\", \\"Never Say Yes\\" and \\"Spinout\\" are fun, in a dumb kind of way. On the other hand, \\"Beach Shack\\" and \\"Smorgasbord\\" are just flat out awful. As forDouble Trouble, it's even worse. The only song here that is the least bit intriguing is \\"Long Legged Girl\\". Everything else is terrible, especially \\"Old McDonald\\" and \\"I Love Only One Girl\\".

However, when I set up the phone system, we started getting radio frequency interference (RFI). Essentially the handset cord acts as a radio antenna and we started picking up a local radio station. Imagine trying to have a business conversation while talking over hold music and you'll get the idea. After 3 calls, the tech support people admitted that RCA is aware of this RFI problem but doesn't know how to fix it. They told me that they couldn't correct the problem and to return the phones. Damn shame as this seems to be an otherwise excellent phone system.

No descriptions are given as to what kinds of players could fill the roles in each of the systems. No details are given on how different situations are dealt with given different player alignments.

Being a professional musician, I think it sounds tinny with lots of high end, moderate low end, and absolutely no midrange. There is no way to adjust the midrange EQ response. Also, the volume control is inconveniently located on one of the satellites on a touchpad. The bass adjustment is on the back of the sub and is a knob. They should have at least put these controls close to each other, not to mention how different the adjustment controls are.

Do yourself a favor: unlike me, research this product BEFORE you purchase it.

At first, after an easy 5 minute setup, I couldn't get any volume to speak of. Reading the manual showed me two very small metal volume controls on the front-bottom of the right speaker. A few pushes of these \\"clips\\" and the volume was house filling. I would recommend these Soundstick II's to anyone who likes to hear the instruments in all their beauty. Besides the sound, the 3 piece set is a work of art. there is nothing average about these speakers.

Until they come off you will start hearing an annoying rattling sound and you will not be able to play your music because of it.

If these cost too much, but you still want something unique looking, try the JBL Creature II speaker set. It ranges $60 - $100.A few things you cannot tell from the product description:> These speakers (Soundstick II) are compatible with PCs. The original Soundsticks were only for Apples.> The casing, though plastic, is very solid. I can't tell how scratch resistant it is though.

There is a standard speaker jack which makes the system plug-and-play easy with almost any audio device. I use them for my laptop, my portable CD player, my iPod Shuffle and my Napster MP3 player. The sound is incredible and if you like to do voice recordings, you will like the quality playback sound these speakers have to offer.

Amazon had them for about half the price. I bought them to have a good sounding system to hook up to my ipod touch, for use around the house. They sound fantastic for that application. Only two drawbacks in my opinion - I would rather have a volume knob than the touch sensors, and there is a mess of interconnecting wires to worry about if you have to move these around. I realize that they are probably designed to be set up in one place and left there, but i like to move them around when cleaning or exercising.

The speakers do work, but the sound is mediocre at best, and every month a new piece breaks, even though all it does is sit on a shelf.Here's the kicker- there is NO POWER BUTTON. If you want to turn it on or off, you have to unplug it. If you have your laptop connected to it and you want to use headphones instead, you better completely unplug it, or you will have feedback noise blasting at you. Someone said in a review here that it is designed to stay on all the time.Why?Why waste electricity?Why have an annoying purple light on all night (the speakers glow purple)?If you life in a studio apartment like me, you might be very annoyed with a glowing purple light that has no business being on.A ridiculous design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small price, big sound!","review":"If you want a decent pair of speakers for a den or a bedroom, these speakers are perfect!The base is adjustable on the unit, so in case the boom is too loud, you can tone it down.I really enjoy the sound quality for the size of the unit.

The speakers are nicely directional, which means I can enjoy cranking it up and the rest of the household doesn't have to play along! My stereo system mostly sits quietly now.

However, if you're interested in anything else that doesn't involve heart thumping base and are willing to dish out a little more to hear what the artist really intended on you hearing, these are the speakers for you.

They sound great with deep bass-intense music, like old R&B;, but sound terrible for any music with significant sound in the higher end of frequency spectrum (nearly every pop & rock song). Music with a lot of sound in midrange and higher frequencies sounds very tinny - really just terrible. I will probably return them. Such a bummer, because they do look VERY cool.The instructions make it clear that the sound from these speakers is highly directional, so I've tried adjusting the position several times. This is not a positional issue. This is not an equalizer issue. The satellite speakers simply have a very harsh sound in the high frequency range. Almost like they are distorting. I cannot recommend these speakers to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"decorative and versatile","review":"The sticks are hanging upsidedown from their donut shaped bases in the corners of my RV. They are slim and attractive as wall corner decorations.

The subwoofer is a bit overpowering, so I have it turned below average volume. The soundstick controls take a little practice. I didn't realize they work just by being touched. Nice.Perfection would be a remote control that can access both the sticks and the subwoofer, but I bought them knowing they don't have even a wired remote.

My only complaint is that I use it with my laptop and plug/unplug quite a bit and I have to turn the sound down every time cause it makes a really loud pop if I don't. The sound is really good altho it's not going to rock a 2 story house or anything. My place is tiny but I wouldn't recommend it for a big space. Bass - if that's your thing probably not the best. But for ME - it's great. I'm not a techno nerd and the sound is clear, clean, melodic and no static..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I really love these speakers. The fidelity of the bass is terrific (as per \\"Come on Closer\\" by Jem, say).

More like being in a concert setting than hearing sound from a box.Quibbles? The volume controls are nearly impossible to find, but that makes them inconspicuous once you've found them! The subwoofer is not tiny in terms of fitting under a desk (12\\" diameter). If you can't imagine yourself fidgeting with the fishbowl in stockinged feet you might pass on this item.

The sub works real well to put under a desk and then have the tweeters on top, fills the whole room with decent bass. The woofer does get a little distorted at a very high volume but not at volumes necessary for a bedroom/dorm/computer room. The power button is also a bass adjustment nob so if this does happen you can just turn the woofer down a tad. The power button is on the woofer which is slightly inconvenient but works fine for me. The volume is on one tweeter and it works great, very responsive. The combination of clear housing and the blue light makes the speakers look sick, I get a lot of compliments for them.

The machine is used lightly by the staff at my company (maybe 1.5 hours use a day at best). Maybe we had a particularly weak machine or lower quality machine where the welds weren't done properly. Other than this issue, it's a nice machine to use. Very comfortable.Anyway, if you're a professional gym outfit, be wary. Make sure you get a warranty!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Different! Probably better suited for adults.","review":"The art is wonderful, I guessed it was a story suited to my daughters age (4). The book looks really beautiful! It is a large book with fancy writing and cute bunny-like characters. After reading it to my daughter, who quickly pushed it away, I wasn't sure which of us was more confused!! I wanted to know what this book was about! I read the inside flap, and then my friend and I spent a considerable amount of time re-reading and talking out what it meant, line by line. To us, it was actually about distractions in our lives, not appreciating the good times if there were no bad times, frienships, alone time, meditation, truth, etc.. It's a great adult conversation piece.

Ironic, isn't it? The author ensures that we don't miss this rather obvious point by repeating it a few times. The jobs and locations change, but finally the reader realizes that nothing else has, and at heart, our hero is still just a guy who prefers to slop through life except now he can earn a little more money to throw away. Amazingly, Schmitt concludes his greasy saga with a picture of pastoral life, now suddenly a contented man with the unexplained arrival of a wife and daughter. To round out this artificial ending, he tosses in a tearjerker story of his dog's death.(I'm not kidding) Richard Schmitt deserves credit for providing such an honest portrayal of himself, but I don't find that person particularly interesting, and that's the last thing that I would have expected from a story about life in the circus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album Contents","review":"1.\\"Heaven Is in Your Mind\\" (Jim Capaldi, Steve Winwood, Chris Wood) - 3:232.\\"Feelin' Alright\\" (Dave Mason) - 4:553.\\"It's for You\\" (John Lennon, Paul McCartney) - 2:024.\\"Nobody\\" (Beth Beatty, Dick Cooper, Ernie Shelby) - 3:035.\\"One\\" (Harry Nilsson) - 3:376.\\"Chest Fever\\" (J.R.

I thought the addition of Hal Horn and Ysanne Isard to the story about Iblis was a particularly good touch.All in all, I gave this book four stars because most of the stories were good, but others(my earlier example and the tale about the two dark Jedi in mind)were just outright unusual and disappointingly strange."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-stop behind the scenes action!","review":"In this book, a collection of stories that range from the main stream story line to the unexpected reaches of imagination and fantasy in the fringes of the Star Wars galaxy, you will find useful information in already written and talked about stories, such as Kyp Durron's redemption, Ysanne Isard's rise to power in the new order, Hal and Corran Horn in their CorSec days, and so forth.

The stories aren't as good as in the Tales from the Empire collection, but Paul Danner's Boba Fett tale makes the book worth buying regardless. Two major dissapointments were Patricia A. Jackson's stories: Longest Fall and Uhl Earl Kohn (or some such nonsense). Longest Fall is about an Imperial getting choked to death by a dark jedi...nothing else...weird. The second is a sequal to her Brandl story in Tales from the Empire. The first Brandl installment was better, but both are really an aquired taste.

A small, enjoyable film about a real-life bronco bull rider named Lane Frost who became a world champion in his early 20s. Cynthia Geary, who plays his wife, sure looks like she is Jessica Lange's daughter. The resemblance is remarkable. And the intense scenes of bull riding. Why on earth would any man want to do that for a living? The film really showed the bone-jarring that goes on, and the very real danger once a man is off. Lane Frost was killed before he had a chance to live. Somehow, just to be the best at bronco bull riding, while providing entertainment for the crowds, does not seem a worthy endeavor to lose your life over. The actor who played Lane's dad, James Rebhorn, has been around awhile, and is very good. In fact, he later starred in the wonderful \\"Babe\\". But Geary is not so very good. She has all of Jessica Lange's woodenness without the intensity inside.

Aishwarya Rai was the highlight--very endearing and charming character she played. I wanted to like the movie more but a big problem I had with it was the lead actor. I found him a bit over the top with trying to be the cute mischievous leading man. Too much winking and smiling for the camera. After awhile it became an annoyance in the film. He's certainly a cutie but taken as a whole--his acting hurt the movie.

It is painful for me to say this because I am a huge EPMD fan but this album is horrible. This came out in 94'?!?!?!?! Look at the other albums that came out that year. Nas' Illmatic, Snoop's first joint, Outkast's first joint, etc. The point is some hot albums came out this year and PMD coming from his background should have fallen right in line with the hotness of that year. The lyrics are weak along with the beats. I thought maybe it was my mental state back then on why I didn't like this release. But I got the same feeling when I listened to it today.

The characters are so memorable, from sweet and innocent Maria, to her mother afraid to tell her where babies come from, to Ol' Grammy, the one-eyed, scary permanent visitor in her home. It doesn't have the quick-paced, action-packed kind of plot that we're used to today, instead we're allowed to savor the slowness of life in the South, which only increases the richness of the story. It's packed with history, and shows what it was like by those who lived it. I love all the references to \\"new things\\" - like the strange new radio that lets you hear far-away people's voices in your own house. It's full of wonderful and often amusing anecdotes about growing up in the 20's and 30's in the South -I know you'll love it too.

But after we got the gun and tried it out, we quickly became disappointed with it. It is very VERY hard to blow bubbles out of it. You have to pull on that trigger for a long time until ANYTHING comes out. And most of the time it's the solution, not bubbles, the solution just runs out of the barrel. VERY hard to form bubbles with this gun for an adult, not to mention a 3,5-year-old kid. And keep in mind, it's 1 bubble at a time! You spend a minute working the trigger and then, if you're lucky, you'll get ONE bubble. So, it's a disappointment. I would recommend to invest in a battery-operated automatic bubble blower, that blows a lot of bubbles at once."},{"rating":"1","title":"my 3 year old cant make bubbles","review":"I have to agree with the other reviews . i to had a problem with the trigger also. i thought this would be a great toy. the no spill holster seems to work great.and the gun only shoots out 1 or 2 bubbles at a time. so my toddler and my dog got board"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea, Poor Toy","review":"I loved the idea of this toy. However, it does not function. You have to pull the trigger quickly and the younger kids aren't coordinated enough to do this. When you do pull it quickly, there are maybe two or three bubbles blown.

This video totally lacks these effects. Master congero Giovanni Hidalgo has some beautiful solos but are not shown during the video. The producers were too busy putting special effects and people dancing that block the performer.

Meaning you don't have a signal on the RF connector when you are playing a tape or selecting a specific channel.I should mention also Samsung technical support is very bad, they have big problem to understand this worldwide VCR.

When switched on, the motor made a loud noise, like it was racing.Samsung's customer support was difficult to contact, and did not get back to me prior to several follow-up calls.Furthermore, Samsung's website is arranged so that the nearest authorized service center appeared to be in suburban Baltimore - not very useful if one lives downtown in Washington, DC, and does not have a car. Further investigation showed that there are actually two repair sites in Washington, one in NE and the other in a Virginia suburb.Samsung clearly has quality and customer service problems that will prevent it from overtaking its Japanese rivals in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps your room warm","review":"I have had the same snow problem as others describe in the reviews. I cleaned the heads -tried everything. One thing the unit does well is heat the room. Samsung produced a portable worldwide heater, capable of warming a small sized bedroom in just under an hour.

It played all of my PAL VHS tapes, and converted them with reasonable (not great, but I didn't expect it to be great) quality. Then, after about 6 months it started \\"snowing\\" and then the whole screen become filled with snow that it basically impossible to see anything on it now. I've also tried to use it to watch my PAL DVDs on NTSC TV, and noticed strange sound drops. Sometimes, for no reason, it would only show video and audio would be completely mute. I've had nothing but problems with it. Samsung *really* should've recalled this model. I would like file a lawsuit on behalf of all people who got fooled the same way as me with this VCR against Samsung. A friend of mine owned the same VCR and his died in less than a year.

The conversion quality is ok, probably better than with most other multi-standard in this price range and definitely better than my region-free DVD player, which produces pauses that are noticeable during fast movements.I have owned this VCR for 5 years now. I returned the first one under warranty for what I thought was a defect, but I now know was the Macrovision protection of my Sony VCR - I looped the signal through the other VCR before it reached the TV. The replacement has served us well for a long time - until my 2 year-old daughter force-fed it a Finding Nemo DVD. The DVD survived, the VCR did not. It does not load/unload cassettes properly anymore. I have been trying to figure out what the problem is, but the mechanics is complicated and fragile. I gave up and I am trying to replace it, only to find out that the sV-5000 is still the best choice out there.

Especially bad seem to be tapes from Disney, Barbie as Rapunzel, The Beauty and the Beast, etc so I thought it may be a macrovision problem but I found out that Beauty and the Beast does not have macrovision protection. Cartoons such as Pokemon 3 were also bad. The tapes we were using were original tapes and when we play them on our other Sony video or Zenith video we have no problems so the problem is in the Samsung machine not the tapes. Disappointing for an ... video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Score based on Quality and customer support experience","review":"I got this device to view European PAL tapes on a NTSC TV set. With the price about 5 times of standard VCR it's obvious that one does not buy it to view NTSC tapes on a NTSC TV set.The quality of the conversation is low and does not satisfy the high price of the device (the image is flickering and areas of same color seem to be pulsating).Samsung customer support refered me to a repair location. I turned the device to the shop they recommended (back in July 2001) and I'm still waiting for a resolution (it's now mid Sept. 2001). Even though I contact Samsung customer support almost daily they do not offer a resolution or at least answers to my questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, but short-lived","review":"A friend of mine and I were both impressed with the features of this system and each purchased one. We used it for NTSC as well as PAL videos, hooked up to a US TV. It was very flexible and offered a great set of features for the price. The high speed rewinding was also a bonus I appreciated. Each of our VCRs broke within 2 years of purchase. It's never a good time for your VCR to stop working, but additionally, repairing the device would have been more expensive than purchasing a new one. I will not purchase this item again and really hope that these features will be available in a reliable VCR in the future. I'm still frustrated and VCR-less (basically we just play our DVDs now). My friend purchased a multi-system TV and cheaper multi-VCR. This item is NOT reliable. I strongly suggest that you not purchase this VCR, unless you are willing to view it as disposable."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad conversion quality--not worth the price!","review":"I have been very disappointed in this product. I bought it to make VHS copies of videos that I have made with my digital video camera and edited. Converting from NTSC gives a low quality product in general. There is a vibration or pulsation in all white or light colored areas which is VERY distracting. But worse than this, when I input from the NTSC video camera and make a copy on VHS (whether converting or not), there is a real problem with the audio. A buzz that intermittantly accompanies the sound--and it was this way straight out of the box. It makes for a very poor quality video and I paid over $500 for it 3 years ago. Unfortunately, I did nothing about it until after the warranty had expired. So I took it to a Samsung repair shop in Rome expecting to pay for the repairs myself. Unfortunately, that wasn't even an option. They told me that it was badly made from the start and there was nothing to be done about it.

It was a bear to figure out how to set up - I am somewhere in the middle when it comes to technical know-how but this one was beyond me.I gave up and let it sit for a year and a half - a very expensive paperweight. Finally got it working, and 60 tapes in it turned to nothing but snow.Needless to say for the $300 price, I was NOT happy. 3 days and a $135 repair job later, I'm back in action. I have 150 tapes to go, and I am hoping and praying this thing lasts on me. I honestly don't expect it to...I am definetly dissapointed in this one. Seems like it needs a lot of massaging to get it to work right, and when it does work, it doesn't last. Unit runs hot - very hot. I leave it right by the A/C to help keep it cool.

At this point in my life, I suppose I ought to be thankful to authors like Erickson, since it was deep immersion in this sort of exclusive writing that finally made me think about what I claimed to believe. There are so many real Christian ways to talk about the idea of God, and though this book is well written and argued (one star), the tunnel-vision in the book really mars it.... Since these reviews aren't places for personal stories, let me just say that, while this book does a wonderful job describing the sort of God fundamentalists want to believe in, once you get past Bible-worship in your life you find it all just too incredible to take seriously. A good book if you already believe all this stuff, but not theological at all and certainly not anything thoughtful. Erickson drags out all the unwieldy \\"omnis\\" and \\"supras\\" for display, but covers no new ground and ends up wallowing in his own presuppositions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"I received this dvd player for Christmas.

Doubtfully a better print will be made and in the widescreen format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for die-hard PECKINPAH fans!","review":"This edition of Deadly Comapnions is a very poor excuse to release his movie for a newer audience. The film itself is a decent western and it is interesting for us that love Sam's films to see his first western. My main concern is the fact that the film is shown in full screen. This shows that even after his death he is still being mistreated by producers and production companies. Most of his film suffer very much from cropping so does this one. I dont mind that it lack any extras but you should at least be able to see it in it's proper ratio. Buy only if you want to see an early Peckinpah film that is real hard to get in these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious video quality.","review":"I rented this on Amazon instant video because I'm a fan of Brian Keith and my mother is a fan of both Maureen O'Hara and Keith. The video quality is so poor we could hardly recognize them. It's like someone taped it off broadcast TV 25 years ago, then copied it from one VCR to another before selling it to Amazon. If it was a terrific movie I'd stand for that, but Peckinpah directs it like a low-budget spaghetti western. Maybe he had a low budget. I'm giving it two stars, one for O'Hara and one for Keith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadly boring!","review":"This was Peckinpah's first directing job on a feature movie after directing some TV Westerns. The result is very poor. Bad storyline, bad acting - nothing much is working out well here. The director was well aware of it - but blamed it on the producers interference in the cutting procedure.

This said, because I recently, 28oct07, bought an official Nordic/Scandinavian release by Futurefilm here in Finland, with a marvelous fine picture quality AND in wide-screen anamorphic format!

He maneuvers among the intellectual set of Britian--insinuating himself into the right circles to enhance is career as he bursts out in laughter at a friend's poetry reading, shows utter disdain toward a group of 'peaceniks\\" and impatiently checks his watch at his mother's funeral since he has more important things to attend to.

The Indestructible Man is mediocre, Tormented is depressing and boring and Horrors Of Spider Island wasn't that memorable either. The extras are the best things about this release. My question is why don't they release the Finnish productions (Day The Earth Froze, Magic Voyage Of Sinbad, Sword & The Dragon and Jack Frost.)?

I've heard stories about the US versions of this player skipping and the European one doesn't but don't take a chance. It skips on new and used DVD's.

I had never purchased a Samsung product before. My DVD-711 had problems right out of the box. The first movie I played froze in several places during playback. The frame would stop for a moment, and then continue. The second DVD I played was a brand new out of the box concert video. After about and hour into the concert, my Samsung simply froze up. The screen was all streaked and the sound was stuttering. When I hit play, it corrected itself, but the sound was no longer in synch with the singer. I returned it to Amazon.com as a defective unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFECTIVE!!!!","review":"This very model of DVD player belongs to my roommate. It skips and freezes often, even on brand new DVDs. Sometimes, after removing a DVD from it, I noticed how hot the disc and player were.

I returned the product and returned home with one that had sound and picture. I got home and hooked up the player a second time. I started playing the movie again and about halfway through it it started to skip constantly. I thought it had to be the movie. I played another movie, the Matrix, and it played perfectly. I also played the Skulls which worked well. Then I tried to play The Cell today and about halfway through it it started to skip so badly that I had to stop the movie.

Once I did some research on this thing I found out that it has serious problems with freezing during the switch of chapters.

Perhaps I just happened to get a bad tape, or perhaps the current distributor does a poor job of transfering; either way, I'm disappointed in the video I received.I also found the movie itself a little dated (that didn't really surprise me).

Although the actress who plays O is quite beautiful, and there are some fairly erotic scenes, this movie is deeply flawed, and I can't recommend it. The plotline gets totally garbled, especially toward the end, to the point where it runs entirely contrary to the book's intention on several key philosophical and psychological points. Second, the actor who plays Stephen is absolutely one of the worst casting choices I've ever seen; doesn't fit the role one bit. So please, read the book.

So it seems it was a challenge and nothing more.I gave this 2 stars because the female lead wasn't bad and because the critic complained that it was disjointed, but it was no more disjointed than the book. I would have given it 1 more star but the ending of the movie wasn't even close to the book. SPOILER ALERT!

This was a time when there was such a thing as an erotic film, that was very very different from porn films. This is a real movie, with lighting, angles and a storyline. It is not just a mindless flesh fest. The main actress Corinne Clery is very beautiful and there alot of other beautiful woman throughtout the whole picture, practically all being seen in the nude. Although sadommasochism isn't my thing, the film still was entertaining to watch. I feel however, that the submissiveness of O, the main character, is not believable for this day and age.

I found the movie rather boring, expect maybe for a few scenes. The total exploitation of a young woman for sex and pleasure will be very disturbing to some."},{"rating":"2","title":"The film does the novel justice!","review":"I am often disappointed with films based on novels. However, this is not the case with The Story of O. Just Jaeckin (of Emmanuelle fame) does an excellent job adapting the eroticism and romance between the protagonists. The game of domination and submission mixed with the true love that exists between the couple is captivating and erotic. Corrine Clery does an excellent job in bringing O to life.

We got a wake her up, chain her up whipping scene, we got a branding (just reaction shots) and some other assorted nudity. Two full and two half stars for the girl-girl scenes and another for the other nastiness, along with a certain amount of credibility for mainstream film reality. I mean, it really looks like they're being whipped.

I wish I'd been able to figure out what sort of self-discovery or personal voyage the main character was experiencing... but this movie tells me nothing. Someone mentioned something about the good musical score of this movie... I like punk and rock music but the music in the movie just didn't cut it for me.

This book is strangely organized and written. I'm not sure if it is a function of the translation, grammer, or my own intellect that makes this book hard to follow.

It took me 10 minutes read a page, and read again, because I truly had no idea what was going on. Every once in a while, you will come across a straightforward statement that really means something. I'm thinking that this translation does a direct translation to English and it just doesn't fit together well.I think it may be my own intelligence that keeps me from following the wording of this book.

But the book does not have all the lyrical aspects of her other books and does not seem as deep or thought provoking as the others. But the book is a good way to start reading Morrison, whose style is extreamily difficult, because it is one of the most linear of her stories.

Please, however, pay no attention to the comments made by the ignorant readers who clearly failed to grasp the message of this rich, wonderful, engaging novel. While I'll admit that this is a complex, challenging piece of literature, it's nothing that the average reader can't handle. I promise you that if you approach this book with an open mind and a willingness to make an honest attempt at comprehending Toni Morrison's slightly abstract ideas, you will be richly rewarded and satisfied. I now consider Ms. Morrison to be one of my all-time favorite authors. I can't wait to read Beloved!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't judge a book by it's surface context","review":"What can I say? The start of this book was very bizarre. Being a teenager I felt insecure reading some of the dirty parts. I discovered as I went on though, that Toni Morrison has an uncanny ability to describe things exactly as they are with brilliant metaphors and a plethora of fascinating word choices. It is evident that many of the sexual scenes and instances of vulgar language do little to advance the plot, but lying closly underneath is a magnificent observance of the human relationship and how it differs from family to family.

In this story she told the story of \\"Milkman\\" Dead and his family. On the surface they are the perfect \\"Nergo\\" family. His father is sucessful landlord and his mother has an impressive family backgound; her father was a doctor. Milkman also had an aunt who was the family blacksheep. Milkman goes through life just existing; he never really lives. He doesn't care about his family, the women in life or his community. Toni Morrison takes on Milkman on a voyage of selfdiscovery that is truly wonderful. In my opinion Ms. Morrison tends to over use metaphors but not this time. Her language was rich and soulful.

I fell asleep about 3 times while trying to finish. I was lucky we had all of Spring Break or else I would never have gotten through it. But after realizing the full circle the characters go through and understanding the lineage, relationships and dynamics of the characters, I appreciated it. Now, the sex is apparent, but nothing as bad as Judy Blume's novels like \\"Forever\\" and \\"Wifey\\". I urge those students who loved the dirty sex talk in this book to check out those great titles. Just don't expect a plot like Morrison gives you. Overall, this book got better, but I would have liked it better if Morrison had added a character wearing lycra. Spandex always adds to the fullness of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third novel a triumph","review":"Morrison's third novel does everything her first two attempted to do.

It took Morrison 3 years to write the novel, and it was well worth the effort and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Range of Morrison's Writing","review":"This being the third book that I read by Morrison, it seems that her range as a writing has kept on growing. I felt involved in the passion of the story as well as in the lives of the characters. Everyone and anyone can take something from this novel, for it is Milkman that should inspire us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading again","review":"I have read this book three times, now, and I find that I get something new from it with each re-reading, plus I have the pleasure of revisiting an old friend. This is probably my favorite Toni Morrison book (Beloved is, in my opinion, somewhat overrated), one that contains many joyful moments along with more serious fare. I recommend it because of the mixture of pleasure and sorrow, anger and reconciliation, humor and ultimately, hopefulness.I think this hopefulness is the key to my enjoyment of the book. There are so many things in a person's history that make them what they are; Milkman's journey as he gradually understands, struggles with, various rejects and embraces his own and his family's history is unique and yet also reflects the struggles that everyone goes through. You can learn a lot from this book; when I first read this book at age 16, I had trouble understanding/accepting the final lines, but I've found them resonating for me many times since then."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book had characters with the courage to survive.","review":"Pilate was one of my favorite characters she developed her own moral code in a world that left her a homeless orphan. Society didn't even afford her the dignity of justice. Yet, she survived with her values in tact. She knew how to forgive others and love herself. But, I couldn't find an explanation in the book as to how she found this great courage. I will reread this book sometime because I feel like I may have missed some of the depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing","review":"Powerful novel, written by one of the greatest authors of all time.

I had hoped to use Oprah's book club to get into reading. I read \\"Song of Solomon\\" and tried another one of her suggestions, but they were just too wierd. I have always read for the enjoyment of it. I don't want to have to analyze a book to try to figure out the underlying meaning. I figure if an author has anything worth saying, they should just spit it out, don't hide it in symbolism and expect people to interpret it the way you intend. I thought I understood this one until I got to the end, but it was beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"7/8 good, ending NOT!","review":"When this book was first published, I had to read it for a Master's Level English Literature Course. In class, I said that \\"I really liked the book until the last few pages. I thought the ending 'stunk'--jumping off a rock and flapping... this is what I mainly remember of the entire book-- and it lost me, and ruined the first part which I thought was good enough.\\" Before class, in the hallway, some of my classmates said what I conveyed but in the classroom, the class members reminded me of \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\", they went along saying it was wonderful to the professor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good resource for Small Business beginners","review":"A great legal resource for anyone who is interested to start a small business.

If I were her I would be embarrased to admit some of the stuff. As for making Mick a lover, I was most interested to hear that Keith is actually a caring person unlike the persona he gives off..

This book was far more, Marianne is a witty and thoughtful writer, it was a hard book to set down. She takes you into the 1960s London scene, and behind the scenes. Her book is interesting, educational, and fun; And was over much too quickly!

By the very exploration of such arcania, there is no detachment and Metzger doesn't pretend there isn't.So many books on these subjects are either uncredible as crack pot advocacy, or conversely are snarky oh-so-cynical jabs at the subject's expense.

A lot of good people in it. Look for Robert Klein as one of those college radicals who puts his hands to his ears and shakes his head when he is \\"blown away\\" by anything \\"far out\\" and Wow!\\"Glad to see it on DVD, but the \\"artwork\\" is horrible; it looks like a cheap exploitation film with the tight close ups; the VHS copy looked a lot more dignified. Why don't the studios just put the original theatrical poster on the DVD case? These \\"artists\\" with their \\"interpretations\\" of a film's content always seem to miss the point of the film. Let them create oversize pictures of Big Macs; that way, their junk will be appropriate and justified."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty cool early 70s \\"B\\" Flick","review":"Saw this as a second feature on a double bill back in the 70s and it stuck in my mind. A bit dated but certainly the story is still relevant - a young guy (the \\"rebel\\") stands up for what he believes and gives up a privileged life as the price for his beliefs. Amazing to see Michael Sarrazin and Barbara Hershey when they were so young! As long as you're not expecting Shakespeare this movie provides a fairly entertaining 90 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever Happened To Michael Sarrazin","review":"Not him personally, but whatever happened to his career? He seemed like such a fine actor in \\"They Shoot Horses, Don't They\\" and \\"The Reincarnation of Peter Proud.\\" He's fine in this film too but once again, the 70s version of the \\"rebel\\" who won't conform to society (or society that won't conform to him) seems a little dated.

The pans are heavier than others, however, they wear very well, cook amazing and their quality is definitely superior to some of the ones I have tried (T-fal, Emeril for All-Clad, Rachel Ray, and most recently Cuisinart's eco friendly cookware - this was especially smooth for the first few weeks but the coating wore off in no time!). I actually purchased the Circulon Elite Skillets in 8\\" and 10\\", I love the 12\\" griddle and I bought the 5.5 quart pan.

We must read it 5 times a day or more, maybe much more, with him asking/signing 'more' again. The illustrations, as can be expected, are excellent. Best of all, from a parents point of view, is that it teaches the importance of manners.Given the lack of manners that I often see on playgrounds (by parents!) I think that it is imperative that good manners be drilled (there is the 'd' word) into children when quite young. Good social graces are usually a surer factor of success in life than extra points on an IQ test. There is a plethora of books out about raising bright kids, but markedly fewer about raising polite kids.I picked this title up in a supermarket on a whim, and found it a favorite with our little guy, who already likes to say \\"please and \\"thank you\\" as well as \\"How do you do?\\".

The author of this book is Louis A. Priolo, not Louis Paul Priolo. I made the mistake and found myself on a wild charismatic ride of Christians who must speak in tongues to be authentic Christians, Christians and even automobiles who can be demon-possessed and other tales colored by what I consider bad biblical discernment.I don't discount the story, but I do want people to be aware that this is not only a different author, but a different theology as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid pot but slight cleaning issue","review":"This is a good nonstick pot. A solid weight but not heavy enough to be of trouble for my mom to take from the stove to the sink. Heating appears to be very even throughout the pan. My only gripe is that the handles on each side of the pot are held to the pot by 2 'screws' each (for a total of 4). The heads for these screws however are located on the INSIDE of the pan, and these screwheads are NOT coated in nonstick like the rest of the side of the pan around it, so food can get stuck on it and can be a bit of a pain to clean off."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality cookware","review":"I ordered Circulon Elite 10-Inch Covered Sauté pan to replace my four-year-old Circulon Classic Saute pan.

State of Grace started with a remarkable debut EP that garnered the contract which produced this album, a really fine seamless mix of goth and shoegazer featuring the classically trained vocalist Sarah Simmonds. There are several excellent songs that stand out, but the album works best as a sonic experience to drift through, one of the best of the genre.Unfortunately, the follow up CD didn't work nearly as well and after that I can find no trace of the band or Sarah. But if you like anything like Delerium, that kind of thing, this will be right up your alley. I consider it an essential album, it's that good.

The author's views on women and female sexuality are straight from the Victorian era. As an activist for women's rights in general and prostitutes' rights in particular, I was appalled by the way the author divides women into two categories (the whore and the Madonna, the latter obviously including his wife), and then proceeds to argue that whores should be licensed and regulated by the government.

It's very handy to know where you're going and what kind of vendors, flight points, and other important information is there. The atlas is the greatest guide I own to help me with my travels.

Guess what.......my player also skips during playback.It is really frustrating when you purchase a new piece of electronics and go through the time and effort to hook up all the connections......and end up finding out that the manufacturer has put a product on the market that does not function properly.I guess this is a case where you \\"get what you pay for\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond poor","review":"I've had similar problems as other reviewers, most commonly the picture skipping...often to the point that the movie is unwatchable. Now, for the third time in as many months, the player has stopped reading discs altogether. The one-year manufacturer's warranty has expired, but thankfully I bought an extended warranty from the store. My advice: skip this player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer clear of this one!","review":"The title really says it all: steer clear of this model. I encountered problems in almost every department. The image of DVD movies often froze for a brief moment, causing the visuals to appear jumpy. Sometimes this problem even got worse, making a movie totally unwatchable because the image looked so awful (jaggy, big blocks on the screen at times, constant freezing etc). It even occurred that the player would not accept a DVD disc, which had been played just an hour earlier on that same player. Even with regular audio cd's this wasn't a great player, often rejecting discs or skipping tracks. Biggest disappointment in a DVD player I've encountered so far. Steer clear of this junk and invest your money elsewhere, that's my 2 cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money And Time!","review":"This thing is a piece of garbage. In the first six weeks, this excuse for a piece of equipment: (1) Displayed skips in the video an average of 8-10 times per disk, (2) Developed a mind of it's own and began randomly running through a wide variety of functions (including scene-skipping, pause, fast forward, etc.) after viewing any disk for more than about 30 minutes, (3) Displays arbitrary error messages, (4) Locks up the disk drawer (usually with a rented disk in it!) for an indeterminate period of time, usually DAYS. \\"But it's 'low-cost',\\" you say? \\"These things are to be expected,\\" you say?

Also, their website does not address these issues, and only after speaking to a friend did I find out there was an upgrade for my player -- but after I got the upgrade, I discovered it wasn't the latest version, and both tech support and the service center gave me the runaround. SAMSUNG TECH SUPPORT STILL HAS NOT RESPONDED TO MY LATEST E-MAIL ASKING FOR HELP. I only bought a Samsung DVD player because I was very happy with an old Samsung TV I own. I also own a Toshiba SD1200 DVD Player, which has no problems at all. If you're looking for a DVD player, DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG. Please, don't put yourself through all the frustration I did. Please feel free to e-mail me with any questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"SKPNG","review":"I bought this DVD for all the cool features it packs with its low price. It worked well for the first few DVDs I viewed. But then it started skipping. It not only skips a few frames, but entire scenes at times. The skipping is usually prominent when the DVD Player has been running for some time. I also recently got a laptop with a DVD ROM. I then put the DVD which was skipping in the Samsung DVD player into the laptop DVD ROM and it did not skip. So it is not happening just because the DVD may be bad. However, I liked the video quality and the zoom feature. The audio tends to be very low and I can barely make out the words at times. The remote although tiny is manageable. I would really be happy if Samsung has a fix for the skipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skips, Freezes, Pixelates","review":"I bought the Samsung DVD611 DVD player about two weeks ago. I noticed that with the first couple of movies we watched the scene would freeze briefly or skip. Since we were watching rented DVD's, I figured they had gotten pretty scratched up. Last week, we bought a DVD and tried it out. It worked fine until about the middle of the movie. The scenes skipped, froze for several seconds, and pixelated over and over again. Needless to say, I'm sorry that I was swayed by the low price. I'm taking this one back as soon as possible and will be getting either the Toshiba or the Sony that everyone is raving about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice!","review":"I have been toying around with purchasing a DVD player for quite some time. Since I don't have the money to buy a top of the line player I did some research and decided on the 611 from Samsung. It is a marvelous DVD player for someone that doesn't want to drain their wallet. Befor writing this review I read the description that Amazon gives this player. I do not agree with any of the bad things said about it. I played Mission: Impossible 2 on it last night and it sounded as good as it looked .

I really didn't have a lot of extra scratch and I am still jealous of my 1,000+ VHS titles, mostly studio editions. I figured that I had thirty days to let this baby prove itself and it did. The picture and sound are phenomenal on my 27\\" SONY with SONY Pro-Logic Surround Processor. Skipping has been almost non-existent, even after heavy use (yes, there have been one or two very slight 'freezes' on most discs but the sound stays on track so it's not a major inconvenience).

We thought it might be the DVD, so we exchanged it for the same movie at Blockbuster and found the same problems. It would even skip in the exact same scenes.It has a lot of nice features like 32X FFWD and RWD. Also, 2X and 4X magnification. Not to mention DTS and Dolby Digital compatible. I just can't live with the skipping though.I guess with a lower price you compromise quality. Sticking with the larger name brands like Sony, Pioneer, Panasonic, Toshiba, or Sharp seem like a much better and safer bet."},{"rating":"1","title":"skippy","review":"I was very pleased when I purchased this product, price, features, ease of use. After playing a few discs I made a horrible discovery, this thing skips at will. Instead of bringing it in for repairs, I brought it back to the store for a Toshiba model. $20.00 more, but no skips, not one. buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice price to pay for skips","review":"I purchased this player based on price and a history of positive experience with Samsung. However, I returned the player after 2 frustrating weeks of skipping. I could deal with an occasional blip, but by the end of 2 weeks, I tried to watch a movie that skipped in every scene. I'll try a more reliable DVD brand next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cry of the Innocent","review":"Great movie.

Taproot is a good bad, however didn't sound the best live, but their cd sounds awesome. Unloco and Chevelle both sounded pretty good on the cd and were very easy to get into and enjoy the music, good balance between vocals and music so you can understand the lyrics.We all know Disturbed is an incredible band. Powerful vocals, great guitar riffs, very talented band. This live performance was nothing less than that. They remade Fade to Black by Metallica which was incredible. The intro to their performance was very well done. The content and song choice was excellent, powerful and intense vocals with their well known beats and guitar made this cd definately worth while.Throw in the DVD for 5.1 surround on all the songs, turn up the volume, and enjoy Music As A Weapon"},{"rating":"2","title":"good CD","review":"The other artists (besides disturbed) I liked and ended up getting some of their CD's so if you like metal and don't know all the bands on this you may want to get it or if you just don't have the majority of these songs already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet","review":"Disturbed, Chevelle, Taproot, and Unloco, not a very good combination, since the only awesome band is Disturbed in there. The only song I like from the other bands is 'The Red' by Chevelle.

Later I tried to find it and only could remember that the author's name began with a C and her brother's name was Colin. So began a search, before the internet, in gigantic books of children's literature in the C section. Finally the internet found me a copy some 45 years later.

I remember it was about a spoiled little girl and that it was strange and wonderful. I tried to find it years later to no avail. Bookstores, libraries, out of print services, nothing. I began to think I imagined the whole thing. I would have recurring dreams of going to my grade school library and searching the shelves. In my dream I would go right to the very spot on the shelves. I could even read the surrounding titles. Pinch me, am I dreaming now?

I vividly remember reading this during Christmas time, curled up on our couch with the lights on the Christmas tree, reading this book for at least the second time. I even remember that the cover, without the dust jacket was a peachy-tan color. Alas, I don't recall alot of the plot, but I do know that I was able to retain the title with great clarity for over thirty years. My kids are too young to enjoy this book yet, so I will re-read it now and they can enjoy it in the furture. I am currently reading the Harry Potter set of books and that made me recall books that I wanted to read over and over again, as so many young Harry Potter fans want to do now.

In my defence, I took the fact that there were only a few copies of this book left to be a good sign, instead of considering the other possibilities: a) a sign that many a good chick-lit fan had been duped by the blurb on the back cover; b) the result of a short, and inconsequential press-run.That being said, it's not that bad. There were a couple times while reading this book that I was impressed by a well written metaphor, or some such flash of brilliance on Monroe's part. However, these were greatly outnumbered by the amount of times I had to drop the book to groan in disbelief at another romance novel cliché.

Other daring episodes include \\"The Protector\\", where the guys find out that Erin's niece Amy was molested as a child and take steps to help her on the road to recovery.Other daring episodes include \\"Tommy's Not Gay\\", where his father comes out of the closet, and \\"The Visit\\", where Titus' mother returns . . . well, I don't want to give everything away, in case you haven't seen it yourself.I'm eager to add this set to my DVD collection, and plan to spend my down time watching Titus, instead of some trashy reality show.

It almost seemed as though the writers sensed that the show was on the chopping block and tried to cram more melodrama in before they were cancelled.

That's one mighty unlucky teen. I understand that Christopher Titus had an unusually rough childhood, but this was completely over the top.

I also supplemented this with a college textbook, which I don't believe I needed...probably wasted my time. CLEP tests are not that difficult; they're well worth the $50 or so. I passed with 16 points above the required 50 and had 42 minutes left on the clock. I saved $350 and spared myself the 3 hours a week in the classroom plus study time.

Most of the time it looks like bad digital cable or internet streaming. Blocky and poor contrast (look at the One video, for instance, YUK!).In addition, my copy (in Canada) was not compatible for 2 channel stereo playback. So, if you don't have a surround system, but play it through your TV or stereo, you will get a horrible sound quality. Everything has an echo to it, as the vocal channel was mixed so low and the background so high. In Electrical Storm, for instance, there is a constant whine of stupid background noise, and Bono's vocals are lost in the background. This is the case for most, but not all of the tracks.What a pitiful effort by the world's most filthy-rich band.Save your money on this one.

Katan comes off as a \\"whole\\" person in her writings, which isn't something we often see with lesbian 'characters.' She's not just a lesbian or a cancer patient, but also a daughter, sister, lover, friend, coworker, student, etc. A great, fast read.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"A different book ... a different perspective on cancer","review":"I saw a short article announcing the book's release in a magazine and thought it would be an interesting read, because you seldom see a humorous look at something we deem as \\"not a joking matter\\". WOW! Let me say, this book is more than just about someone getting cancer. It's about family and friendships and no matter how quirky your family is and how toxic some relationships are, you can still come out on top even when you've been hit not once, but twice with a life threatening disease. Tania is my hero. Very inspiring story. You'll find yourself scolding her in some parts and emphatically cheering her on in others. I definitely recommend this book.

I wanted to build something very much like this photo. There was not one instruction or reference to this design in the book! There was one instruction for a seat and one for a flower box, but neither one was the design on the cover photo. There were several paragraphs about \\"covering\\" you deck, but they were general \\"things to consider\\" rather than specifics. Amazon allows a potential buyer to view some pages in a book but not others. I didn't find what I wanted in the \\"allowed\\" pages before I purchased, but I have noticed that the best information is frequently omitted in the Amazon preview pages. I am certain I can create a very similar design and drawing myself, but I could have done that without buying the book.

If you buy \\"Mulan\\" it must be for Goldsmith's score, although the interweaving of the few musical numbers from the film are not distracting. The integration is very complete here for a Disney movie. Goldsmith has accomplished something with this score that has renewed my faith in his genius. You can feel the ancient legend of Mulan in this work, the vastness and dignity of China and the desperate courage of the army. Ignore the pop singles and buy this now. Trust me, if you love Jerry, you'll kick yourself for not buying this sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soundtrack!","review":"Beautiful music, beautiful voices, beautiful songs.

All of the 6 songs and the 6 scores on the soundtrack are worth listening to. Also, the music is relaxing and for the most part upbeat. The songs are sung nicely, and the scores are performed well. Additionally, the well orchestrated scores allow you to feel emotions as you listen to the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!!!!","review":"Its a good movie with a good scores.. Lea had proven another entree of her versatility. Donnie Osmond and Steve Wonder are wonderful. The reflection ballad version is perfectly taylor made for Lea Salonga and the pop version for Christina Aguilera. I was disappointed why Coco Lee had a duet with Christina Aguilera but it sounds to me like the music were conjoured. Coco Lee ruined Christina's piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE SOUND & TEMPO OF THE SONG MULAN","review":"THE SOUND OF THE MULAN IS NOT SO GOOD.THE TEMPO IS TOO FAST FOR KIDS & ME TO HEAR.BUT,FOR ME THE SONG SHOULD BE A BIT SLOW LIKE A CLASSICAL SONGS.MAYBE THE SONG SHOULD PLAYED BY A GROUP OF ORCHERSTRA OR SYMPHONY BAND.THE CONDUCTOR OF THE BAND OR ORCHERSTRA SHOULD PLAN FIRST AND THEN START THE SONG OF THE MOVIE MULAN.SO I HOPE THE SONG WILL BE IMPROVED ON THE NEXT MOWIE OF MULAN MAYBE.BYE!BYE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop version a BAD idea!","review":"I don't understand why Disney had to do another version of an already lovely insipirational song. The original song was already perfect with its melodic rhythm and Lea Salonga's clear, lyrical voice, and Disney had to tamper with it by having Christina Aguilera ruin it and turn the song into an-American-Idol-wanne-be-piece! No wonder this pop version didn't perform well in the charts as Disney had hoped it would. Serves Disney right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I don't like this soundtrack at all! I would expect much more from Disney. The songs are horrible!

UGH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Disney Effort","review":"This is the worst Disney album in a long time. The songs lack any of the adult complexity that can be found in earlier Disney albums. The songs are cold and the lyrics sound as though they have been written by children rather than talented lyricists.They are songs that could capture your heart but fall short. Jerry Goldsmith's score is too heavy and never seems to lighten up for the subject matter.

Songs with an asian background and easy lyrics that are fun to sing along with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Enchanting","review":"With Jerry Goldsmith as the composer, this soundtrack is golden.

The recording does leave out some of the best music from the movie, over all, however it is still great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Soundtrack but . . .","review":"The sound track is excellent. Lea Solanga is outstanding and the selection of music is great. I found only one possible flaw and that was in the order of the tracks. I think it would been a much better flow if A Girl Worth Fighting For was followed by The Burned Out Village. As it stands now the song ends abruptly. The next track is True to Your Heart. The Burned Out Village should have followed \\"Girl . . .\\". The two are connected in the film so I think it proper that they be linked on the soundtrack. I think this is a big enough problem that I decided to downgrade my rating. A little more care and thought into the ordering of the selections would have made for a better soundtrack CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mulan Soundtrack","review":"I would have given it 5 stars except the CD was a little dirty (small spots that cleaned off OK).

I hope Disney produces more albums like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and imanginative.","review":"This soundtrack clearly depicts all of the feeling, emotion, and visions of the movie, especially the instrumental pieces. NOTE: For those of you wondering why the advertisments for Mulan (example: on the Hercules video) have different music than found in the movie or on the soudtrack, it is because the ads were created before the final music was decided upon. The temporary music heard on the ads is from \\"Seven Years in Tibet.\\" Check out the book entitled The Art of Mulan -- it tells about the music and cut characters, but doesn't revel the temporary soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best song ever","review":"After listening to the disney movie song Mulan \\"Honour To Us All\\".We felt that the rythmn is like skipping very insteresting,especially when it talks about the acient china woman need to beared children and a man need to battle for their own country.The songs also talk about how the traditional chinese wedding is held.Other than that,we think that the composer had also made in a lot of effort and decision to suit the movie.We think that the melody is active that we would like to listen the song again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Mainstream Pop out of the Disney CDS","review":"Christina Aguilera has the most annoying and obnoxious voice.

I play it 24/7. Literally. Lea Salonga does a brilliant job with the vocals, and so, surprisingly, does Donny Osmond. My favorite songs are \\"I'll Make A Man Out of You\\" and \\"Mulan's Decision,\\" which is stunning even though the music to the haircut scene wasn't included.

Reviewer Hsu below intimated that he almost cried upon first hearing this; I can tell you that after almost 30 years of listening to Mehta work his magic with this symphony, I still cry every time I listen to it.Zubin Mehta was responsible for a number of excellent recordings for Decca/London during his tenure at Los Angeles.

The brief glimpse at it left such a memory that when I saw this available on DVD, I had to purchase it. Of course, to get the DVD with English subtitles requires one purchase the PAL or region 2 version. It was worth both the price of the DVD and the cost of region-free DVD player (around $50 on amazon.com) to see this in its entirety. Moliere is a sublime experience of direction, writing, acting, cinematography, music, set and costume designs. Thanks to the desire to see this film again, I can now watch other DVDs that are not released in NTSC versions."},{"rating":"1","title":"updated description was too late to help me","review":"Be careful--the reviews may be for a different version of the DVD from what is being sold! And there are several product numbers with the same three reviews. Confusing!Like the other reviewers, I've wanted to see this film again for such a long time! I studied enough French that I thought I could take a chance on a version without subtitles, as the other reviews describe. But the product description said there were subtitles! Great! I emailed one of the sellers and asked if what they were selling had subtitles. I got an automated response that said, in effect, \\"sorry, we have so many DVDs we can not respond to questions about individual ones.\\"Unfortunately the Amazon.com product description at the time I was shopping did not say that it would not play on standard US DVD players. Now it does.But I also see that one of the sellers says it will play on computers! I'm not sure whether to take that chance or just send it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wabi Sabi Subtle","review":"I found this book a bit of a challenge initially because my left, analytical, logical brain was searching for a step-by-step description of what wabi sabi is. Having never heard of wabi sabi, at times I wondered if someone had pulled a fast one me with a spoof of Eastern beliefs and the way Westerners embrace them. As I continued to read I realized that Powell was teaching wabi sabi by writing, shall we say, in a wabi sabi style. He never provides a clear definition, yet his beautiful prose conveys the sense of what wabi sabi is. Powell is a very talented writer, and the book is worth the price just for the prose - elegant, tight, beautiful imagery with sometimes powerful and sometimes subtle metaphors. I would recommend this book as an initial dip into the waters of wabi sabi, with further exploration the responsibility of the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a stretch!","review":"The author has little first hand knowledge of the history or experience of the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"442 Enthusiast","review":"I found this book a disappointment.

My data plate, however, did not match the one depicted in the book. Ironically, on the back cover is an actual photograph of a '69 data plate, and it to does not match what is shown in the book either. I have a convertible, and the book says I should have a vinyl top. The back cover photograph also shows a particular code for upper body/top color which is isn't even listed in the '69 section. If '69 is this inaccurate, what about the rest of the years?I ended up logging on to (the net), and asking for help which I got the next day.I appreciate the effort in trying to show paint colors and upholstery materials, but I'm not sure this book is worth (it).

I found this book to be ridiculously basic. Although it certainly does not harm anyone, this book does not contribute to the available literature or to the professional development of any unfortunate psychologists who add \\"Talk is not enough\\" to their library. I cannot imagine that this book would be helpful to clients or to therapists at any stage of training."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor","review":"My first concern about this author's competence came on page four when he stated that he still passionately believes in psychotherapy. This hardly seems appropriate when there are so many concerns as to its effectiveness. I became even more alarmed when on page ten the author confessed that the book was highly anecdotal. I really became alarmed when I couldn't find any references. I became even more concerned when I couldn't find the phrases \\"placebo effect\\" or \\"natural rate of recovery\\" in the index. I was almost amused when he describes the therapeutic relationship as something quite extraordinary when I've found my years of therapy to have been of questionable value. Moreover, I found it laughable that the author believes that a therapist can objectively determine biases from self-reported data. It seems more likely that a therapist will project such biases."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Excellent Reference","review":"This volume of the Sacra Pagina series is extremely well researched and well written. For the preacher, both the interpretation and the verse notes are very helpful. I use the text for my own sermon preparation and find that the notes almost always provide challenges I can offer the congregation.

If you are a fan of Jazz/Blues, you cannot go wrong buying this CD. The Slow, sultry sound of \\"You go to my head\\" makes you feel like you are sipping mint juleps down by the bayou on a late summer evening. The fast-pased \\"Corrine, Corrina\\" makes you feel like cutting a jig. Best of all, though is the simplistic yet utterly breathtaking sound that is Thomas Newman . His quiet, melancholy score is the bittersweet topping on this classic compilation. I bought my mom a copy after, of course, securing myself one, and she has not taken it out of her cd player since! The only thing that I found wanting was the Bill Evans classic, \\"Peace, Piece\\" was not on the cd. Other than that, it was perfect. What are you waiting for?? GO!

Very little of the actual subject matter -Malcolm X, rarely shows up on his own tape. Instead of showing Malcolm himself speaking, they give us OTHER people telling us what a great speaker Malcolm was. Rather than having Malcolm explain himself, we have a variety of \\"experts\\" explaining Malcolm's beliefs. When you finish watching a tape like this, you can't understand what all the fuss over this guy is about. You don't get a sense of his personality or charisma.Its really annoying how John Henrick Clarke, Joseph X and others are allowed to speak sentence after sentence about Malcolm, but when a clip of Malcolm himself is shown, its often cut after only one sentence.A much better choice is \\"Malcolm X: His Own Story as it Really Happened\\" which was made back in 1972 when the trend in documentraies was to include as much of the original subject mattera as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better M/X documentaries","review":"This is one of the few Malcolm X documentaries that does not require previous reading on the subject to understand what is going on (the also-good \\"Biography\\" segment does a good job too).

I am giving the album 5 stars for the really memorable and melodic songs- all 10 of them are good, my favourite being \\"Sarabanda\\".

What can I say! A synth-tastic electropop debut from what is obviously a talented group of young \\"Spark Rockers\\". It's so good to hear young glammers taking the new wave where it should have gone before it got sidetracked by the angel/devil that was MTV. The sound and songwriting is very reminiscent of Clear Static, some of the Killers, The Modern/Matinee Club, and First Wavers Human League, Yaz, Duran2, and especially the early Vince Clarke-inspired Depeche Mode. \\"le disko\\", \\"Rainy Monday\\", \\"You Are The One\\", \\"Don't Cry Out, and especially \\"Waiting\\" stand out from the other tracks.

He sent me an mp3 of one of thir songs and I knew after listening to that that I had to buy the cd.The only problem I have with the cd is the typo on the cd jacket. The track names listed are not in the same order as they play on the cd. Photograph and Le Disko are swapped.

I bought this album based on so many 5 star reviews and the claim that they were pop synth fun for the 21st century. I was thinking okay Cat, you are gonna like these cats, they are gonna be like space cowboys or maybe even something like pet shop boys or whatever. This album has little substance, this music is \\"lite\\" to say the least, the waning voice of the singer really does not do anything for me. The songwriting itself shines at times but overall the sound of this entire CD is just flat out FLAT. I was just really disappointed and was expecting a much greater showcase of talent. I would have to say bands like Coldplay or Modest Mouse fare much better in this category because these guys are trying to bring back a certain style of music that they obviously do not have the talent to perform."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty mediocre","review":"Just a day prior to listening to this CD for the first time, I listened to a CD from another new band I'd never heard of before, Persephone's Bees. Where I really enjoyed that disc (P's B's) and thought I'd discovered something, with STG I was very bored throughout the whole CD. They SOUND good, but there isn't one song on We Are Pilots that I would consider even close to being memorable.

But honestly, it is arguably the best album from The Shiny Toy Guns. There is a lot of hype for the new album because of there song in a commercial that is a re-make of a David Bowie song called \\"Major Tom\\" But be sure that this album, although it does not have the Major Tom song, is worth every penny. If you like electronic music, you will love this album even if you never heard even one song on it before. I promise you will be hooked on several songs with one listen of the C.D. I might find one album in a year that when I listen through the entire album I can say that I like almost every song. This is one of those albums. There is a great mix of different tempo songs. You will find well written and fun songs to listen to for every mood. There are only two C.D.'s I would recommend you purchase this year. One would be Casey Fallen and the other would be Shiny Toy Guns. You won't regret this purchase. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle availability","review":"The Gap Cycle consists of:1.

His descriptions of Angus are both revolting and compelling. I have yet to read a more disgusting character than Angus Thermopyle. Totally void of any redeeming qualities, Donaldson has created the ultimate anti-hero. This book sets up most character development for the other novels that follow. Not as in depth as the first books from the \\"Thomas Covenant\\" series, but on par to be a 'must read' for any Donaldson fan. This series is not to be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointing, but I still read it straight through","review":"It was not nearly as interesting as the Thomas Covenant chronicles, but at least the afterword about the source of his inspiration was worth it. Because of that, I might just read the rest of the series to see if the character development expands some more."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Donaldson?! Are you sure?!","review":"I read this book after finishing Donaldson's series of Covenant books (all six, which took me an entire year), hoping for more of his genius in a different setting. All I can say is, if this book is anything like Donaldson's other science fiction books, he's much better at fantasy. The protagonist is Angus Thermopyle, a space pirate, a drunk, and an all around jerk. At first, I figured he would be the unlikely hero, that something would happen to change my opinion about the character. It didn't. If there were rednecks in outer space, Thermopyle is them. Maybe Donaldson's other scifi books are better, but I can't give this one more than 2 stars, which is probably more than it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment is such an insufficient word","review":"(...)

It's so lightweight that it almost defies gravity. The plot is tissue paper thin and the characterisation is very sketchy. It reads like a poor 1950s pulp novel and the ending is flatter than week old beer. I'm surprised that Dondaldson managed to pad this material out to a thin book. For good space opera see early Niven or Haldeman."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good","review":"There's a vein of rabid misogyny that runs through most of Donaldson's books. In some stories, such as the Mirror of her Dreams books, it's possible to overlook it. That is not the case in The Real Story. This book is basically a 300 page rape scene. I really can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassed to admit I read this","review":"I'm embarrassed to admit I read this. So why am I confessing? Maybe it's good therapy. Unbelievable characters. Trite dialog. Flat out stupid plot. And the worst thing is, the 4 book \\"series\\" that this begins isn't so much a series of 4 books, but 1 big lame book split into 4 installments. A real series would have distinct stories, a beginning and an end, with some sense of completion to each. This reads like a TV mini-series complete with a cliffhanger at the end of each night's episode.So, if I hated it so much, why 2 stars instead of 1? Somehow the author managed to trick me into reading every book.

Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obscenely Compelling","review":"This was not what I expected - a sorta soft porn adventure soap opera among the stars. In this case, the science fiction is only a backdrop to the \\"real\\" book, a study in characters. A dark and dreary mood permeates this story (and the following ones). Sure, you don't want a steady diet but for a change of pace...I loved Morn and in a perverse way, came to feel something for Angus. Their relationship was more than master-slave, involving a deeply disturbing complexity. Actually, I had no trouble getting through the book although I admit that the following works were better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A series NOT for the impatient","review":"Fair warning, this series is, at times, sadistic to both characters and readers as both are forced through some hideous trials whose endings are unforeseen. But, if you are able (like the characters) to be shaped by these trials you will find by the end a marvelous story rich in detail and insight. Many reviewers are put off by the starkness of this first novel, but as you read on you will find that each novel will in turn open up more and more of the universe to you, like looking at a small detail of a picture and then pulling back a bit at a time to see the whole thing. Starting with the first novella, a theme of never knowing the full story begins and with each book more of the truth, the story, and the universe are seen. It will take some time to get there but the final picture is well worth the intial investment of time. Bravo, Mr. Donaldson!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic Series following a Real BAD Story!","review":"The first time that I read 'The Real Story' was the last time Iwould ever read it. It disgusted me so much that I almost neverpicked up the second book in the 'Gap Series'. What a greatmistake that would have been. Anyone who loves the'ThomasCovenant' series will love this epic as well.I am presently reading the series now for a third time. I juststart with book # 2 'Forbidden Knowledge'. The four othernovels in this series are 'CLASSIC' Donaldson! For theNOT faint of heart, I would advise a single reading of thisbook. It sets the story line so that you can effectivelyfollow the remainder of the story. It is possible toenjoy this series without ever reading this one book.Just don't miss the last four books! Youwill miss reading a Donaldson epic that will make you late forwork because you couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a great story RUINED by the consistant rape theme :-(","review":"Excellent story, incredible insight into the characters, and then it all gets dulled by Mr. Donaldson's preoccupation with rape and sexual humiliation and torture. Similar themes run through the Thomas Covenant series and now plays a major thread here - and why! It doesn't add anything, sheesh. It doesn't have to be soooooo vile- does it?Sex in the story = good. Torture perversion = bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does this book stand alone","review":"I read this book, and ONLY this book out of this series. It was sub-par, so I didn't buy the rest. This book ends like a movie serial. I loved The Unbeliever series, and expected more from The Real Story.I sit here and read reviews of all the Gap books, but the reality is that this one is badly written. Perhaps the series is good, but I will never know because I disliked the writing style, the simplistic story, and the pulp ending of the first installment. If an author writes a bad novel, do they REALLY deserve to get more of your money? In this case, I didn't invest another [dollar] in the rest of the Gap books because the first was not very good. I recommend you do the same.... The Gap gets 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life is too short to wait for the \\"good part\\"","review":"I should have read the Amazon reviews before buying this book. Instead, I picked up this book solely because I enjoyed Donaldson's Thomas Covenant titles.

The story was done at page 42. Ah, but we had to get the 'real story' right? So Mr. Donaldson decides to expand the story another 200 pages with details of rape and anger. There is no hero in this story, no one to root for. The story is told almost entirely in exposition, the few attempts at internalization were laughable. So Angus is angry, so what? The action sequences are ludicrous. I found myself hoping the characters would blow each other up so I wouldn't have to hear about them anymore. The story as a whole reads like a synopsis that had never gotten around to be written properly.I read this book hoping to find something that would pull me into the sci-fi genre. It failed.

But when I read 'The Real Story' I had trouble keeping my eyes awake. It was amateurish at best and I had to literally force myself to finish it (which I rarely ever do). Normally, even if I don't like a book, I will finish it just to make sure that I didn't miss something or find something prophetic in the last chapter. But none of these things materialized, even in the end. Don't waste your money or your time on this one (and I hate to say that because I am a staunch believer in literacy). This book doesn't even deserve one star. Sorry Mr. Donaldson."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll never read Donaldson again...","review":"I kept reading trying to get to the real story but kept winding up in the degradation of a woman and her treatment by ALL the characters as an object to further their own egos. I think Donaldson also uses Morn as an object, a way to cause conflict and to help show how degradation and humiliation affects the abuser and the viewer. The Covenant series didn't do much for women, the Mirror books claimed a female hero but repeatedly set her up for deliverance by either a man or an unexplainable event--she can't help herself or fulfill her destiny without help.The books made my stomach hurt. It was unacceptable and unredeeming violence against a person without serious reprecussion.I requested that these books be removed from the Juvenile Fiction section of our public library. That is a first for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad. Gratuitous violence done badly.","review":"It's really hard to care for these books. I'm currently trying to read the second of the series (I was hoping it would get better) and it's a struggle. It's far too easy to be distracted by something more interesting... like watching paint dry.If you like edgy, violent sci-fi, try Richard Morgan's Black Man (aka Thirteen).

I wish there would be more of the same to follow.The only draw back I have about this cd is the repertoire. A lot of the songs offered on this cd, I didn't know.

Either Harper endured a similar experience herself, or she is an extremely gifted fiction writer (I guess both are possible, actually), because the struggle between mother and daughter is so real. The feelings Jeanne expresses are so intense. This is a train of thought novel, almost like Jeanne's private journal. It deals with being middle-aged and alone, family relationships-particularly Jeanne's relationships with her son, Rad, and her ex-husband, Larry-and learning to come to terms with the ravages of Alzheimer's. This was a really instructive read, for me, as my grandmother had Alzheimer's, and it helped me better understand what my own mother must have dealt with. But more than that, it was a truly poignant, often funny and memorable mother/daughter tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it would be better...","review":"I'm not sure if it was the author's writing style or the book itself, but I found this book hard to follow. The author's writing style was choppy and her sentences just didn't seem to flow. I was constantly reading and re-reading; it was as if my brain was stuttering.

One example will suffice: the author lists Danny Kaye AND Donald O'Connor as playing the lead in the biopic THE BUSTER KEATON STORY. Interesting sounding 'facts' abound. No proof is ever offered that these events, totally unknown to other Keaton biographers, ever occurred. I have to give them the same credence I did the Kaye/O'Connor credit.

I noticed many glaring contradictions or falsehoods troughout the book, but chalked these up to the possibility of differing reports from interviewees. But, as soon as I read that DANNY KAYE starred in The Buster Keaton Story (actually starred Donald O'Connor), I promptly recycled the book and went in search of something (ANYTHING) better that may have been written about the greatest film comic of ANY time.

This book is just poorly researched.The only saving grace is that Edwards obviously adored Keaton. Sadly, even a lot of the facts (his middle name, the plots of his films, etc.) are just wrong. I don't think there was any viciousness in the untruths (like *ahem*...) but if you read this first, you won't get the real story.Read it after you've read a few others. \\"Tempest In a Flat Hat\\" is a good start."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"Mendelssohn's Scotch Symphony is Maag's speciality.

Although it was an interesting story, the ending was somewhat unsatisfying. Also, having some gay characters gave the story interest, but having so many of them seemed forced and detracted from the story line. As a previous reviewer mentioned, the way Hieronymus Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights is featured throughtout this novel worked well. The way that it influenced the characters, however, seemed a bit far-fetched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Incredibly T...E...D...I...O...U...S... I have seldom had so much trouble finishing a book. I was just so bored. I don't deny that college students have lots of pointless, meandering conversations about philosophy and the future.

But i just read your readers' reviews and apparently that is not the case.. The book is just poorly edited... I have a hard time really getting into the story since just about every page has an error. Needless to say it is very annoying.... maybe i will try to muddle thru but (how does this happen?????)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This novel gets a Raspberry from me","review":"Disappointing, disappointing, and what do you know, disappointing! That just about sums up my feelings towards this book after doggedly ploughing through the entire thing. Obviously, literary talent isn't hereditary in the Rice family. I havn't read crime thrillers since many moons ago, so when I decided to pick one up again and decided on Snow Garden, I thought I was in for a night of exciting action. I was proven wrong. By the time I had gotten through a quarter of the book, I knew it was a lost cause. Granted, one shouldn't be expecting beautiful lyrical prose in thrillers and in-depth character delineation, but surely one shouldn't be served with truckloads of surfacial details (e.g. about art), attempts at creating multitudious oh-so-quirky homosexual relationships and a plot that sinks to abysmal depths!! Seriously, if Chris Rice has any writing ability at all, I hope he shows it soon. This novel is a very disappointing showcase of his talent (if any)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give it a miss!","review":"The Snow Garden is one of the worst reads I've had this year. The distinct lack of editing proved to be a huge stumbling block. Rice does not yet have the sophistication to be able to keep multiple plot lines running and this results in characters who seem to be motivated by schitzophrenic tendencies when this is clearly not the auhor's intent. When the characters do behave rationally they are one dimentional and I found none of them believable or even remotely likable. This is particularly true of the main character. My final complaint would be that too many characters are gay. This is also a problem I had with his first novel which, in comparison, was a far better piece of work. I think the publisher has given Rice a lot slack because of his name, which pretty much guarantees turning the company a profit. I am skeptical that a first of second time writer would get this published without having a mother who's so well known."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, but the ending lets it down horribly","review":"I bought this book after reading the back flap. It reminded me of \\"Lake of the Dead Languages\\" by Carol Goodman and \\"The Secret History\\" by Donna Tartt.The story mostly takes place on a school campus and revolves around a couple of (not so typical) students. There is a lot of tension between them and the death of the wife of one of their teachers brings a lot of intrigue. In the end though the story goes into fast forward mode and before you know it half of the people in the story are dead. This ending was most disappointing and I expected more after such a good start.Also note that this book contains some explicit sexual content involving homosexuals. While this was not a problem for me, I thought some people might want to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merely Okay","review":"I thought that the description of this book sounded fantastic. The cover drew my attention, too. I know, I should never judge a book by its cover, but I do. I have tried at least five times to read this book, but I just can't seem to get into it and stay into it. There are some parts that are very exciting and make me stay up until 3:00AM reading. These are followed by sections that I have to read over and over again because they are so boring that I cannot pay attention enough to comprehend what is going on. When it's good, it's very, very good, but when it's boring, it's horrid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Boring","review":"I have no doubt that Christopher Rice has talent but you wouldn't know it much from this novel.

The book is a void- a dark, twisted piece of writing (poorly written and paced at that) that is devoid of all hope. It's a shamble of sickness, without any real art to it. I enjoyed Rice's previous book, but regret buying The Snow Garden."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"I'm an avid fan of Anne Rice's, and I have to say, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree!

The characters, plot pacing and suspense are all well enough. My only wish would be to see slightly more believable finales. Of course, maybe the slightly-unrealistic dramatics are what make it interesting.....In any case, it's a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Snow Garden","review":"For Rice's second outing he moves us away from the hot steamy swamp of New Orleans that he had us in in the wonderful \\"Destiny Of Souls\\" for the cold Northern town Atherton. We start off in the 1980s and little more is said of the events that open the book but they are never to far behind in the plot we dont know how much of a role that event plays until the end of the book. We dont know who the killer is and we are kept guessing is it Kathryn who is fighting the memory of her ex? Is it Randall the drunken rich boy that no one really knows anything about but knows there is a deep secret waiting to come out? Or Jesse who is Randall's roommate that sleeps with any girl on the campus? Could be Eric the gay but married professor that is also sleeping with one of his students?

I was hoping that it would deliver much more with him being the son of well known writers...I was wrong. To me the characters were bland and not well-rounded. The plot didn't make sense to me either.

I will give Christopher Rice another try but I'm going to wait for him to have a couple more books under his belt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Rice's son - and much more....","review":"I am pleased to report that the writing talent runs in this family!! Christopher Rice's style may be a bit different than his ultra-famous mom, but he shows talent and great promise for a long, successful career. I look forward to his future efforts after having enjoyed this one as much as I did.This sexually charged murder novel has several interesting twists, amazingly detailed and flawed characters, and it keeps you turning the page straight through to the end. I really enjoyed his touches of dark humor and imagery throughout.I suspect some readers will expect to pick this up and have it be filled with supernatural and horror elements a la Chris's mother. Don't be fooled - this novel is dark and dangerous in a different way than his maternal mentor's contributions - which doesn't mean that it isn't fabulous! Pick this one up - you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Geared to the correct audience","review":"\\"The Snow Garden\\" along with Rice's first book (...) are all good books as long as you fit the demographic.

I was put off by the twist ending. Instead of being surprised, I felt manipulated.I also hope Rice fires his editor. At one point Randall grabs Tim's belt (while Tim is only wearing boxers, mind you) and toward the end the novel Ken approaches the closet, turns into Tim and then turns back in Ken. Supernatural forces? Naw, just baaaaad editing.I will give Rice one more shot. I read his books in nearly one sitting (no doubt because there is so little there), and I sincerely wish him luck in the future. I just hope he lets his Mom read his stuff first, like any good kid.My two cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read.

Wandering through barnes and noble one day i stumbled on this book and became bretty interested to see if he actually had any talent as a writer, or if he was just going off of his last name.Well, I don't think he is a horrible writer, and honestly i don't find the book to be that horrible. I however wasn't expecting much so that probably has a lot to do with it. The information on the back cover was horrible misleading I honestly thought the book was going to be about something completely different. Also the editing was pretty horrilbe too, I suppose he can't really be blamed for that completely.I think if Rice just sharpens his story telling skills he'll grow up to be a real good author, currently however his novels are decent enough if you're just looking for a quick read with no real thinking involved (I read this book in one evening with no difficulties)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and unreadable","review":"I have a habit of forcing myself to read through an entire book even if early on it doesn't appeal to me. I have to admit that this is the first book I stopped reading before completing. At about 100 pages, which I had to force myself to read, I decided it was not worth the time to continue. The characters were laughable - not only were they totally repugnant, but what college student talks like that? It was so unbelievable (a male freshman student walks into married prof's office and seduces him in two minutes) and just ...boring. The writing was verbose, as if the author wanted to prove he knew a lot of big words. Obviously, to each his own, but I found the book not worth the time to complete reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old themes","review":"This is Rice's weakest novel by far.

Other series guides seem to be pompous, overly reverent affairs, but a cheeky tone (on the part of both the writers and their interviewees) make 'Anarchy for the Masses' a breath of fresh air. 'The Invisibles' is a series open to many interpretations, and wisely the authors shy from providing one, opting instead to provide tools for fans to make up their own minds. The interviews are good, tracking the creation of the comic book with a sometimes-unexpected honesty. If you're a Grant Morrison fan, you've got to read the huge interview here.

One of the better series guides I've seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was never produced","review":"This book was once available for pre-order when it was still in the developmental stages. Since that time, it has been officially canceled. \\"Across the Threshold\\" was going to be the Moody Blues's version of the Beatles's Anthology, a coffee table book full of color and black and white photos, written by Mark Murley, one of the main writers of the essential U.S. Moody Blues fanzine \\"Higher and Higher.\\" So, don't fret about this being \\"out of print\\" or \\"unavailable\\" and don't go searching used book stores for it because it was NEVER PRODUCED!! Check out the paperback called \\"The Moody Blues Companion\\" instead, though it is a far cry from a slick coffee table retrospective."},{"rating":"1","title":"George is great","review":"This CD seems pretty good, however, I have experienced difficulty getting it to play. I have had to clean it numerous times to get songs to play properly. It was sealed when received in a plastic wrapping, but w/o the seal along the edge. Price was good, maybe too good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good But Not Great - Although I passed","review":"I rated the book not the test - the test is easy/simple. I passed with just reading this book - although I bought a review sheet (you know those sheets you can get at borders that just outlines everything) I reviewed for the clep for about 4 weeks - but I really didn't start to study for it until week before the test. I also work full time, I am husband and father, and go to school part-time on top of this. I passed with a 54 - to - 50. Which means barely. There are some, if not a middlepassage, of questions that the clep does not answer and you do have to have a basic understanding of sociology to pass. Well thats what the clep is for, and I think the test has changed some what. But the subject itself is very easy - just alot of names and definitions - other than that its nothing! Really!! Anyone can pass this test if they know those things! Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Computer-based Sociology CLEP Test","review":"I was concerned when I bought this book that the material would not be current enough to pass the new computer-based version of the test. In short...it is. I work in the IT industry and have never taken a Sociology course in my life. I bought this book, read it from front-to-back, went over the sample tests and explanations twice, and took the test. I spent three days covering the material and passed with 16 points to spare. This is the only book that I used to prepare for the test. For anyone who is contemplating whether to take this test or the class, just take the test. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another passed CLEP!","review":"This book is THE ticket for passing this test. Read once & did the practice tests, quickly read again and reviewed practice tests, took my CLEP and got a 70 out of 80 (50 is passing). I was amazed at just how much material was on the test that was from the book. Not word for word questions (well a few) but basically the same material. A VERY cool way to do Sociology. Oh, if you're interested in a Sociology education go to another book, this one is geared to get you through the test, no more and definitely no less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorize, memorize, memorize","review":"I bought this book and took the test in 02/01.After three weeks in which I read the book front to back and memorized all 300 qustions I took the test and past with an 90% score.

I studied for a week and passed all of them with flying colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"REA- is the BEST","review":"I took this test today 9/11/01 and got a 62 scaled score.

All Disney fans out there would definitely appreciate this addition to their collection. There are so many tracks, and especially some that you cannot find anywhere else. This comes in a very nice displayable case, with a book as an added bonus.

Featuring the music of current favorites and long gone attractions, everyone will find something that they enjoy.With that being said, it has many things to offer that aren't available on other CDs. Don't toss out your older Disneyland CDs because this collection has several different versions than can be found on the older ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great HISTORY of Disneyland!","review":"For the true fan of Disneyana, not for casual listener who wants to hear the absolute latest at the park. This set goes BACK in time, and some tracks are antiquated; some are hard to find music/sounds/speaking tracks. There is nothing from the Jungle Cruise (my family's favorite attraction!) but some tracks are full 20 minute shows. Sound quality is fantastic. I paid about $58 for the set (less than $10 per disc!) so it was a good deal. My kids and I listen almost every day. It is therapy for when you are too far from the park to visit. I wish there were 6 more discs in a second edition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD set jams!!","review":"I got this set recently and nothing about it is bad. I listen to it all the time. I love how all the holiday tracks are compiled on one CD (disc 6). Listening to the Wishes firework show makes me feel like I'm really watching the fireworks. The track also includes the cool Star Tours boarding message before transitioning into the music for the ride.Going to Disney is way too expensive for my family, but I can listen to the music and feel like I'm there. That's good enough for me. Now I look forward to a similar compilation for WDW's 50th, but we're still a few years away from that.Thanks, Disney.

He covers the disassembly and assembly, but it is interspersed with history, discussion of other guns, and future course information among other things. He shows various steps with a gun and a factory cutaway (a helpful thing), but occasionally does not position the gun so you can see the parts he is talking about. There is a camera operator he talks to that should recognize this situation but he doesn't. I have not watched the course through, so I don't know if he covers it completely or not. I find the course very tedious to watch.If you will follow the manual that comes with the gun carefully, it should cover what you need to know, at least the basics for a 12 gauge. I bought a 20 gauge, got the 12 gauge manual. There are some differences which I find to be significant (you decide)."},{"rating":"2","title":"French classics CD","review":"Treat for the ears.

The songs and melodies are definitely French classics. However, the performances are very bland, it sounds like most was done on ... keyboards. Gone are the authentic instruments like accordions and mandolins and in are ... synth strings. The reviewer that said that this sounds like elevator music nailed it right on the head. I love the music, but I hate the way it's done.I am going to keep looking for something that has authentic content AND instrumentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comme-ci, comme ca...","review":"Although the instrumentals are nice, this CD wasn't quite what I thought it would be. For some reason I thought the songs would be sung, but instead it's all instrumental. If that's what you prefer, then you probably would enjoy this CD...

This is anything but that! This is an extremely atmospheric cd, which takes me back to the summer I spent in Europe with a special friend, including several days in Paris. Now, is Paris as romantic as \\"They\\" say? Not really. Its a big city with noise, activity, and LOTs of people. BUT, this cd conveys the feeling one gets on long walks down the quais, going through the bookstalls and kiosks, stopping at the Deux Magots for an afternoon refreshment. The music reminds one of the changeable skies over Paris. I took pictures of La Tour Eiffel fifteen minutes apart, and the skies went from clear and sunny (Il fait beau) to le ciel gris. These arrangements are lovely and will fill your home with that special French ambience on a quiet afternoon, when nothing quite fits the mood but the hushed elegance of a glass of champagne!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's LOVELY - don't listen to the haters!","review":"This is a gread CD.

This is a B picture, to be sure, shot on a budget, but its great fun as Mr. Wong solves a crime in San Francisco's Chinatown. The transfer is very good considering there is no restoration.

So once again Mr. Wong puts his life on the line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reasons To Read","review":"Sometimes a book comes into your life and it feels like the stars have aligned. It sounds like the author is speaking directly to YOU. I imagine everyone to feel this way about an Amy Hempel book. She illustrates the heartaches, heartbreaks and losses of all of us. But somehow you come out on the other side with a smile.Written with the barest minimum of sentences that contain a teeming excess of emotion. This is literature. This is art. I'd like to see how she paints. Read this book and all of her others. These timeless stories keep. Years after reading them they'll be with you in a little pocket next to your heart. I usually go in for lean,tough,Hemingway style books and yet my favorite story in this collection is all about knitting. Five stars for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Was eager to read this book because Chuck Palahniuk raved about it. Found it rather BORING. I didn't find it stimulating or emotional, as suggested by his recommendation. Could just be me though-I will not pretend to be an expert! Her language has good flow and the words painted good pictures as you read, but I guess it was just missing that... special spark for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sentences, poor stories","review":"I picked up \\"Reasons to Live\\" based on Chuck Palahniuk's sterling recommendation in his book \\"Stranger than Fiction.\\" Hempel's collection contains 15 short stories -- very short as the pieces average about 8 pages each.Her writing is very clever (as promised), but left me uninterested. The tiny length of each story made the characters and their situations too opaque to care about. Hempel can certainly write a great sentence, but not a great story.One footnote: \\"Celia is Back\\" clearly mirrors a story Palahniuk tells about his own father. I must admit to wondering if some of the high praise came from personal association more than objective evaluation."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"This book was nothing i expected it to be.

Brogan balances the troubled heroine's story with a fresh-as-today's-headline look at drug research and the billions of dollars at stake.Title says this is part of a series but it worked for me as a standalone and didn't have the feel of a series. The first book I've ever read on a Kindle and my fingers flew across the screen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Investigative Reporter Provides New Twist for Mystery","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this break from the typical mystery genre. Told from the viewpoint of an investigative journalist, this mystery unravels around the protagonist at the same time her life is just getting under control. Jan Brogan's novel is impossible to put down, as each turn in the story propels the reader on to a new, and sometimes erroneous, conclusion. Reporter Addie herself provides the ultimate surprise ending, and all at once the reader realizes it's the only choice she ever really had. Have a great time reading this one, and keep your eye out for Brogan's next. Personally, I can't wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best mysteries ever written!","review":"As a mystery buff I am always in search of that exciting, well writen mystery whose ending I cannot predict.Final Copy was all of that and more!

When they start using technical buzz words I can tell real quick that they are using words with no real subtance behind them, but I have avoided talking about \\"value chains\\" and \\"best practices\\" because though I understood them from context I did was not sure of myself. This book explains many of the key buzz words used in management in clear terms.It also provides references and resources for further study. For instance it recommends \\"Competitive Strategy\\" by Michael Porter. I asked a friend that is a Wharton graduate if she was famliar with the book \\"Competitive Strategy\\" and she answered \\"by Michael Porter?\\" There are so many business books it is nice to have a guide to cut the wheat from the chaff.I am glad I read this book and it even inspired me to make some changes in my business that have been useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Organic shampoos are not necessarily good","review":"After I read the only review of this shampoo, I felt that I must tell my real experience with this shampoo.When I bought the shampoo, I was hoping that my hair (usually oily and so become flat easily) would have more volume after I use it.

The quality of all five classic movies has been terrible. DVD's skip, soundtrack volumes yoyo and all the scenes, even those which were originally brightly lit are so dark that viewers can't distinguish which actors are on camera, what the locations are, or whether shots were taken in bright sunlight or dimly-lit rooms. As other reviewers have commented, \\"Heart Beat\\" isn't the most factual account of the beat generation's driving forces but it's an enjoyable movie nonetheless and it deserves better presentation than this. At an msrp of almost $30 a film should be superior to the ones sold for a buck in dollar stores and this one certainly isn't. Come on, Warner Bros, if you want serious money for your films get serious about the quality of what you offer for sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"heartbeat","review":"Was SO happy to finally find this on DVD.

Knowing little about motorcycles and even less about biker bars, it was a great introduction to that world.This book screams for an editor--someone to put the Thesaurus back on the shelf, someone to suggest more natural turns-of-phrase. However, the story doesn't need much work. The many twists did not lead where I expected--except the last turn. The ending was contrived. The suspense ended with a laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hit","review":"Wow! My daughter really loves this book. Ever since I brought it home from the library she has wanted us to read it to her every day, several times a day. I think it appeals to her because the verses are so gentle. She seems to like the illustrations also. Sometimes I sing it to her, and sometimes I just say it. Either way, she can't get enough. For the first time, she actually cried and pitched a fit when I was through with reading a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to see words","review":"I'm not sure why everyone loves this book so much. There are at least three pages on which there is extremely dark lettering on a very dark background. Whoever made the decision to mix these colors made a terrible mistake. It's to the point where you literally can not read it comfortably and there is no way my son will be able to try to read it by himself... he won't even be able to see the words!

The book also stands as a fine social history of Depression Era America."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little dry","review":"While deeply researched, this biography is a little dry for me. It's just the telling of what happened, in great detail, in my opinion without vivid language. Few direct quotes. All in past tense. This happened, then this happened, then this happened. Maybe that's how biographies were written back then (in the 1980s) but they have come a long way since then. These leaves me feeling like I'm watching this story from afar, not feeling it, never getting close enough, not touching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So long, it's been good to know ya...","review":"I concur with the majority of reviews of this book. I have owned my hardcover copy for many years, and I've read it three times. Joe Klein did a good job. For most people, there is more here about Woody, his times, his friends and his foes and his sorrows than they will want or need to know. However, I must also advise true fans to consider buying another book, \\"Woody, Cisco and Me\\" by Jim Longhi. That one depicts only the WW II adventures when Woody and his friends took jobs feeding the crew and troops on merchant ships crossing the Atlantic in l943. It shows a side of Woody that Joe Klein's work does not, and both books should be read or owned by people with a serious interest in this wiry, weird genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red camera case for FX07 camera","review":"The red color of the case does not match the color of the camera exactly, but it does fit just fine.

One of the stories stood out. It was about a young girl, Arlyn, titled Wind Beneath My Wings, written by her mother after her Arlyn's death. In this busy, hectic world, we get so busy, it was a good reminder for me to listen more carefully to my own daughter. At the end of the book the author's mailing and email addresses were listed - I think that is an extra bonus!

But the stories are still very inspiring.Each story is more emotional & moving than the next. Lots of tears were shed, as I read these stories. It makes you realize that your problems aren't so bad & there are a lot of people who have it worse off than you. You must keep a positive attitude & remember that 'life goes on.'If you are looking to put your problems into perspective & see the big picture, then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but nowhere near as good as its predecessors","review":"This book is okay, but nowhere near as good as its predecessors. It is comprised of short stories -- often rather verbose short stories -- rather than the short, meaningful passages in the earlier Chicken Soup books. The earlier books are studded with post-it stickers saving the innumerable passages I want to reread or frame, and I frequently think back to those wonderful passages. Not these -- there isn't a single post-it sticker in the entire book, and I'm donating it to the charity fair since there's nothing worth rereading. To be fair, I suppose that this might prove helpful to someone overwhelmed by insurmountable problems and in need of reading sappy boring story after sappy boring story -- but I, myself, was much more humbled and inspired by the earlier volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich Sonic Visual... absolutely breathtaking.. brilliant","review":"I remember first hearing \\"At First Light\\" literally at dawn as one well known New York jazz DJ had taken to start his morning program with this ethereal, powerful, provocative, darkly beautiful piece. I... was.... mesmerized. I promptly rushed to the record outlet and picked it up. I soon discovered that there was no let down throughout this recording. What that one piece promised that, and the remaining pieces delivered. Patrick O'Hearn is one of the great undiscovered. For this type of music, he is one of the very best. \\"At First Light\\", \\"Unusual Climate\\" , \\"Live Along the River Baal\\" and \\"Malevolent Landscape\\" are true highpoints. This is one to listen to from beginning to end. The pieces are different but flow together seamlessly. This was strong and brilliant debut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short, new age ambient album","review":"This is Patrick O'Hearn's first solo CD. It comes from 1985. It is only 32 minutes long. The sound quality is excellent.This is one of those new age albums from the mid-eighties that took advantage of the new digital and CD technologies. It has a great dynamic range and beautiful sonic quatity.Like most of the early new age work, this is all about the sonic qualities and making beautiful sounds. It is not about the compositions. Like many new age albums, this is just repeated sounds; very beautiful sounds; but no cohesive composition. I find it to be repetitive and boring.There are some interesting parts to the CD, and track 6 is very good throughout. This whole CD might be OK as background music.Patrick O'Hearn got his start with playing bass for Frank Zappa. He was then in Group 87 with Mark Isham (who plays trumpet on this CD). After that, he struck it big with Missing Persons, featuring 3 other musicians who used to play for Zappa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this!!!!","review":"I purchased this DVD to help my son with his math.

That is it. I though it would be a Bill Nye sort of approach to math. Not at all. The DVD says professor X2 is \\"Wacky\\" and \\"Eccentric\\".

Knox's fictional autobiographer tells the story of her life up to the eve of the 1972-1975 Great War (major enough that the previous Great War of 1914-1918 was renamed the Five Years War). This medium gives Knox the chance to satirize various social trends of the 1910s and early 20s, especially in education, marriage and divorce, and the role of women in politics and business. There are many hilarious passages such as that where Lady Porstock describes the education of her sons in a school which forbade the boys to do the things the school administrators wanted them to do, so they would be naturally eager to do them; teachers read and taught from comic magazines while the students surreptitiously studied Greek (from books stolen from the restricted shelf in the library) under their desks. The index of proper names also contains a few good jokes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the size I needed","review":"I bought this padded bag to replace a midsized unpadded duffle bag I was using to transport my Behringer 208D speaker and related accessories. I had put a piece of styrofoam at the bottom to add a little shock resistence, but that took up space and only protected to bottom of the bag. I decided something more was needed, so I bought this Ariba bag. It's smaller than my duffle, so I have to leave the microphone case out. Not a deal breaker, since the speaker is limited to 1 input (unbalanced TS or balanced XLR, but not simultaneously). So if you have a powered speaker with similiar dimensions, it'll work fine. The zippered pockets hold power cords and various other cables I need to meet all possible connections to RCA, phono plug, or XLR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelmed","review":"I purchased this bag to carry my two American DJ Starball effects lights.

Though still clearly rooted in typical Japanese cartoon character design, the characters have a very modern feel which is mixed with a seventies anime nostalgia. The result being a very clean, stripped down, at times almost Bruce Timm / Batman the animated series style.Being a comic book artist myself I can really appreciate the work put in to make these characters look so good.But, the story isn't quite as cool. It's fun to watch, don't get me wrong! It's very enjoyable but, at times, it begins to drag. However, this is due to the first DVD being so action packed. This batch of episodes are more character driven with fewer giant robots and space battles. Thankfully, the characters are very likable. Just be ready for a change of pace after the first DVD.All in all, this is still one of my favorite \\"anime\\" DVDs and hope to get the whole series eventually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Karloff Gets To Act!","review":"The \\"Black Room\\" enables the viewer to enjoy great acting (Karloff) and an entertaining story. Karloff portrays twin brothers. One kind and innocent beyond belief (Think of an intelligent Gomer Pyle). The other (brother) pure evil (Think of J.R. Ewing as a serial killer). The brothers are both doomed by a family curse, and bound by a beautiful maiden. If this story isn't interesting enough, just tune in to Karloffs' one man acting clinic. Karloff made me think. Why was I rooting for both the \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" brother? I was probably just rooting for Karloff. However this film proved to me, someone of Karloffs' ability does not need a cheering section. Buy (or rent) this film.

The book reads quickly , I like the wriing style, and overall the story is \\"fun\\"... as fun as senior citizens watching Matlock daily in the nursing home. There is no real violence so it is very sedate and you'll be able to go to sleep without checking under the bed. The suspense really revolves around the sale of the pantyhose rather than the characters being killed. Overall, if you need to forget your troubles, dive into this book which requires minimal brain activity."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word - INSULTING","review":"This book is insulting to readers of average to above-average intelligence.To say it is difficult to get published is one of the understatements of the century. It is almost IMPOSSIBLE to get published these days. Average writers can forget it. Good writers, probably not. Great writers, maybe... just maybe, if your agent and the publisher are in a good mood.Therefore, you don't see much drivel making it to print anymore. I don't even know if this book is good enough to be called drivel. The immature writing is below sub-par and the characters are so flimsy that they don't even qualify as \\"cardboard\\". Even the basic premise of the book is so thin, it should never even have been made into a short story.But I guess, when your mother is one of the most exhaulted mystery writers of all time, you're allowed to vomit text on to a page and expect to get it printed. Must be nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Get Snagged by this Lemon","review":"Was this supposed to be a children's book? It's so juvenile and simplistic that even most kids would find it boring and insulting. It's frightening to think that there may be an adult market out there somewhere for this type of drivel. I see that this author's next book (\\"Fleeced\\") has had its publication date delayed until the end of next year. This is good news, since it will prevent unsuspecting readers from getting fleeced for a while. This author's mother (well-known mystery writer Mary Higgins Clark) should convince her daughter to change her name! I've never heard of \\"brand extension\\" in publishing before, and this example is hurting the mother's well-earned reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pantyhose aren't the only ones running....","review":"You may find yourself running to the trashcan to toss this clunker.

Apparently neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinker!","review":"Stinker! could more aptly describe what this book should be entitled. I tried this as my first CHC novel. What a joke. She has missed every one of her mother's tried and true techniques at building suspense. In fact the book is laughable in its attempts at a new genre - comedy/mystery novels. I even found myself so bored that I simply read to finish the book , and then donate it to charity. In her mother's novels, one is lead along chapter to chapter , and feels that there must be numerous potential actors in the murders. In this Snagged book, one just doesn't even care. Looks as if we readers were snagged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snagged, but not Fleeced","review":"Even children would find this book simplistic and moronic. Who exactly is this author writing for? I see that her next book (Fleeced) has had its publication date delayed.... maybe her publisher finally wised up. It's a shame that Carol Higgins Clark has to trade off the good name of her mother, Mary Higgins Clark. Snagged tries to be funny but falls flat. The plot is paper thin and you feel like you've ingested junk food after wading through this clunker. And these one word titles (Decked, Twanged, Snagged, Fleeced) smack of some big marketing promotion to lure us into a purchase that we normally wouldn't make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish","review":"I'm a big fan of Mary Higgins Clark and that was the reason I picked this up. I think I read 30 pages before I turned it in at the local thrift store. Apparently parentage makes no difference if you have no talent. Haven't read any other books by her, but then I don't think I will. I see that she is still publishing her one-liners though! I thought it was just me until I read the previous reviews. The moronic story isn't even worth reviewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Instrumental CD I've Ever Heard","review":"I have been a fan of Patrick O'Hearn for over 10 years. \\"El Dorado\\" was my first exposure to his music and I still believe it to be his best. Unlike keyboard artists such as Vangelis, O'Hearn integrates electronic instruments with acoustic, creating a \\"landscape\\" of sound that is truly extraordinary. The \\"rain stick\\" on the title track is a perfect example of how he so masterfully intigrates primitive, acoustic instruments with the electronic. With songs like \\"Delicate,\\" I have heard no other artist who can musically set a mood of such deep serenity. All of O'Hearn's CDs are worth owning, but this one remains my all-time favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"O'Hearn's Absolute Best!!!","review":"I have had this CD since it was first released and have many fond associations with it, mostly hiking in the SE Utah desert. It's a true masterpiece and his absolute best. I wish more of his work was like this, that he hadn't gone all dark and moody. The cuts on this are either upbeat and energetic or perfectly pensive and melancholy, but in a good way, not dark. Amazon Waltz is just fantastic, my all-time fav. Also love the fretless bass. In my top 5 fav CDs of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical, magical mix that made me a Patrick O'hearn fan","review":"First of many albums I have collected of Patrick O'hearn music.Easy to listen to, and a pleasure to share with others. This is a masterpiece of modern compositions, original and deep. Music that has texture completly throughout the Frequency spectrum. Not just ambient noise but rhythm, harmony, and soothing melodic passages that seem worldly and un worldly. Love the deep bass lines and variety of different beats and rythms.Excellent intro to his music as it is more upbeat and lighthearted than most of his later work.

After reading it I found it to be unbelieveably practical for life spiritual journey today. Kushner did a great job with this easy but meaningful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing, an Important Reminder","review":"A book to cling to. Religious or not, Christian or Jew, young or old, healthy or sick, everyone needs the Lord to be their shepherd at some point in their lives whether it's realized or not. Kushner doesn't dwell on bad experiences, on sickness, nor on tragedy. Instead, he offers hope for all people (regardless of religious affiliation) with an well-organized dissection and comforting reflection on a well-known Psalm. Kushner presents a renewed perspective and appreciation for the psalm and The Shepherd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Worth Reading, Not Worth Buying","review":"This book focuses on the 23rd Psalm, but I found it to be a bit self-centered. It is probably a great read for someone going through a time of personal grief, and I believe that is what the author intended, since he is the author of When Bad Things Happen to Good People. I can appreciate that aspect of the book, but I feel that some of his interpretations of the psalm are incorrect.One instance that comes to mind is his view of the rod and staff mentioned in the psalm. Kushner tends to view the rod and staff as punishment from God. I can understand, however, this viewpoint if one does not have knowledge of grace. A good book to help understand the metaphor of the rod and staff in regard to grace is A Shepherd Looks at Psalm 23.Kushner is learned and concise with his knowledge, but fails to shift the focus from the personal and earthly to Jesus and the kingdom of God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, this is a message that further divides the world","review":"I heard an interview with Dr. Kushner on NPR today. He explained how the comfort in the 23rd Psalm lies in the realization that, for example, God is not on the side of the terrorists, or the hurricanes; he is on our side.Why define the world as divided so in the first place? Terrorists are people too. Nature is people too. Until we accept the fact that God is in all of us, we will continue to place things in \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" bins and only strengthen the hatred and suffering in the world. Our comfort and relief from Psalm 23 will only revitalize us to more intensely resist those things that we (WE, not God or some divine law of the universe) label as evil.I rate the book 2 stars instead of 1 because it is clear the author means well and has a heart of gold, full of compassion. Unfortunately his wonderful intentions are sorely misguided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Junk","review":"This is the worst tent I have ever owned. I am not new to camping in a tent. I was a boy scout as a kid and have spent many rainy nights in a tent. I received this tent as a wedding gift a few years ago, and it is very roomy...I'll give it that, but when the rain comes it leaks like crazy. Even if there is an excess amount of dew in the morning you'll get wet. I think the problem lies in how the tent poles come together at the top center of the tent. The connector piece touches the rain fly and wicks the water in. The top of the tent without the rain fly is screen mesh. So when the water wicks in it runs down the screen, pools up, and eventually falls through. I even added a seam sealer to the rain fly, and water still came through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"Would never buy another tent from Target. They wouldn't take it back.

I look forward to future projects from Ms. Arnaz."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd had the potential but...........","review":"Before I bought this cd I had always wondered what Lucie's voice would sound like. Now I know! Bad news, her voice is not that appealing. It appears that Lucie was a bundle of nerves while singing on this cd. On every track I noticed that her voice quivered. Surely this is not her normal sound?For the brighter side of this cd, her repertoire was good. Her arrangements were ok. Her voice I thought had a lot of potential. What a shame this potential didn't shine through.Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wretched, Horrible Mess!","review":"Listening to this CD is worse than listening to Yoko Ono! It is just so amazing to me that someone who comes from the great stock that Lucie Arnaz does (parents were Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz) could have such little, if no talent! If it wasn't bad enough that for the last several years, she has been living off her dead parents, by selling \\"Lucy\\" merchandise, that is mostly tacky, she has to cut an album now too! She doesn't have any of the musical talents her dad did, or the comedic ones her mom did, so Lucie, just crawl into a little hole and never come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be missed!","review":"Every page of this book is a delight. I've been a fan of Elaine Coffman for years, and the Mackinnon books are treasured. This book has wonderful humor without being silly, and the emotions are heartfelt. I don't know when I've laughed and cried so much with a book, and Lizzie Robinson is one delightful heroine I'll never forget. She reminds me of Ann of Green Gables. Ms. Coffman develops her characters until its hard to believe they only exist on paper. Every woman remembers her first love, and this book is guaranteed to make you remember yours. Pure delight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Favorite books....","review":"I bought this book years ago then lost it...I never forgot the story and spent years searching for it but I could not remember the title or author. I even tried searching online describing the story but could not remember the characters names except Elizabeth kept coming to mind. Finally today in bookstore I found it at a local library where the books are 25 cents...I am so glad I finally get to read this book again. This is my favorite from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch this one hurt.","review":"I give Ms. Coffman 2 stars instead of one because first of all she took the time to try to write a love story and secondly she had the basis of a good story. The problem for me is the way she writes. Her characters conversations are so silly. They don't build the characters personalities. As a matter of fact I almost feel embarrassed for them. The whole character developments left me lacking. I also think it is so completely stupid to assume that we are going to fall for a character such as Lizzie, when she is nothing but a smart mouthed brat. Tavis, well now he was just plain and simple a jerk. He never inspired in me anything but comtempt. If Lizzie was portrayed to be so smart, why could she not see Tavis for what he truly was? Yuk! What a very dull story. I only finished it (truly by skipping over half of it) because I hate to start a book and not finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"Reviews are not my favorite type of musical. But Howard Crabtree's \\"Whopp-Dee-Doo!\\" is a pleasant exception to this.based on the premise of having to find numbers to fit Crabtree's costumes, the musical nunbers can be riotous or sad. This piece celebrates being gay. Numbers poke fun of many thiungs held dear by gay people. The laughter comes from recognition. \\"Last One Picked\\" is a song about a guy remembering his days in high school when he was the last one picked for teams. The song is a bit sad, but does not well there. \\"The Soldier's Musical\\" is another satirical romp that is full of doule entendres. So it turns out that this CD is a great addition to the musical theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Road from Damascus to Ft.

I live near Ft. Worth but found this book at the Pike Street Market in Seattle. I started reading it on the airplane going home and found it hard to put down. The paperback version is so attractively packaged that I did not realize when I purchased it that it was written and published locally in Seattle.

The original cast recording is a good but old recording. The movie has the wrong cast. The most recent staging has some beautiful voices but is hurt by how Dom DeLuise's voice blends with them, particularly in the \\"This is My Beloved\\" quartet. This 1964 Lincoln Center revival has great performances. I am particularly thrilled by Lee Venora's voice and musicianship. Listen to her scale down at the end of \\"Baubles\\" - the best performance I have heard of that beautiful song. The quartet is beautiful. It would be great for this recording to be remastered and re-released, since the post 1960 era recordings have often come out really great when the remastering work is done well. Hope that happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cast, great score","review":"Great sound. full, ruch orchestrations. Good actor-singers. Alfred Drake, Lee Venora especially good in recording of Lincoln Center production. Score based on themes of Borodin.

But it did help clarify and deepen my knowledge of their society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't we have a \\"0-star\\" option?","review":"My first question is to whom was Chesnoff addressing this -- I'm reluctant to dignify it by calling it a book? It certainly was not to an adult or anyone possessing any education or intelligence. Case in point: his interminable English translations of common French expressions and words, as well as his own childish phrases, \\"hoity-toity\\" and \\"keester\\", just two of literally hundreds of similar expressions commonly discarded after one outgrows the playground.

Chesnoff's arrogant and xenophobic chewing of stereotypes associated with the French is not only boring but pitiful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridicule","review":"I always wonder why people write this kind of stupid books. Maybe because they find people even more stupid to buy and read them ...I think that this book's title should be: My unpleasant neighbors - why they can't stand me-and why the feeling is mutual. Chesnoff would at least write on a topic he knows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated that the French aren't intimidated by bullying?","review":"Frustrated that the French are not impressed by belching lardo American tourists that demand respect? Frustrated that they just couldn't be bullied into seeing any real threat in puny impoverished Iraq? Frustrated that the French aren't impressed by America's abusive image? Want some disparaging comments to pile in on the French and blame them for US failures? Like the Nazis who spat on the jews, some US nutcases spit on the French. This book is for you, look it up at Borders next time you're there. Must be awful learning that they created the word \\"courtoisie\\" and that unlike the US, they are beloved worldwide as the most visited nation on earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE TRUTH IS PAINFUL","review":"I am a French reader who often chooses American and British books in order to get a non-French point of view. Chesnoff's new book \\"The Arrogance of the French\\" was sent to me by an American friend. It makes painful reading for any French person, but if I want to be honest, I must admit he has captured the essence of all our faults and prideful behavior - and with wit and humor. Moreover, I found that while it is written with harsh criticisms and even anger at our attitude towards the nation that saved us from destruction, it is not without sympathy for France - and certainly not written in hatred. General De Gaulle used to warn that we French could often be our own worst enemies - and this book points that out all too well. A well done book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OH FRENCHIE, OH FRENCHIE, FRENCHIE!!!!","review":"They are truly exasperating and \\"The Arrogance of the French\\" explains why and how to deal with them. This is one of the wittiest books I have read in ages - and certainly the best yet on the French and their long standing love/hate relationship with the United States. The history and current situation are both explained astutely but concisely. I particularly enjoyed Chesnoff's list of expressions you can use when that haughty French waiter get's haughty with you! A must read for anyone who ever tried to understand the mysterious and maddening French. Merci M. Chesnoff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Al doin' it right","review":"A friend of mine turned me on to this album when it was one - wax, I mean.

Both of these albums are five stars as far as I'm concerned and completely blow away the later stuff that he did which turned in the direction of sappy, pop-oriented, \\"radio-friendly\\" pap.

Haha. I wasn't really feeling the remix to \\"Pon De Replay\\" because I don't like the guest star much and while it has pretty music, \\"Music Of The Sun\\" is a slightly bland mid-tempo.All in all I'd like to own this just for my favorite tracks.

Rihanna has combined both R&B and Reggae and it sounds great. The only flaw I have for Music of the Sun is her Rihanna's voice isn't that powerful. She's only 17, she can practise.

For some real Hip-Hop see Kanye West latest Masterpiece Late Registration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pon de Replay is a great track","review":"Unfortunately, it is the only standout track on this CD. The rest of the tracks come across as filler and do not leave an impression. The tracks are not really bad per se, but they all sound the same and do not have much substance. Don't get me wrong......some people say....\\"well that's just reggae\\" whatever, but I disagree.

She's a fresh breeze on the american soil, his style and music sound unique, blabla... and they are also talking about the industry. Come on! Every body fin her good but no one can explain why. IT'S just GOOD! Good beat, what you know about beat? The same beat that goes all along the song during 3min, so basic that you have'nt notice that is the same one that we hear here and there. It's just another IMAGE artist. Image is in front, after you got the music. No art here, just an other version of something déjà vu."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rihanna A Manufactured Singer, Nothing Caribbean About Her","review":"I heard this girl came from my home island, Barbados, so I was naturally curious to hear her song. Quite frankly, she did an amazing job. An amazing job of hiding her accent in a few months. You'd never think she was a Bajan. All the people that compliment the so-called Caribbean rhythms and whatever, please, this girl had her accent heavily modified or changed and the flow of the record is definitely not Bajan-inspired, but rather quasi-Caribbean. The song, \\"Pon The Replay\\" is terrible, I figure Americans and Bajans alike probably wouldn't like it. I figure she ran into or her parents knew one of the umpteen million rich folks and producers that vacation down there and got the hookup with a contract up in New York or wherever. It's so sad how many popstars are assembly-line jobs like Rihanna, let's see, Britney, Avril...ugh...Believe me, I'd love to give Rihanna the benefit of the doubt, but she is just plain TERRIBLE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SORRY RIHANNA I EXPECTED MORE","review":"AFTER PON DE REPLAY I THOUGHT THIS IS ABOUT TO BE HOT BUT IT AINT MY FAVOURIT TRACKS IS THERES A THUG IN MY LIFE IS SO GOOD PON DE REPLAY:THE LAST TIME:IF ITS LOVING THAT YOU WANT:THE REST IS NOT GOOD I DIDNT BOUGHT I WAS LISTING TO IT MAYBE IM GONNA LISTING TO IT AGAIN BUT 4 NOW IT ISNT WHAT I WANT AND SHE SHOULD MAKE MORE TRACKS WITH HOT RAPPERS BETTER BUY TEAIRRA MARI SORRY RIHANNA"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Lumidee...or Nina Sky possibly....","review":"I was excited about this CD coming out, however keeping in mind that this could be another lumidee or nina sky, and in many ways i was right! i do like her voice and the beats on this album are HOT, reggae beat over a r&b voice is something we need more of! However, lyrically i dont think it's close to 'great' or 'good'...I know she's 17 but still i don't think that's an excuse for lyrical weakness...good thing i didn't buy the CD and burned it from a friend. Overall however, it's a great dance CD, but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pon De Garbage","review":"This CD cover absolutely frightens me. . .Anyway, the songs on this CD are all over place and there's a simple reason for that: Rihanna has no unique style. She's an island girl and she tries to portray that in a few of her songs with the Reggae rhythm; but when you jump from Reggae to R&B to Club on the same CD, it doesn't sound uniform. These three diffferent musical styles can be combined and it has been done before. However, when you jump to this genre to that genre, trying to cover all areas in order to appear cool, what you really get is bits and pieces and nothing flows. This CD was boring. \\"Pon De Replay\\" was hot for a minute but it got played out real quick. Seriously, when I first heard the beginning of that song on the radio I thought I was listening to Lou Bega's \\"Mambo #5.\\" Anyway, Rihanna is prepackaged and there's nothing authentic about her style at all.

Rihanna is a very versatile singer and I think she will be around for years to come. My favorite songs on this album are Here I go again, That La La , If it's lovin' that you want, The last time, and There's a thugh in my life. I also like Now I know. This ballad really showcases her beautiful voice.I think some people are disappointed because they were looking for all up tempo songs like Pon de replay. But it seems like Rihanna wanted to showcase her versatility as a singer and frankly, I think she did an excellent job at it. She showed us that she can sing up, mid and low tempo songs to just about any beat Reggae, R&B;, Hip Hop, .....I wish her success and I can't wait to hear her next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"No replay!","review":"I bought this on a whim. I liked \\"Pon De Replay\\" (until it was WAY played out) and thought I would give it a chance. I should have stuck with my gut instincts. It is just not good. She has a decent voice (I don't see how people could possibly compare her voice to Beyonce'.....NO WAY!) but, she was just given crap songs' to record. They all sound so generic especially the island sounding songs. The ONLY other song on here that I like besides \\"Pon De Replay\\" is \\"That La La La\\". Other than that leave it on the shelve or do some serious sampling before you purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good after all","review":"I was kinda skeptical like this girl has the #2 single in the country just outta no where. How good can her album possibly be? I've seen this all too much before. But this album is actually good, it has a lil bit of everything in it.

This is mos def. worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rihanna - Music Of The Sun","review":"Pon De Replay - I really like this song, no wonder it did so well!!! 9.5/10Here I Go Again - Cute song, v. reggae. 9.5/10If It's Lovin' That You Want - I LOVE this song. Glad that it's the 2nd single. 10/10You Don't Love Me (No, No, No) - I like it. 9/10That La, La, La - I really like this song, less reggae. 9.5/10The Last Time - Nice. 9/10Willing To Wait - I actually really like this song. 9.5/10Music Of The Sun - A bit poppy, but I think it's really nice. 9.5/10Let Me - Upbeat, it's cool. 9/10Rush - Again, upbeat, i like it. 9/10There's A Thug In My Life - It's a nice song, love the music at the start. 9/10Now I Know - Kinda boring, but her voice is nice. 7/10Should I - Nice upbeat song.

These companions are drawn to Roland's world from our own, or something like it, specifically from New York City.Much of King's work deals with the intrusion of the fantastic into the mundane, but in The Drawing of the Three the trick is turned around; NYC appears as a bizarre, dangerous place, and Roland, such a weighty character, freighted with blood and doom, seems oddly more real than the city.For a writer often accused of churning out work, King was clearly 'on' for this book and the next in the series, The Wastelands; his vision is crystal clear, and translated to the page and the reader's mind with lucidity and style.I stayed up to 4 am finishing this book. It's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proof that our gifts improve with time","review":"Reading the first installment of The Dark Tower series proved to be a difficult task.

The Drawing of the Three did not disappoint! I found myself able to better understand and visualize the events and storyline. This one I could not put down. Proof that writing ability and artistic gifts develop over time.

The entire Dark Tower series is brilliant. But where the Gunslinger is a worthy introduction, and the Wastelands a wild stop on the way, The Drawing of the Three and in my humble opinion, Wizard and Glass are the absolute standouts.Roland's first interactions with our world run the gamut from funny to thought-provoking to scary, and each of the new characters are impressive and likeable.This book is not to be missed. And while you're at it, read the other three and wait with breath as baited as the rest of us for #5."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book Ever Written","review":"Oh my God...Mr. King is the worlds greatest author. I could not put this book down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Drew me right in...","review":"The Dark Tower series is on a roll with this, the second book. I was not expecting strange magical doors to appear on the beach, and found the idea very imaginative and fun to be a part of. In this book, Roland, Gunslinger, star of the show, keeps finding magical doorways into different \\"whens\\" of New York City, presumably from NYCs in different universes as well. Each when contains a troubled character who will form Roland's party of adventurers (his tet). King did a good job of capturing how these characters react to having some stranger \\"possess\\" them, and it's a riot to see how Roland fumbles his way through NYC through the eyes of someone completely out of his when or where. Keep reading! There's only 7 books in the series, not 19 as you might expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aaargh","review":"Growing up, I read every book King wrote in his early career; and loved them all.This is supposedly his \\"masterpiece\\". Unfortunately, it felt like required reading in high school. Ponderous, difficult, over-bearing and (frankly) boring.This is a visceral, personal reaction. Based on the other reviews, many may like it. I habitually read for pleasure. Books that are relatively easy on the intellect, and this book isn't. I have enough mental challenges in the real world. If you want escapist fiction, this may not be right for you.An analogy; its like being at a business dinner in Asia, eating a delicacy that tastes aweful. All the locals at the table are treasuring the feast, and you're fighting to keep your gurge down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This was my first time using a Kindle product and I found it very convenient and a speedy way to get information."},{"rating":"2","title":"And what lies behind door number 1?","review":"As the second book of the series, I found this one much easier to follow. Perhaps because a lot of it occurs in our world in our own times (or nearly so). The language is a little \\"rough\\" at times, but is entirely in context with the characters. In book 1, most of the events occur as Roland is traveling through his world on his quest, and deals with his background. In this one, it seems more centered on the events surrounding the acquistion of his traveling companions and their lives. I enjoyed this story and, having now ordered the next 2, look forward to their arrival."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I don't do many book reviews as it would entail a prolonged synopsis and I don't really think anyone wants to read it. The series this book is a part of is Stephen King's best, most fleshed out series in his career. Maybe not his best book, The Drawing of the Three is a superb continuation and you really get to see a lot of plot and character development. My favorite in the series is the 3rd, but this book does a wonderful job in setting it up. That's all from me.Bottom line: Very good book and a must if you are reading the series. May be cheaper to get on nook or kindle though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I was really questioning whether to continue after reading the gunslinger, but now I'm glad I did. I couldn't put this one down and I look forward to the third book. I have to be fair and say that some of the wording can be a bit confusing.

Oh My!","review":"The second book in The Dark Tower series seemed a bit slower paced, at times.

I am glad they are there with the gunslinger, with the exception of Detta. I don't want to give too much away, but I have no doubt you will understand my feelings about Detta pretty quickly.There are several fantastic action scenes with Roland being the ultimate good-guy as well as the ultimate gunslinger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be patient with this one","review":"Alright so it took me a while to get through this one. I started this book last winter (Feb. 2010) and read the first half rather quickly. See this is essentially two books. The first half of the story tells us of Roland's interactions with Eddie Dean. The second half of the book chronicles interactions with Eddie, Detta/Odetta, and Rolad. After reading the first half of the book, I wasn't really sold and hadn't enjoyed it half as much as the Gunslinger. I put the book down for a while and came back to it a few weeks ago. All I can say is, what took me so long? Where the first half of the book felt slow, the second half popped with adventure at break neck speed. It was everything I wanted in the first half. Don't get me wrong the first half of the book had its moments, but not compared to the second half. The second half has what I thought to be some major reveals that are setting themself up for future books. With this book down I am ready to journey to The Wastelands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than The Gunslinger - don't lose heart!","review":"The Gunslinger, which kicks off the Dark Tower series, was a bit slow, but The Drawing of the Three picks up the pace, brings in characters that you'll actually care about and is in short, a great read!If you were tempted to stop reading after The Gunslinger, push forward and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not King's best...","review":"I love Stpehen King's books. I like to get first ed, and get them the day the come out. But as for The Dark Tower books so far...UG!The Drawing of the Three is a smidge better then The Gunsliger...but not by much. I found this book to be very dull and the char are thin at best. They have no developement, not like King's other books.This is the story of the last gunslinger (I just love that name :O) ) and how he builds his team in search of The Dark Tower. I found this book to be slow to read...it's like I was walking through mud. The only reason i want to read the seires, is that his next book (The Black House) makes references to this series and I want to keep up with what's going on.I'd say read this book if you want to, but only if you want to."},{"rating":"2","title":"delviered as ordered!!!","review":"I was very happy with this product.

Unfortunately, I found The Drawing of the Three to be one of the weakest stories I've ever read. I think the best description has already been stated elsewhere in these reviews...dull.I guess this must be one of those series that you either love or hate. For those who enjoy a good fantasy series of the likes of Goodkind, Jordan, Brooks, Feist, Donaldson, and Herbert, I strongly suggest that you look elsewhere. Unlike Roland, the span of time that I wasted reading this book means a lot to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WRONG BOOK!!!","review":"After finishing the first of the Dark Tower - The Gunslinger, series I was looking forward to receiving the second book, The Drawing of the Three. When I opened the package there it was, but I don't care for dust jackets, so I removed it from the new book. The actual book under the dust jacket was The Song of Susannah, which is the same size as The Drawing of the Three.

Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed it, but it read like a bad '80's sci-fi movie, and the use of colloquialisms and conversational narration was annoying and at times redundant. As with some of King's other books, he has come up with a great idea but failed to endow it with the story it deserves. Hopefully King will do more justice to the next installment in the series, and redeem Roland in this world.If you want to read a Stephen King novel I suggest one of the greats like \\"The Shining\\" or \\"The Green Mile\\".

Eddie Dean, a drug running heroin addict, Odetta Holmes, a wealthy handicapped woman with a split personality, and Jack Mort, a nasty killer who is the final bridge between the three. Where \\"Gunslinger\\" was murky in what it revealed, this second installment is much more accessible and begins to let the reader in on how the stories tie together. I find it great fun to be in the hands of such a master storyteller as his plot slowly unfolds. King once again brings his vivid imagination to the story with some amazing visual images, the lobstrosities, and how Roland takes over of the other characters bodies among the best. More action packed than the first I thought this was great, and can't wait for the third."},{"rating":"2","title":"And so it begins","review":"From this volume onwards, the story gets better and better.Things now start to take shape, and a thickening of the DT series starts here.The Gunslinger was for RolandThe Drawing of Three is for his comrades.If you are intending to read the rest - do so - then by book three you'll be up, up and away."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Border Legion.","review":"It was a bit slow to start but as I got into it, it got better.

I appreciated the attention to detail in the stories and the fact that they are told over several days when needed. For example, the story of Moses is read on days 51-101 so as not to leave anything out while not overwhelming the child with too much information at a time. It gives them something to look forward to the next day as the story continues.If this book had been available when my kids were young, I think it would have effectively replaced all the others I bought in my search for the perfect children's Bible story collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is stunning!","review":"This is the first book I've read by Ruth Wind.

The several back stories and connecting them to the present and not really knowing where exactly it all fit in kept me reading way too late many nights!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruth Wind just gets better and better!","review":"In the Midnight Rain is the kind of book you sip and savor and roll around on your tongue like Blue Reynard's favorite bourbon. It is as haunting as the blues drifting through a steamy summer night, as compelling as the questions that bring Ellie Connor to the town of Pine Bend. It has the slow, lavish sensuality of all good fiction set in the South. Ruth Wind brings to this work an eloquence in both her understanding of her characters and her use of language that makes this story linger in you mind long after you have closed the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected Ending","review":"I never look at the reviews prior to reading a book-- granted sometimes this works in my favor (such as this one) and sometimes not. I found it difficult to put this book down once I started reading it. I most enjoy a read when I can sink into the story and actually feel like I am there... For me, this book delivered that and more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised...","review":"While browsing the \\"free\\" books, this was #1 on the list...I didn't read any reviews prior to my purchase, something I've never done before.I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! From the very beginning, I was reading every line...that is the biggest compliment I can give any author! There are not many books that I read where I don't skim paragraphs, so when I say I read every line, that's big.Although predictable in many ways, I like the characters, story development and the story was laid out well enough and I can easily see this becoming a made-for-TV movie.I'm glad I have been introduced to this author....very talented story teller!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW.....Upset when it was over....so awesome that I wanted more!!!","review":"Okay, yall, I suck at reviews b/c I cant seem to say what I want without telling all. LOL But I had to try with this book. My Grandmother sent me this book b/c I will read anything. I picked it up 2 days ago and couldnt put it down. I got so wrapped up in the story of Ellie, Blue, and Mabel. The chacters in the book are wonderfully written. Even the supporting characters draw you in. I love Blues and Jazz and this books makes them come alive on paper!!! You can almost hear the music swirling around you as you read!! The story behind the story is just another draw of this book. I have never been SO pleased with a book. Again all I can say is WOW!!! Go Ruth for writing such an AMAZING book. I honestly was upset when it was over....so AWESOME that I wanted more!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it!","review":"I only got through a few chapters and I could not get into this book.

It is a sensual, steamy, bittersweet, hauntingly beautiful love story, set in a small Southern town, filled with warm and wonderful characters and loveable pets.Ellie and Blue are both emotionally wounded, but she is moving forward with her life, while he is stuck in the past. Ellie is the strongest woman I have ever met. She knows that she can't heal Blue, until he is ready. Smart girl! Blue is handsome, charming, sad, confused, and in such pain that it breaks your heart. He needs her. The past and present are interwoven throughout the story, and it all comes together in a great conclusion.I've read many books by Barbara Samuel, and I have never been disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice twist!","review":"The ending had me saying,\\"no way!\\" Never saw it coming, really great book!

The hero and heroine have great chemistry, and the mystery from the past was fascinating. This book certainly deserves its nomination as an Romance Writers of America RITA finalist."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books of 2000!","review":"All I can say is \\"Wow!\\" I finished this book with tears streaming down my face. Ruth Wind makes every word of this story sing. I felt the rain on my face, I tasted the buttery crunch of sweet corn on the cob and most of all, I felt every emotion that Blue Reynard and his Ellie experienced as they were falling in love. When you add a tantalizing mystery and the story of a woman discovering herself by discovering her past, you end up with an irresistible and empowering piece of women's fiction. It takes incredible skill to blend growing orchids and Vietnam and race relations and romance, but Ruth Wind makes it look effortless. I'm off to the Romance Writers of America site to vote for this brilliant and touching book as Favorite Book of the Year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book.....","review":"After a long list of disappointing books by some of my favorite authors this summer, I decided to try someone new. I haven't read anything by Ruth Wind before, but after reading IN THE MIDNIGHT RAIN I am eagerly awaiting her next book. It was by far the best book I'ver read all summer. I didn't want Ellie and Blue's story to end. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I stayed up until 1:37am reading this book.

Thank you for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fortunate find","review":"I'm so glad I found this book. Wasn't expecting much, but sometimes buy inexpensive books just to have some quick, casual reading. I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Interesting story and characters. I'm now going to look up more books by this author and hope they're as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luscious language, sensual atmospherics with a Southern drawl!!!","review":"What a great read! I felt a bit like a voyeur watching the relationship between Ellie and Blue develop. heat up, and mature. as these two complex characters open more and more of themselves to each other and to us. A beautifully written, well-thought out, engaging, and satisfying novel. I will definitely look for other books by Ruth Wind/Barbara Samuel . . . she definitely knows how to write spellbinding fiction. Count me as a new fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great romance","review":"I loved the story!

Not interested in details of seduction and all the description of their love? life. The mystery part takes 10th place in this book. I bought it based on reviews where no one said it was a romance novel. Great mystery definitely not. Will not get any more books by this author. Please reviewers say it as it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"too political and impossible dates","review":"The book has impossible timing,these people are suppose to remember 1968 and still be in their thirties chatting online in music forums??? Then the author has to throw in her politics, claiming Republicans aren't real people etc... So tired of liberals never letting entertainment be about entertainment and not about pushing their impossible champagne socialism. The Characters are all the same, bland, and not realistic, the plot is obvious, though she does write well, her story is not thought out."},{"rating":"1","title":"In The Midnight Rain","review":"Boring, took too long to get any action going.

Just hang them around your neck when not in use and go about your business. The only problem that stuck out with me immediately and in all seriousness was if you are a person with a large, larger than normal, or round head, it would be hard for the glasses to click or stay clicked together, even when the arms are fully extended. Also it would be nice if they had some sort of protective case to put it in when its not around your neck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Hit!","review":"I had read reviews that the frame ran small and I knew my husband's head and thick hair make his hat size a large, but I ordered them any way.

I'll get a complete refund, thank goodness.These would have worked had the band been a LOT more flexible. I couldn't even imagine trying to lie down to read in them.

I can never figure out if they should be above my hair or below. They are too snug they pinch my nose closed or if I make them longer, they balance an inch off my face and reading is a pain. I think the standard glasses chain with reading glasses is a better idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"clic too small","review":"Clic glasses good in some aspects but for people with a little larger head the adjustable frames could use about an inch more, they are too tight on the head.

However they are described as one size fits all which is not true. I have a normal size male head and they are too narrow. They squeezed my head so much that they just were not comfortable. I had to use a pliers to bend the metal part to make them wider. Now they fit nicely but they should not advertise them as one size fits all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small","review":"These are too small for my head. I don't know if they make a larger size but these things are too small. Yes these do adjust but they just do not adjust enough to fit me.

I have to give them a poor review."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"I've bought this pair of glasses before. I broke them. I liked the product which is why I bought again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for me and a conversation starter","review":"As some have said, the glasses are a little tight for someone like me with a melon head, but they are still usable (and I do have a very large head). The lenses are very good and provide a sharp view which is sometimes a problem with some store-bought glasses. The blue color of the pair I bought is striking without being overbearing and have generated multiple comments from even random passersby. I also found them to be very sturdy when I have gotten them caught on a bag strap I was removing from over my head. Sturdy, good-looking and good value. The only reason I don't give five stars is for the tight fit, which is partially my fault because of my oversize genes, but the company should have taken that into account. Otherwise, I recommend whole-heartedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product but not for the big guy.","review":"My wife loves them, but they are really not usable in bed as the angle that you look through is not comfortable while lying down. Also, I tried them on and they are not for someone with a wider forehead. They do not comfortably fit around a bigger guy's head, but she loves them and wears them a lot around the house.Build quality is great and they do the job for her and since they were bought for her, they are fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fashion over useful, not","review":"Where are my glasses? never again though you will not be the coolest person in the room.thus you are stuck with a dilemma.

Simple as that.I work as a paramedic/firefighter. If I doing intubation or starting IV or reading an EKG my patients don't complain about how I look, only did I save their life. If seeing is important and you need readers this is an excellent, reliable product. If seeing and being seen is important buy a dozen cool readers and leave then everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"They do exactly what they appear to","review":"The magnet is solid, the frame wiggle perfectly to make it clic and fit just like the picture shows. Lenses are clear and functional. However, they need to give a bit more space to accomodate larger heads, since it can get snug and this is NOT your usual glasses. Notice that the frame encircles the head, making head size an issue.On the plus side- the glasses won't fall off when you bend forward, they stay around your neck after you unclick 'em, and they are functional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clic Readers","review":"I had my original clic readers for about six years before I had to replace them. I love the quality of the lenses, the ease of use and the fact that I do not have to remember where I put them when I took them off. I never take them off and have even ordered several pair for other people at work. I am a carpenter and other than having to clean sawdust that accumulates on them once in a while, find them to be one of the most useful tools I own."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Long-Haired Wearers","review":"I have hair to the nape of my neck and when I wear these glasses, ithey either compress my hair and I look goofy, or if I tuck the arms under my hair, it sticks up and I look goofier.

I thought they would be the answer to the problem I have with constantly looking for my glasses. Due to the fact that I have long hair the glasses do not work as well for me. The strap is too short when not on my face which makes them a little too tight around my neck. If the strap were longer it would be too messy with my hair. I wear them under my hair so the longer strap would not work. I still would recommend these glasses for men or short haired women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not lost yet","review":"I bought these glasses for my boyfriend who is always losing reading glasses.He has used these for 10 months and he just loves them.

Kind of music if you like Meatloaf - strong, bold, out there operetic rock. Best part of the movie is watching Diane Lane lip sync strong vocals, dance and just look sexy.This movie was given a positive feature write up in \\"Time\\" magazine when it was reviewed and unfortunately did poorly at the box office.

It used British musicians which I particulary like, but the musicians seemed to not play in a synergenic style. They seemed to lack direction. They didn't really have a leader that took charge. I would have thought that Brian Lemon, the pianist would had taken conrol, but he didn't.I felt like the repertoire was a decent one, but there's more to creating a great sound than this. The musicians need to act like they are having fun playing and have a purpose for their gathering together.There were a few bright spots for this cd, but not enough.Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Class","review":"A superb album from the ever reliable Scott Hamilton. He's on Tenor Sax and from the moment 'Autumn Leaves' starts to when an uptempo 'Indiana' finishes you just know this is going to be a swinging affair.The album was the result of a poll in Japan's \\"Swing Journal\\" where they voted for the numbers they wanted to hear Scott Hamilton record.With Hamilton is a top British Trio:Brian Lemon - PianoDave Green - BassAllan Ganley - DrumsHaving seen all these musicians live on many occasions its a pleasure to hear an album that sounds 'live' in the studio, and this is reflected in the fact that it was all recorded in one day on August 31st 1993.This is an album any Jazz fan will enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classis East Side Kids move.","review":"This is in reference to the Alpha Video version.This is a classic east side kid's move where the kids help out the poor little rich boy who gets himself in a jamb. If you like the East side kids, like I do, you'll like this movie. The DVD and sound quality are terrible. You can barely see the picture at some points and the sound is scratchy to say the least. It appears it was just copied from the old films. I guess you can't expect too much for the price. There is a re-mastered copy of this video by Digiview Productions so make sure you buy that version. I haven't seen it yet but it has to be better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video transfer is awful.","review":"The movie is standard fare for the East Side Kids with some inside jokes like them saying \\"If we don't stop those muggers in the neighborhood, people will start calling us the East Side Kids\\". The real problem is that it is put out by Alpha Video which produces the very worst movie transfers in the industry. The film looks like they filmed it off a a bad signal on an old TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a must read for all educators.","review":"This is a book is for anyone interested in new ideas for education. Even though it was written a while ago, its still as relevant as ever. Since the school system is still using the same outdated tactics to get kids to learn, and it suffers continual degradation in results, the system still hasnt got the message that its way off track. This book will pull the reader back to a sane way to educate your child. One that doesnt sacrifice the child's desire to learn in favor of regimen, rules, standardization, repitition, uniformity, etc. This book will tell teachers how to create an environment where the student wants to learn. It will re-ignite the childs passion, sense of wonder, creativity, and yes, freedom to go as far or in any direction he/she wants to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band","review":"What a unique sound, even for the seventies. This group mixed teh sound of the fourties and fifties with disco. Contains every song that hit the disco charts from this group. So if you like this group, this CD has it all. Favorites are Cherchez La Femme/Se Si Bon and Sour And Sweet/Lemon In The Honey."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAMBO DOWN MEMORY LANE","review":"wE REALLY ENJOYED BEING ABLE TO ONCE AGAIN EXPERIENCE THE SONGS WE LOVED ALL ON ONE CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yikes - this is accurate!!!!","review":"I hate to admit it, but this is one on-target - the good and the (ummmm, well) things to work on :-)As a Cypress, it targeted my down to the detail, much to my dismay at times... Wonderful book, and a BIG insight into personalities - including your own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great jazzy Christmas tunes","review":"I love the upbeat, toe-tapping songs of Phil Driscoll on this album... hard to find it, but well worth the hunt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Puts you in the Christmas Spirit","review":"I enjoy Phil Driscoll's music a lot, however, this album was a big departure from his signature sound (blue eyed soul). Yet it is probably my favorite of all his work, and really shows his range as a trumpet player. The big band/swing sound always puts me in the Christmas spirit. His rendition of God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen is one of my favorite renditions of that song. This is may be my third favorite Christmas album tha I own, behind Nat King Cole's Christmas Song(best ever in my opinion) and Israel and New Breed's A Timeless Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"My all-time favorite Christmas CD to date","review":"I had the honor of playing bass for Phil once and was amazed at his talent. He sings better than Michael Bolton in his prime, plays trumpet like Doc Severinsen wishes he could and also plays keyboards - frequently all at the same time. A friend of mine who was doing some production work for Phil mailed me this CD with a note that said \\"This will blow your mind\\" - and it did! My mouth was hanging open 30 seconds into the first track. This is Phil and some monster session players ripping it up like you have never heard Christmas songs played before. I've been wearing it out every year since it came out. Phil; if you ever read this brother - where can I get the charts?!Gods Love,RichHeaven & Nature Swing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Music... bad editorial choices","review":"There's some great music on this album. That said, the idea here is that this is music by Gay composers.... and some of these guys were straight. Not convinced of the mood and, most certainly, the editorial choices were unfortunate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"I bought these for my 17 month old. They fit him perfectly. Due to the fact that they aer listed as \\"snow boots\\" I naturally assumed that they would be good for outside, in the snow. Way off.... He wore them in the snow once. He also had snow pants on. The shoes were soaked right through to his socks. Paying upwards of $30 for a pair of shoes that are mis-advertised as \\"snow boots\\" is ridiculous. List them for what they are - cold weather slippers!Since I already wrote his name on the back of them (day care child) I can't return them! I could not be more irritated!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"These boots didn't stay on my son's feet very well at all. They were impossible to slide on because they are so soft...there's too much give and they just scrunched up. Also, the soles are soft fabric. They are not at all appropriate for the snow as they get wet right away. Not worth the money in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspiring story but poorly written","review":"I read this to my 11yo son and 13yo daughter as part of the SonLight Curriculum. The story is inspiring, no doubt, and educates the reader on the value of the Bible. In our Bible saturated society we are too flippant in that lesson. Since my kids are not extra-ordinary like Mary (rather ordinary) and content to sit through a 2 hour sermon, they had a hard time empathizing with her. As stated in a previous review, the author tends to lose the reader with rabbit trails that feel endless and meaningless about other characters. I hope a more imaginatve author takes this inpiring true story and weaves it into a fictional historical novel thereby spreading the word about Mary, the need to value God's word and proving that christains CAN write good books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific translation of a classic","review":"Many modern readers are intimidated by books like this. Yes, it's long compared with most modern fiction; and yes, there are some (to Western ears) tongue-twisting Russian names to keep straight. But at its center, The Brothers Karamazov is a riveting murder mystery and social commentary, surprisingly modern (the section about doctors and specialists, particularly)and very readable. It would have been interesting to read this for the first time in the midst of the O.J. Simpson trial, since the trial in the book shares some similarities with that most famous of murder trials. A classic novel, and not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review for Kindle version only","review":"There are serious formatting problems with the Kindle version of this otherwise fine book, evident from the very first page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never use one word when you can add 10.","review":"I read as far as page 574 (of 974) and would have given up a lot sooner if I wasn't reading it for a bookgroup discussion. The concepts and plot of this book would be interesting but the writing style made me nauseous. There is just too much unnecessary detail and irrelevant addition to make it interesting. It also makes it confusing and interferes with the main themes and plot.It would be a good exercise for someone learning English to take parts of this book and summarize them down into less words. (If someone did that with the whole book it might be an enjoyable read.)This was my first attempt at reading Dostoevsky and probably my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes some pointed observations about genetics","review":"The future of the human race and its probes into genetics is considered in The Impact Of The Gene, a title that deftly blends the history of genetic research with an informative discussion of future trends of geneticbased technologies. From the initial establishment of genetics as a science by a 19th century friar to latest advancements by genetics which have affected everyday life, The Impact Of The Gene makes some pointed observations about genetics and its influence on our world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great, thought-provoking read that sticks with you.","review":"This Other Eden is an intelligent, humorous look at society and its foibles. It sucks the reader into its twisted story of approaching appocalypse and fails to let go, even long after the last page has been turned. I still find myself, a few years after I first read it, thinking about this book. Read it; it's fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most romantic of his books, with a quasi-happy ending!","review":"Ben Elton has written four books (see my Ben Elton FAQat http://pobox.com/~brit-com/Comedy/Elton.html)and has been responsible for many hit British comedies,plays and books.This was his third novel on the theme of EcologicalArmageddon, the first one called Stark, about thepossibility of business leaders abandoing Earth, andthe second one concerning the motor car.This one is much more 'together' than his first novel, andalso has more humorous characters than his previousefforts. Having said that, his original novels' charactersare far more unique and individual, and aren't necessarilystereotypical. Try them out"},{"rating":"2","title":"From the mind of the Eighties","review":"Out of Ben Elton crawls some of the most wonderful and fantastic prose I have ever read. What if Pynchon, instead of losing track of some of the balls he juggles and readers in the process, instead kept a strict schedule of events and knew how every word should sound before he ever wrote a book? Ben Elton is fantastic; I enjoyed his television venture(s), but I am in love with his prose. This story is wonderful, I am giving it to at least one person this holiday season. Elton has a profound grasp on the American and british psyches... let us hope that he never chooses to relax his hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad but Ben..","review":"not everything you write can be about rich people escaping doomsday - unsuccessfully, as it turns out. Still I enjoyed this book and he writes very amusingly - I often laugh out loud when reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty and clever","review":"Was never too keen on Ben elton as a comedian, but as a writer/novelist he is first class. This was one of the funniest books I have read in a long time, great humor and set in a not too distant future. It's full of great characters, great one liners and a plot that will stay with you long after you have put the book down and given it to someone else to read. Elton is a clever but witty genius. Can't wait to start reading the rest of his back catalog now."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Ben Elton book","review":"Ben Elton's books are excellent. The political and social comment is intelligent, perceptive and hilarious. Unfortunately, although this book is perceptive it lacks the direction and characterisation of his other novels. The book is therefore tedious in places and lacks the laugh out loud hilarity of Inconceivable and Gridlock. Therefore read any Ben Elton book apart from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps he should stick to television.","review":"Stark was excellent and Gridlock was good. This is poor. Nothing is compelling about this book. No surprises, not a very good story line, not inspiring, it's not even funny! If you don't buy one Ben Elton book, don't buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice detective story","review":"This is a detective story based in Valparaiso, Bonn and La Habana. The detective, Cayetano Brule, is a cuban who lives in Valparaiso and is always thinking about leaving the rainy and melancolic city, but never does. It is very interesting, and even more if you know Valparaiso and are familiar with the political circumstances in Chile. The author has a very interesting point of view about that, and this circumstances have a lot to do with Brule's work. The only critic is that the detective's character is too similar to Montalban's Carvahlo. Even so, it is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Una Novela de Misterio Mezclada Con La Politica","review":"Esta novela estaba escrita con un bueno estilo d'escritura y el dialogo esta escueto y estimulante. L'historia tiene lugar en Chile y las pistas llevan el detective a Bonn, Alemania y a La Habana sobre la muerte, l'asesinato de Cristian Kusterman qui parece estar un arreglo entre contrabandistas. Sin embargo hay muchos, oltros factores y algunos factores tienen una calidad politica. Este libro esta muy entretenido."},{"rating":"2","title":"What barley did to Alexandria","review":"This book is a collection of history as well as pictures of past and present history.Greek,Ottoman,Roman and modern. It includes all the phases of Alexandria.From the time of her popularity to her downfall.The book is rather small compacted and has about 200 pages.Extremely well written,with many interesting details.Having lived in Alexandria for 30 years of my life I can sincerely vouch that this book is great.If you really like Alexandria Egypt then this book is a must to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Information","review":"It's clearly written and is clearly aimed at the novice. I'd advise people to see how much they can learn from the program help rather than spend the money on this one. You'll probably need a book but you'll need one that's more comprehensive.In spite of its actual length, the book seems like it's 20 pages long. It's a friendly, very basic, intro to Access. Unfortunately it's going to leave a lot of beginners hanging when they encounter the myriad real world situations the book doesn't cover. I would not advise buying this book without a reference manual to go with it. Example: I wanted to know the syntax for quoting character strings in comparisons. Nothing. In fact all of the comparison and selection by value examples in the book use numbers or dates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had expected","review":"This book leaves alot to be desired. Cover to cover, It seemed way too brief. I felt like I was being coached through a few topics that could be figured out by just playing around with the program. Im confused as to why the authors felt it necessary to sacrifice so many trees in order to offer a step by step walk-through of how to use the program's various wizard modes. It seems to me that anyone could open up access and walk themselves through the wizard without reading any of this book. The other 25%-35% of the book that does cover the design view is way to0 brief to be of any use. You barely get a taste of what's out there. Basically you feel like your still.... searching for the \\"Missing\\" information."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Female Singers Around...........","review":"Her voice exudes all of the wonderful qualities that one would attribute to an attractive mature woman..... low-pitched, husky, with an incredible refined sex appeal. If you doubt this, listen to her killer version of the old Tommy Dorsey theme \\"I'm Getting Sentimental Over You\\". Another favorite of mine is \\"An Older Man...etc\\". which, with her delivery, tends to make you feel better about the passing years (face it guys....none of us stays young forever).Actually, there isn't a bad track on the whole disk. Superb accompanyment by Stefan Scaggaiari on piano, the rest of the rhythm section being John Lockwood on bass and Colin Bailey on drums. Some nice embellishment is provided by the appearance of Frank Wess on 4 tracks, playing either tenor sax or flute.You have to try this one........actually, any of her Concord Jazz albums would be good choices. A wonderful songstress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great content","review":"I bought this book to assist with editing newsletter articles for our work newsletter.

Highly recommended for those who edit or write for newspapers or magazines, even high school & college kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto... Don't Bother","review":"I couldn't agree more with the other 2-Star Review. Don't bother adding this to your collection. While John Goodall illustrates gorgeous books, the plot on this one is seriously lacking -- and not worth the greatly overpriced cost. Don't let the cute cover featuring an adorable mouse maiden in Renaissance garb fool you. I bought this for my 4-year-old daughter who absolutely adores Goodall's other classics: \\"Shrewbettina's Birthday,\\" \\"Naughty Nancy Goes to School,\\" and \\"The Midnight Adventures of Kelly, Dot & Esmeralda.\\" This one, however, not only fell flat, but the images of the bats and dragon scared her to the point where we had to put the book away for some time before she was willing to look at it again -- and this is a child who is not easily scared. If you like wordless books, and aren't familiar with Goodall's other classics, the best to start with are \\"Shrewbettina's Birthday\\" and the \\"Midnight Adventures of Kelly, Dot & Esmeralda.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"John Goodall illustrates beautiful wordless books, and this is no exception (so I've given this two stars, instead of one). But unlike some of his other books our family has \\"read\\" (such as Paddy Goes Traveling), this does not have a very interesting plot. In a nutshell, two mice visit an abandoned castle, are locked inside and face a few perils -- each one easily handled by the male mouse, a knight -- before safely returning home. The characters are flat; the knight is brave, the lady timid. Yes, it is a fairy tale, but many traditional tales are far more interesting. Skip this one, especially if you have a daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im guilty.. read desciption","review":"Thought I was buying a knife. For $5.00 plus $3.95 .. Total price of $8.95.

Author James Robert Parish also shows how Hepburn's offscreen life was shaped by the era in which she lived. Fans who do not want to hear that Hepburn was bisexual or that her affair with Spencer Tracy wasn't all that it seemed may not appreciate this investigation. Others should enjoy reading the many \\"Golden Age\\" anecdotes (some I've never heard before) and seeing the rare photos (I assume some have never been before published). And what could have been seamy and exploitative becomes compelling and well-crafted. This book is recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Daring, Important Biography","review":"Parish, who has dominated the field of show business biographies for so long, has dared to do what Scott Berg only hinted at and no other biographer dared: depict Hepburn through the lens of her hidden sexuality, as well as explore the same of other players in the motion picture industry of the time. Those who object to this kind of scrutiny will simply ignore the fact that to this day, stars often battle their own sexual needs with the marketing of their public images. This is an important and respectful book on a fascinating woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Untrustworthy Story","review":"If you enjoy a book where in every so-called shocking statement or bit of innuendo is preceded or followed by \\"maybe\\" or \\"possibly\\", then you will like this book. Also if you like cut and paste jobs this is your book. If on the other hand you are looking for a well-written, well-researched book that actually tells you something worth knowing about Katharine Hepburn, then stay away from this one.This book has one mission -- to try to convince the world that Kate was gay and since Parish can provide nothing more than rumor, gossip, and supposition in that area -- it is a miserable failure of a book and a waste of time and paper and ink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even one star is too generous.","review":"Parish's efforts are nothing more than a re-hashing of everything you already know. It certainly isn't the \\"untold story\\" the book jacket promises. Clumsily written and boring, Parish should have enlisted the aid of a better editor. One case in point: a good editor would have checked facts and known there is no such place as Tavasoon (where he notes they filmed part of \\"The Lion in Winter\\"), the town is actually called Tarascon. This book is pure drivel. Don't bother wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unprofessional","review":"Groundless, biased assertions couched in meanspirted prose. The author appears to really dislike Hepburn, and that is neither professional nor engaging for the reader. A good biographer should 1) be able to substantiate sweeping claims, especially about a subject's sexual life, and 2) maintain a neutral tone when writing about the subject, no matter how distasteful the biographer finds the actions of said subject. This author has done neither. Don't waste your time with this book even at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another poorly written biography","review":"Those of you expecting a well written account will be very disappointed by another ho hum biography of Hepburn . The subtitle of his book is An Untold Story but there is nothing new in this biography expect for endless speculation about Katharine's sexuality . I guess its hard to deal with such a complex issue well but if you don't have the skill don't do it . I knew the book was in trouble when Parrish pegged Katharine as a lesbian on the basis of a crush he had when she was 11 years old!!! More importantly the book does nothing to help us understand Hepburn . Its poorly written and relies heavily on Darwin Porter - stay clear of it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the jacket!","review":"The books jacket says that it is well researched. In fact it is, but all the stuff about Kate and being bisexual is a matter of opinion. He never gives concrete information and uses what he does find he twist around to work in his favor. Although it is a good book for Kate facts, don't believe anything about her being bisexual."},{"rating":"2","title":"A necessary addition to your Christmas music collection","review":"This album is phenomenal. *NSYNC's harmonies will bring goose bumps along with an overwhelming sense of Christmas spirit.

There's one song called \\"I Guess It's Christmas Time\\" that reminds in its style very closely the Swedish group Abba which back in the day used to be a very hot one here.

Something for everyone!","review":"This is the most awesome Christmas CD released in a very long time. The new stuff is great with the same *N Sync heart and soul that makes them stand out. The traditional songs are recognizeable but again with the *N Sync sound that sets them apart from the same old tired recordings we hear time after time. My 5 yo daughter, 15 yo sister, 50 yo mother and 70 yo grandfather all love it - something for everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Home for Christmas\\" expresses different meanings","review":"I love the idea of a Christmas album (for one thing, it proves depth of \\"teen stars\\" in some popular groups), and I love the sound of 'N Sync's Christmas album. I started to cry when I opened up the album booklet and read that some of the group members made a point to acknowledge Jesus Christ, the real reason for the season. While coming \\"home for Christmas\\" is a sweet idea that should hold true forever (keeping in touch with family and such) I find that it also can represent one's personal spiritual path. Coming \\"home for Christmas\\" can mean, for me at least, to realize the truth of the holiday and to take this time of year to wake up, change your ways, and return back to God, your true home. Thank God for these people, who are bold enough to state their religion publicly and live it, and may they provide an example for some fans to discover their own spirituality. Merry Christmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holiday favorite","review":"I love this cd! it is a perfect mix of classic favorites and new songs. There is not one song on this album that I ever need to skip. This is one of the best cds to ring in the holidays with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for all fans of Christmas music!","review":"You don't have to be an NSYNC fan to like this album; anyone of all ages who likes Christmas music and great harmonies will like the album. It has some traditional songs and some original songs that are even better that the traditional songs! All 5 guys get a chance to sing verses (Justin and JC still dominate, but at least Chris gets to sing more and Joey and Lance actually get to be heard by themselves). \\"Oh Holy Night,\\" \\"Under My Tree,\\" \\"Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays,\\" and \\"The Christmas Song\\" will be sure to get you into the Christmas spirit. \\"I Never Knew the Meaning of Christmas\\" is also great. Most of the other songs are about love/Christmas, and they almost sound like they are normal song that the guys could sing year-round if the word \\"Christmas\\" didn't appear in them. But don't expect to hear songs that sound like \\"Bye Bye Bye;\\" the production is different. All NSYNC fans should have this album because it showcases NSYNC's wonderful vocal abilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"A major Justin, and NSYNC fan from Seattle, Washington","review":"Home for Christmas is the best! Their voices are finely toned and they each somehow have a solo. It's an excellent CD! I LOVE JUSTIN AND THE REST OF *NSYNC!!

All the guys sound awesome, and it is great to hear more of Joey, Lance and Chris (especially Chris)...."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAGNIFICENT","review":"*N SYNC has done it again. \\"Home For Christmas,\\" has proved to be not only the perfect holiday music, but the most heatfelt album that I have heard any singer or group put out ever. It's December 26th. I am still listening to this album as if Christmas isn't here yet, and I am continuously astounded day-to-day of the accomplishments of these guys. This Christmas album has brought so much joy to me as a person (especially around the holidays), and has helped me understand the real meaning of Chistmas. I LIKE EVERY SINGLE SONG ON THIS ALBUM, BUT MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITES ARE; \\"Love's In Our Hearts On Christmas Day,\\" \\"O Holy Night,\\" \\"Home For Christmas,\\" \\"Under My Tree,\\" \\"In Love On Christmas,\\" \\"It's Christmas,\\" \\"Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays,\\" and I guess that sums it up. Justin has an amazing solo in \\"Love's In Our Hearts On Christmas Day."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Completely Intriguing","review":"This C.D. is wonderful. It has a mix of so many different things. It's kinda techno, kinda gospel and totally full of love.

This Cd was the worst thing to happen to Christmas since Celine Dione. This Cd is obviously propaganda leading people from the joy of christmas.

Too commercial and studio-ized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry excuse for a Christmas album","review":"My mom bought this CD for my sister and I think that it was just a big waste of money. I HATE \\"Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays\\" or whatever it's called. *N Sync has this stuck up attitude and they think that anything they put out will be gobbled up by consumers. Not everyone is an eight year old girl, and not everyone enjoys what they put out. They need to expand their horizons if they want to last in the music industry. Break out of the bubblegum mold and start singing some real music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merry Christmas and a Woosy New Year","review":"Well,well, a Christmas album from the most boring group in the history of music. Sorry but I think it's possible to have a thrash metal Christmas album. What I'm saying is that it doesn't have to put you to sleep in order for it to be heartfelt and beautiful. This is the Christmas gift for teenyboppers and wimps."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album is quite easily, the worst CD EVER!","review":"After the popularity of N'Syncs' catchy song, \\" Tearin' up my heart\\" I decided to give them a try with their next album. Oh my lord this IS the worst cd ever. With those boys singin' songs that are so annoying and dumb, I couldn't stand it! The first song, it was like, totally off key, and sounded exactly like the next one, and the next one, and the next one, and so on. Stay away, N'Syncs' made a stink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still great after all these years!","review":"This album is great!

Here's proof: I listen to it all year long! It's THAT good. One of my favorite things about \\"Home For Christmas\\" is that all of the boys get a chance to sing on it, not just Justin and JC. The songs really put you in the Christmas spirit. I definitly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Album!","review":".... I think this album is awesome, well one thing is becuase nsync is my favourite band and 2nd of all it really puts you into the christmas mood. The songs vary from semi fast happy songs, to sad songs that could make you cry. And It has an acapella 'O Holy Night which is SOOO extremely nice, and it is almost worth buying the album just for that song. Of course there is also, all the other songs like \\"merry christmas happy holidays\\" which is a semi fast song that really puts you into the spirit of christmas. The cd is definately a must have for nsync fans, and for people who really like christmas hope this helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Holidays!","review":"This is by far my favorite Christmas album! \\"Merry Christmas Happy Holidays\\" is played repeatedly at my house in the winter time. My mom and I have to fight for the use of the CD system in our living room (she wants to play her Elvis Christmas CDs).

When CD arrived, CD looked great. It was a Christmas present for my daughter and wrapped promptly. Unfortunately, I should of checked it better because on the back cover someone had many inappropriate anti-gay slurrs written on it.

I should of knew better buying used."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"WOW! This is a phenominial track with wonderful songs.

A few of the songs could be very pretty, but Justin is so whiny on 9/10 of this CD, it makes you cringe.*NSYNC has put out some honest effort in a few of their CDs and have had some very good songs. This doesn't contain any of them, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS FUNKY FOLLOW UP ALBUM IS SURE TO BE A HIT","review":"THIS CD IS THE PERFECT FOLLOW UP TO 'N SYNC'S PLATNUIM DEBUT ALBUM. ALTHOUGH SOME BANDS SUFFER FROM BACKLASH WHEN THEY REALEASE THEIR SECOND ALBUM, THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THIS ALBUM WILL ONLY HELP THEM. THE SONGS ARE FRESH, AND FUNKY. THEY ARE UPBEAT, AND HAPPY. VERY REFRESHING. THE VOCALS ARE GREAT, AND THE INSTRUMENTAL, ALTHOUGH A LITLE CHEESY, GOES WELL WITH THE MUSIC.

Some of the CD was nice, but some of it wasn't fit for the whole concept of the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"What could possibly have possessed them?","review":"Unfortunatly, high pitched pop doesn't get me into the Christmas spirt. The songs all have an annoying beat and the group's voices don't work well with the subject matter. The only only holiday tradition this album reminded me of was Hanky the Christmas poo."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is MUSIC?!?","review":"N Syncs is not real music. Do they play there own instruments? No. There nothing but one-hit wonders. They might be popular now, but look what happened with MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice to name a few. The background instruments are just cheesy. Not one guitar string plucked on the entire album. They are merciless imitations of the backstreet boys. Some of these songs are just a disgrace to christmas. The best showing here is probably \\"Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays\\" and \\"Kiss Me At Midnight\\" but even those are cheesy and horrible. Everything sounds like you'd hear it in line while buying popcorn at the movies or in a bad soap opera. So to all the teeny boppers out there, listen to some real music like The Beatles, Radiohead, Beastie Boys, or even Marilyn Manson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teenybopping Trash, Annoying, Horrible, Pathetic","review":"I HATE N'SYNC. THEY SUCK HARD! THEY ARE A BUNCH OF POSERS WHO WANT TO BE EXACTLY LIKE THE BACKSTREET BOYS, WHO IN FACT ARE NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK WANNABES. THEY DON'T PLAY THEIR INSTRUMENTS OR WRITE THEIR OWN MATERIAL. IT'S A GUARANTEE THAT THEY WON'T LAST FOR LONG. ATTENTION ALL LITTLE TEENYBOPPERS, DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM ON 11/10, AND IT'S ABOUT TIME TO LISTEN TO REAL MUSIC LIKE THE DOORS, HANSON, AND FIONA APPLE. NO STARS AT ALL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-enthused","review":"For their type of music, I expected this to be a little more upbeat. Its a lot of mushy songs.

A brief but informative overview of Vermeer's life is provided, along with large format reproductions of all of his existing works. Inlcuded in each description is the location of each work, along with the dimensions of the original. While my goal is to see all the Vermeers on display, this is a great reference companion. I keep it on my coffee table and refer to it often. It's a treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"Does not sound like original, early Cline. Sounds more like late 60's early 70's music. Dissapointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, repetitive, badly written, translated poorly","review":"Do yourself a favor, skip this mess. It's boring, repetitive, badly written, and translated poorly. Often the ramblings are just incoherent. There are inexplicably long paragraphs that start with one subject, switch to something unrelated, and end with yet another story.If the eroticism is what interests you, skip this book: You will be disappointed. Amazon.com has a wide selection of much better erotica to select from or you can go to literotica.com to get stories from amateurs written a hundred times better than this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Numbingly dreary","review":"Millet's sexual life is just a rambling catalogue of sexual acts. She is fooling herself if she thinks she is revolutionary or shocking. She obviously believes in quantity over quality and sex to her is all about the act rather than the emotion. Maybe something is lost in translation. There is nothing interesting about any of the encounters, no humor even, just a rather depressing account. It reads like a rather gory medical experiment. Yes, it is an accurate title but if you want some good erotica, try \\"The Butcher\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Detached to Engage","review":"Everybody has a friend or someone they know how loves to brag about their sexual encounters. At first they're interesting, then repititious and tiresome, then unbelievable.This book was like listening to that guy or girl.Living in a GIRLS GONE WILD era, where just about every girl under 25 looks drunk, tattooed and totally slutty, it's hard to feel there is anything unique about this memoir: beach parties and spring breaks provide daily debaucheries on a wide scale.I also questioned the credibility of this book when it comes to diseases: anyone so reckless would've surely picked up something! I have friends with only a few party indiscretions who found themselves infected with herpes, so for Ms. Millet to drone on and on about long lines of strangers without a word about any infection at all sounds dishonest.The more she writes of her sexual escapades, the more detached and removed she appears from herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather dull, all things considered","review":"This book can keep one's interest for about the first 100 pages, but that's about it. After that, you will have become thoroughly maddened by her writing style. You will find out by that point that she's not going to tell you very much about herself other than she likes/liked sex a lot, and as one other reviewer wrote, the letters in American men's magazines are better. As for the reviewer in Switzerland who thinks it's the best piece of erotica he/she has ever read, Switzerland must not have much."},{"rating":"1","title":"She is fooling herself","review":"While promoted as a no-holds-barred feminist track on sexuality, I found this book to be a very sad account of a woman's search for identity and meaning. Sprinkled throughout the long narratives on group sex and sex with strangers, are clues to her lack of self esteem and her disappointment in sex. From her molestation as a pre-pubescent girl to one long-term partner telling her she had a so-so face but a great [butt], I think Millet is fooling herself if she believes the life she has led has not scarred her. The sexually transmitted disease, the abortion, and having \\"lovers\\" who pass you to strangers are not sexy. For crying out loud the woman wasn't sure what an orgasm felt like was after years of group sex. I was unable to enjoy the eroticism in the book because I could not get past the self-debasement of the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Millet Herself, this Book Sucks","review":"What does it take for an average looking woman to attract a great number of men for a variety of sexual expressions. Not much -- she just has to be willing. Men must be clever or rich or charming or whatever, but a woman just has to show up. So, since she is supposed to be a writer and an intellectual, I was hoping for interesting views from that perspective, or at least above average tittilation. No such luck. Fortunately, I borrowed the book. It was returned clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money and time!","review":"I was so bored that I couldn't be bothered to read more than one third of this book. I expected much more - liberating female writing, passion, pleasure. I couldn't find even a grain of passion or pleasure in C Millet's writing, just a list of very boring descriptions of sexual activities. Even the worst pornography is much more interesting! CM describes happenings as if she was not involved at all, as if everything happened without her consent, as if she is mentally retarded...Lousy!I rate this book with O stars, or with five dead bats, it's so boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Boring Sex Life EVER","review":"I was totally bored reading this book and completely disgusted with the critics who recommended it. After the first chapter I put the book down and have no plans on reading any further. This is the first review I have ever written, but I wanted to warn everyone - DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. I don't know what the French were thinking in making this book a success!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have listened to the other reviewers","review":"I read several reviews that told future customers to skip this book. I should have listened. The writing was poorly done and confusing. There was no passion to anything that the author did, it was robotic and just made me sad for her. This 'liberation\\" of her just came across as low self esteem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just what stupid men need to read","review":"I had to put this book down after the first chapter becuase I felt like my hands were covered in semen. This is a hastily scrawled inventory of one woman's lovers -- and they are a cast of thousands. She takes on groups of men with every orifice and yet offers the reader no more inight about these experiences than if she'd been shopping for cucumbers. She is boring, possibly troubled but who cares? I was reminded of that group of chimpanzees that stays in rut the year-round and can barely provide itself with food for the time it spends in frenzied coitus. Two things about this book made me suspicious: First of all, the author claims to have had a vigourous bout of group rutting in the midst of a migraine, taking time-outs for the vomiting. Right. The other is her claim that not once did a group of men get out of control and harm her. This is ... tarted up as some kind of cutting-edge wisdom. It should do well in college towns."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sexual LIfe of Catherine M.","review":"I have never been moved to write a review until now. Save your money! This is a terribly, terribly boring book of disjointed ramblings of a very sad woman. It is not or even the least bit erotic or interesting. Skip it, period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Tour-de-Force","review":"This is a great book by an incredibly adventurous lady. It is no wonder it is a runaway best seller in Europe. Whether it is all her experiences or not she makes it seem that it is (was) and she is to be admired for her explorations and sexuality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Read","review":"I couldn't get past the 3rd chapter. I feel pain and sorrow for Catherine M. that she has so much emotional pain and disrespect for her body=TherapyI was on a flight and put this book down to read the Inflight magazine which was more interesting then this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Since when is Sex intellectual?","review":"Or perhaps intellectual is too good a term for it. This unintelligable nonsense goes on for far too many pages. We have whole chapters in which the author tries to relate having sex al fresco to expanding person freedom into space. Is this the actual sense we're supposed to get from sex, or is the rest of the human race just not attuned to it like Miss M.? Not only does she describe scenes of unimaginable humiliation with a blink, but she even describes a scene in which she was beaten by a dozen different people while running down a street, and both times without the slightest hint of emotion.Sex has not made this woman alive, it has made her dead! It has not made her free, it has made her a toy. She describes in a scene in which she trusts her male escort so much that she will sleep with anyone he gives the nod to. I wonder if Miss M. still comes out in public."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Money","review":"If one seeks to buy a book about sex, it should either be erotic or informative, or both. This is neither. The woman's sex life is basically that of a blow up doll - she basically makes herself available to anyone who wants it and is so detached from emotion and thought that one wonders whether she enjoyed any of her experiences. As a reader, I could not. That's when I could decipher the bad writing. Sentences and paragraphs flow on without any indication of organisation and the writing is bad. OK, you might think, at least it could be erotic. It's not. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope she got more satisfaction than I did.","review":"Finally, I thought, an honest, open book about the life of a female sexual libertine. I looked forward to learning about her motivations, her experiences, in a thoughtful, possibly linear fashion. Instead we are advised that Catherine first had sexual intercourse at 18. Within pages she is describing taking part in a gang bang (how many in a gang bang, 3, 5, 10) and spreading her legs for 20 and 30 men at a time. How, pray tell, does one go from a deflowering at 18 to 20 to 30 men in a row. And how long did it take to achieve this. And what was her thinking. You'll never know, and less than halfway through the book, you simply won't care. I finished this book but wish I hadn't. A complete waste of time and effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it.","review":"I quit reading at fifty pages. I was bored. She blips from one story to the next and none of it has a point. It's about how much sex she's had and how great all of her partners thought she was. Whoop-de-doo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks True Insight","review":"Some have termed this book courageous for its inside look into the free (of responsibility and emotion) sexual life of a woman. I plunked down $ hoping to gain some unique insight into the emotional consequences of such a lifestyle and perhaps learn something I could apply to my own life. Instead, I felt like a voyeur who was only treated to the mechanical/physical side of a strange wanderlust with no insight into emotion or inner transformation. It provided neither insight nor erotica if one is looking for that. I have read novels such as Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin that force a more thoughtful examination of one's relationships and self-concept, and which hit home very personally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without taste or plot","review":"I purchase _The Sexual Life of Catherine M._ out of curiosity. I sincerely regret it. It has been compared to the works of the Marquis de Sade. What a joke. This fails horribly as erotica AND as philosophy. It's not giving anyone any insight into anything. I found it hard to believe, and if this is true, how can anyone take the author seriously. I mean, come on, it jumps from her coldly-regarded orgies to \\"I love to ...\\". It's a waste. If this was amazing, ground-breaking etc, when she wrote it, something was lost in translation. And no, that's not just an ignorant American speaking out of jealousy or whatever. Not by a long shot. You can find better in letters to \\"gentlemen's magazines.\\" Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow","review":"What can I say? I absolutely wanted to regurgitate this book...metaphorically and physically. It was raunchy, emotionless porn. I wouldn't recommend it to even the most adventurous reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The proposal seemed very interesting at first and the book's review gave the impression that it was about the sexual history of somebody who had lived its sexuality at the up most and have something to share with us about it.However, the book fails to deliver that. It seems more the result of the author's fertile imagination than the register of real history.She managed to turn the narrative timeless (it's not possible to know when the facts happened and at what age), the names may have been changed for privacy purposes and the link between one history and other sometimes is quite confusing.The bottom line is that what regards a reflection about human sexuality this book adds nothing to the discussion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, this isn't erotic or even interesting","review":"I don't usually post bad reviews....if I don't like a book I just move on. But this really made me angry becuase its not erotic, or even interesting its boring.Skip over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all erotic...nameless, faceless orgies.","review":"I bought this book in hopes of reading something liberated and erotic. In fact it is descriptions of orgy after orgy, no character building, no plot...who cares? This women degraded herself, left herself completely vulnerable to STD's and never describes any satisfaction she gets from these sordid endeavors.I didn't even finish it, a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get it","review":"This book was just plain weird. I couldn't relate to anything about the author, and I'm glad of that.I finished the book not understanding anything about the woman -- her motivations, the ramifications of her choices, etc. It was a long, rambling, jumbled mess of strange, twisted memories and fantasies.It was awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do something else with your time","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. It lacks inspiration or any sort of structure or organization. It sounds more like fever-induced random ramblings which often refer to orgies. Like other reviews note, there is nothing new, funny, interesting, artistic, or exciting in this book. I would not qualify it as erotica or pornography. It is simply extremely dull repetitive writing about one woman's sex life.I am amazed this book was even published."},{"rating":"1","title":"who thought sex could be this dull?","review":"considering that sex should be about as interesting a topic as there is, it really is amazing how so many writers can make it sooooo dull. are orgies really about as interesting as roofing a house? reading this author, it sure seems like it. what a disappointment this book was. not once did i achieve wood status while reading it. horrible. horrible. horrible. about as bad a book as i've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"I really think this was either a ploy to make a quick buck or a planned hoax.Poorly written and gives the reader little insight of a seriously flawed woman or an erotic reading.I was suckered by a review in the newspaper.I have read better prose composed by high school students.

It's chock full of great stuff. Nothing scary, just good time music for children and those still young enough at heart to enjoy Halloween. There is a great remake of 'Purple Peter Eater'. Also there is a great song on here called the 'Wolfman Watusi'. It's performed by the same fellow who did the original 'Monster Mash'.

I tried twice to watch it and ended up shutting it off not even half way through. Not surprisingly Full Moon Pictures didnt produce this one.

However, even with an aluminum case, the unit allowed too much heat to build up around the hard drive, which after a year or so caused both to fail. I did not realize it, but hard drives generate A LOT OF HEAT, and excessive heat is death on electronic componets. With this unit, I normally leave it unplugged and only plug it in when I want to do a backup. Functioning this way, it works fine. I just have to remember to do backups; I can't schedule them through the backup software.It is very easy to set up and install and is very well-made.

I was captivated by the beauty of the land's description, and the language of the people. This story unmasked the secrets in religious customs and the households of ordinary people. The way Adichie weaves the abusive angle of the father into the tale was genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Book","review":"This is a terrific book across the board. Well written, never self indulgent, to the point, poignant and incredible up to date. It has is it all. It tells the story of a rich family in a country that is being torn apart by civil war. It never brings politics to the foreground, but everything revolves around it. The family is the revered by most in their community but they hold a tragic secret and somehow they have to find a way to live with the consequences of it. A must read for searious readers who love reading something a little more intense than a regular Grisham novel (which are fine as well mind you, but this one is so powerful you won't be able to put it down)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm in love!","review":"I was a little apprehensive about reading this book. After a few pages, I immediately identified with the character and fell in love with her innocence and ready to please behaviour. I felt a little nostalgic with her description of the towns and the people, especially the women. Having visited Enugu and Nsukka lots of times. It is a great book, the words just jump out and hug you, ezioku."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first book","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed my first read by this author. The characters were real, even though I couldn't understand why they put up with the father, but I put that on seeing things from another perspective. But the characters were well developed to me and the story evoked emotion. I thought this was an engaging first book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bookclub selection","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. My bookclub, Reading Roses, read this as our June selectin and everyone really enjoyed it. I think this book brought out the most discussion we have had in a while. It was quite interesting to read about life in another country; well written; characters were well developed. Good choice for a bookclub."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary dark tale...","review":"I had every intention of wanting to love this book but will alone wouldn't suffice. It is dreary, seemingly long for it's relative size. Until the very end Kambali and her mother come across as weak and needy women enduring endless beatings while continuing to have a twisted reverence for their husband/father. The story has a depressing flatline rhythm. One that would be better to get from the library or wait for paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy read, a very \\"visual\\" novel, could have gone deeper","review":"As a debut, this novel is noteworthy, and the author paints a highly visual picture of the Africa she knows. To me, the disappointment with the novel was the author's inability to go deeper. It stayed very \\"surface level\\" with me, reads almost like a \\"young adult\\" novel. Also deals with the subject of physical abuse, so those who are unable to handle such content should avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"purple and red hibiscii","review":"I usually read fantasy, science fiction, and young adult novels, not famous literary works or 'modern adult fiction' (which has got to be the most boring thing anyone could ever imagine). I heard about this being famous, so I looked at the first chapter in a bookstore and knew I would love it and could buy it. The prose has the best qualities of the best fantasy and YA novels. It's lyrical and clear and makes everything you look at feel new and interesting and different, like the way you feel after you come out of a theatre after seeing a really really good movie. The writing doesn't intrusively interpret or explain things for you. The dialogue makes every character feel like a real person, three dimensional and distinctive. If you like reading Diana Wynne Jones, Sandra Cisneros, Gregory Maguire, or Nina Kiriki Hoffman, you will like this novel. I read it in 2 days during breaks at work and on the bus and staying up several hours later than I should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ppurple Hibiscus","review":"Great book....I really enjoyed reading it. I will look for more books by this author and recommend it to others...Also sold at a great price with timely delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I bought this book because (if I recall correctly) it was long-listed for last years ManBooker Prize and also, (this I recall) because it had good reviews here on Amazon. Anyway, I was real disappointed. I quit paying attention after page 100 and quit outright a few pages later. I found the contrasting aspects of the Father's character interesting but after awhile so contrasting they felt way off reality. Character of aunt, cousin, priest, mom etc etc also grew gratingly \\"perfect.\\" This may be excessive, but after a while I felt like I was reading a bit of sophisticated version of a teen romance novel. The comparisons with God of Small Things are seriously unflattering to Roy's great book. Comparisons with (the overrated) Memoirs of a Geisha or (also not finished) One Thousand Chestnut Trees would have been more appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Igbo Man with Power.","review":"This book was a bit of a disappointment storywise. It was very slow to get going. What was up with the father? Did he have a psychological disease? Why did he have such little empathy for his family? Was it supposed to be because he was so stressed out by the evil government that he had to take it out on the powerless people who loved him? The father was a monster who was equally as bad as the vile government. Does he represent a typical Igbo man with power? The angelic priest was not an Igbo, was he? The ending was bad. Did the son or the mother do it? Either one doing it makes them equally as bad as the father. The author couldnt make up her mind. The son must have done it, cause the premise of the book is that Igbo men with power are evil. Nice that the evil government allows the 3 of them to inherit all of Bad Daddy's money to squander as they wish and live happily ever after without Bad Daddy around."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre","review":"it's surprising that so many people gave this book a favorable rating - did we read the same book? i found \\"purple hibiscus\\" a little to simplistic and childish for any accolades - there was no particular insight on any of the issues e.g. physical abuse, first love, teenage angst/rebellion - to speak of, and the political ranting towards the end is laughable. apparently, everyone that can write a few words is now styling themselves as political activists, i wonder where ms. adichie was during those tumultous times - enjoying the breeze well away from the conflict in london - and now she's spewing out all the stuff she probably heard from her parents. i doubt that any self-respecting nigerian - unless you're the type that thinks \\"mills and boons\\" are literary masterpieces - will find anything remarkable about this book. as for people who don't know anything about nigeria, or africa, i suggest you read chinua achebe, buchi emecheta, or wole soyinka (for the cerebral) to get a real flavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I appreciated Adichie's exploration into the everyday of a traditional Nigerian family; it is easy to form a picture in one's mind. However, I expected more. I came away thinking and feeling \\"is this it?\\". The book seemed to lack a certain substance.Anyhow, I am proud of her accomplishments and have her other book \\"Half of a Yellow Sun\\" waiting to be read. I hope it is better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from the Algonquin stable","review":"If you're not sure which new book to pick, choose one published by Algonquin Press. They seem to select the most consistent string of quiet winners.Purple Hibiscus is an amazing debut novel about Kambili, a 15yo Nigerian girl who is the keeper of ugly secrets from within her privileged family, a family dominated and abused by her religious fanatic father. She is offered escape when she visits her Aunty Ifeoma, a university lecturer who is supporting her children on her small salary. A tragic conclusion slowly builds as old secrets and new tensions rise to the surface. As Kambili blossoms toward maturity, she questions values she once held as inscribed in stone. Her own turmoil is mirrored in that of her country. A startlingly good coming-of-age novel, disconcerting and thought-provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book!","review":"I picked this book for our book club and it was a big hit! Over half of the club members gave it a 10. Beautifully written and a very touching story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purple Hibiscus","review":"Terrific story about a place I knew nothing about previously. Her books are page-turners with magnificent explanations of people's feelings and the country itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should have made Booker's short list","review":"I know I'm being unfair when I say it should have made the short list since I have not had the opportunity to read many that did so -- they are not available in the US. I chose this book since it had made the long list and was one of the few available here from that list. As revealed in other reviews, this is a classic story of abuse and denial, told time and time again, but has the ring of actuality about it. The fact that the background is Nigeria and not a more familiar locale makes it even more compelling. The revelation that this kind of abuse is prevalent in that corner of the world makes it all the more horrifying, plus the fact that part of the father's abuse is to deny his children access to his traditionalist father and heritage. As another reviewer has remarked, I look forward to a sequel because these characters are so vivid, I want to know what happened to them once the book was finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Voice","review":"Well written novel. Believable. Will make teenagers grateful for their own, flawed but human parents. Great contrasts between different families and ways of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"a child's life played out against Nigeria's larger struggles","review":"Kambili is fifteen. She lives with her mother, and brother in the house completely controlled by her over-bearing Christian father whose ideas of \\"keeping the faith\\" include numerous forms of torture. The story of her life is played out against the larger struggles of one of Nigeria's many coups.The story is well-written, and does a fine job of exploring Nigerian custom, life in the big and small cities in Nigeria, and the differences between religious fanatics - Catholic and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"True emotional genius...","review":"I just finished re-reading this masterpiece. And the second time was better than the first. When I describe this book to others, I find myself able to recall the colors, sounds, and feelings that Adichie provokes with her vivid descriptions of human emotion. Absolutely amazing. There are times when you get totally connected with the main character and as the reader, you're able to appreciate the narrator's vivid and articulate descriptions of her inability to express herself verbally in her interactions with others. This is a paradox that I don't think many writers could really pull off. However, Ms. Adichie nails it! She grabs your emotions and takes you on a ride for which preparation is impossible. For me, that is the sign of a promising writer with a bright future. I definitely recommend this one and look forward to reading more by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revenge, Revenge","review":"Nothing deadlier than a woman scorned - watching enough of these movies will have any man thinking twice about some 1 night stands, lol!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good!","review":"Stinks!

I knew it was special even then- no other orchestral performance sounded quite like this. A magnificent, passionate and blazing performance. I hoped for years for the release of this CD. We are fortunate indeed, to live in an era when digital audio transfer has reached this level of excellence. The 1956 recording is different from the latest releases, to be sure, but no one need doubt that it sounds wonderful. The orchestral detail is thrilling. The New World coupling is very nearly as good making this an irresistible bargain. There will be those with their own favorite Dvorak symphony CDs, but this one is my top recommendation, hands down. The cream of the \\"historic\\" reissues continues to rise. Skim this one off the top!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"There is an interesting story behind the 9th Symphony, besides the well-known one that Dvorak supposedly gathered the material for this work while he was temporarily in the U.S. directing the Curtiss Insitute. This great symphony is a classic example of a work that almost comes to ruination because of the over-inventiveness and ingenuity of the composer. The work almost completely loses integration and explodes, but not quite. Funny thing was, Dvorak won a composing competition when he was still very young. The committee noted that he was extremely talented, but one of the members, I think it was Brahms himself, said Dvorak would need to learn to control and discipline his talent. Then Dvorak writes this symphony many years later as a mature composer and again it almost gets away from him--sort of interesting given Brahms' earlier comment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reference Book on Luke","review":"Luke Timothy Johnson is an outstanding Catholic biblical scholar with an acknowledged expertise on the writings of Luke.

Inexcusable, from a saw in this class."},{"rating":"2","title":"smooth and quiet","review":"When i recieved this saw the box was in very poor shape. Part of the saw was prodtruding and two sides were split from top to bottom. The saw had shifted position clockwise 45 deg. in the box and I was concerned. I set the saw on my stablmate stand fully prepared to spend the next couple hours tuning it up. Was I surprised to make my first test cut and find it right on. I put it through the shakedown and didn't have to make a single adjustment. Nothing I expect to put this machine though can possibly compare to it's trip here. The blade is as good as my Forrest and I was amazed at how quiet it was. I have used a number of miter saws and have to say using this one has spoiled me. The light is probably not of much use unless you are working in unsafe conditions anyway. The laser is a plus.

I was however extremely disappointed. This book presented numerous problems and oversights of video games in general. Although there are many areas covered, none of them are covered in any serious depth or scholarly attention. Too often, Berger makes personal comments (typically negative) without backing them up. When comparing books to video games and other narrative forms, he really splits hairs in trying to bring out differences. His compartmentalization on the subject is extremely artificial and disturbing. The typos and spelling errors are enough to keep a reader frustrated. Even if you are not a scholar of video games, I would not recommend this book. There are numerous other books out there that are better written and look at video games on a much more even level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Sorely Lacking","review":"The back of this book says that it begins with the tracing of the evolution of video games. However, any book that includes a history of games and doesn't include the names Baer, Bushnell, and Atari, is sorely lacking. Also, it would have been nice had Berger read the two definitive books on video games; Leonard Herman's Phoenix: The Fall & Rise of Videogames and Steven Kent's Ultimate History of Video Games. Instead, his source was J.C. Herz's Joystick Nation, a book that has been poorly received by the video gaming community."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clic Reading Glasses","review":"I bought these glasses for my husband who is forever putting his glasses down and walking off and forgetting where he put them.

While I don't have a monster sized head, I would consider my head size normal for a larger man. The problem with these is that they're so narrow that they crush my temples - instant headache potential. Even with them fully adjusted for length, they're still way too small.

I've tried using the chains before but they hang down low and get in the way of other things. These are very handy and I sometimes forget I'm wearing them. My only criticisms are (1) the magnet isn't super strong and there are times when they come apart. I hugged a friend while wearing them and it happened and scared him because he thought he caused them to break. (2) I don't like to wear them in bed. When I'm leaning back against the pillow the back part of them pushes the glasses away from my face, so I always wear regular glasses now for reading in bed.

I think it'll be helpful to remember WHEN everything happened, etc. on a week by week basis.The \\"What to Expect\\" books I could have done without, really ALL the books... the same info is available online (and emailed to me weekly)... but this book has been invaluable.

I bought this book looking for a solution to the small kitchen I have: one element & one sink, no JOKE!

And Valenti and Friedman's book, so titled,provides ample inspiration. The recipes are clearly written, easily made and eagerly eaten. The White Bean Casserole with Preserved Duck proved to be a cassoulet taste-alike and taste delight, assembled in minutes. So, too, the Mediterranean Fish Stew, a variation on the Manhattan-Style Fish Stew,trumps the more time-consuming bouillabaisse.Some cookbooks are really just the recipes, which after all are their raison d'etre. This book, however, is also a great read. I particularly enjoy the chatty bits at the beginning of each recipe and the variations at the end.

On page 110, the recipe for lentil and garlic-sausage stew calls for two tablespoons of salt. I assumed that was a typo, but even with two teaspoons of salt, the dish was inedible. I can only assume that M. Valenti expects you to use the very same sausage he uses; he makes no allowances for variations.The recipes also call for an annoying number of exotic ingredents, and offers no suggestions for substitutions. Porcini mushrooms, penette pasta, imported Italian tuna, arborio rice, smoked duck. This exotica might make the restaurant dishes spectacular, but for the home cook, they serve only to render the recipes expensive and unforgiving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy gourmet","review":"Fantastic receipes!!

Because It's Written...","review":"Disappointing as to what I was expecting. The puzzling thing about this book, is that while it fairly well gushes about the band in the text; when it comes to capsule album reviews following description of the recording process for each album, this is where the criticism can become quite pointed. It's almost as if the author didn't want to offend the friends and co-workers of the band (it's obvious that Lee, Lifeson, & Peart didn't talk to Collins themselves), but then somewhat stuck the knife in when it came to reviewing the albums.I was expecting (& hoping) for a better overview of how the band and its members have evolved through the years. This is dealt with in only a superficial manner. The reader does not get a sense of the band and its times. Nor do we get a real feel for what Lee, Lifeson, and Peart are actually like as people.There is a definitive Rush biography to be written. Unfortunately, this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"This is a wonderful Lovejoy story!

There are a lot of characters in this little book, and unless you've been faithfully reading like I have, you might get confused. I suggest that you read these stories in order. It helps when you're trying to decipher characters, and anyway, they are just so good.

For starters the blade had so much play up and down when its open i can wiggle the knife and hear and see it move. Also the lock is located twards the middle of the handle and when i grip the knife it presses down. I personaly would not trust the knife under any moderate to hard cutting.

I hemmed and hawed between the plain-edge Delica 4 and the Benchmade Minigriptilian. After going to a knife store and holding them in my hands, I felt more confident in the Syderco because of the handle ergonomics, the jimping over the thumb hole and the raised portion over the hole for strong and secure thumb grip. When it came I was amazed at the sharpness and still very happy with how it felt in my hand. However, I still had a curiousity about the Benchmade, so I purchased it with the combo edge. When I got it in, I was disappointed in how it felt in my hand. The jimping was slick and no grip..no handle ergonomics. I know that others like the Benchmade over the Delica.

And you like Jason Lee.But... this sounds like it could be a really dumb, banal comedy. And the reviews aren't so hot. So should you bother with it?That's what I was mulling over before I finally bit the bullet and rented it. And I'm glad I did.First and foremost, Glover and Lee are fantastic. They carry the movie. They're in top form here, and they create two wonderful bozo characters.There is some very funny material, and some great, even classic, lines. I laughed out loud several times. And the story zips right along, doesn't get tedious or slow.Having said that, it's a pretty conventional, routine storyline, despite many detours into inspired craziness. And some of it is kinda dumb or obvious.This isn't risky or edgy material. But it is fun, funny viewing, with outstanding weirdo performances by Glover and Lee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drop this movie","review":"Jason Lee and Crispin Glover play two small-time crooks in a small-time Texas town (that looks remarkably like Austin). They dig up a dead woman to steal her necklace and end up \\"kidnapping\\" her and holding her for ransom from her husband. Supposedly, hilarity ensues, but I must have missed that part.Crispin Glover creates a very believable, original, and funny small-town hick, but it feels like Jason Lee isn't even trying, and the movie definitely suffers from that.There's a good amount of gratuitous nudity in several scenes that take place in the local strip club (The Mean-Eyed Pussy Cat) and even in the morgue. If you're looking for nudity go for this movie. If you're looking for anything else, don't bother.Overall this movie moves along slowly and without too many laughs. I checked it out because it was filmed in Austin and I was interested, but it's really not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only liked the SUPER HOT GIRLS!","review":"The story isn't very interesting and just about the worse movie I have ever seen. I like Jason Lee from other shows and movies, but this one he was just average. I don't like Crispin Glover character and I think he was weird. All I liked about this movie were the HOT girls. But even that didn't save this movie from a 1 star review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crispin Glover is Perfect","review":"I bought this movie to add to my Crispin Glover movie collection. I thought that it had a few good laughs in it and very likable main characters. Both Crispin Glover and Jason Lee were great-but Crispin carried it for sure. It was a little dark but not over the top. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting and kinda cute movie night movie. Four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too small","review":"We have a 6 pound Yorkie and this was way too small for him!!!

Even at her current weight, she did not fit in the seat. Also, I was concerned that it would not fit in my car - but it did. I have a 2012 Nissan Rogue, if that helps anyone. The space between the seats in the Rouge apparently is much narrower than most vehicles, I discovered, while trying to take measurements and see if this would fit.

Freeup front passenger seat","review":"This was my first car seat and I got my money's worth out of it. We travel 7hrs every 3 months and I bought this for my cockapoo puppy. He used it comfortably until he was 14lbs. He is now 2.5 yrs. old and 20lbs eventhough outgrown the seat for sleeping comfortably he continued to ride in the booster but he needed the extra space to stretch and laydown so we recently upgraded. Sadly, it is a booster seat rather than a console. The console benefit is he sat closer to me and would lay his head on my shoulder while I drove. He could sleep and sit it in for the longest times and was comfortable without complaints. Worth the money and a space saver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase!","review":"I'm so glad I got this car seat. My 3lb Morkie puppy loves it. He can lay down and stretch out completely in it now, so he still has some room to grow. He stays so calm in the car and I can relax because I know he's safe. We travel 2 hours to and from our camp every weekend and he just sleeps most of the trip. He loves being close to us and being high enough to see outside. I love that it doesn't take up a \\"person seat\\" like most other pet car seats, so we can still have two people in the back comfortably. The seat is well made, easy to install, although a little bit of a pain to take out if you need to use a different vehicle. I would suggest getting two if you alternate vehicles often.

It is well-packaged, Targus have a section on their website that let you check if the tips will work for your equipment, and the supplied tips included ones that were correct for ours. The cords and connectors leave little doubt how to get the thing working. Except, it took me a minute to be sure there was an Empower connector (for some airplanes), but once I hunted I found it under the cigarette lighter connector. It all comes with a carrying bag.Two oddities. One is that the power supply unit has a very bright blue light shining when it is working. I don't mind this. The other is that, after unhooking the tip from my equipment, the power supply shuts off and I can't work out how to turn it back on again. It does come on if I unplug it from the wall and then replug it.

It worked OK last few weeks, but has now succumbed to loose contact between the special socket in the block and the cable running to the computer. That special socket seems a very very poor design, because something apparently went wrong with the pin alignment, and, although all the pins are still going into their respective holes, the connector started requiring lots of jiggling back and forth for the current to flow properly. The problem is compounded by the self shut-off within the block, under certain conditions. So, you have to jiggle fast enough before it dies, which became increasingly tricky, and now it's dying immediately upon proper contact. The whole thing, in totem, is a poor design -- the flimsy contact pins plus the self shut-off.

This is also the first book ever to cover the artwork of Blaxploitation films. The contents are amazing and you'll be shocked (as I was) by how many films of this films there were. There are 200 posters in this book alone and there are even more not covered here. This book is also great for Graphic Designers in any field. It is designed beautifully and the poster art (from the collections of Ron Finly, Mathieu Bitton and Quentin Tarantino, who published the book) is great inspiration. You'll also read great stories about the films from interviews with Pam \\"Coffy\\" Grier, Fred \\"The Hammer\\" Williamson, Melvin \\"Sweetback\\" Van Peebles, William \\"Blacula\\" Marshall, Samuel L. Jackson and many more. Basically, this is the best book I've seen this year and the best I've ever seen on the genre. For the price, you can't not get it!

All in all, this game just doesn't look, feel, or play like basketball. Try NBA Live 2002 where the dunks are amazing and each player looks so much like his NBA counterpart. Inside Drive, my friends, can't be called basketball, it's not even worthy of being called a game. I can't believe i bought this one. OUCH. [NICE] GAME.

In between the intrigue and adventure, men you can learn how to please a lady. The story around a ghost town that is finally made alive inspite of villians, and the various underlying subplots and relationships makes this Garlock book sore.

I didn't see this when I was younger there is no nostalgia for me but it just seems like a better film overall. It's still a older campy ninja movie full of cheese but the character endures some serious hardship and by the end you really feel he was vindicated. You really do feel like you can relate to the character and that he is a ninja in modern day (well 80's at least).

It actually cut to a lower resolution during the \\"deleted\\" scene where his wife was murdered in the hospital, and that seemed really weird.Overall, it's a must if you're a Sho Kosugi fan.

Granted the films quite dated as it came out in 1985 but if plot holes were all the rage \\"Pray for Death\\" would be an Emmy winner. While the hilarious James Booth plays one mean SOB, the rest of the gangsters are just as amusing & campy. In fact, the entire acting in this film is so one dimensional its absolutely perfect viewing ala \\"Mystery Science Theater 3000\\". As for Sho Kosugi's lukewarm choreographed fight scenes followed by the bad Pat Benatar theme song, this really is as bad as it gets.

Earle writes in a functional, graphic style that evades cliches. His style reaches its peak when sentences are cast like lines of a poem to convey the bludgeoning delirium of Manse's mind. His dialogue is particularly effective, varying from the guardedly genteel to the foully forthright. It is dialogue that scorches and furrows the memory --- P.

Great stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New Here","review":"Taken from the premise that this book will likely just be picked up by fans who already know much of the Floyd story, I'm puzzled about what the author was trying to achieve. There's no real revelations here, nothing that hasn't been said or published before. In fact, looking at the sources he draws from, it's primarily a collection of previously published works and even a few DVD's! My - what strenuous research Mr. Harris must have done.Unless you're completely new to the material, this book will do very little to help further your knowledge of the subject. It appears the author just cobbled together a bunch of already known facts and anicdotes in an attempt to make a few bucks off a great creative work that has stood the test of time.

When I got it home I looked at the reviews for it and saw it was only rated 2 stars and found out the review was wright.The only good movie on here is shaolin vs. manchu the others aren't even worth buying or watching It was like watching soap operas from another country. The biggest thing about this is that the dvd cover basically misleads into thinking wow this must be action packed and It's not It's like watching kids play with plastic swords and throwing red paint on themselves when one of them wins. The first movie Hero's blood didn't have one hero throughout it I could of been the hero because nobody in the movie could fight. The picture was very poor It might as well have been on VHS you wouldn't be able to tell the difference.In a way giving this 2 stars is being nice but shaolin vs. manchu gets the 2nd star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half-baked","review":"I lost track of how many times this low-budget indie used the same downtown LA scene-setter, with its view of the tallest building. It's a down-at-the-heels coming of age tale that focuses on a young girl who runs away because daddy abused her. She meets and falls for an illegal alien, and they live in an urban loft, of sorts, though how they pay for it, plus cell phones and food and beer, is left a bit hazy. The centerpiece is an attack by daddy who comes back to get his daughter, only to be driven off. There's no plot here, just a character study of homeless life in urban LA. It's forgettable, but okay as you watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Quality but small","review":"It has a good quality, nice looking but too small, I expected to have more compartments to care the charger and extra battery.

The Beast was, and still is, one of the best television series to hit the screen and I am SO disappointed they cancelled it. Excellent from Episode 1 to Episode 13, The Beast is suspenseful and action packed...very intense! I would like to commend Travis Fimmel for his excellent portrayal of Ellis Dove....the little-bit quirky, but loyal to the end, side-kick of Charles Barker...great acting, I hope they put him in another series SOON!!The only complaint I have of this DVD collection is WHY IN THE WORLD DIDN'T THEY INCLUDE ENGLISH SUBTITLES...it would ahve helped me tremendously!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beast - Season One - DVD purchased at Amazon","review":"I have been an unconditional Swayze fan ever since I saw his performance in City of Joy and North and South -- LAST YEAR!

It seems to make fun of the opera more than to perform it. The famous opening of Act 3 is set in a girls' dormitory and involves a pillow fight.

It embodies the true emotion and the joy of running - while still showing a team that just did the race to say they did, although they were so not prepared it was comical to them and the audience. A wonderfully done movie and I believe runner and non-runners alike could take something away from watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie makes running even more fun!","review":"This film is very well-made and reaches people from all \\"runs\\" of life: wannabe runners, once-was-a-runners, older runners, younger runners--I'm pretty sure even non-runners would enjoy this movie (but I can't speak for myself). It's very inspirational and just plain entertaining. If you like running at all, this movie is great! Even if you don't, it's still great (and maybe it's about time you become a runner! This movie will help you with that too...). Has great extras and good music as well. Whether you just want a weekend watch or something to inspire you in your running, this movie fits the bill!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs More Racing and Less Human Interest Cliches","review":"This DVD doesn't have much about the actual race, so if you're looking for top teams, race strategies, team logistics and tactics, or nutrition schedules, you can forget it. This film is mostly about four very different teams, only one of which seems to be competitive. Of the other three teams, two are featured to tug at your heart strings, which is becoming such a cliche in the first place and was seriously overdone in this film. The final team is a bunch of Gen Xer's who are doing this more on a lark and less on real training. Buy this DVD if you like the human interest stuff. Otherwise, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"All bluster! Occasionally witty but often sloppy","review":"The only way to get away with being a smart aleck is to be really smart, and Mark Steyn comes across all too often as a big dummy. His casual name dropping is pretentious at best, and all too many of the quotes he claims to have heard firsthand were previously published elsewhere. As to his theories, he relies on data that is far too selective to support many of his ideas. In seeking to entertain or even titillate, he winds up sounding boorish. While I don't think much of RENT, I do not agree with much of what he says against it. His word games and puns are amusing, but they wear thin after the first few chapters -- my advice to him is to heeds the Bard: \\"more matter with less art.\\" My advice to you is to spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crock!","review":"What an incredibly disappointing book this turned out to be. Is Mark Steyn's brain completely ossified? Does he think that the only good musicals are those that are \\"fun\\"? Get real, Mark, a lot has happened since Curley rode on into that cornfield. In case you haven't heard, the musical can actually comment melodically on the lives of real people AND be good entertainment. I heard that Steyn knew what he was talking about, but after partaking of this bowl of tripe, I will take the comments of the person who told me that with a very large grain of salt. The final straw, of course, is his viciously homophobic chapter called \\"The Fags.\\" One would expect this from a company like Regnery, but not from Routledge. What is happening over there? And finally, a question for the father from Manhattan who whistles tunes from Oklahoma (a show I like by the way) on the way to school with his little boy: Are you for real???????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes Witty, Often Wrong","review":"Mark Steyn in Broadway Babies Say Goodnight (Musicals Then and Now) has accomplished an unique objective. He has written a book that is meant to appeal to people whose veiws are strictly politically conservative, love musicals (particulary fond memories of older musicals that they are in fact too young to have even seen) and do not know any actual facts about the history of the genre so the author's glaring mistakes will not prove an annoyance. Even stranger is that he has found these people and, God bless them, they have the book they have always dreamed about. For anyone else, this can be a bit of a slog. It is funny (espcially if you like puns) in places but the arguments are so often backed up with mistakes as to be worthless. This book is not truly bad. It is just simply odd. If you like Mark Steyn (this book is more about him anyway) then enjoy. Othewise, it is worth a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"More opinionated than informative","review":"Steyn isn't all that great a writer to begin with. But once you get past his clumsy prose, you find that he's more blustery than insightful. His view that the Broadway musical has died is particularly funny in a time when we're seeing brilliant new musicals like \\"Ragtime,\\" \\"A New Brain,\\" \\"Floyd Collins,\\" and \\"Parade,\\" when incredible new writers are just becoming visible, and when writers like Sondheim, Kander & Ebb, and others are at the top of their game. Steyn is nothing more than a cranky, old guy who hates that musical theatre has gone to new places and created new rules that he doesn't understand. He longs for the old days, but who in his right mind would ever ask an art form to go backward?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What good there is undermined by bigotry","review":"Though Mr. Steyn does have strong opinions and some good observations, his judgements are tainted by an anti-gay bias (he titles one chapter \\"The Fags\\", and it's not meant affectionately). His readings of stories such as the reaction of Lorenz Hart upon hearing \\"Oklahoma\\" in a blackout could have been better informed by further research, and he repeats Lerner's silly comment about Lorenz Hart being to short to be heterosexual so he had to turn to men. The book is also dated in many respects including the waning influence of British Operettas and the public's acceptance of Stephen Sondheim. Rather than this book I would reccommend anything by Ethan Mordden or Martin Gottfried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate, nasty and mistakes snide comments for wit","review":"In addition, it is extremely homophobic and reflects a very sour spirited authorial voice"},{"rating":"2","title":"good value, good movies","review":"Four movies for ten bucks is a great deal.

This item has a few serious design flaws. First, the wire spools out from both ends. As you pull the headphone jack end out, the video out wires unwind as well and easily tangle. It doesn't matter which end you pull out first.Second, the wire isn't rooted in the center and the retraction mechanism is pretty random. So, attempting to retract the cord you'll often end up with a long length of cord on one end or the other that hasn't retracted. It took me several tries to get it to retract evenly.Finally, the video connection cables are VERY thin. Maybe this is necessary to fit in a compact package, but they're so thin you worry they'll break when you pull them.I've attempted Boxwave to return this merchandise.

By a miracle, this second hit man was actually an undercover sheriff's deputy and Patricia is serving three years.Patricia planned my murder in the family home with the children present and as potential victimsI sought this book in my search for answers and I found some. This is an importnat topic and an excellent breakthrough popular work on the subject.In an area so galvanized by gender, I found Dr. Ludwig's work free of gender bias. The victims, male or female, are victims enganged in complicated relationships with their killers. These are crimes of passion and crimes planned. This is an excellent start for examining this issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart and thought provoking","review":"All you can ask of a book is that it keeps your interest and when you're finished it lingers with you. Till Death Do Us Part does both, and then some. Dr. Ludwig gives us the Reader's Digest versions of the tragic and violent cases she uses to explain her ten motivations, which are well thought out and presented in an understandable way. They are fascinating and needless to say I now look at my spouse in a whole different light. Ludwig adds credibility by co-authoring with Matt Birkbeck, an investigative journalist who wrote very good books on millionaire killer Robert Durst and Sharon Marshall. Both were well researched. The Sharon Marshall book, called A Beautiful Child, I still cry over.Ludwig/Birkbeck present an equally credible book that can be used as a foundation to analyze your own relationship. Highly recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wannabe","review":"Probably the only person who was thrilled that the Minister was killed by his wife was Ludwig, as it coincided with the release of this book. This of course led to more TV time to promote it. That sales are stil dismal, despite that good luck, tells you just how awful this book is. Ludwig is a wannabe expert with pulled from the sky theories and makes no effort to explain how she reached them.

And Laci told Scott to grow up, and he wouldn't, and that's why he killed? Peterson who just as much a liar as Hack, if not more.HUH???It just seems like a lot of made up stuff. With 0 merit. And the woman who killed her preacher husband was probably Post partum , and she was without a mother figure.She may be a shrink, but she should really spend more time learning about \\"true crime\\"Geez.

I didn't realize what a good writer Ann Rule is until I read THIS book! Robi Ludwig should stick to looking cute on TV while giving her fluffy opinion of what makes the criminal mind work. That works better for her than actually putting those opinions down on paper. Even a ghost writer couldn't make her sound educated or literate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theres better out there","review":"If youd like a really good book on this subject read Gail SaltzMD new book \\"Anatomy Of A Secret Life; The Psychology of Living A Lie\\".

I found it fascinating and I haven't stopped thinking about it since Ifinished it.Ludwig should get a better editor and re-issue the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"First of all I cant help thinking whenever I hear Ludwig on TV that she logged off the internet 5 mins before airtime and is now telling us her newly learned theories. I get the same feeling from reading this book. Alot of her writing seems like guesswork and speculation and I have to wonder how many spousal murderers she has actually spoken with. High powered friends King and Grace add somre name recognition to help sell some copies. It would be interesting to see what someone more qualified, like a psychiatrist, would write on this subject instead of a cable TV hack like Ludwig."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHE DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE","review":"This book is an example of how desperate publishers can be if they think they can make a sale. I am friends with Betty Broderick, a subject of the book, and I know a lot about her personality and her history. To claim that Betty was \\"stalking\\" her former husband is a clear indication that Ludwig doesn't have a CLUE what she's talking about -- she never met Betty or interviewed her, even long-distance! Don't waste your money on this piece of trash (or the book, either). Some people in prison were the victims of AWFUL circumstances, and to minimize the suffering that lead to their incarceration only adds to the suffering. Shame on everyone connected with this waste of otherwise good paper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat interesting, but many factual errors.","review":"I thought this would be an interesting and insightful book. Instead, I found a group of very familiar cases wrapped up in junk psychology. The author claims a PhD, but I'm not sure what in. Certainly not forensic psychology. Too many of her conclusions and explanations are based on outdated and discredited assumptions (e.g., homosexuality is rooted in strong mothers and weak fathers--increasingly eclipsed by genetic information), rather than solid research. The average person on the street could produce the same quality in a book.

It does not make me convinced that the camera is securely supported or that it holds the camera with any precision (optically speaking) to the scope.One other problem, at shutter speeds of 1/4000 or faster and using the live-view mode of the 40D, there is an under-exposed strip on the bottom of each exposure. Because I haven't tried the Canon T-ring I can't say whether this flaw is unique to the Celestron but I would recommend spending a few more bucks for the Canon T-ring for the better fit I would assume it has."},{"rating":"2","title":"S'wonderful","review":"One of my all-time favorite action.adventures from the Deerslayer/Leatherstocking series.

I was unable to get traction for my feet and felt as though they would slip up when in many of the commonly practiced poses in yoga. (downward facing dog, even poses like triangle and extended side angle). I really tried giving this towel a chance but ended up purchasing a harmony yoga mat (those rubber mats) which greatly reduced my slippery yoga experiences.I would not recommend the skidless towel for your entire mat, maybe you may have better luck with just the hand towel.I realized with yoga mats that every person is different, so what doesn't work for me, may work for you.

This cd is one that I have partially enjoyed. What I mean by this is, this cd has a good sound from a vocal stand point, but left a lot to be desired else where. For one, the repertoire was not even par. There were some songs that I knew and really enjoyed, but there was not enough good songs.

The lens does suffer creep when pointed down. It is much less heavy than the Sigma 50-500 lens. Focus is faster as well.It is a little soft at f5.6 at 400mm but punch down to 6.3 or more and it gets sharp.I am giving it 5 stars because nothing really competes with this lens at price or peformance.Pros:Light weight, fairly sharp, CheapCons:Lens Creep"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't available","review":"I wanted it.

I quickly got through the few pages of study material and was surprised to find that the questions on the practice exams didn't cover what was presented earlier. Funnier yet, I recently took the formal exam and it was even further afield of the prep exams, having what seemed like 5% of the questions based on web-centric marketing and technical questions like differences between intranets and extranets.

The only study material I used was this book. I studied it for a week, and took all the practice exams and reviewed the anwswers with the explinations in the back. There where a few questions on internet marketing on the test, but most of it was common sense. One question on the test was this \\"How do marketing companies rate the success of banner ads on websites\\" and out of the five answers they provided one was the most obvious \\"click-throughput\\" the rest where just stupid responses like \\"the banners size and color\\". Using a text book for this CLEP is over kill, and it might hinder your success, because this book sticks to the facts and the must know material.

Good luck :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is all you need for this CLEP Exam","review":"This book is great for passing the CLEP.

However, I found that less than 40% of the material covered in this text is present in the current CLEP exam.

For starters, it's the only stand I could find online after a week of searching, that had positive reviews, and was within a reasonable price range. The stand seems very well built, however the fastening screws that are meant to secure the piano to the stand, are not long enough for the Yamaha YPT-210 (They do not reach the recessed threading on the underside of the piano). The reason I did not score this is a perfect 5/5, is due to the stand's weight and obtrusiveness. I stub my feet into it quite frequently (yes, I'm a clutz, and that shouldn't detract from the score much) and the stand weighs 13 lbs, making it a little bit more difficult to transport than I'd like. So hopefully this review is helpful to anyone looking - I had one hell of a time finding an alternative. Although not perfect, this is the best stand for the value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story, but not as satisfying as \\"Running with the Demon","review":"John Ross has renounced his pledge as a Knight of the Word after he failed to save the lives of schoolchildren in a tragedy.

Overall, a decent followup, but not a thriller like \\"Running.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Mild, but yet stunning!","review":"Eventhough it starts out really slow.

Phenomenal fantasy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not equal to Running . . .","review":"The is the first time that I've seen Brooks stumble. The plot isn't very believable or strong and the whole theme doesn't capture you like Running did. The whole five-year jump is annoying since you want to know what happened during those years.

But...What a disappointment.The plot was totally predictable so kiss suspense goodbye. And the demons in this book are pussycats.

Brooks slows down the pace considerably here and the characters do much more navel gazing. Perhaps the contrast in settings affects the story; while \\"Running with the Demon\\" was set in a small town, \\"A Knight of the Word\\" is set in the city. I did enjoy the chase scene between a demon and one of the characters . . . pretty intense.If you liked \\"Running with the Demon\\" you'll like \\"A Knight of the Word\\" but just expect something different. Sometimes change is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Running with the Demon","review":"I agree with most reviewers that this is not nearly as good as Running with the Demon, but I'm still giving it 4 stars because it was really fun to read! Yeah, the story is a bit soap opera-ish and predictable (I knew right away who the demon was, why the Shelter was set on fire, etc.) Probably what made this book very worthwhile is, once again, the presence of Nest. She is just the coolest character I've ever read in a novel! And, poor John Ross, can't he ever get a break?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a younger reader","review":"I picked up this book for 2 aussie dollars ready for my flight back to the uk, and as far as time killers go i cant fault it. In fairness i would say its aimed more at 13-16 year old readers and the language reflects that, but it doesnt detract from the fact that the story is told well, and maintains a good level of interest. It reminded me of Stephen Lawhead books, which i would imagine most people would agree isnt a bad thing, and some would say just because it doesnt have metaphors which merit an \\"after the water-shed rating\\" its not just aimed at younger readers and thats so, but its just lacking that extra bite for my tastes. Still, on a long haul flight,and for 2 dollars, it did me proud!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on, Terry. Get with it.","review":"This was a disappointing, mediocre book. Having read every book Terry Brooks has written, I found myself knowing how the book would end well before I should. The plot twists are as obvious as a parade down Main Street. Mr. Brooks should stop considering himself a successful writer and go back to basics. Otherwise, his fans can find other authors to read.

Sorry Terry, you just cant add onto everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Brooks novel for \\"Thirtysomething\\" fans....","review":"Mr. Brooks issues another installment in the Running with the Demon series, but this time it is as predictable as all the other reviewers have stated. If you read the first book in the series, you will already know who the demon is when they are first introduced in the second book. On top of this, the characters in this book are even more overwrought and whiny than ever. Even the demon takes time out at the end of the book to whine about her problems and situation. Whine, worry, and contemplate; it does not add up to an active plot. For those readers spoiled by Shannara and Landover, you can hope that Mr. Brooks redeems this series with the third installment this fall. The first book was good; hopefully the third will wrap things up competently."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Terry Brooks book, definately not my last.","review":"Not having read the first book, the characters were all new to me.

But I read the 2nd one to see if maybe there was some hope.Nope, figgered this one out on page 12 just like the other one!Good heavens!Oh, and if you want Brooks to lecture to you about homeless people ad nauseum then read ahead! Some of the lectures in this book were straight from the writer to the reader, with no characters in between. A note to Mr. Brooks: DON'T EVER TALK TO ME WHEN I AM READING YOUR BOOK!Oh and his scene descriptions are so detailed and looooooooong, you just skip over them to get to where the characters are actually speaking instead of moving through these long boring scen descriptions! (Terry, go talk to Stephen King. That fool can give a decription of an area in like five words and it's better than your FOUR PAGES of scene description...(no I'm not lying FOUR PAGES!))Do not read this book or this story, it is atrocious."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's wrong with Terry Brooks","review":"Nest is one of the more interesting characters Brooks has created, yet she does essentially nothing in this entire book. She seems to have this incredible power but we are barely made aware of it. What's the point in creating a great character if you don't use her? How about a bit more character development?

This is Jon's story and tells if he will be able to continue being a Knight of the word and all that entails.This is another wonderful story told by a master, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very predictable; falls short of the first novel","review":"This is a very disappointing follow up to the first novel in this series. Very predictable plot; no real drama. Brooks had a chance to create an interesting series but has fallen way short with this second book.

While this book did keep me turning pages, it was more out of habit than anything else. I had read _Running with the Demon_, and mildly enjoyed it, so I bought this expecting more of the same. Well, I guess I got it. The story was eminently predictable: I ferreted out nearly all of the plot twists from the beginning. If you're a diehard Brooks fan, you might as well read the book, but otherwise I wouldn't reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"enthralling read","review":"The characters in Running With The Demon were very well drawn and you got interested in them and in their lives so it was great to see them again, like meeting old friends. The story in Knight of the Word packs a punch because it is about the choices we make and the obligations we have in our lives. Even if you don't care about that kind of thing in a book, its still a great story - bit of mystery, bit of action and people with special powers. Well worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyable read, but way too predictable. Not his best.","review":"Terry Brooks is one of my favorite authors, and I thouroughly enjoyed the Shannara series, and Running With the Demon, and this book continues the tradition of easy, fun reading that made the other books such great sellers.On the other hand, though, this book was WAY too predictable, with the major antagonist being obvious early on in the book. In fact, I was getting really annoyed when Brooks didn't reveal who the demon was. I mean, is there anyone out there that completely suspended thought, and didn't have a good clue as to who it was?Personally, I would have enjoyed it more if the book would have focused around the suprises to the characters, rather than to us.All in all, it was a fun read, but nothing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"a knight of the word","review":"Loved it.... and they just keep getting better... Terry Brooks is an amazing writer... I can't wait to start the next trilogy in the shannara series..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the 1st in this Series","review":"While Running with the Demon did not get a high vote from me (the first book in this series), I could tell it had great potential and Terry Brooks did not disappoint. Again, this wasn't his best but worth the time to read. The characters are more developed and you can see huge potential for more in the future.The one annoying thing this author did was to have the characters all figure out who the demon is but don't tell the reader. While I was pretty sure who it was, I felt stupid. The author writes things like \\"and then I figured out who did it. So I told him who did\\". Next Chapter!Nevertheless, this was a great read. In the next book I'd like to see Nest gain more insight into her magic and a teaming up of her and John to fight more than just a demon -- introduce a few more Word characters.Hurry up Terry -- your fans are waiting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never use oncesoldtales","review":"Tried to cancel order two hours after placement.

I had to give them a one star rating, it will not let me go any lower."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOSTLY FILLER, WITH LITTLE ACTION OR SUSPENSE","review":"Through most of the story, the characters are in little danger, so there's not much suspense or action. When they do face the demons, the demons are so weak that they're quickly defeated. Maybe if Terry made demons a little bit more dangerous and more of a threat the story would be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reality crashes into fantasy; thirty die in collision","review":"Mixing fantasy with reality is a decent concept; 'A Knight of the Word', however, is a casebook example of how not to pull it off. Though the first book in the series, 'Running with the Demon', was at least readable, this book is horrid. All throughout the book, the hero continuously demonstrates his incredible power of whining. Having lost a single battle, he suddenly considers himself unfit to fight. Of course, there's no free will when dealing with the Word and the Void, so we know that by the end, John Ross will be either staff-swinging or dead no matter what he wants to do. Then there's the 'look at the bad stuff in the newspaper' scene. This came off very cheesy and cliched in the first book; when Brooks repeats it using Ebonics in this book, it's not much better. Throw in a series of lame, easily-predictable plot twists, and you've got the makings of a genuinely bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequel identical to the 1st book...?","review":"I picked up KNIGHT because I found the first book of the series, RUNNING, somewhat interesting if not original (good vs. evil being a popular theme in fantasy books and all). Unfortunately it seems that Brooks is following the age old adage: if it works, don't fix it. This book is plagued with the same problems as the first: predictable plot and slight lack of suspense. Also, the written format is identical to the first, with the prologue/what-might-be epilogue at the beginning and the chapter/day division. Lastly, there's a huge tangent revolving around the \\"plight of the homeless\\" which is totally unnecessary and has very little to do with the *real* plot, John's fall from grace. I do hope Brooks other works are an improvement upon this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Butler did it!","review":"Halfway through the first chapter I had the ending figured out! The only reason I kept reading is that I was hoping the author had truly fooled me. And he did... he fooled me into reading the whole damn thing and wasting all that time.Over 20 years in the business and Brooks still hasn't learned to write. I tried to read his first book, \\"The Sword of Shanara\\", when it first came out, but I kept falling asleep and never got the ending. His pacing is plonding, his characters are flat, his descriptions are verbose and his plots are trite. Who is it that keeps buying all his books so that he makes it to the best seller list?So many people raved about \\"Running with the Demon\\" that I decided to give it a try. It was OK! It needed work, but it was good enough to get me to read \\"A Knight of the Word.\\" Well, that's that last Brooks book for me, you know the old saying, \\"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice...\\" Instead I'll re-read a Charles De Lint book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The travails of Persiles and Sigismunda","review":"...There are several monographs on the subject, but the book itself is missing. And that is a pity: Persiles is a funny and action-packed book, very different from everything else Cervantes wrote.Under different names, Persiles and Sigismunda travel to Rome. They are sister and brother. On their way to Rome, countless adventures happen, including the kidnapping of Sigismunda by some barbarians. These and Sigismunda suffer a shipwreck in the Mediterranean and the adventures continue. The ending is a twist of the plot.This novel is very representative of the Reinassance. As noted in other reviews of works from this age, one constant feature is the interaction between mythological characters and Christian deities. The divine entities participate in the action and fantastic things happen. It should be read and appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chics kinda hot...dancin' kinda NOT!","review":"That pretty much explains it all.

If I had it to do over again, I would buy only two, maybe three - and THIS would be at the top of my list. This has the most entertaining transitions between songs, and the best songs - NOTHING tops 'I Love My Elbows,' although my kids' favorite is the Lamb-y dance. 'Get Along' is the catchiest tune since 'Rubber Ducky' and my kids howl everytime someone gets on that trampoline. This is WELL worth the price (and 'Let's Make Music' is, too).

As you can see from the picture, the light is positioned in the middle. I should have realized that this was a design flaw because it automatically means that the tweezers cannot maintain a grip on small hairs.If you intend to use these tweezers only for eyebrows, they will work fine. There is enough grip to hold onto thicker, longer hairs and yank them out (ouch). However, if you are in the menopause crowd, like me, and have unwanted facial hair (i.e., whiskers) on your chin, these will not work at all. These tweezers will not hold onto, much less pull out, these tough little hairs. They are absolutely the worst for this purpose that I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never thought I'd see the day.....","review":"....when I would find sex so boring!

I have one of those Focus models and trusted the Amazon model checker which said this harness would work in my car when in fact it did not.It would behoove you to pull out the stereo first just to check which harness you need before ordering one, especially if you have a 2003-2004 Ford Focus.I can't really comment on the quality of this product as I was unable to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not true","review":"I have a 2000 ford focus SE and this DOES NOT FIT!!!

A Philly guy, he is being hailed as a respected new talent on guitar. That talent is on display in force here, especially on the title track (a blues) and THE ETERNAL TRIANGLE, which swings mightily. And Jimmy can play a pretty ballad, too, as witness Coltrane's CENTRAL PARK WEST. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth rating higher than the five alloted stars","review":"This is the finest hard bop jazz guitar I have heard in quite some time. From the opening \\"Eternal Triangle\\", Bruno establishes this album as a major force to be reckoned with. He is capable of playing as deftly as major heavyweights like Montgomery and Green in the big toned electric tradition. His choice of material shows a fine sense of intelligence (Witchcraft by Sinatra, indeed!) and his version of Giant Steps preceded by Coltrane's Central Park West is a tour de force. Some may see this music as a throwback to an earlier era, but this CD is brilliant in an era where players like Frisell, Scofield, and Mike Stern are changing the notion of \\"jazz guitar\\" for better or worse. Not to be excluded, the rhythm section of Craig Thomas and Steve Holloway complements Bruno perfectly. This album should be in any serious jazz collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense! Incredible!","review":"Jimmy Bruno is the best jazz guitarist I have ever heard, period. That's a mighty strong claim, but listen to this CD and you might find yourself singing the same sort of praise. \\"Moonlight in Vermont\\" is worth the price of this CD alone, but take a listen to the interpretations of Coletrane's \\"Central Park West\\" and \\"Giant Steps\\" if you need further convincing. The man can burn, and he can also chill with achingly melodic lines. If you like jazz guitar of any flavor, but especially of the bop school, then you ought to buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You're Serious About Outdoor Photography","review":"Cokin has been the go to product for graduated neutral density (ND) filters for many years and this is no exception.

Second: It seems that after they've been used for a few months or more, no matter how clean it is, if you point them towards the sun you get a LOT of noise and spots effectively rendering them useless into the sun for sunset/sunrise, especially if the rest of the scenery in the photo is dark.Having said all that, I use mine a lot and would not want to be without it.

There are several reasons for this: in comparison ISB lyrics are generally much more evocative, surreal & original, and while the ISB is musically quite adventurous (incorporating lots of foreign influences), Forest seems to base its songs upon more conventional folk song structures.Having said that, Forest/Full Circle is a well-appreciated addition to my cd collection, and I recommend this cd to all ISB fans and open minded folk enthusiasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Folkies rejoice","review":"Touches the essance of where we ought to be.

My 9-year-old son, however, loses interest in a book if there isn't something exciting happening at least every other page and so he wasn't really a fan. The Bunnicula series is really more of a cerebral children's series. If your kid is a big reader, this will probably be an excellent addition to his/her library. If not, you may want to look elsewhere. This isn't really the book to get a child hooked into reading if they don't like to do it in the first place. My 1-year-old daughter already likes reading more than her older brother ever did, so I suspect when she gets old enough for these books she will love them. I will save them for her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How great it is!","review":"I love your pet's: Chester and Howard are funny! How do you think of the pet's????

But the lovably dumb dog who is the point of view character and his cat friend who is too smart for his own good really seem to connect with kids. This books also has just enough tension to be exciting and enough camp to make the mystery safe rather than scary. Horror fans take note, this is a great starter book for the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for any age!","review":"I won't lie I bought this book for myself and I am in my 30's.

Bunniculacomes from a Dracula movie and has a note in the CarpathianMt. language from Transylvania. Then one night Bunnicula looked like he was gathering sustenance from the moonlight and a V-shape mark was going down his back like a cape. The next morning Mr. Monroe found a white tomato. All of the juice had been sucked out. Soon other white veggies appeared. One night Bunnicula got out of his cage all by himself. These are the reasons we think Bunnicula is a vampire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid basketball system","review":"We had this basketball system installed and it took two strong workers to do it but it's worth it.

I would definitely buy them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hillside/Sloping lots neglected (somewhat)","review":"This book is great if you're building on flat or very gently sloping terrain. The cross section of plans can fit most lots and the plans are very high quality either as is or as an inspiration for your own design. If you're looking for ideas for a sloping lot this is not the book. The section on hillside homes is really poor especially for a book of 500 plans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"English-, Germanic-, Greek-centric. VERY disappointing","review":"I bought this book expecting a dictionary which would give equivalents of various lexical items throughout the Indo-European language family, with representation from at least one language from each branch. Instead, what we have here is a book whose title SHOULD have been \\"Dictionary of English word equivalents in Germanic and Greek\\". About 95% of the \\"Indo-European\\" explained here comes from these languages. Next in frequency is Latin.There are only a handful of references to Celtic, Sanskrit and Russian (only very basic and obvious correlations for the latter), plus only one Iranian word I could find. Armenian? Albanian? Tocharian? Baltic? Anatolian languages? Hah, forget it!This book can only be recommended to those people interested in English or Germanic word origins, rather than those interested in a truly balanced overview of Indo-European. For everything else it is totally inadequate."},{"rating":"1","title":"same old same old","review":"This booklet is merely a reprint of the appendix found at the back of the American Heritage Dictionary.

In my work as a scientist I feel that my first job is to look into the origin of the words the name each new field that becomes the subject of my research. Books such as this one help provide such insights.The only other thing that I might wish for would be the equivalent dictionary in other Indo-European languages such as German, French, Russian, and Icelandic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Functional","review":"Most bike helmets these days look like something H.R. Giger might have dreamed up. The techno pointiness is more extreme than ever! If you ride a cruiser or commuter bike, you might want something a little more understated. At first I was a little nervous that the Makai might make me look a little like a 12 year old boy, but thank god, no. It looks kind of like an old motorcycle helmet. It has that right blend of simple coolness and whos cares what you think geekiness. It provides good coverage, and feels safer really than most of the others, especially in the same price range, and it doesn't sit up on your head like a futuristic mushroom. I have the white one and the Hula Girls are nice. The only con is that it will be a little warmer than the others on hot days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult to follow","review":"I've tried this video several times, but I can't seem to follow along in certain sections. I agree with some of the other reviewers who say you need a dance background. I find it really hard to follow the dance moves - maybe I'm not very coordinated, but it's frustrating. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you can learn new dance moves quickly or are extremely coordinated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing","review":"I hate to be critical, but I have been looking for really good, fun workout tapes. THis one was not it. THe price was excellent, but no workout whatsoever. It was fun to learn some dance moves, but I spent tons of time rewinding because the cueing was awful, and the instructions were minimal. My heart rate barely rose. Sorry to say, but I wouldnot recommend this to anyone, unless you were trying to learn a few, very few, modern dance steps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book in a Great Series!","review":"The Anasazi mystery series by the Gears is tremendous fun to read and teaches one a lot about archeology and the Anasazi culture. Don't start with this one. Begin with The Visitant, then The Summoning God and finish off with Bonewalker. I'm reading them for the second time which I find enjoyable due to the complexities of the mysteries and the Anasazi cosmology. If you have ever been to Chaco Canyon you'll really appreciate the detail and, like us, perhaps plan to a trip back to hunt down all the magic places referenced in the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 Excellent Stories For the Price of One","review":"This was an excellent book. There were two stories interwoven within each other. Both followed right along each other. The characters were outstanding. Both of these stories had a great deal of suspense and murder and of course with the Gear's writing the excellence of past history was there for all to see. The Gears have an awesome touch of allowing the reader to see and feel the history of the Anasazi. I could not put the book down and I thoroughly recommend it for anyone who likes a good murder mystery and a love for the past.Kathy Riley"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes I am puzzled","review":"I am a Native American and I have been a big fan of the Gears andthis series of mysteries. The Gears display a rare sensitivity to Native American values. But in this novel I find myself puzzled. From my perspective, one of the arch-villains escaped without punishment. This left me feeling that there was a loose end flapping in the wind. All of the wicked Native Americans got killed but the wicked white woman is to get a couple of years probation. In my value system she was even more evil than some of the Native Americans because she devoured people's spirits. Four stars because of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashed It","review":"I've read just about all of the O'Neal Gear books and I just could not stomach this one. I tried twice to read this book and finally just threw it in the trash. The content was just too much. I found it repulsive. Most of their books I enjoy, some were tedious to read but for the most part entertaining and interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is the third book in a 3 book series which is very interesting.

It would have been nicer if the shoes had been comfy from the first wearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"great shoe -- very comfortable","review":"I loved this shoe from the first wearing.

I listen to this CD everyday as I drive to work and when I drive back home. My three favorite songs are \\"Hubo Alguien, Contra La Corriente, No Sabes Como Duele\\". My feet automatically start moving to the music. I recommened this CD to everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best contemporary salsa albums this decade.","review":"The album is a gem. It contains a great mix of danceable salsa numbers as well as great classic ballads. Most noteabe songs are \\"Y Hugo Alguien\\" and \\"No me Conoces\\". One can't listen to the first without wanting to get up and move your feet. In the second song, a ballad, Marc Anthony displays great range. I have not followed salsa for some years but I have to say that this album made me realize how much I've missed. I enjoyed the album so much I went out and purchased his two prior album the following week. They were just as great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic- a Marc A classic!","review":"Marc Anthony's Spanish language albums are usually exceptional and unique but he really took his talent an extra mile here and this is a show case of one of best salsa albums produced in the nineties. Everything in Contra la Corriente is on point- the voice, the acoustics, the lyrics and the emotion. What can I say this is exceptional salsa by an exceptional artist. This is a great album for true and new salsa fans, all the songs are great for listening and dancing (yes, although it's not fast salsa). My ultimate favorites on this cd are: Y hubo alguien, Contra la corriente, and Me voy a regalar. This is a very special album, I don't think the artist himself can top this one. In a nutshell- beautiful salsa!"},{"rating":"2","title":"His Best Salsa Album","review":"Great songs, great voice. I don't think I'll will ever hear Marc make a full salsa album, without any of the pop or ballads. The style of music that in his albums are ideally not danceable, basically because the louder and more aggressive arrangements will take away from his voice. That is one major difference between him and other salseros like Victor Manuelle, Tito Rojas, etc.; they don't necessarily have the same range as Marc, but the orchestra doesn't become as a distant background. His records are to be listened to relax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nadie Como Marc!","review":"For real Latin Music, this has to be my favourite album by Marc Anthony. It's so hard to pick just one favourite track, but if I have to then it must be Si Te Vas. But all the songs on the album are incredible and I'm almost rendered speechless by my enthusiasm. I just can't get enough of that amazing voice or that hot-blooded Salsa beat.

I took turns reading it to him and found it an enchanting book. The main character was so transparent and in my eyes, a hero. He faced loss, rejection and loneliness, but had strong faith, integrity and ultimately, friendship and love. It is an easy read for adults and a good read for middle schoolers. For the most part, the chapters are short, helping to keep the interest of those who need encouragement as they read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharing Solitude","review":"The Slaves of Solitude (New York Review Books Classics)Patrick Hamilton's work is gaining attention as a result of a 2007 publication of The Slaves of Solitude by The New York Review of Books. Originally published in 1947, it tells the story of residents in a boarding house in a small village located on a train line to London. Although they share the same dining room and lounge, the characters live their lives in solitude, limited by the conditions imposed on civilians by 1943 World War II. The distinguishing factor is the insight of the players that ranges from minimal to obsessive. This is a very engaging novel that immerses the reader in the era, location, and interaction of the characters. Readers are confronted by their own solitude and learn that insight is the result of sharing experiences with others. Hamilton's novel shows that war prevents isolation but encourages people to explore their solitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"avalon","review":"this book is the best its nice and thick and super interesting i wish i had the auctal book i took it out of the libray if you cant decide to buy it or not buy it you wont be disaponted also another good seires isw w.i.t.c.h."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was great!","review":"I love the whole series so far, I'm only up to 4 The Secret of the Unicorn.

All the politics, the wrangling, all the non-medical stuff.These guys seem to have access to the top people in the field and probably have lots of inside connections. Brookes sends post-SARS dispatches from the right places, even the famous Metropole, Hotel M! Why has no one else written or picked up on this story? Every american and european should read this if only to understand the larger world they live in.Good job Brookes and Khan for making epi and public health come alive in a realistic way.

He is a very long term trainer in interviewing with an emphasis upon discourse analysis in legally sound interviewing. His works (including \\"Investigative Discourse Analysis\\") are not a \\"Cliff Notes\\" or \\"MTV video\\" of interviewing which appears to be desired by our society, rather they are thoughtful and careful works, like pieces of a puzzle, where study and practice are needed to embrace the techniques.There is no \\"quick fix\\" to the art of interviewing and it is not something for the unlearned, but if your profession calls for interviewing skills, and you have a basic foundation of grammar, you will love this book. It is to be read slowly and carefully. I marked up mine.It saddens me to read of police officers who did not \\"stay the course\\" and learn the material.Those who are our country's best in Statement Analysis, are those who practice their craft, forever learning and forever growing in their understanding of interviewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad hand day ?","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer, though I am puzzled that he should give 4 stars to a record he won't be playing again. This lady's technique lags way behind her objectives, so she should either work on the former or simplify the latter.

But that was the only redeeming feature in this novel. The heroine was annoying and unbelievable - one second she hates this guy and on the very next page she loves him? I couldn't find any reason why any of the characters fell in love with each other, except for maybe their reported good looks. Ms. Coffman's writing was also a bit cumbersome.

I put the chairs together myself (I'm 33 year old female that doesn't know much about construction) but I couldn't figure out the table. My boyfriend had to help me put the table together.
