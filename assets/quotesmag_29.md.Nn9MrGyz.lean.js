They got some woman to try to sound like Sandra, the main Enigma vocalist, making them even more of a cheap imitation of the King. The lyrics are so ridiculously cheesy, too. These people are not the prophets they think they are. Enigma's lyrics are deep, original, and heartfelt. These are not. They make me want to laugh, if anything.

And frankly, all Elesiem has managed to do here is create church music with drum loops. In theory it sounds like it might work, but in practice it alternates between boring and forced.

I planned to use NiMH AAA bateries instead and the problems came down considerably. But that swaping business comes into action...so thats another overhead.=================What Palm/PalmOne shud have done is make that model charge NiCad/NiMH batteries like some CD players do...inside the battery case itself.

The IIIxe fit the docking cradle securely and reliably; for some reason, the m125 is much trickier to fit into the docking cradle. The plastic cover looks and feels flimsy. Compared to the IIIxe it eats batteries. Finally, after a couple of months it just plain stopped working. Although I'm frugal, I decided I didn't need the trouble of an unreliable PDA and went ahead and bought a Toshiba that works beautifully.

When I called to ask Palm if this was a recurring problem with m125s the man tried to charge me $25 to get the question answered. Then when I refused to pay $25 for the question, the rep actually laughed at me. So I took it took the next step and submitted an e-mail asking the same question and requesting the company's complaint process. PalmOne did respond, however not to any of my questions.

It also shows how Florida's agribusiness can only exist through these workers.I live in Naples, less than 1 hour away from Immokalee, yet almost on a different planet.

I take that back, TB has one talent, and that is his talent to take a perfectly good premise and completely butcher it with his repetitive, dull and close minded style. I gave him three chances and he blew it three times in a row with the first three stories in this book. All the good ideas got mangled by his inept, sorry excuse for style.

The battery backup doesn't work (the machine resets itself when the power goes out, erasing the messages, even with a brand-new battery). Wait, did I just contradict myself? NO, the battery will not save the messages if the power goes out, but you still have to unplug it to reset the machine when it crashes.To top it off, the sound quality is awful; people who speak softly cannot be understood at all.

In ten chapters Shoni Labowitz describes the 10 sephirot of the tree of life and each chapter is devided again in paragraphs in which she describes aspects of the sephirot. These paragraphs are like meditations, in simple and very beautiful language. And when reading I notice that each sephira can be a part of my daily life.

Will Oz ever be able to find the peace and balance he needs to come to terms with the animal inside him and with himself?I will admit that Oz is sometimes out of character with the cursing and all, but this is still an awesome book!

The story is predictable and a yawner, offering little in the way of furthering character development in an ancillary Buffy character - Oz. Equally dull is the artwork with little in the way of flair or panache to further stimulate visual interest.

This knife has been ideal for me. It is small, light, and flat, and the blade is sharp and suitable for everyday jobs (opening letters, boxes, plastic packaging, etc.) The blade can stand a good amount of pressure.

If you chew your nails to the nub, or have diseased nails, choose a different knife. Maybe for the those who paint their nails, avoid this knife. But for the great majority, opening these blades is not an issue at all. This is the perfect light duty knife for those times you don't want your pants weighted down with the Cadet, and Cadet is my EDC. Or when you don't want that Swiss Army Knife (with the 6 to 10 blades) lump in your pants. If you want a small knife, avoid the Classics because they're just too small.

I've loved the design of them all. This model is the one exception.For the item I received, the can-opener/bottle-opener combo tool was very difficult to open and close. I actually cut my hand while closing it.Also, in my opinion, the knife is too thin for its length. This makes it difficult and uncomfortable to use. Please consider the Victorinox Swiss Army Classic SD (Silver Alox) or the Victorinox Swiss Army Cadet (Silver Alox) as alternatives.The Alox Clasic SD is just as thin; but because it is shorter, it is better proportioned. Also, the SD's scissors are very useful. The Cadet is a little thicker, which gives it better proportions. The Cadet is still slim enough though and it comes with more tools. All the tools on these knives where easy enough to open too. Both these tools are close in price to the Bantam too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Cable(s) Good Brand No Need to Spend More","review":"I have a few types of Dayton cables and just purchased another one of these \\"Y Cables\\".

He takes center stage a few times (along with some guest DJ's like Babu), but for the most part he puts together nice beats and lets the guest MC's do their thing. The result is an album that's probably better than what I had imagined I was buying. But it does seem worth it to mention to potential buyers that this is not just an exhibition of competition style turntable spinning.

The author is clearly trying to capture the atmosphere present in Caleb Carr's \\"The Alienist\\" and \\"Angel of Darkness\\". However he fails due to the improbable friendship that develops between Poe and Crockett.

This wasn't a parody?","review":"I was surprised to realize that this book wasn't a comedy. I was laughing happily at the ridiculous prose (crafted to imitate Poe's writing style) and the clever, over-the-top parodies of both Crockett's and Poe's characters. But as I read on, I realized that the novel possibly wasn't intended to be funny. Did I misunderstand? I came to Amazon.Com to find out. Well. Here I found it. It's supposed to be a deadly serious book. None of the reviewers, neither professional nor readers like myself, describe the book as a parody. (Or even acknowledge the parody.) As I read on, I found myself less and less willing to put up with the author's style. Unable to trust it as humor, it's simply a tedious book. I didn't finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I purchased this book a few years ago. I finally go around to reading it and I was pleasantly surprised. At first, it was a little odd, reading about Edgar Allan Poe and Davy Crockett teaming up to solve a murder but as I got into it, I really started to enjoy it. I thought the subtle hints at where Poe might have gotten his ideas for his most famous stories was very interesting and I had a good time picking out which story Schechter was writing about. If you are a fan of historical fiction written in a style that makes it nearly believable, this is a great book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh oh don't buy","review":"This is a book I bought with high hopes, none of which were fulfilled. It's boring, it's tedious, and a second class attempt at mirroring Poes style does nothing to make you want to finish it. Also, the constant allusions to Poe stories make you think \\"oh no, not again\\" pretty soon. A nice idea, but badly executed"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most unlikely pair of sleuths in modern literature.","review":"I loved this book. It is eloquently written from Edgar Allen Poe's perspective and is thoroughly engrossing. The idea of pairing frontiersman Davy Crockett and Poe is genius as the two actually work well together. Highly credible dialog and a historically atypical setting in old Baltimore make for a delightful read. If this is the author's first foray into fiction (I know he specializes in true crime pieces) I only hope he continues. I recommend this book highly to anyone who enjoys history and mystery stories. Poe's refined vocabulary may send some for their Webster's, but it is worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"The conceit of this book is that it is written by Poe, and incorporates in the plot many elements of his poems and stories. It should work, but it doesn't. The wordy, faux-Victorian prose style is deadly. If Poe really wrote like this, you'd never have heard of him. Poe's prose, whatever else it is, is readable, and this is not. Somebody needs to try this idea again and make it work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written BY the Author FOR the Author","review":"This novel is unfortunately written in the first person, supposedly by Edgar Allen Poe, and the real author, Harold Schechter, is so busy showing us that he has done his research and that he knows how Poe might have spoken, that he uses his erudition to flog the reader with it. The prose is hell to read and the author succeeds in the almost impossible task of making heinous murder boring. The reader may say to himself, as I did, \\"Reading this book is more difficult than ditch-digging,\\" and I (unlike most readers) know all the obscure words used. The constant use of italics is maddening. The character of Davey Crockett comes across as a cartoon. If you like macabre novels, do yourself a favor and read H.P. Lovecraft and forget this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"italics?","review":"clever idea and plot, but wading through Poe's narration is as grim as the murder scenes, despite the historically accurate voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying","review":"I really wanted to like this book. The subject matter seemed excellent. However, several things really started to bother me greatly. First of all, Poe comes across as a really pedantic prig. His conversational language is absurd: it is not as if the real Poe wrote or spoke that way so I don't know why the author has him speak in such a pedantic, convoluted style. Another annoyance is the constant use of italics for emphasis at least 4 or 5 times a page. It is so very unnecessary. And thirdly is the ridiculous way Davy Crocket speaks. I don't care if he was a showboater, no one speaks that way. The plot is an interesting one but the denoument is far fetched and unrealistic. Needless to say, I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poe and Crockett...why?","review":"The reviewer from Bogart, GA hit the nail on the head. By writing as Poe, Schechter was able to create the illusion of Poe telling this \\"true\\" tale. The problem is Poe's prose is deadly dull. With a delicate sensibility, \\"Poe's\\" narration avoids any mentions of things to horrible to convey to the gentle readers, leading the reader to fill in all the blanks. This technique starts as quaint, but rapidly becomes irksome .The mystery is far fetched, but it is clever in the way it references Poe's work. Crockett's appearence as the frontier hero image he created for himself was a bit larger than life as was Poe's fainting at every horror. The portrayal of Poe's relationship to his cousin and future bride was appropriately creepy, but this occasional glimpse at the \\"real\\" Poe was buried amidst the dated Poe first person dialogue. A good idea, buried under literary pretensions."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to make it to the end","review":"I really did try to finish reading this book -- Honest I did! -- but I just couldn't.In the beginning, the idea of a full length novel written in Poe-esque style was interesting. Then, when that style was combined with an authentic backwoods Kentucky dialect for Davy Crockett, it was a novelty. After 150 pages it was no longer interesting nor novel, it was just painful. Buried underneath all of this \\"highfalutin\\" writing is, I think, a very good story, but I just didn't have the fortitude to dig deep enough to find it.I have no doubt in my mind that this novel was meticulously researched. I have no doubt that the writing and speaking styles correctly and accurately represent both Poe and Crockett. I have no doubt that the historical settings are correct and representative of the time period. I do, however, have serious doubts about the readability and enjoyment of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearable","review":"Nice cover art, but oh, the writing! There's more to E.A. Poe than paranoia and a recherche vocabulary, but you'd never know it from Schechter's tiresome imitation of his style. The running gag of having off-kilter references to Poe's story (the \\"House of Asher,\\" a croaking seagull, a murdered old lady and ape-like suspect, Poe's curiosity about maelstroms, etc., ad nauseam) gets old really fast.Poor Poe wouldn't get far on \\"Wheel of Fortune,\\" either, judging from the number of times he misreads \\"NEVERMORE\\" with half the letters staring him in the face.Irritating, phony, and dull.

The film is lush, certainly; Kingsley is studly and Cruz is beautiful and pliant like a Barbie doll, but this film convinces me of nothing--absolutely nothing--other than the fact that an old man's attempt to remain virile is dependent upon the disfigurement of the woman.

I considered myself to be competent at math, yet I find that I struggle through this morass of a book. If your professor assigns this text, you will find yourself on Wikipedia trying to make sense of the material that should be in the textbook. Good luck to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"very confusing book","review":"it seems like all the people reviewing this book has taken diffe at rice university, and no other universities have assigned this book. fortunately, i did not attend professor polking's section (i sat in on the first day and quickly switched sections). professor polking is a nice guy, and offers help when you need it (having said that, hopefully i won't feel so bad in my subsequent bashing). however, the book, like the second reviewer said, has very confusing proofs. the book is mostly just talk, and it's hard to tell what the key points (key equations) of each section are. it's also confusing because the sections aren't \\"sectioned\\" off--what leads to which key point? rather, it just seems to be one big blob of text, with the equations interspersed throughout. sure, buy it if it's required, but keep attend all lectures (if you are a college student) and keep another differential equations book handy, as you will undoubtedly not have a clue what polking is talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book in Undergrad Career","review":"tulane uses this book exclusively for diferential equation. This is t quite possible the worst text book i have ever used. They like to say that they don't put as much emphasis on specific solution techniques as they do to solving pratical equations. this means solution methos a briefly mention then sections up section are made of problem you should be able to solve if you were to know the solution methods. some sections don't even over solving differential equations at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Homestake Lode is a load of fun","review":"G. Sam Carr's \\"Homestake Lode\\" is a lively western with a plot that moves along from crisis to crisis like a runaway six-horse team. Carr paints the beauty of the still wild American West through his fine descriptions and the reader becomes privy to the wheeling and dealing of mine owners, stake claimers and saloon keepers. Especially enjoyable is how Carr weaves historical characters, George Hearst for one, and Samuel Clemens for another, into the plot giving it a rich and lively sense of time and place in that undisciplined yet developing period of the late 19th century. The male/female love interest between the lively lass, Kelly Ryan, and Wells Fargo Detective Tuck Powells, is kept in a state of will-they-or-won't they, up to the last exciting page. Western lover or not, don't miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astrological Insight","review":"In his usual insightful manner Ray Grasse shows how the profound symbolism of the signs and planetary forces in astrology synchronistically link up to newsworthy events. What I found especially fascinating is his conveyance of the transition from the Piscean to Aquarian Age through cinema. It's a fresh and fun approach to symbolism and the astrological language. This book is every bit as good as his previous one,\\"The Waking Dream\\". Even non-astrologers can derive benefit from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This was the first biography I've read about Michelle Kwan. Though I'm not a figure skater, her confidence and determination have inspired me to succeed in gymnastics. It was a nice biography, with lots of pictures and nice information. I only have several complaints. First, it was a little too short in my opinion, since you mostly learn about the outlines of her life, not full details. For details I would suggest reading \\"Heart of A Champion\\", Michelle's autobiography. Second, it would have been nice if the book was longer, like I said it needs more details. Not realy for older readers, but great for anyone who wants to learn about Michelle Kwan"},{"rating":"2","title":"La Cross: Always Great","review":"These cuticle clippers, like other La Cross products, are great. Although do-it-yourself amateurs need always use caution when using sharp clippers on the delicate cuticle tissue, they are sharp enough to do the job with precision without being so sharp they too quickly or easily draw blood. Both my husband and I really like these clippers, as much as if not more than our other ones by equally reputable nail-care companies. Another La Cross item we absolutely love and highly recommend are their diamond-tip, LED-lit tweezers, which usually come in a travel case, the black satin box-style with internal mirror being our favorite because as a set they are invaluable at home and on the go (lighted tweezers, protective case and helpful mirror)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just too big!!","review":"These are so big and heavy.

My vet recommended it after he found oxalate crystals and her urine. We tried various things to combat the crystal formation over a period of 4 months and nothing worked. In fact, when trying to change her ph from acidic to alkaline in order to avoid the crystals, she developed struvite crystals. Then he told me that another patient of his, a golden retriever, uses free & clear and asked if I wanted to try it. After 2 weeks, she was completely clear of all crystals and hasn't had any in over a year.

In giving examples of what not to do they give examples that use words kids find funny like \\"Stupidosaurus\\" that can plant ideas of bad behavior. At a very early age kids can't differentiate between good and bad examples. My 4 year old grandkids would never use the word bored but this book uses it and now they want to know what bored is. There is an example of a boy running after a girl and the girl saying \\"he's my boyfriend.\\" It's not even used as a bad example. Don't want my kids thinking that it's OK for boys to chase you if you don't want them too. Although there are good examples the bad ones make this book dissappointing (there are many others) and not a good way to teach about friendship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for children to learn social skills","review":"I purchased this book so that I could it read it to my own elementary age children and also so that I could use it in a classroom.

Even at the end of the book I still feel that his love for Alice is greater than anything he feels for Judith. He done nothing but protect Alice and show only kindness toward her while he treated Judith like his property. He is no hero to me and there was no love between him and his wife, Judith but sex.

I started with the 3rd book (Velvet Song) and my interest was piqued - I bought the other 3 to see how all the Montgomery brothers ended up. This one is a real keeper, a great love story. Judith and Gavin are right pig headed at times - and he does hit her early on, so if that bothers you (and it does me) be warned. However, the story is so well-written, the characters are so interesting. You understand the appeal, for instance, of Raine Montgomery in this book (it's not so clear in \\"his\\" book, Velvet Song - he's a sour guy in that one). The villians are great in this book, the heroes strong - what more could you want. I'm half way through Highland Velvet (Stephen's book) and it's just as good as this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really???","review":"I don't understand the good reviews I read about this book.

It's not your typical premise.However, I got as far as the scene where the husband rapes his wife on their wedding night, started to cry, and closed the book. Intimate partner rape is a real life issue that devastates people's lives, not a technique of erotica."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was beyond BAD!!! It was violent and depressing.","review":"Where to begin... I love Jude Deveraux, I think her stories are wronderful and I always grow to love her characters. There are always exeptions though, And The Velvet Promise was a depressing, violent tale which actually made me throw the book accross the room after I finished it-This was how angry I was. I LOATHED the hero, Gavin, with a passion. Judith, dear, you are a doormat. I am suprised that she put up with some of the stuff Gavin dished out. Since when is rape a marital right?

The author clearly has never been raped or she would not have used it as a plot device at all and jumped from rape to an intimate consensual sexual interlude with the same man in the next breath. Gavin, who is supposed to be the hero, is just an idiotic, barbaric moron infatuated with Alice, a manipulative woman who is not his wife.. while Judith, the heroine, lacks a ton of self-respect and intellect when she keeps coming back to Gavin for sex. I just didn't get this book at all and don't understand any women who likes it. Gavin never trusts Judith until the very end, yet Judith is constantly finding reasons for liking Gavin when there really isn't any.Forgive me for not summarizing the plot, but I just don't want to waste anymore cyberspace for the review of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"domestic violence isn't romantic in any century","review":"a confusing concoction, comprised of detailed descriptions of silk and velvet garments trimmed with the fur of a variety of rodents, interspersed with scenes of rape, torture, beatings and unrequieted love enacted by characters whose motivation and actions are just plain Out There.

She was forced to get married of course but five minutes after she meets the hero (who just happens to be outrageously handsome) she declares \\"Maybe this marriage isn't going to be so bad after all\\" How trite can a person be.

That will be easy because Adipex or its generic version, Phentermine, will give you tons of energy and cut your appetite.

Now, before you claim my loss as water weight, my weight before was a consistant 130. And I've lost 3 pounds and weighed myself 3 different times throughout the day to make sure of it.

After running out of the pills, I gained 7 pounds within a week even though I had not changed my diet/exercise plan.I called them on their guarantee and they said it's only good for 30 days from the date of purchase. It took that long just to complete the bottle! Don't buy this product. It's a waste of money. Take that $70-$140 you were ready to shell out and go buy some new clothes.

I have had a decrease in my appetite and it has made it easier to eat more healthy and be more selective about the food I eat. I have also increased my water intake. I also committed to a gym membership. I started a strict routine of 30 minutes of cardio vascular (bike or stepper) followed by alot of crunches. I will probably get one of the guys that work at the gym to train me since I don't have alot of weight lifting experience. I want to get back into the shape I was in when I was in College.

It brings to light so many answers to questions that any normal inquisitive human being has pondered over once or twice in his or her life.

The title of the album is appropriate as this is a bit of a retro sounding release. Overall I don't like this one quite as much as the band's debut, but it is still a very good album with those familiar Flower Kings touches. Everything here is solid. Highlights included the title track \\"Retropolis\\", and the sprawling \\"There Is More To This World\\". \\"Judas Kiss\\" is another good one, and the album closer \\"Retropolis By Night\\" is a great way to end the disc. The Flower Kings are very good at what they do and if you like their other stuff this one should defiantly be a part of your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for you prog music fans !","review":"If you don't know the band, this is a good choice to begin with, that's what I have done when one of my friend talk to me about the FK, after hearing this, I wanted more. No filler in this album, only top quality modern prog music, you can't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly amazing.","review":"This is my first run-in with the Flower Kings. I heard one of their songs from I believe the album \\"Adam & Eve\\" some time ago and it wasn't my particular cup'o'tea. Then riding in the car with a friend one day he had a mix cd playing and this ridiculously good song came on that I was almost positive was Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Upon inquiry he said it was the Flower Kings' Retropolis. Needless to say that song alone was enough to make me buy the album, and the rest of it is just as fantastic. There is some amazing guitar work on it, along with great bass lines and keyboard work. The vocals are perfect. Perfect. Dwell on that word. There's not many things I would consider musically perfect, but the vocals fit right in with the rest of the virtuosity."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIPOFF. RIPOFF. RIPOFF!!!","review":"This compilation may call itself 'Starship: Greatest Hits,' but this is Starship featuring Mickey Thomas, the newest incarnation of the group in which Mickey Thomas is the sole original member from its 1980s heyday. These are not very good re-recordings, and while Thomas still sounds very good for a man of his age (this was recorded c.2003), the production is sloppy and the band does sound off at times. If you want Starship's greatest hits, seek out the three studio albums, 'Ten Years and Change,' or 'The Very Best of Starship - We Built This City.' NOT this. This isn't the Starship you remember from the 1980s and early 1990s.Buy it if you are a curious Starship fan that wants to know what Mickey Thomas has been up to lately. Otherwise, avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant? HA!","review":"I've never heard something so rediculous in my entire life! What are they trying to pull? The whole album is a re-recording of old songs, and not by the original band members. I can't believe they even dare to sell this tripe. I'm soooooooo angry. I'm buying the Cocktail Soundtrack. At least that has the REAL version of Wild Again. I'd be more angry if I didn't have another greatest hits album. I really only bought it for Wild Again. I am sooooooo angry about this.

It reminds one of a \\"B\\" movie from the 1970s. C. Thomas Howell looks like he has partied too much. He has lost a lot of weight and his face (with the aid of some powder) looks like something out of \\"The Night of the Living Dead.\\" There us an interview with Howell on the DVD where he seems to try to save face, but comes off really weird (like a space case).

Great cast, although the scripting at times gets a little campy, however, C. Thomas Howell & Nic Turturro really stand out as Bianchi & Buono, though at times Turturro can go a bit over the edge with his \\"wise guy\\" esque characterization. Directing is good (same guy who did the excellent Ed Gein movie a few years back), but overall the film does suffer a little due to it's low budget, but other than that, i really liked this film, much better than the other recent film put out about the Hillside Stranglers, this one is closest to the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting..A bit shy of being a porn film","review":"I saw the original version of the Hillside Strangler starring Dennis Farina made in the 80's and enjoyed the movie immensely, that movie was done giving you the full effect of the story without adding all the deviancy and smutt.This movie should have been chucked the minute the script was finished!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy product!","review":"After receiving this item, I realized I should have paid more to get something nicer - cheap, cheap, and my son never used it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Camcorder!!!","review":"It's a wonderful product and clear picture!

The author is clearly blinded by his ideology to actually paint a realistic picture of the Israeli-Palestinian relations. This is an incredibly oversimplified anti-Palestinian diatribe by an author who wants to paint the Palestinians in broad strokes as virulent anti-Semites hell-bent on the destruction of Israel, while the Israelis are innocent victims who never hurt a fly. The reality, of course, is far more nuanced and complicated. This book is so peppered with lies and distortions that the author quickly loses any and all of his credibility, and any truth he hopes to convey is lost among crude emotional appeals. If you want a balanced view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, read elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they make it","review":"Don't buy. Bad acting and senarios. Total disappointment.

Her framing of masochism is encapsulated in the legacy of antiquated theory, with seemingly no appreciation for the empancipatory science that created mental health reform around gay/lesbian identity. There is a lot written, both before and after, that offer a much more balanced and empowering view of BDSM. Her closing paragraph borders on sexual harassment...she reads like a bitter second wave feminist, too rigid to share diverse sexual voice and join the third wave. Not recommended, other than as an example of the stigma that still exists against BDSM within academia."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was very pleased with this seller and woul;d use them again","review":"I got everything that was promised (conditon and description) and it arrived well before the expected date given"},{"rating":"2","title":"So much cheaper than the bookstores!!","review":"Product was exactly as decribed!!

You'd have to read the entire book to realize this, however, so not a lot of people would catch the stunning lack of suspense and thrills and the inaccuracy of it being placed in the wrong category.I've heard a great deal of praise for Reichs' first novel, Deja Dead, and in retrospect I wish I had read it instead of this one because it sounds like it at least belongs in the suspense/thriller genre whereas this one is not even worthy of praise.If you don't like to get excited, or if your doctor has suggested you should lay off all excitement for a while, then THIS is your kind of book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up to Par","review":"Reichs usually writes a really good thriller, but this one falls absolutely flat. One feels like she dashed it off in a great hurry to meet a deadline and never got chance to revise her first draft. The characters are not well delineated and it is difficult for the reader to remember who is who [or to care] and the plot did not engage me at all.

There are bits in the end and the beginning worthy of the mature Sabatini; but not much happens in the middle, at least by his usual standards--he seems to be aiming for a different genre and audience.

Alas, even that strategy was frustrated, as only one of the murders is solved on the last tape. The writer's style is both pretentious and repetitious, a deadly combination. After we had heard \\"lugubrious\\" for the third time, the groans became audible, even above the traffic noise. The writer's obvious fascination with the styles, manners and customs of London in 1890 have led her to assume that all her readers are similarly inclined. For me, they got in the way of the story... constantly! I got the book/tapes from the local library, so it was free. It still wasn't worth the price.

These types of books are fun for kids, and provide a good source of topics for discussion while they go through the book. This one has a \\"let's find Pal\\" theme that is useful and educational, and there a good number of flaps, of different sizes, shapes and content.

Very thorough, covering the essential classical algebras, basic results on nilpotent and solvable Lie algebras, classification, etc. up to and including representations. Don't let the relatively small number of pages fool you; the book is quite dense, and so even covering the first 30 pages is a nice accomplishment for a student. Small caveat, the notation might be a bit confusing until you get used to it, but this is a common problem due to having both a Lie and a matrix product floating around, and is not a fault of the text. There is also a nice selection of exercises, between 5 and 10 per section.Highly recommended; every mathematician should know the basics of Lie algebras."},{"rating":"1","title":"dense and uninviting","review":"This is a typical mathematical monographwhich means it is densely written withalmost no examples. It's too bad sincethat makes decoding the text much moretime consuming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walking in a dream","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read, and to think, it was just a debut.

I usually don't re-read books and I've read this twice in the last 15 months. I can't wait to read his new novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressing but epic","review":"This is a great book. I won't pretend to state more eloquently the rave reviews it has received here and elsewhere.I did not know what to expect, and the book blind-sided me with a culture of which I knew little; however, the quality of writing and the fictional story that is developed so well are remarkable, and go beyond the learnings of the culture and geography. I found a new understanding of Muslims, but neither acceptance nor forgiveness for their lifestyle and belief. In some ways the book further galvanized me relative to the incredible threat humanity faces from these bottom-dwellers. Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read!","review":"It took about twenty pages for me to become fully engrossed in this novel, and then I was hooked. This is a beautiful and touching story; it made me cry, it made me angry- ultimately, it made me think.

Hosseini is a very talented author, eminently readable and engaging, and I look forward to more of his work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"This book tells an excellent story and gives a glimpse into the life of a boy growing up in Afghanistan. It provides an insight into the cultural and political situation in Afghanistan starting from the presoviet occupation to the talibans fundamentalist regime.Its an excellent story told through the voice of the main character and how he comes to terms with a mistake he made as a child, a mistake which follows him to adulthood.I would caution the reader in that the story is somewhat disturbing and depressing.The only reason I gave this book four stars as opposed to five is that I dont feel its well written. The writing style of the author is somewhat simplistic and I feel the book lacks somewhere in the area of character development. Other than that I would highly recommend this book for the great story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Feeling It","review":"I read this book with high expectations. I ended up being disappointed.While it is a work of fiction, I still found it to be overly unrealistic and hard to relate to any of the characters - especially the main character.It is a page-turner and can keep you interested. However, as a literary work and a story, I don't think it really has the glue to stick to anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why waste time on this rag?","review":"This book is terribly overrated. \\"Things Fall Apart\\" is a much better book, and shows everything that \\"Kite Runner\\" lacks.

Q&A (slumdog millionaire) is also a much better book than this dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"Overcome by the hype, and the fact that The Kite Runner was on the NYT's best seller list for so long, I started reading it. I must admit, I really enjoyed the first few chapters. I found the book was well-written, and the characters were clearly developed. What I particularly found interesting was the description of Afghanistan prior to the Soviet invasion. But about a quarter way through the book, the plot started becoming predictable and the prose started wearing thin. I was also becoming confused. I wasn't quite sure what statements the author was trying to make. Perhaps the book was longer than it should have been. Why was it successful? Maybe its success is a result of the politics the book represents rather than its value as fiction. In closing, it reminded me of the types of novels we had to read in high school English classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Hosseini's writing and am looking forward to reading his next book.

In The Kite Runner Khaled Hosseini gives us a touching story of two boys who are great friends until a tragic episode erodes their friendship.

I was hesitant to read this book because it sounded like a history of Afghanistan, but it is not.... He places facts in places and you don't realize it. Instead of having a chapter or paragraph about how the Taliban came in, he describes it in hidden spots.

I am a reader of non-fiction and biography. I cannot say what led me to \\"The Kite Runner,\\" but it was a great honor to read this book. It will be read, debated and digested for years. It is great literature. It is the most outstanding comtemporary fiction I have read in many years. There are 5-6 times where the story kicks the reader in the gut. It is very moving.I do not recommend \\"The Kite Runner\\" for the squeamish nor the very sensitive. It is a tough, violent book to read. I did not care for the profanity or the graphic violence, but current fiction often is much worse.Amir, Hussan and many of the other characters in the book will stick in my consciousness for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kite Runner","review":"An excellent book!

The powerful plot undulates, each twist met by a breathtaking turn later on in the story. The writing flows poetically, uncontrived, authentic. Each of the diverse characters is familiar to me, each one's behavior is true to his or her context. This book gave me insight into Afghanistan, past and present, and led me to look at the ghosts in my own past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fact and fiction meet genius....","review":"Although this may be a work of fiction, the war behind this book is very much a reality. This shows that war is not glamorous, that it's scars last for years and that the choices we make can have such long-lasting consequences we could never imagine. The two boys in Kite Runner have wealth in their own ways and in the end, I chuckled at how money really doesn't buy happiness. A very quick read that I would recommend to anyone who likes books that stay with you even after the final word is read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every US citizen should read this book","review":"Why?First because it's worth your time. This is one of the great ones.

Yes. Predictable? Always. A portrait of Afghanastan? I have not been there or even read much about it, but I have a hard time swallowing the story that your average Taliban is a religious hypocrite, a pedophilic rapist, AND a savage killer.The characters are like cardboard cutouts: thin, unrealistic, and often reused in slightly varying forms. If this is great writing, I better stop throwing away those pamphlets the Jehovah's Witnesses keep giving me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful","review":"After the poor boy called Hassan was raped by other \\"racist\\" boys, I finally stopped reading after 10 more painful pages of the book. It had become obvious that the rest of the book would be about that.I was excited to read this book because finally a Muslim (by name only??) wrote a Best seller about a predominately Muslim country and what a shame and disappointment it turned out that he would devote so much of his time to such a shameful plot.Unfortunately, I already bought Khaled's other book called Thousand Splendid Suns, but I am so disappointed with this one, I am contempating throwing the second book in the gabage before even opening the first page. And if you guessed rightly, yes, this one named The Kite Runner is going into our gabage bin!

And I can't say I read a lot of stories like this one. I did not like the narrator for being the way he was toward his underling \\"brother\\".Amir was quite the coward yet I continued to read his story and accept him-- flaws and all. And it was quite amazing how things grow and change throughout the expanse of the story. This is what great fiction is all about. I can't say it's perfect: there are some plot manipulations that seemed a bit convenient--especially in the last section. But all in all, this is a good read. And a moving story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable Sensationalism","review":"Usually, I am very sympathetic to young, aspiring writers who pull on their heritage to write about terrible situations around the world, but this is not a well-produced and well-thought out book. The villain is immensely hateable, pulling on all the Hitler/germanic (half) pedophiliac fears lurking in American culture, sadist, brutal and sensual. The love story converts the hero into a suppressed pedophile himself, and the recurring images try to hold together an otherwise predicatable story. I hope Hosseini can do better with his next work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fabricated","review":"Hosseini lost me when he had Amir go to a soccer game in Kabul while searching for his half nephew. This is supposed to be believable? It's obvious that he feels we don't know anything about the Taliban and he had to somehow work it into this book. I HATED the character Amir from the moment he left Hassam in that alley. To me this is more a pulp fiction novel than a story of redemption. The hokey ending was very difficult to swallow. I expected this novel to go someplace and it didn't. If you want to read a GOOD novel about the Taliban, Kabul and the cruelty of the men in that part of the world - I recommend you read BOOKSELLER OF KABUL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"What a huge disappointment.

This is the type of ridiculous, laughable plot that hollywood turns out over and over and over and over and over. I really don't need this simple-minded crap in the books i read. I got this book because of all the good reviews/blurbs i saw it got. come down to earth people. this childish plot is painted with two colors: black and white. no shades of grey here. this is cartoonish to the extreme and i am annoyed to have wasted two afternoons with this junior highschoolish drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the critics say it is ..","review":"The first few chapters were really good, but then the rest of the book just didn't deliver.

I was really disappointed after such a great beginning ...If I had to say something good, then it would be about the descriptions of the country and culture ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"With all the great reviews of this novel, I was very disappointed. If ever there was a book in need of a thorough editing, this is it! The beginning part of the book is very good, but it reads as if the entire middle part in the U.S. was added as filler, so the author could resolve the issues raised in the beginning. There are ridiculous details, such as Amir screaming over and over -- with his jaw wired shut?? The ending seemed totally unbelievable to me. He just happens to meet up with his nemesis from childhood? What a coincidence! The author obviously has some talent, but this reads like a first draft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total chick book","review":"Don't read this if you usually read Ludlum, Clancy, DeMille etc. I read it on a reccomendation from a female friend.

The style, voice is simply incredible. And that \\"The Bamboo Chest\\" is the memoir of an American teenager who split from college, took off for Thailand to be a photojournalist (even though he didn't even know how to use his cameras when he left) and became the first American political prisoner held by Vietnam since the end of the war answering a lot of questions about American MIAs, is amazing: a definite movie in the works I read in the New York Times!

Only a few travel books I've read have come close (Molavi's \\"Soul of Iran\\" and Macintosh-Smith's \\"Travels with a Tangerine\\") and most of the policy books are written by wonks who sit in their offices and opine about places they know little about and whose languages they dont speak.

Khaled Hosseini writes a poignant tale of friendship, betrayal, regrets, and above all else, love. He is capable of expressing in one sentence what many authors would use an entire paragraph to convey and that one sentence can have you in tears! I also got the audio book which was only more powerful emotionally as the author conveyed every feeling the characters had. Any avid book reader, no matter your preferred genre of reading, would classify this one as a \\"keeper.\\" Long after the last page has been turned, the characters will live in you, and you will cherish the insight this author has brought to a story done by anyone else would have been mundane and trite.

That this is Khaled Hosseini's first novel is nothing short of stunning. Once I started reading it, I could not stop and the end left me in tears. The Kite Runner is powerful, gripping, moving, and utterly amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing glimpse into Afghan life","review":"This is by far one of the best books I've read in a long time. Hosseini gives us an enthralling page-turner from the very beginning. I highly recommend this whenever someone asks me for a book suggestion. Even if you're not interested in learning more about how much the landscape of Afghanistan has changed in the past 30 years, the storyline alone is enough to propel this book to success. I can't wait to read Hosseini's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling Story","review":"I was engaged immediately by this book. The Kite Runner has a page turning plot and complex, interesting characters. The book is set in Afghanistan - a completely different world from our own. This book really made me think - as the characters are challenged in different situations, I asked myself, \\"what would I do?\\" By painting the different shades of grey that make decisions and actions difficult, the author really pulls you into the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting portrayal of Afghanastan, but weak in some areas","review":"This book gives a poignant and haunting look at one boy's youth in Afghanastan, showing the disparity among people in the class system. The book for me, falls apart a bit in the middle, when he moves to the U.S. - it just loses some of its luster and vivid imagery. Overall though, a thought provoking, emotional book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will make you cry in public...","review":"This book was a terrific read. It was very much like a \\"soap opera\\" like someone said, but in recently recounting the events of the past ten years of my life I said \\"wow, this sounds very much like One Tree Hill\\" so though we may be loathe to admit it, life can sometimes be quite dramatic so far me those aspects of the story do not diminish it's power. I liked the flawed narrator, how it was uncomfortable at times to read through him because he did things/said things that so many of us may do even though we don't want to. I loved the way he described a country that I had never been to in such loving detail and how I felt like it was ripped away from me too towards the end and felt a sharp sense of loss, that millions of people felt. The story is sad and universal, and I found myself once or twice wiping away tears as I read it on the train home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great book, but slightly incredulous","review":"I really enjoyed 95% of the story. Moving, troubling, I really did love the book.It did get a little bit of \\"what ELSE could POSSIBLY happen?!?!?!\\" near the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional read!!","review":"This unique book offers insights into a bygone time and place, yet the reader feels as if the story could be taking place today. This gives The Kite Runner universal appeal. It's not at all surprising that the novel has received great reviews.The characters are exceptionally well developed and make the reader feel very connected to the story. The author opens up corners of the heart which not many of us have the courage to look into. It's also amazing to find that a reader from the US or Europe could have such similar childhood memories as a boy from Afghanistan. What feelings of nostalgia suddenly grip the reader's heart!!The author shares many interesting observations about life and people, and the moral and spiritual lessons cleverly inserted into the story are worth rereading and remembering. Great find, worth sharing with all your friends!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than I'd hoped for","review":"I'm usually one to enjoy the written word, held in my hands. I've had bad experiences with audio books as either I don't care for the reader's voice, tone, inflections, or pacing, but after checking this book out of the library and having time getting into it, I decided to get the audio version. Glad I did. I was pleasantly surprised and found that I loved being read to, at least this particular book. I suppose my try on the audio version was due to the first time novelist's popularity and I plan to see the movie. Either way you slice it, can't go wrong with the audio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting background on life in Afghanistan; hokey, melodramatic plot","review":"The title of this review pretty much sums up where I stand. If you can borrow a copy, it's worth beginning this book. I very much enjoyed the back story, with its details of day-to-day life in Afghanistan in the 1970s and 1980s, before and after the Soviet invasion. I might be willing to read more non-fiction from Hosseini, but the man is no novelist. The plot is pure soap opera and gets more and more implausible (and irritating) as the book proceeds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I loved this book. It was so creatively written. Even though I have never seen Kabul I was able to envision the home where Amir lived. I pictured Amir and Hassan sitting in the tree, or sitting under the pomegranate tree where Amir and Hassan etched their names. I could picture Hassan running through the town chasing after the kite and the kite drifting down and into Hassan's waiting outstretched arms. The tale is heartwarming and heartbreaking, but in the end one learns about loyalty, love, forgiveness, and the gift of a child and family. This was a story I won't forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I purchased this book as a gift for my Grandson who is stationed in Afghanistan. I read this book about 4 years ago and it is one of the best books I have ever read. Although it is fiction, it does give you some perspective on the people of Afghanistan. It is about two boys growing up friends, one from a well off family and the other the son of an employee of the family. After reading this book, I immediately read Land of a Thousand Suns which offers the perspective of girls growing up in Afghanistan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book I love to give as a gift","review":"Every year there is maybe one book I wish I could give everybody to read, and this year, it is the Kite Runner. From a privileged childhood in Kabul, through migration to the United States and then a thoroughly harrowing return to Afghanistan under the Taliban, the book's protagonist is depicted as a flawed, human, real person. I look forward to this author's next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"After all of the accolades I had high hopes for this book. I'm always interested in discovering good new novels written by new authors.The beginning started out promisingly. The stories of young Amir and Hassan in Kabul are told in a very taut and interesting manner. Where the book falls apart is when Amir and his father move to America. Characters become cliches and stereotypes, and situations become predictable. If you can't figure out every \\"plot twist\\" 20 pages in advance, then you're a naive reader.Without giving away any of the plot, what happens later in the book when Amir returns to Afghanistan and Pakistan is just ridiculuous, and would make for a bad TV special. Everything is just too neat and tidy and resolutions come too easily.Hopefully we as readers can learn to appreciate writing which is much more complex and thoughtful than The Kite Runner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercial? Yes! Great? No!","review":"The prose is workmanlike but not distinguished, The plot is contrived and lapses into melodrama and the maudlin. Afghanistan is merely sketched as the novel's background. A Cliff-Notes tour of a country and its customs. The book is, however, a page-turner, thanks to its editing: bite-sized chapters, each of which ends on a note that encourages reading onward. Which pretty much defines many a modern best-seller. For a quick, non-demanding read OK. For more substantial fare, look elsewhere. I note that many reviewers here who lavish highest praise upon the novel are students and those whose reading range seems limited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reading!","review":"I had a hard time putting this book down! I found this book to be very interesting; I enjoy learning new things. I am looking forward to reading his next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you","review":"Thank you to the author for educating me. I know where afghanistaN is on the map now. I made an effort after reading this book to learn more about the war cur renting raging in the middle east. I feel for the people in that country and is grateful for my freedom here. I could not fathom their everyday torment and terror. This is a must read. I read every genre of books out there. But rarely do I walk away wanting to more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that...","review":"I put this book down truly wondering about its success. At this point, I feel like the only reason for its fame is because Westerners know so little about the featured cultures and religion. I thought it was average at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I have absolutely no idea why this book would be rated anything less than 5 starts - I simply could not put it down and thought about it all the time while reading it and after - I will remember this book, always! GREAT BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking...","review":"Amir and Hassan were close friends throughout childhood. Amir betrayed Hassan when he left him to be beaten by bullies. Even after emigrating to America and becoming a successful writer, Amir is haunted by this incident. When Amir hears that Hassan and his wife have been murdered during the Taliban takeover, he returns to his native Afghanistan to rescue Hassan's son. Amir arrives in Kabul and finds out that the boy has been enslaved by a Taliban official. Amir's quest to rescue Sohrab is full of dramatic plot twists and Amir learns much about himself and his family along the way.This is a novel that reads like a memoir. The characters are incredibly realistic and the details of life under the Taliban are chilling. I kept thinking about this book long after I turned the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another book every American should read","review":"A wonderful glimpse into a world that Americans know so little about. It is easy to be disconnected with South Asia and Islam, but for how much our government (and our tax dollars) have meddled with that part of the world we ought to find the time to read this extraordinary book. Khaled Hosseini offers an excellent opportunity to learn about the beauty of his ancestral country and religion while at the same time giving us a chance to understand some of the ugliness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"This book started off a little slow, so I wasn't sure I was going to stick with it. But after the first 1/4 of the book, you realize why there is so much detail and background. A very rich book that makes you feel as though you were there in Kabul in the 70s when things were moderately peaceful (or at least intact). What a great ending too! Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A deep and emotional read!","review":"This is a great book for young adults everywhere. It's an awesome and powerful story that really gets you thinking. The story tells the story a boy growing up in Afghanistan. The story moves pretty fast and you have to pay attention or you'll miss something. This fiction/drama is full of twists and surprises. It also teaches you about Afghani customs and traditions. Learning the customs and traditions is especially important because of all that's going on in that part of the world right now.Khaled Hosseini did a great job of portraying the Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. And I cannot emphasize that enough. This book has some content that might not be appropriate for really young ages but is still perfect for high school aged students. I hope that people will read this book because this book actually has some meaning behind it and you can learn a lot from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly moving.","review":"I've had this book on my nightstand for a couple of years, but for whatever reason, I never felt I wanted to read it. Then, last week, I ran out of books to read and decided to start reading the \\"Kite Runner\\". I can't believe I didn't read this book years ago. This book was so moving. I couldn't put it down. I can't even put my thoughts into words (unlike the author) about my deep feelings for this book. It's an incredible story of love, loss, hope, devastation, redemption. I didn't want it to end. I can not wait for his next novel. Please write another one soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Briliant","review":"Hosseini's writing is exquisite literature and also maintains a completely authentic voice akin to the spoken story. You hear him as well as read him. His story is sad and redemptive, compounded of love, betrayal and ultimately forgiveness. I loved this book and have recommended it to friends and readers who could recognize the difference between the pop novel, the equivalent of shlock tv, and the kind of book that not only speaks of change, but generously leaves its readers poised for continued growth. This is my favorite book in many months, and I read a lot. I taught writing; I've written book reviews for the Boston Globe. If you like fiction that gives access to real life, read Kite Runner. This is how it's done."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intense Drama","review":"You won't be able to put this book down. It's tragic and heart wrenching at times. But an eye opener, written with deep humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"What a powerful story, told with dignity, honesty, and heart! The pain of the years of tragedy in Afghanistan is told through the eyes of very human people, and yet is told with grief and redemption. It is one of the best books I have read in a long, long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites!","review":"I won't go on and on about what this book is about, but I will say that it I just finished it and I loved it and had to add my review to the others here. If this sounds like something you are interested in, I very highly recommend this book. In the back of the paperback version I read, it says that author Khaled Hosseini's next book is due next summer. I can't wait for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read in years","review":"This is a beautiful, compelling, raw story. The story is wonderful, and it's so well written. I wept several times, especially at the end. I can't believe this is Mr. Hosseini's first novel. He is brilliant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very moving, Great First Book","review":"Bravo to Khaled Hossaini. I feel that this is a remarkable debut effort for the author. He is able to connect the reader with the history of Afghanistan, without objectifying the Afghani people and culture. In addition, he brings amazing insight into how the Afghanistan has transformed into its present state.With that said, the books is deserving of another set of editors. There are too many artificial cliffhangers, created by the sudden ending of chapters. In the end the book becomes predictable, because of it.I look forward to more of this author's work. He is very talented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me people?","review":"After hearing/ reading the glowing reviews for this book I couldn't wait to read it. What a huge let down. Cliched, formulaic ....before reading it I thought this book would really educate me as to the culture and the reality of living in Afghanistan during the period covered -- no such luck. The story could be set anywhere, so little insight was shown. Wow, I can't believe 99% of the reviews are 5 star. I didn't give it one star because it's not the worst book I have ever read...but really, definitely a big letdown after all the hype"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and enthralling","review":"One of the best books I've read. A picture of Afganistan from a very personal viewpoint, a heartrending tale of friendship, and tragedy with a light at the end of the turnnel. Superb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Human connectivity","review":"We are living in a global community of shared experience and the more diversity, the better. This wondrous novel engaged me so thoroughly and so movingly--for its fascinating conveyance of a culture that is so completely unlike America's--and that's only one reason I recommend.I ,too, though, found that the first half was far more compelling than the latter, being that certain \\"coincidences\\" seemed a tad convenient>>this is still a worthy and credible read. For the father-son element, for what we--as humans--hold in common: our spirits.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"the kite runner","review":"The kite Runner is a amazing book that is about Afghanistan before and after the Taliban take over. It talks about two boys, who are from different social background, but nevertheless they before friends. Then something horrible happens, and they no longer are Friends. When Amir and his father have to flea Afghanistan they come to America and leave t here for many years. Years later Amir goes back to Afghanistan and then learns how his friend, Hassan, is doing. Later he learns that his friend has died, leaving behind a young son. Amir runs into trouble when he wants to bring the boy back to America. When he they do get to America the boy does not talk.The Kite Runner shows the growth of the Afghanistan from a time of innocence to a time of killings and the Taliban taking over the counrtry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great first half - Horrible second half","review":"I bought this book because of all the hype - many people told me about it and what a great read it is. When I started reading it seemed to answer my expectation: a taste of a different time and place and a view of Afghanistan before wars turned it into what it is today. Well, without revealing the plot, when the book reaches the turning point something weird happens - it turns into the most two-dimensional, hole ridden, not surprising 'surprises' laughable garbage I read in years... I mean, how can such an engaging story turn into such total crap? The last 100 pages or so are a real straggle - you'll be laughing and crying but for the wrong reasons - laughing at the ridicules plot twists and crying over your valuable lost time. So if you have to, rent it and read the first half or so - when you fill it's starting to sink bail out."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor writing; painful to read","review":"The book started off alright, but pretty quickly it became clear that the author lacked skills for portraying psychological and emotional depth of his characters. In the second half, he seems to completely give up even trying. It reads like it's a child writing--very shallow and schematic. As lots of reviewers point out, the author relies on cliches way too often. As a result, it becomes almost painful to follow all the \\"coincidences\\" and read dialogues in which all characters sound the same. I feel this book does a disservice to Afghanistan and its people by turning everything into cliches. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I read this book with a book club and it was an amazing book. Very thoughtful and unbelievable sad at times. Has tons of material for discussions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves more than *just* 5 stars...","review":"This book has been reviewed a thousand times over and I just had to include a short note as well. I read this book several months ago and scenes from it still keep popping in my head at random times. No book has ever affected me as much as this one did. Beautiful, tragic, hopeful...it has it all. My only wish is that I could give it more than 5 stars, as this gorgeous book is worth more. A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My second amazing read by Khaled Hosseini","review":"The author is a true story teller. Every word on every page breathing life into the tale, the characters. Khaled Hosseini has the ability to turn places and objects into characters: Kabul, the kite.The Kite Runner is a story of family and how the perception and realities of it change as we grow. It is about friendship. And it is about guilt. How guilt can take away so much of you if you do not learn to forgive yourself.Hosseini' s stories are the kind you insist the the next generation read, too, so that the story is not forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the Kite Runner","review":"enjoyed this book very much, when i first started reading it I didn;t think I was going to enjoy it, but after the first chapter I could not put it down"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Tricks","review":"This is 2.5 star book. I gave it a 1 to balance out the disproportionate share of 5 star reviews.After all I had heard about this book, it was a big disappointment. I would not recommend anyone read this book, there are many better books to be read.I enjoyed having a pictures of Afghanistan and Pakistan, countries I know little about. The story is engaging and moves quickly. If it were a journal, I would find it improbable, but like it more. As fiction, its full of \\"cheap tricks\\" : gratuitous violence, rape, pedophilia, and other plot divices to titilate the masses. The story also has many improbable ridiculous coincidences.The fact that is is set in Afghanistan and is anti Taliban I am sure goes a long way to giving it the 5 star reviews and press it received."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful story of two boys growing up together","review":"This book is a wonderful story of two boys growing up together as friends in Afghanistan and their lives into manhood. It is a heartbreaking tale of the twists and turns their lives take. I could not put the book down and am enthralled with the author,Khaled Hosseini, and the details of human life he brings to his writing. I have already read his second book, \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" and must say it is as fine a piece as the first. Neither should be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book that Changed My Life","review":"I tried reading this book a year ago and just couldn't get into it. I kept hearing from friends how much they liked it so I gave it another try. I couldn't put it down. Hosseini is truly a gifted writer and opened up my eyes and my heart to a whole new world. Read his other book, \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns,\\" it is wonderful as well.Kudos to you, Khaled!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book!","review":"What a great book!

You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"This book had me interested from the beginning. Such and awesome story that really takes you there. Definitely worth every penny I spent on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls apart 3/4 way through","review":"Due to incessant hype and a friend's recommendation, I read the book. At first I found it a compelling read - especially descriptions of Afghanistan before the Russians, and the inter-relationships betweent he narrator and his boyhood friend, family, his transition to living in the States, etc. BUT - when the narrator returns to Afghanistan, the story loses all credibility. The plot becomes an overwrought and turgid soap opera, full of eye-rolling coincidences and a cheesy villan out of a silent movie. Like a bad Hollywood script, into which I'm sure it's already being developed.It went from being a book I couldn't stop reading to a book I didn't want to finish. It's mindless popularity and critical accolades says more about the sorry state of American fiction and publishing than the sorry state of Afghanistan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A contrived soap opera set in a fascinating culture.","review":"The Kite Runner has some admirable features; however, compelling story-telling is not one of them. The descriptions of Afgan culture and society, before, during, and after the Taliban, are the novel's only redeeming features. The story line reads like it was written by a bright high school student. It uses the worst, most transparent plot devices and cliches. I laughed out loud at several of the most predictable points in the book, and believe me, this is no comedy. I think that too many of the reviewers here are being generous because of the very worthwhile descriptions of Afgan culture, one that we Americans ought to know a lot more about than we do. As a work of literary art, this book fails in some very obvious and compelling ways. No committed reader of fiction could take the plot seriously, but it still might be worth your time if only for the cultural dimension alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A View of Afghanistan through a Changing Friendship","review":"The Kite Runner follows the life of Amir, a wealthy boy living in Afghanistan, as his country changes under the Taliban. However, rather than giving objective accounts of Afghanistan under the rule of the Taliban, Hosseini focuses in on the Afghan tradition of flying kites and combines it with the political history of Afghanistan to allow readers to experience the story at a more emotional level. Hosseini's story begins with the childhood friendship that develops between Amir and Hassan, the servant of Amir's father. As they grow older though, a life-altering event takes place. The relationship between the two boys distorts and later, ceases to exist, only to be revived by an astonishing turn of events - all told in Hosseini's powerful language and vivid imagery. Ultimately, as readers watch Amir and Hassan's relationship bend and break, they also see Afghanistan warped by the Taliban."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illustrated Edition Not Worth the Extra Money","review":"Let me begin by stating that I love \\"The Kite Runner\\". When I got an email notice from Amazon that a newer edition with illustrations was available I contemplated spending quite a bit more money since I loved the story so much. Luckily, I didn't buy it. The photos add nothing to the original story that makes this version worthwhile. I highly recommend the book, but don't waste your money on the illustrated version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the faint of heart...","review":"I loved this book! Although a tough subject at times. It leaves you feeling hopeful. The characters are extraordinary. The story beautiful. I finished it feeling enlightened and unable to stop thinking about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"I was a little leary of reading this book because I didn't know if I would be able to get into this book. I wondered how could it possibly live up to all of the hype....I was wrong! This is probably going to be the best book I'll read all year long.With so many plot twists and turns it's hard to put this book down. The characters are one's you'll come to care about. From beginning to end I enjoyed this book. It tells an amazing story of life filled with courage and heartache, about finding yourself and trying to make some sense out of the meaning of things. It's about loyalty and betrayal and friendship and the unfairness between the classes. There's something for anyone to relate to in this novel.A++ I will definitely be recommending this book to friends and can't wait to read A Thousand Splendid Suns!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"This is not for the timid, nor is it for those only looking for a nice liesurely read. It is compelling, hard-hitting and gripping. A very satisfying read from start to finish. Especially the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could not put the book down","review":"Yes, I read it at one sitting, which tears running down my cheeks during much of it. The novel for starters is very well crafted structurally, with its themes weaved through the story with great skill and insight. The characerters are well formed, and oh so three dimensional, and compelling, the descriptions of life in Kabul, and of the Afghan community in the Bay area, magnificient, and ah the writing, the writing. It soars like a kite! The book is simply splendid in every way. As another reviewer stated, it is right up there as one of the best, if not the best, novels that I have ever had the pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the type of book I thought I'd like","review":"A friend of mine insisted on me reading this. I felt hostile to the subject matter at first. As the book went on I found myself entranced. It is an extremely good read. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book broke my heart","review":"As a mother of two little boys, it made me ache and hurt to know some people can be so cruel. I felt the pain of these young boys in Afghanistan. Sometimes I just wanted to slap Amir for not standing up for his friend. I was also, very upset in a way for Baba but he should have seen how much his son Amir wanted his attention. Beautiful Hassan I just wanted to hold this poor kid for the life he was dealt noone should ever have the right to ever touch a child like the bullies did to them. Then what was even harder was to know that poor little Sohrab suffered in some ways the same as his father. This book gave you a glimpse of what happens in Afghanistan not only the good but the bad also. Very good book, had to read something happy after this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"but I will say its a very good book. It was recommended by someone and I'm glad to add it to my library. Can be a bit trite here and there but does a good job of showing how other cultures differ from the West."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book!","review":"When I ordered this book I was a little skeptical. It was way out of my comfort zone as I don't usually read something like that. But I was interested. I'm certainly glad that I did order it. It was full of insight and information about a country that, today, holds great fear and hostility in the hearts of the world. If you are wondering what Afghanistan was like BEFORE the Taliban took over, read this. You will be suprised. Who knew walnut trees grew there?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kite runner book","review":"This book arrived quickly and as described. I really enjoyed reading this book. It really brought home the idea of living through war and how it uproots families. Really when we get down to it we are all alike and most of us want the same things for our families. Cultural differences aside. there are beasts everywhere and there are gentle peace loving people everywhere. Even peace loving people sometimes must take a stand for what they love!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is the kind of story that you're sad to see end. You feel like you know the characters and, on the last page, you feel like your saying goodbye to old friends. Still, its a hopeful ending to a wonderfully written story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written","review":"This book was beautifully written... I was on a plane to Vegas and had planned to sleep since I was taking a red eye, but once I opened this book, I couldn't book it down. The story engrosses you from page 1. Love, friendship, racism, death, responsibility, forgiveness... all captured with elegance and honesty. Please note that the book is an easy read. Do not be put off by the challenging topics that it explores. You will enjoy reading this book and won't be able to put it down till you are done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-rending","review":"The most heart-wrenching book I have ever read. Superbly but unobtrusively crafted, it a story of love, betrayal, guilt and redemption in the context of modern Afghanistan - from the time before that unhappy country was plunged into chaos until the time of Karzai. The personalities above all; the portrayal of Afghan society at its best and at its worst, both at home and in the diaspora; the picture of the war-torn country - all these are quite unforgettable. The author is an Afghan refugee living in America, and one suspects a strong autobiographical element."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, not great","review":"I very much enjoyed the cultural perspectives in this book. I thought that some of the plotting was over the top, and the writing, melodramatic. The characterizations and character development were done very well. I would give this book 3 1/2 stars if I could, but since I can't, I give it 4 because it opens a window onto a world rarely seen by; white western readers, and this in itself is very valuable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and ultimately hopeful","review":"This moving book is not for the faint of heart. Horrible things happen to many of the characters. But it gives you an insight into the troubled, tragic history of Afghanistan. While overall there is a sense of sadness, the ending feels like a redemption. I didn't come away from it feeling totally bummed out, but I did feel pretty solemn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Much more raw and intense than I expected- a few very explicit/graphic sexual and violent scenes... Interesting to say the least, but NOT for the faint-hearted. I would not recommend if you get nightmares..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book hit the whole gamut of emotions.....wonderful read!","review":"It took me all of two days to read this book. It was one of those ones I couldn't put down once I started it and then when I was done I couldn't stop talking about it. Great book that I would recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A haunting glimpse of the human soul","review":"This is a heavy, depressing novel about two young Afghan boys grwoing up in the 1970s. There are scenes of total brutality that made my stomach turn. I cried several times. But past the human cruelty presented in the book, past the Taliban terror and the horror of war, is a story about a boy fighting for his father's love and for his own redemption, and the end of the novel is filled with hope. Wonderful book, can't recommend it enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I bought this book three years ago and it has been in my book shelf since then. I have no idea why I never read it. When I noticed it sitting there in my book shelf, I decided to read it. And I couldn't put it down. The story was beautiful. It was full of friendship, love, tragedy, redemption, forgiveness and adventure. It was powerful and brought me to tears more then once.I know that many have said this before me, but this book is a classic. I know that it will be read, and treasured for many years to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"I would never have chosen this book myself, But it was a gift. What a great read. The story was so well written, I couldn't put it down.I wish the story went a little further. It felt like someone ripped out the last ten pages.Overall ... I would recomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read!","review":"Keep in mind that I'm ADD so it takes a lot for a book to keep my attention...that being said...simply put, this book is wonderful!There were parts in the book that seemed to drag on a bit. but overall, there were many things that kept me interested. There were even parts of the book that made my heart stop. It was that good!There are also a lot of great quotes which make you think. I really enjoyed the glimpse into afghani culture that this book provided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I just finished reading this beautifully written novel and like most reviewers here, I was completely and utterly enthralled from start to finish. My husband urged me to read it, then watched as I devoured the book in a few hours, unable to put it down. I laughed, cried-- sobbed uncontrollably is more like it-- and ultimately exclaimed that this is simply one of the most touching and haunting stories I've ever come across. \\"Must Read\\" is an understatement. It will change you. It will stay with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it but I hated it","review":"I know that this was a very well written novel as it is still haunting me 8 months later. It was very real, and I could not put the book down. However, I cried and cried while reading this book as the course of events are devastating. I still cry about it and in retelling the story, I can only picture the violence and unfairness that takes place in this book. I don't recommend you read this book if you're a new mother, as I am, as imagining what could happen to your own child is enough to make you sick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read in a long time","review":"This book is a wonderful book about friendship, deception, fear and redemption. As for all those negative reviews, this book is a work of fiction, and not a historical or political review of Afghanistan. If you want to read a good piece of fiction, it's a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overated and underwritten","review":"I read this book after so many of my friends insisted it was the their best read this year. What a disappointment. The simplistic and shallow characters follow a horribly contrived plot with the seeming goal of manhandling your emotional state into one of forced sympathy for a protagonist you never liked anyway! The narrator frequently mentions how bad it is to use cliches, but this book is chock full of them. Don't feel bad about skipping this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"I am generally very sympathetic to young, aspiring writers who venture to write about tragic events around the world, but this is not a very well-thought-out book. The predictable love story converts the hero into a repressed pedophile as the recurring images try to hold together an otherwise lackluster story."},{"rating":"1","title":"First part of the novel, awesome; Second part...","review":"As said in another review, the first part of this book is interesting and describes Afghanistan well. After a few chapters it just feels like the writer didn't know what else he could write and started writing anything to fill the pages. In my opinion, most people said this is a good book only because they heard other people saying the same thing. The Kite Runner woulld definitely have made a great short story if it would've been only three chapters long, beacause the rest of is totally dissapointing. It becomes tragic and tedious. If I'm giving this book a two-star review it's only because I really enjoyed the first part. My advice, if you buy it, read until the part where Hassan and his father go away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable, No really, ludicrous.","review":"Don't read this book if you're a fan of literature. And if you're looking for something about real life in Afghanistan try non-fiction like The Bookseller of Kabul. Having said that, this is a very exciting and readable novel about the lives of some fictional Afghanis before and after the Taliban took over. It's severely marred though by broadly-drawn characters, cliched plotlines, and worse: by extreme coincidences that would shame a Hollywood screenwriter. I don't mind that kind of thing in a book that is clearly superficial but when an author is writing about a real time when tragedy and difficulties befell a great deal of real people, I find it more than a little unseemly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we have another twist of the plot?","review":"Here is woe. And more woe. And the person who started the woe, a childhood bully, grows up to put the whole society in woe. Wow."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an overrated book","review":"Let me put it this way: If Stephen King or Deane Koontz decided to write a suspense/horror novel set in Afghanistan with an all-Afghan cast of characters and really did their homework on Afghan language and culture, the end result probably would not look too different from _The Kite Runner_. There's nothing wrong with that; I like a good suspense thriller as much as the next guy. But I expected a somewhat higher form of literature with this book and was disappointed. I guess one man's Pulitzer Prize material is another man's pulp fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Vivid writing, and descriptions of pure love (nonromantic) that brought tears to my eyes. Melencholy and touching."},{"rating":"1","title":"guilt amongst the book club gang","review":"This book is not very good. Defensive writing, tiresome coincidences ( random character conveniently works at INS), an evil half-german, child rape (the rapist gets punished, dont worry), dull characters (except the narrator's father). Dr. Hosseini's remarkable success with this work (top 20 in Amazon) is either a testament to his shrewdness or to the guilt weighing down the chattering classes that read such writing at their book clubs."},{"rating":"1","title":"over-wrought, over-interpreted, over-rated","review":"A real page turner that doesn't hold up to scrutiny. It relies too much on coincidence. Also, the author doesn't trust the readers enough to draw their own conclusions. Rather, the author amateurishly tells us how to interpret the scenes. (Note for example how many times the narrator ends the chapter with some prophetic line like, \\"This was the last time I would laugh because my world was soon turned inside out\\").The climactic scene in which the author liberates the son of his friend from the clutches of the mein-kampf-reading villain is laughable. Of all the houseboys in Afghanistan to sodomize, how likely is it that he would seize upon the son of his childhood victim? Or that, in the fracas, the narrator would receive his own hair-lip? And if you didn't get the symbolic wounding, the author feels compelled to point out that now he, too, has his own scar. p-lease."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre and poorly written fast food.","review":"This man should first attend an english class on 'cliche' before pelting them at us so savagely - so relentlessly. I was in a constant state of painful literary paroxism. I had to read this, I was verily forced to read this for one of my fiction-writing classes, and I was thoroughly disturbed by the combination of lack luster writing (it's said to be 'spare', but more properly one would call it talentless)and high praise. The fact that it has more than its share of 'script' moments, scenes that would be more enjoyable on screen than in a book, is a testament to its indolent abuse of letters.I read the equivalent of one modern novel every other day and with all the wonderful literature to choose from I would save my resources for something of value, perhaps a classic. This is rubbish, and that's why it's popular."},{"rating":"2","title":"had too high of expectations","review":"A good book, not as good I was expecting. Maybe the book was \\"too hyped\\" with such glowing reviews, that I had been expecting too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing Up in Afghanistan","review":"This painful story paints a vivid picture of life in Afghanistan. The characters are dynamic and the story moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought provoking","review":"While it was a pretty quick read, it was also very thought provoking and many of the scenes stayed with me. The main character is someone you don't always really like, yet you want to know what will happen next, and the story moves quickly enough to keep you reading while still allowing enough time to develop the key characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book of hope","review":"The is not just a beautifully written book, not just a riveting and often wrenching story, but a book of hope. The image of Afghanistan in so many peoples minds is one of a fearsome desert, hellish mountain ranges, hordes of marauding barbarians and a total and eternal sense of hopelessness. That is western media for you.I have read Afghan history before and know that is simply not the case. This book more than any other shows how Afghanistan once was, and perhaps how it could be again. It's so personal and though viewed through a set of privileged eyes, it offers a ray of hope. Inshallah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very easy and fast read. Would make a good early High School book","review":"For those who don't like to read, this books is a simple formatted book at the 6th grade level. I thought the story was great and it makes for a great discussion. I would recommend it simply because its a fun-fast read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid images","review":"Provokes vivid pictures of a Afghanistan long forgotten and that which truly exists in today's world. At times disturbing, I found the book to be fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book","review":"Wonderful book. If you're interested at all in the 'War' and life in the trenches for our troops, this is a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moved me to tears.","review":"I read this book a while back and loved it. I know it is fiction but it left me in tears. The loss of Amir's innocence, Hassan's friendship, the family livelihood and human life in general was too much. The author's writing is so captivating that it made me feel as if I was there. It was also good to learn how Afghanistan used to be before the Taliban. I had to rush and read his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good reading","review":"Although the story was difficult emotionally and heartbreaking, it is well written and very interesting...I would recommend it as well as another book by the author--A Thousand Splendid Suns"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kite Runner: a short review","review":"The setting of this novel helps to keep you reading. The unique relationships enhance the tale. The book is very descriptive of the culture, landscape, and history of the region. Most foreign terms are explained in the context of the story. An interesting read even if the ending is rather abrupt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never thought I would read this kind of book","review":"Honesty this book was bought for a college course. At first I didn't enjoy reading it because it's not the type of books I would have interest in. But farther on into the story, it got more interesting. Overall I did enjoyed reading this book because it slowly pulls you into the story. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"All about friendship.;","review":"I would not dream of giving any of this story away but wanted to add my very favorable comments. It was extremely interesting and I was not able to put it down until the last page. Even then, I was wishing for more pages. Hope this writer will continue. Read the book on vacation in Hawaii as did a lot of other people and we would stop and compare notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tear Jerker!","review":"I can't count the amount of times I was holding the tears back to keep from balling. Such a powerful story about sin, guilt, betrayel, and forgiveness. It's unbeleivable how the emotions toil page after page from anger to hatred to sadness and even love. This is brutal, there is no doubt, but it is a must read for anyone who appreciates humanity and the power of love."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"I read this book before it really became a bestseller. It was the first book I ever read away from my ususal love story. I thought I needed to \\"broaden my horizons\\" and so I did. WOW, did I! It was great! Now I read all kinds of genre. Highly recommend this book. Good look at how others live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good.","review":"Intense and very interesting story. I enjoyed the writing style and was captivated by the characters. Well worth reading. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was that it is a difficult story to \\"enjoy\\" due to the subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in a very long time. I could not put it down!!! I found myself relating to each character in a very personal way...the emotions they felt I experienced too. As soon as I finished this book I turned right around and purchased Mr. Hosseini's second novel, \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns.\\" I am hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"I could not put this book down - this is a beautiful story. My eyes are tearing up just thinking out Hassan the harelipped kite runner. The first half and the ending is excellent! There are a few pages where the story may seem to drag, but keep going it is well worth it. Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a 5","review":"This book is hard to put down. Hosseini's characters are interesting, flawed and believable. I loved this book until the last few chapters. The means to redemption for the main character comes at the expense of believability. Too many coincidences, too many forced forced and contrived circumstances. But I still enjoyed it and think Hosseini is a talented writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Moving Story","review":"I really enjoyed listening to the book of tape of The Kite Runner. The story is very moving, as you follow Amir's life in Afghanistan and then on to the US. He has a deep secret regarding his best friend- and this secret is very sad and touching.What I liked best about this novel is that it showed me another culture that I would not normally be exposed to. I feel I learned about the people of Aghanistan by reading this novel.The author read the book on tape, and he did a great job. It was very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly amazing, brilliant novel","review":"This novel is undoubtedly the best I have ever read. The Kite Runner follows the life of its protagonist Amir from his childhood in Afghanistan, to his immigration to the United States as a teenager, and finally, his return to his war torn, devastated homeland for redemption. This book is magnifacent. Similairly to how Ibsen's A Dolls House or Camus's The Stranger are read by high school students across the country, expect Kite Runner to be read by students in another 5 or 10 years. Kite Runner is a stunning debut from the brilliant Khaled Hosseini."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing insight to a different world...yet the same","review":"If you're interested in finding out what goes on in a personal level over in the middle east, this book will certainly not dissappoint. It was interteresting to find out about customs and that the country at some point was a happy place to be. It helped me understand the attrocities from the perspective of someone who's been there and gone through it. In the beginning, the names made it difficult to read, but after getting into the plot, I could hardly put the book down. After reading the book, I found that it wasn't just about learning about the culture differences, but that people are the same, around the world, with the dynamics of the family. Would certainly read more by the author and not be scarred off by the names this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"First half was fascinating but the narrator's return to Afganistan was contrived-- like a hollywood movie. The half german, Taliban leader was an ill conceived character who is laughably evil. Ironies abound.Nothing rings true. Don't believe the hype. This book is strictly for people who consider subtlety boring and 'Crash' high art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme a break","review":"Unfortunately, I have a terrible habit of being unable to leave a book unfinished. This was especially painful with The Kite Runner, a gift from my inlaws. Though I enjoyed the timeliness of the cultural content, and the perspective of an immigrant Afghani, I was horrified at the quality of the writing. I am even more horrified at the number of people who believe that this is good writing.Stock characters, unbelievable plot turns, and pure melodrama populate this novel. I groaned audibly every time a came across another cliche (every ten pages or so), and couldn't even connect with the the caricatures that passed for characters. The second half was definitely more enjoyable (in the pulp fiction sense), but by that time I had accepted what I would need to endure to get to the end.All that said, I liked the ending. I expected the melodrama to continue, but it was surprisingly even-handed. Or maybe I was just glad it was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much stringing along","review":"The only saving grace for this novel is that it provides, during the first half at least, an interesting insight into life in Afghanistan prior to the Taliban's regime. I have no way of knowing how accurate this insight is but I take it on faith that it is reasonably so. Aside from this Hosseini's novel is far too contrived and manipulative for my liking. The author cynically uses one cliché after another to advance the unconvincing story. He seeks, unashamedly, and at every predictable plot turn, to elicit an emotional response from the reader. I also found Hosseini's writing style to be rather hackneyed and unimaginative. I wish I could be more positive, but frankly I'm amazed that such a formulated work has garnered such widespread praise."},{"rating":"1","title":"The brutal sexual exploitation of one boy by another boy","review":"This book was very favorably reviewed by the literary press. I found it sophomoric. The author relies on the old, old hack formula of trying to shock his readers to the extent that they will consider his work avant-garde 'literature.' Too bad, because the story could have offered interesting insights into another culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perplexing effort","review":"I am perplexed at the acclaim and popular attention that this debut novel has received. The setting is very vivid and fresh, but the story sags and appears to read as if one was pulling mundane details from a diary. The novel tilts much too far to the descriptive, to the point where the writer himself fails to fully understand how far he has ventured into meaningless structure. One sentence just threw me for a loop and made me wonder if the critics were actually reading a different, better written edition of the novel. The beginning of one chapter starts, (I'm going from memory here, but the clumsiness is accurate), \\"The dress she was wearing was a green dress.\\" Ah, this is high literature? Some of the other prose isn't far off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful moving book","review":"I picked this up while being deployed in AfghanistanI think every soldier should read it.It is a powerful and moving story about growing up in Afghanistan and going over to America.There were a lot of heart wrenching moments.I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only worth half the money","review":"When I first started reading it, I thought I was reading something truly special. Compelling and absorbing, beautifully written, it was a book I didn't want to put down. But maybe a bit less than half way through, I thought the author lost his inspiration and drive. It was like he was just fabricating things to fill out the book and get it finished. It went from being deep and rich to being shallow and dull. Very frustrating and disappointing after such a promising start. I gave it the second star for the wonderful writing it started with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilt, Love, Forgiveness (From America to Afghanistan)","review":"This is a wonderful book. We read this book in my book club this month and not one person said a negative word about it.The author takes a subject extremely familiar to him: lovely Afghanistan in the 60's and early 70's, to the Russians invading, to fleeing to America, to returning to Afghanistan to find the Taliban in control. Also familiar to the author is the difference between certain classes of people in Afghanistan.Hosseini took all of these topics and wrote a touching and beautiful novel out of them. He begins with a moral dilemna and a search to redeem himself. This search takes him from Afghanistan to America and back.Bottom line: Great first book for Hosseini. I anxiously await his next. Good book club book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a phenomenal book","review":"This is a fabulous story, beautifully written and well conceived. The characters are ones which stay with you. I liked it as much as East of Eden by John Steinbeck, one of my all time favorites. Why didn't think book win the pulizer prize or a booker prize? Go figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome human story","review":"This is the best book I've read in a very long time...human, involving, emotional....I couldn't put it down but I didn't want it to end either. Anyone who doubts the need to stamp out terrorism should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kite Runner","review":"This was an extraordnary book--fiction, but based on real life. There is a lot to be learned about a culture that is very different from ours, but surprisingly modern."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous human story","review":"A novel that proves across all cultural lines, underneath it all, we are the same.Khaled Hosseini has put together a gripping tale of a family that grows up in the politically torn nation of Afghanistan. Like many great stories, Hosseini weaves in the turmoil of everyday life under the Russian occupation and the hell of Taliban into the story, all the while the fabric, heart and soul are ripped from the country and it's people.The tale is at its best when the writer puts you in the land of his childhood which seems like an idyllic place to grow up and the main character's relationship with his best friend. As the story unfolds, your heart goes out to the people of Afghanistan who were vitimized by the events of the past three decades in their country. At its core Kite Runner is a human story that educates the layman about a war torn country that has garnered a ton of media attention over the past 4 years.A truly great story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving, educational...sad but worthwhile...","review":"There are a few flaws in this first novel by a California doctor who grew up in Afghanistan, such as a couple of coincidences late in the book which strain belief, and a couple of instances of behavior on the part of its main character which seem too out-of-character for him. However, the good far outweighs the weak spots. It is a morality tale above all other considerations, and could have been set in any country or any time period. However, the depiction of life in Kabul in the '60's and 70's was surprising and fascinating. The country's woes under the Russians in the 80's and the Taliban in the '90's are better known than the more positive situation which dominated the two earlier decades. I am usually not very interested in novels about other cultures, but this one kept me hooked all the way through. It deserves the sales and respect being accorded to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I see things under a different light after this book.","review":"Although the ending was a little bit sappy, the book as a whole was great. The story line was extremely interesting and learning about the lives of some of these families eased some of the 9/11- fear..anger..whatever the emotion that has been imbedded in my mind. I now realize that many of the families left their \\"highly-respected\\" jobs and lifestyles to come here and start over - taking any job, jobs that our high school children wouldn't lower themselves to take, just to have the freedom and safty for their family. It made me wonder how much of our \\"status\\" we would give up for freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid","review":"This book was an adventure, it had emotion, success, failure and the simplicity of love that everyone wants to experience in their lives. It also gives an inside view to what it feels like to grow up in a culture which we are so far removed from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not an avid reader, but ended up loving this book","review":"I hate reading books, but had to read this book in English 102 class. I really was not looking forward to it, but I found myself reading beyond the assigned chapters! I had a hard time putting this book down. It is well written which makes it easy to read. It really is agood book, and I loaned it to my mother-in-law (she is an avid reader) and she agrees with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful book!","review":"I truly enjoyed this story, it is one of my favorite reads.

It is Romeo and Juliet, it is the Sharks and the Jets, it is the \\"haves and have nots\\".. it is a heart wrenching lovely love story. It is about secrets and guilt and redemption and confession. This book is non-stop emotion, even as you read the last page. I have recommended it to many."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book for Our Time","review":"Kipling said that Afghanistan is a country easier to get into than out of. As the Russians learned, and as perhaps we Americans are learning now. We think of Afghanistan in terms of western eyes, western news sources. We don't tend to think of the view from a local.This is a novel about life in Afghanistan from the life of a young man who is living there as the Russians come in. As such, it presents a view that most of us outsiders can't quite imagine. No only a superbly written story, the tone and feeling leaves one with feelings of great sorrow at the collapse of a society with ancient roots. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"By the number","review":"If you like sentimental stories that for every action has a corresponding reaction, this is the book for you. If you like character-driven novels, where reactions are driven by both the character and yes, chance, this is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"What a wonderful book!

Hate that feeling?? Then read this book by all means. (POSSIBLE SPOILER)I'm not sure what the other reviews mean by \\"a story of redemption\\" The main character is a back-stabber who, although supposedly haunted by his past bad decisions, keeps making more bad decisions! He is interested in helping no one more than himself. I don't see where he ever succeeds on his own at anything. Living in Afghanistan in relative opulence?- thanks Dad! Leaving it?- thanks Dad! Getting his life saved?- thanks, Kid! Working out the adoption?-thanks relative in the INS! Oh yeah, he did succeed on his own at one thing- he turned that kid into a mute.Although well written and a quick read, I can't recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kite Runner","review":"this was a great book, but when it arrived at me house, the cover of the book was ripped and had a few pages that were damaged.

The five-star rating simply doesn't give it full credit. The heartbreaking story is told with intelligence and sincerity. Hosseini pulls no punches when telling the story of a boy growing up in Afghanistan. The story is totally believable and brutally honest. We see pre-Taliban Afghanistan from the eyes of a boy and through those eyes we see the extreme inequality between the Pashtuns and the Hazaras. On his return as a grown man, we see life in Afghanistan with the Taliban and experience the fear, horror and helplessness of its people. Refreshingly, Hosseini's portrayal of the boy/man is realistic in that he is no angel, just a human being with good and bad characteristics. Overall, a deeply moving and insightful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good read.","review":"I loved this book and when I was told it had been turned into a movie I bought that straight away to watch and was quite happy with that as well.( books are always better than the movies ) This book made me want to know the Afghanistan that was and loved by so many of it's people. I felt it took me from lush green to dust and hell and the full circle back to lush green. The very next day I bought Khaled Hosseini other book Thousand Splendid Suns and really enjoyed that too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stole my heart","review":"One of the few books in my entire lifetime that I've read from start to finish in one go. I could not put this book down. Contrary to some of the comments, having lived in a country with a similar culture and love for kite-flying (Pakistan), I would have to say that the author's descriptions of the scenery, the market place, the hustle and bustle, etc. was accurate and actually made me feel somewhat nostalgic. This book is highly enjoyable to read and is a book that everyone who has ever had a very \\"best\\" friend -- a person who would do anything for you -- can relate to and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read!","review":"Khaled Hosseini has written a magnificent novel that gripped me from the first paragraph and held me until the last word.His character development was excellent and he utilized irony throughout. I would especially recommend the unabridged audio version as the author himself reads his novel just as he would like his story told. It also educated me further on the conflicts in Afghanastan by giving a glimpse of what it was like for the children and families instead of focusing on the strictly political viewpoint. I appreciated that the author didn't become distracted with the political details- but kept the focus on the main characters and the events that befell them. This book was not a \\"light\\" book, but filled with complex twists and turns that elicit a range of emotions in the reader- tragic and hopeful."},{"rating":"1","title":"hokey","review":"i concur with those who are baffled by the volume of glowing reviews for this book. the plot was extremely contrived and thus completely hokey. don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Got Through It!","review":"It wasn't a terrible no good book, but it was in no way really good and special either. I thought that Amir was a terrible person and I felt sorry he was so terrible, but I still can't quite understand his motives. He was so blessed, but he just didn't see it. That is why the book is so soap operaish and bad. It wasn't one of those books that really take you to the place and make you keep reading. It got better in the middle and by the end I had lost interest again as I listened to the story unfold very predictably. If you don't have to read it I'd say skip it and read some other book...there are millions more that are more worthy than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This may very possibly be the biggest disappointment. I expected the book to be brand new. It was very obviously read before. Not only was the binding already in bad condition, but the seller's name or some other name was already in the book cover. The seller obviously could not make it any more obvious that he had already used the supposedly new book. I would not recommend buying anything else from this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just go see the movie...that's all the author wants anyway","review":"So I bought this book because of all the raving reviews and because I heard it was going to be released as a movie. I admit, when I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. But as the story developed and the chapters went on and on, I began to absolutely hate this book. No. I began to hate this author. It just seemed like the author wrote this book just so it would be made into the movie. The storyline, characters, setting, descriptions...everything was toooo perfect. Don't get me wrong, the story was great, but I just didn't feel ANY passion from the author. Like he really didn't love this book. And if an author doesn't love his own work, how is anyone else supposed to. I know I must be wrong because hundreds of you RAVED about this book. It just seemed like a total gimmick to me and I'll never read anything else by Khaled Hosseini."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"I bought this book because of Thousand Splendid Suns and I hated it. Khaled sees himself as the main character - arrogant. Khaled suffers from self-esteem problem, I guess being Middle Eastern in this country he feels discriminated."},{"rating":"2","title":"A captivating journey","review":"I recommend this book to the beginner intermediate kite aviator. Some of the techniques is this book may seem a bit redimentury to more advance praticioners, but the information presented is clear and very exhaustive. I especially like the \\"dragon dipper\\", but there are many other great techniques in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blessed to be in America","review":"Of the hundreds of books I have read in my lifetime, I have never disliked one so passionately. This is a story of a rotten elitist child who uses his impoverished servant companion selfishly and without compassion. In the end this child grows into a rotten cowardly adult who could never redeem himself for, if he even realizes, the mistakes in his life. The story is indeed well written but none-the-less lacks value or virtue. If this book is indeed an example of middle-eastern lifestyles then I thank God to be American. When finished with this book I so gladly deposited it in the trash can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but its got its flaws","review":"I will agree with those who say the plot is too neatly tied together. Some of his plot devices are too jarring for their own good. The author is capable of understanding the most subtle and complex of human emotions and relating it in the most perfect way. But then he mixes in some pseudo action type of stuff that ain't quite right in its context. Its a breathtaking book but left me with that empty feeling I get when I know things don't quite add up. Was it a mistake mixing such sweet emotion and outlandish plot devices? Could be.That said, this guy is a hell of a writer and even though I had trouble swallowing some of this book it was still a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kite Runner","review":"One of the most moving stories I have heard. Author is a great writer-- carries you along the path with insight and empathy. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart tearing yet fullfilling!","review":"This was our book club read, i am so glad i read it. I learned so much about another culture and the relationships that these characters struggled with. I am sorry to hear the movie wasn't as well loved. I will probably never watch it b/c the book left such a vivid impression in my mind, i wouldn't want to alter it. Totally recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I still tear up when I tell people about this book...","review":"Wow....I read this book in 2 days, the fastest I have ever read a book...my husband was going crazy, but I just could not put it down. Every page of this book held my full attention. Fantastic! I just bought a Thousand Splendid Suns, sorry amazon, I could not wait for you to ship it, I bought it elsewhere. I recommend this book to anyone... unless, of course, you're heart is made of stone. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I remember being told by a good friend that after reading this book, every other book will seem so bland and pointless.I couldn't agree more.Enjoy, if you're lucky enough not to have read it yet...."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting book","review":"I read this book with great interest after hearing my friends rave about it. It did not disappoint. Written in a very simple style the story pulls you in from the first page. It is a well crafted book, but at times it is a bit too well-crafted, predictably so: perhaps the writer went to a writing workshop or had an editor who went to one. Still, a moving story, simply told, one that deserves to be this widely read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Read","review":"This was truly a well written story. The author takes you through the emotions and thoughts of the characters. At the end of the book, I felt as if I knew them. I enjoyed the historial background the story provided. While reading I was able to learn history about Afghanastan that I never knew. It was a story that became real as you read about what was going on in the world during a certain period of time. I greatly enjoyed this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"i had to read this book back when i was in high school and i was really surprised to find this book to be good. I personally really like this book and finished reading it in no time. I don't know what it is, but this is one book you will always get mixed reviews. It all depends on what kind of books you like,There were some parts of the story that were overrated or unnecessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I have worked with Dr. Hosseini when he was a physican at Kaiser a couple of years ago.I read this book shortly after it came out. I was completely amazed when i started reading his novel. How he tells the story is heart wrenching, and the characters become so real. I believe i finished this book with in a couple of days. I am very excited to see how the movie will be portrayed compared to the novel.I am in the process of starting his new novel, and i hope he has as much success with this one as he did with \\"Kite Runner\\".Good Luck to you Dr. Hosseini"},{"rating":"2","title":"UNFORGETTABLE!","review":"Few things in life make me cry, and this book made me cry twice during my reading, I have never been so moved and so touched by a novel, it is unbelievably beautiful, thanks Mr Hosseini, you are a genious, now everything else I read seems bland."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Must Have Missed Something","review":"I heard a lot about this book and was anxious and excited to read it. I found it to have way too much talking and not enough action for me. I gave this book a lot of chances and stuck with it when I felt like giving up on it, but it just never did it for me. The first 100 pages or so are okay, but then I became confused and bored. I never felt any connection to the characters at all.--Gerard Zemek, husband of author of \\"My Funny Dad, Harry\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching story","review":"This is a deeply touching story. It is not about Afghanistan or war. It is about human feelings. Bond, trust and love between people and guilt from betrayal. The storyline is simple but real although it becomes a bit over-dramatic and implausible in the last 1/3 of novel. It might be more powerful if the story stops at when Amir went back, found that everyone was dead and he had no chance of redeeming his guilt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and timely","review":"Growing up in Afghanistan can present some significant difficulties. Hosseini provides a great look at the struggles of a fictional boy, Amir, who goes through significant and internal conflict as he grows up in a family of privilege in Afghanistan. The character development and conflict is well done and the background descriptions of the Middle East are timely, relevant and, unfortunately, eye-opening.For those who enjoy historical fiction, this is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"a real page turner. Charming and heartbraking story","review":"How anyone could give this a one star review is beyond me. Granted, the suthor has no literary tricks up his sleeve. The prose is not fancy or out of the ordinary. But the story is deeply affecting and heartbreaking and you will be burning through this book as fast as you can turn the pages. I think I read this in 3 or 4 nights.It goes to show that you can do some things in your youth that you can never truly receover from....or lose the feelings of guilt from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Afghanistan Story UNCUT","review":"I knew first about the film, then the book. I Regret I did not read this book sooner. Khaled captures Afghan recent experience of past few decades in such a remarkable ease and simplicity. The story took me back to all my childhood places - I recognized all the characters with all their demons and their good deeds and their shame. As if Khaled was describing pages from my childhood. It is authentic and real no matter how painful or joyful or hopeless or hopeful.I saw the book on a recent trip to Norway and I picked it up and I did not put it down until I was done. I stayed in the hotel room and read the book instead of visiting the city that I had gone to visit.A must read for anyone who wants to understand people of the region (and not just the Afghans) a bit better. These people have been there for thousands of years and they are going nowhere and rightfully so, no matter who wants to force its way in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, moving, heartrending, hopeful - a magnificent book","review":"I just finished reading this fascinating and quite amazing book, which I could not put down, and I'm still overflowing with emotion. It's a window on another (rich and ancient) culture, yet full of universal themes...and I did not want it to end. I respectfully request of Mr. Hosseini that he continue the story in a subsequent novel -- his characters are so full and real that we come to care deeply about them. The story completes a circle and ends with glimmers of hope and expectation, but leaves much hanging and has left me begging for more.I'm a voracious reader, and this qualifies as one of the best, most memorable books I have ever read. Thank you, Khaled Hosseini."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the ones that linger.....","review":"There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said except that this is one of those books that make you not want to start another one. I listened to the unabridged audio version, which is read by the author. It added to the authenticity and flavor of the story and the culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will not be able to stop reading till you finish the book","review":"This is an incredible book about the life of a little Afgan boy. It takes the reader to life in Afganistan during times of before and after Russian occupation and the Taliban regime. The book is very vivid and sufficiently descriptive without losing the momentum of the plot. The author is soo convincing that you will never forget the story. The story leaves what I could call an aftertaste that you will probably wish to lose by finding another book that is as gripping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Great Book","review":"I loved this book I didn't want to put it down. I highly recommend this book to everyone but not the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating look at Afghani history and culture","review":"Amir is the privileged boy, living in a large home in a wealthy area of Kabul, Afghanistan. Hassan is his servant and constant companion although, separated by social class and cultural stigma, they can never truly be friends. When the Afghan Civil War begins, it signals tremendous changes - though in very, very different ways, neither of their lives will ever be the same.I fully expected to be blown away by this book given all the hype surrounding it in the years since publication. The first half was riveting, but it seemed to lose some momentum later on. I'd still heartily recommend it, especially for the presentation of Afghani culture and the fascinating competitive kite-flying events, something I'd never heard of before."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful treat in literature.","review":"There is a lot covered in The Kite Runner which spans roughly 40 years. And it reaches every emotion. As a child, Amir, makes a poor decision to leave his friend while being attacked, but 30 years later he finds redemption for that heartless act as a child. The characters, descriptions, and plot are all very well done. There are so many reviews that I don't need to go into detail - what more can I say that hasn't been said already? It is a great book and you will enjoy it. I would also recommendA Thousand Splendid Sunsas it is another marvelous achievement in literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"If the narrator wasn't so Horrible, it might have been good for 14 year olds.","review":"I don't get it at all! A teenager would write better prose... The story is sooo predictable and the narrator... don't let me get started! He is such a spoiled brat throughout his life, an incredible egomaniac and he is not even aware of that. It's not like it's a choice to have a jerk for a narrator, because he keeps trying to justify his actions by explaining \\"reasons\\" for them! Yeah there's a reason: that he's the epitome of spoilbrattedness! Nothing redeems him in my eyes. I hated him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mundane is insane","review":"Afghanistan schmanistan.

That's your final destination? I was waiting for you to wisk off the guilt ridden toad of a son to Nargalon. Poor little human! Trapped in a world of disease and industry. No magic spells of flight and invisibility here. Dad croaks, and I'm still waiting for the demon Balthazor to announce his wicked presence. Dude, you be illin'.

Some might call this foreshadowing. I call it lack of creativity and wanting some poor joe to think ur smart because they think you put \\"foreshadowing\\" in the book. The book isnt sad its downright suicidal, mayB not quite that bad, but still. Heres why its sad: EVERYONE GETS RAPED!!! And then children slit wrists with razors. I this this Khaled man is a sicko!

It is refreshing in it's uniqueness and gripping in it's beautiful voice. An absolute achievement for a debut novel - let's hope this is only the beginning for Khaled Hosseini."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised... what a great read!","review":"I say *pleasantly surprised* not as an insult to the author by any means, but because I wasn't sure I could bring myself to read this book given the intensity of the events that surround the story. But once I turned the first few pages, I was captivated by the author's writing style and read it to the very end in a few days. Yes, there were times I wished some of the events would turn out differently, and my heart ached for the boy who was less privileged but perhaps there wouldn't be much of a story if things happened the way it should in a perfect world. Very impressive first novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, moving and ultimately worthwhile","review":"I could not put this book down, devouring it in little more than 4 hours. Khaled Hosseini weaves a story rich with characters, history and culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emerging Courage","review":"This is a story about behavior molded and forced by tradition, yearning, realtionships and uncontrollable life events. Conscience is secondary to need until love triumphs; courage is absent until deadly consequence promises to be less painful than failure. Events guide toward reflection and change. The inability of youth to analyze or understand rings true, and the priceless ability to evolve through experiences is clear. Afghanistan was given life in the heart of this reader. Unconditional love and understanding without judgement is the key that opens the door of the heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kite Runner","review":"A must read, will affect you deeply. Well written and one of those books that will stay with you always."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This audio book is specatcular! The content is an amazing insight to Afghanistan's recent history (late '60's to book's present) from a (fictional) first hand perspective. This audio book is read by the author. The author sounds completely natural as if not reading at all but that Amir himself is simply telling his story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book.","review":"I am looking forward to Hosseini's next book as I thoroughly enjoyed the Kite Runner and a Thousand Splendid Suns.l"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.","review":"This is probably the greatest book I have ever read. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good read. AMAZING."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth reading, lives up to the hype.","review":"i resisted reading this because i feared it was overpraised and too commercial. i was wrong. i found it moving and well told. don't miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Staggeringly obvious and trite.","review":"I heard so much about this book that maybe I expected too much. There are no likeable charachters, and the ones that are supposed to be likeable come off as oddly Christlike and unreal.The plot twists are obvious and expected-- totally forced. Actually, for a book this long, there isn't really that much of a plot. The writing is good, although not particularly lyrical or creative.Without revealing too much, I would agree with the reviewer who mentioned that this has all the markings of a Hallmark movie. It really seems contsructed that way. As well, Afganistan is not vividly portrayed enough, IMHO, and if this book were set somewhere else with the same level of writing I don't think it would have achieved the same level of acclaim.If you are interested in Afganistan do yourself a favor and read some non-fiction-- this book really wasn't \\"it\\", and it was WAY too manipulative.Rachel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally moving","review":"I read this for my book club and all members eagerly agreed that this was a wonderful book. It almost made me feel guily about not knowing about the history of Afghanistan and being ignorant to its beautiful history and our part in destroying it.The story is beautifully written and easy to follow. The emotions of the characters are clear and their relationships deep and enduring. I found some of the events towards the end alittle contrived, but the metaphorical representations they exposed were vital to the story's impact.Definitely worth your time and money- a must read book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kite Runner","review":"Unfortunately, most of us do not know much about Afganistan and even less about its history. The Kite Runner unfolds a poignant coming of age story against the background of historic turmoil and class differences in the country. Beautifully written and brutally honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Best Book Ever!","review":"Best book I have ever read--and I read A LOT. Worth buying. A great plot, very moving. Definitely read at least 30 or 40 pages before deciding it isn't for you. I was hooked from the first page, but others I have talked to said it took them a bit to get a feel for the flavor of the book. The way the plot takes shape as the novel goes on is brilliant. WORTH EVERY PENNY. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kite Runner is a book that merits all the praise it has received","review":"Here you may experience profound emotional exploration and a lesson in Afgan history enveloped in a tale of exquisite beauty. Given the recent historical events that have occurred between the United States and Afganistan, all Americans bear some responsibility to gain a greater understanding of that country and its culture. The Kite Runner is a beautiful example of the value of fiction in the context of becoming informed. It is, even more than an invaluable teaching tool, an example of great contemporary literature with its sweeping grasp of complex familial relationships and heart wrenching tragedies and thrilling triumphs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice story...delightfully told!","review":"The 'Kite Runner' is a nice story...delightfully told!At it's heart 'Kite Runner' is a feel good story. It is a story that every kid grows up dreaming about - brotherly love, endless fun, pranks and, most of all, winning! That said, credit to Khaled Hosseini for making the story of two boys growing up in Kabul of the '70s come tantalizingly alive in the pages of this novel. He sticks to the basics of good storytelling by keeping the language simple and the plot direct. The characters, with the exception of Amir, are all clearly either good or evil. And like all good stories this has a neat, tidy ending. The story has its fair share of coincidences but it fits into the spirit of this happy story.Overall it is a thoroughly enjoyable book. After all who can resist a good story from a good storyteller?"},{"rating":"2","title":"captivating","review":"A truly captivating, multi-layered story that pulls on your heartstrings. An extremely well crafted plot in beautifully written prose that explores the human condition in a lesser understood part of the world. This book is not to be missed. To do so, would be your loss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Astonishing Novel","review":"The Kite Runner is a spellbinding tale of a young boy's struggle from childhood to adulthood and the things he must conquer along the way. It begins with Amir, a privileged young boy living in Afghanistan. The storyline follows his transition from boyhood to manhood through a number of heart wrenching events that most people could not even begin to fathom.This novel goes beyond the cold politics of Afghanistan and delves deeper into the true emotions felt by the Afghani society. It shows the people behind the news headlines that are sometimes overlooked. These people have lives. They have fortunes. They have families. Now we have a remarkable book to portray those things."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is as good as everyone says","review":"Not being familiar with Afghanie culture, I was worried that I would not relate to this book at all. But, the author did an excellent job of making the story a universal one. I was riveted by the narrator's inner conflicts: (1) to please his father and (2) to come to terms with his betrayal of his best friend (although he would never admit that Hassaan was his friend). I think the author did a nice job of bringing everything to a close in a realistic way. By that, I mean that the author did not give it a \\"Hollywood ending,\\" but that the author resolved the conflicts in a believable way. This book is just wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish and unsophisticated","review":"This book had come highly recommended to me by several people, and as you can see, the reviews are glowing. Personally, I couldn't get through it. If I hadn't heard that it was a first novel, I would have soon figured that out, as the writing is so irritatingly, distractingly amateurish. I understand that English is not the author's native language, but my issues with the writing were not so much style as content - such as being beaten over the head with certain points (I get it, I get it!). Then there's the main character. I don't need for a character to be \\"good\\" to care what happens to him, but he must be interesting. This guy? I just didn't care. If you're enchanted by the Middle Eastern setting, there is plenty of wonderful literature in translation from this region. Or, for some other social, political or historical perspective, you might dip into the wealth of nonfiction available. Unless you're big on the bestseller/Oprah stuff, don't waste your time with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped and predictable","review":"As much as I enjoyed the eloquent writing, the story line was way overhyped and predictable. There was nothing remotely unique here if you have lived in poorer countries. Other than the author tried to make a hollywood story out of it. I cannot recommend this.Save your $14 and donate that to CARE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeper issues in life","review":"This is a book that is very moving and the reader has the hope for a positive outcome in the ending. As a Christian I would say this is not for the Christian that is faint of heart. Some of the subject matter in this book is of a very brutal nature. There is an underlying reality of issues that are not really talked about in a society or culture today.I found myself sobbing several times for the characters in this novel. The author is very good at character development and keeping the reader turning the page. It's a bittersweet portrayal of loyalty, friendship and a boy wanting his fathers love.Kite Runner helps us to see some of the deeper issues we deal with in life and how they affect us throughout our entire lives. This is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost two nights of sleep because I couldn't stop reading.","review":"I spent a year in Kabul, so there is some personal resonance.Regardless of who you are, this is a grand story. Very emotionally involving."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kite Runner - life in Afghanistan","review":"I had previously read another book by the same author and enjoyed it very much,so decided to read this one too. I found it very interesting - a view of life in another country with a different faith and customs. It was not just a documentary, but rather a day-to-day account of how things really happen. If this author writes any more stories, I will be very glad to read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two-Thirds Great","review":"In the first third of THE KITE RUNNER, Khaled Hosseini grabs his readers then forces their senses to experience the Afghanistan of the narrator's youth. Wonderful. The second third takes place in America, there the color seems to leave Hosseini's writing. Was this intentional, a way to illustrate the narrator's new life? If so, it wasn't obvious, and a bit pale. The final third is fast paced and exciting; the narrator has to act on his choices... now... before he loses his nerve. He has to visit Afghanistan's present and HIS past. The ending was fine, but I wish Hosseini had left it tattered--to reflect the conditions in Afghanistan.Read THE KITE RUNNER. See the movie. Both are sure to provide sensory feasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little predictable","review":"This is one of the best written books I have read in a long time. This book grabbed my attention at the very beginning and held it solidly through to the end. I ended up reading this book in one day because I just had to know what happened next. My complaint about this book is that so much of what happened seemed obvious pages (if not chapters) before it happened, which is why I can't give it five stars. I plan on recommending this book for my bookclub to read because I think there are plenty of moral and ethical topics this book brings to light and are worth discussing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing","review":"This is truly a disturbing book. When I say a book is disturbing, that means it is written so well that the reader gets caught up in the emotion of the text, and the emotion continues far past the last page. It was also quite educational. The \\"Taliban\\" used to just be a word I heard bantered about in the news. It is now real.The narrator, speaking in the first person, is so easy to hate throughout most of the book, a very clever literary device. Loyalty never was presented with such beauty and such horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good REad","review":"I enjoyed this book alot and found it very interesting as well as well written. I hope the movie does it justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Glimpse Into Afghan Life","review":"Khaled Hosseini has created an insightful view into what once was Afghanistan of the 1970's and what became of this country in the following years. The characters are compelling and believable and the storyline is authentic. I found the book very hard to put down and very satisfying once it was finished. A rare glimpse into a country many Americans, including myself, have trouble understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amir is shallow and arrogant and unlikeable","review":"I was looking forward to this book and chose it for my book club, but am very disappointed in the book. I really disliked the main character and narrator, named Amir. And he is there from the beginning to the end, you get no relief. What an unlikeable, shallow, arrogant, superficial, childish NOTHING who caused everyone pain. I thought he might show some redeeming quality, but no, he was pathetic to the very end. We only know the other characters through the eyes of this awful man, so therefore the other characters are not well developed.I did like that it showed some about Afghanistan, the scenery, customs, food, language. Poor Afghanistan - my heart goes out to the people there."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kite Runner","review":"The Kite Runner is a spell-binding novel that takes you into the world of 1970's Afghanastan in a way that historical accounts cannot. It is truly the story of one boy/man's redemption and his coming to terms with his relationship with his father. This is a book that is uplifting without having the need for a pretenious Hollywood happy ending. I have recommended this book to all my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating and compelling","review":"THE KITE RUNNER is one of the best books I've read in a long time. Everything from the novel's setting, to the characterizations, to the almost-expected yet still surprising plot twists, to the heart-breaking emotional relationships at the core, all taken together made this an extremely powerful reading experience. The fact that the story encompasses 30 years of modern history in Afghanistan makes it interesting enough, but the complexity of Amir's relationships with his father, his boyhood friend, the various characters who weave in and out of his life, and most importantly with himself, makes this book a true treasure.If you've been hesitating on buying this book, don't wait any longer. Just get yourself a copy and plan to stay up until the wee hours of the morning until you've finished reading the story of the kite runner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story of determination, deep forgiveness, and a happy ending","review":"I wish I would have left my review for this as soon as I finished reading it. I will never forget the feeling that came over me once I started reading it. How hopeless it made me feel. And, how happy I was at the end. I hope you enjoy this one as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and real ...","review":"I really enjoyed this! I found it very touching and very real - for the most part. The relationship between the boys was particularly well done! It just felt like it came from the heart. The multiple viewpoints on racism - in all its subtle and unsubtle forms - was fascinating! The dynamic between the father and son and the lack of love between them was sad yet touching too.Overall a very well done, thoughtful book. Though, full disclosure, the plot at the end, like the last 80 pages, becomes extremely contrived and unrealistic. I just didn't buy it and since this was a book that had been so incredibly real up to this point that is not a small issue. It's too bad the author went that way but the rest of the book is so well done it isn't enough not to enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I was at first very nervous about reading this book because I thought it was going to be a dry historical account of Afghanistan. But, I was completely wrong! I read this going and coming from work on the subway, and had to hold back tears a few times. The line I will always remember is: \\"for you, a million times over\\".

What if it is a true story of boys and men growing and fighting against religious oppression and an economic cast system in the United States of America.Go back and re-read it, it may open your eyes to a world of subtle shadows and nuance that could only come from literature written and published in a free society, and, will we ever really be free to address the painful truths that this book speaks about?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time!!","review":"I read this book for my book club, and I was really looking forward to reading it, having heard so much praise for it.The book is awful. The story is boring and entirely predictable, the coincidences are simply too many and beggar belief, the characters are all shallow and not a single one has been developed to any degree of complexity.What astounded me were the numerous grammatical errors that litter the book. I started to mark them in red, but eventually I had to stop making corrections, or else I would never have finished the book. Just what did the proofreaders of this book do? Perhaps they fell asleep reading it, as I came very close to doing.Diane Sawyer is listed on the back cover as one of the reviewers, and that should tell serious readers all they need to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy ebook price!","review":"The Kindle version of this book is $3 more expensive than the paperback!

How is this book so popular? Liberal guilt over the war in Afganistan? The general sheep like nature of most readers after too much college courses?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"After the main character's loyal, humble, happy, innocent friend is raped by 3 other boys-while his cowardly and selfish \\"friend\\" watches-I just couldn't read any more. The main character was utterly dispicable and, from the reviews I've read, never redeems himself. This book was just depressing and horrible.

A masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"I GOT SO EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED","review":"This book is amazing!!! I would read it again and again. I'm a busy mom of 3 boys and I couldn't put this down at night. It took 3 days and I finished last night at 3am!! I laughed, cried, felt the pain... it was well-written and I'm looking forward to his next book due out soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Novel","review":"One of the best novels I have read so far. It is a very warming novel about friendship, trust and betrayal. A novel anyone can read and will enjoy. I have so much to say but I will just keep it at that. Read the book. I read Hosseni's second novel A Thousand Splendid Suns and that novel is just as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Wow, what a disappointment. I had read such great reviews about this book and seen it on so many top ten lists. I expected a tale rich with the Afghan heritage and culture. While this was the backdrop, the story was really more about a barbaric psychopath, a pathetic and self-pitying protagonist and grossly unnecessary cruelty (to children nonetheless). A truly good novelist should be able to move the reader without resorting to multiple accounts of child sodomy, brutal murders of beloved characters and horrific accounts of torture and senseless betrayal. In the end, this book is just manipulative with its contrived plotline and characters. I say skip it -- there are so many better reads out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly long","review":"The book's plot is very good. The problem is to find it and when you can't find it quickly enough you'll have a dull reading. The last chapter you can read it or not because you'll know how the book'd end. The book has too many wasted pages e.g. How many pages do you need to explain a kite tournament? Maybe 15? Another example is why Amir went to draw a Visa for Sohrab and spent 2 days and 40 pages to get nowhere if his neighbor worked in an INS office? If you want to read an excellent book with the plot akin read: \\"The Bandit Queen of India\\" by Phoolan Devi"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great love story of friendship","review":"Like everyone else who read this book I COULD NOT put it down, I was up until the wee hours of the morning turning the pages, holding my breath, crying at times ....There are so many stories here - the father/son relationship, the best friends, brothers, wife/husband - all beautifully intertwined. This is one of those books that I have been thinking about since I put it down and I know I will read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking Work","review":"The emotions are so deep and raw, I can't really go into it. This book is filled with such unspeakable sadness. Amir's guilt turned me into an insomniac...I was Amir. I felt all the pain and betrayal...I was Hassan. I was destroyed, elated, torn in two by the powerful emotions in this book.This book touched me even more deeply than \\"A Fine Balance\\", one of my favorites. I don't know if the comparison to Ha Jin's \\"Waiting\\" is as accurate....although the prose is spare in both, I don't know if the same depth of emotion is conveyed.Highly recommended. Swear off all heavy books and literature afterwards...after your soul has been pierced like this, you won't feel a thing. I suggest going to some light reading or nonfiction. Hell knows I needed to."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing & heartbreaking","review":"The Kite Runner is a very deep look into the life of an Afghani set against a very vivid cultural description of Afghanistan as well as its political turmoil.The story follows the narrator from his well to do boyhood and his struggles for his father's attention to his love/envious relationship with his best friend. The dramatic event in his childhood foreshadows the dark clouds forming over Afghanistan in the form of political upheaval and years of civil war. Once he is older and has settled into life elsewhere, the old skeletons in his closet resurface and as an adult, he must choose how to react. His reaction and the ensuing story is both heart breaking and also uplifting as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm one of the lucky ones...","review":"I only got through a few pages before giving up on the writing. I watched the movie this afternoon; it was good enough,though it couldn't get beyond the clichés of the book. So I thought I'd try the audio version at bedtime. Didn't get any farther into the audio than the book. Sadly, the author's reading isn't any more interesting than his writing - save your time and watch the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"I rarely have difficulty getting through a book.

This is definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal history Afghan / Muslin civilisation breaking down","review":"I read this book in bed being ill, which is about as good an opportunity to read as when on vacation. It was one of the most impressing books I ever read. Each time the story gives unexpected turns. The literary style is perfect (pardon my English, I'm not native speaker). It gave me insight in how minorities are discriminated and not allowed to have a real life. It shows the Afghan / Muslin civilisation breaking in pieces with the power vacuum being filled by Taliban and Sharia. The main person is a child who has to choose between trying to help his friend (a minority)who is being assaulted and saving his own skin. He decides to turn away. His feeling of guilt determines the sequence of events which merge with the recent events in the history of violence and dispair of Afghanistan. It is a book written in respect and with deep psychological insight."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great read!","review":"There is definite truth in \\"saving the best for last\\" as this is the last book I will read this year and it was truly one of the best I have read in 2004(I am writing this on 12/31/04). I was mesmerized by this book and stayed up until three o'clock in the morning reading in order that I could finish it. It's a real page turner! I found the book capitivating! I was immediately taken in by the author's style and was intrigued by the connection between the various characters: father and son, servant and employer, friend and foe, etc. The descriptions of life in Afhganistan and life under the Taliban's rule are quite interesting. Equally interesting is the transition to life in America for the characters when they leave Afhghanistan and how they adjust to life in the United States. I am sure you, too, will find this book to be very good and extremely well written. I was sad when it came to its conclusion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read in a long while","review":"I read a lot, and The Kite Runner is the best book I've read in a long while. Based on a true story, the author takes the reader inside the mind of the narrator and inside the country of Afghanistan during the past thirty years. Told with sincerity and pathos, the author gives us a short history lesson of his country. I sat and cried at the end of the book because of it's emotional impact. Mr. Hosseini creates characters that will live in our memories for many years, but most importantly, he helps us realize how much alike we all are in our hopes and dreams.I highly recommend this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"Brilliantly crafted and painfully emotional, Khaled Hosseini's first book will take your breath away. You'll fly through the pages and find that you reach the end too soon. It'll make you laugh, cry, and gasp out in disbelief. It's definitely a must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"soap opera novel","review":"Although I enjoyed the first half of the book and it's poignant way of introducing the reader to Afghani culture, the second half left me feeling like I was reading some trashy romance novel.

This will be the new college reading requirement for english. this book is a classic with an amazing well told story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first hundred pages really work, but then...","review":"The Kite Runner gets off to such a good start, with its blend of history, observations about daily life in Kaboul, and a compelling story of two boys growing up together. The second half goes badly astray, as the novel becomes more and more manipulative and sentimental. By the end of the book, the author is willing to put his characters through all sorts of hell just so he can follow up with a teary reconciliation. I wish an editor had convinced him to tighten it up, stay focused, and resist the urge to tug at the heartstrings with such a heavy hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kite Runner","review":"The author's writing style is easy and inviting. After reading the first few sentences of Chapter 1 I knew I had to have this book. One of the most emotionally evoking novels I can remember reading in a long time. A must read for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyable book with amateur writing style","review":"I really enjoyed this book until I had time to reflect on what I'd read. As a whole I felt that the book, as written, was quite amateurish. The foreshadowing was obvious, the sequence of events too convenient as to be considered almost ridiculous, and towards the end the plot felt rushed. I get the impression that, if Hosseini is indeed a skilled writer, that the publisher wanted a more easily digested story that could be sandwiched into a few hundred pages for marketability."},{"rating":"2","title":"a window into Afghan life","review":"More than a beautiful story, the Kite Runner is a window into Afghan life, mindset, culture. As we wage war in Afghanistan, this story brings complexity and humanity to the people of that country, and their struggle to live under repressive political leadership, and moral dictatorship.As for the story itself, the tale of Amir and Hassan is beautifully heart-wrenching, filled with deeply drawn, authentic characters, with moral flaws, tragedy and a compelling journey of redemption.I listened to the Kite Runner unabridged on audio CD, narrated by the author. Hosseini's narration is thoughtful and compelling, not so much \\"acted\\", as read with the insight of someone who knows the story and characters so well, they can effectively stand out of the way and let their inherent drama speck for itself. Highest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"you wont want to put it down","review":"if you want a experience of a different culture from the comfort if your home and a fabulious, moving and beatufully written book then this is it! this is a book that caught me till the end. a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves 10 Stars","review":"Hands down, one of the best books I've ever read. My dad was in the Marine Corps for 22 years, and it's eye-opening to read about life on the other side of the war. I was immediately sucked in to the story, and literally could not put it down. One of the rare books that brought tears to my eyes on a few occasions. Absolutely amazing. I was so overly satisfied with this book that I bought his other book \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns,\\" which was just as good. I encourage everyone to read this book...you will not be left disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perspective","review":"Rather than recap the synopsis found in the Editorial review or one of the other reviews I will simply provide my view of this novel: Although this is a work of fiction, you imagine as you read this book that everything in it happened; that all of it is real. And your soul aches at the level of inhumanity and cruelty that exists in the world. The story begins in the early 1970's in Afghanistan--so immediately you have an idea that things will only go downhill, for a long time. Somehow, Dr. Hosseini successfully weaves in acts of kindness and humanity that are believable and not contrived and saccharine. The choices the various characters must make throughout the story make the choices most of us are faced with seem trivial by comparison. It is one of the most powerful books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift Given","review":"Got it for hubby. Well, he's reading it! I had heard from many sources it was a good book, and that seems to be the case. Maybe I'll give it a go this winter, when I have time to get engrossed."},{"rating":"1","title":"unacceptable","review":"I ordered the Kite Runner on June 28th of this year. I am still waiting for it to be delivered. I ordered an another book at the same time and received that book weeks ago. My son needed this book for summer reading. This is unacceptable business procedures. I would never order anything from this account again. Sure enough my credit card was already debited for this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can good be so bad","review":"I cannot disagree that this book was written in a very compelling style but as well written as it was I painfully read the book dreading to think what horrible human foible awaited me on the next page. As I approached the middle of the book and I found myself avoiding it I sadly closed the book and began my quest for the next victim to read it. I have not for one minute regretted putting the book down unfinished and I cannot recommend it to anyone I know and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much abuse!","review":"Such a beautiful novel, interesting characters. Loved the tale of redemption and the kites in the sky. I felt very wounded by the story by the end. I couldn't stand to read about these children so abused. So haunting, I can't get those horrible images of abuse out of my head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotionally beat-up by a book!","review":"I feel used. The book exposes the reader to all the sadness and tragedy of recent Afghan history. That's okay. However, at what emotionally cost. The book is still a fictionalized account. I was very upset to read one child being sodomized, but when a second child is brutally and repeatedly sodomized, I skipped forward to read the end, and put the book away. The book could have accomplished its purpose without that. It had great potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Entertaining","review":"It was a pleasure to be able to \\"hear\\" from Randy Cohen again. Ethics are always interesting and his reflections make them very entertaining as well. Organizing by categories can help open up some lively discussions.There is also a very funny book written with a different take about a man who writes the \\"Moralist Column\\" for The Worldly Times. It is titled Daddy-An Absolutely Authentic Fake Memoir. Another angle to enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant book","review":"read this book before the movie came out.. the movie was great and this book was even better than the movie.

Unfortunately the day I opened the book, I wasn't ready to read the horrific events portrayed. Only that morning was I made aware of a frighteningly similar tragedy experienced by one of my closest friends, as the event which is pivotal in The Kite Runner.Because of the horror that was so real and devastating to me at the time, I'm not sure that I could appreciate the true literary impact and brilliance or the strength and growth of Amir, the central character.It is vividly and hauntingly written, and created an all too real picture of how lives can be destroyed when we find ourselves arrested in, and by, moments of fear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"I love the way the author has molded the story. Just when you think you know whats going to happen, it changes drastically and makes it so much more interesting. I couldn't keep my hands of this book and finished it at the first go! A *must* buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly haunting","review":"I have never, ever wept whilst reading a book before. With this one, I had to put the book down to finish my sob. It is a heart-wrenching read, but one that will stay with you for a long time. Don't read this if you're vulnerable- it'll push you over the edge!"},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated load of bull","review":"Don't buy the hype. This is one of the most overrated books that I have read.It seems the author has read lots of Dickens, superficially I might add, and has seen too many bollywood movies. The bad characters are really bad and good ones really good. Bad things really keep happening to Hassan and then his son, Sohrab, who's very young but talks like teenager from California where he ends up eventually. The most annoying thing when author tries give 'insights into life' with deep sounding sentences. In the second the book gets utterly predictable.I wonder whether this book would have seen the light of day if there was no 9/11."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book EVER","review":"This was the WORST book I've ever read.The geography part of the story was interesting, but the characters and history part of the story was gut wrenching. For those interested in reading about that region of the world, I highly recommendThree Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission to Promote Peace . . . One School at a Timeinstead, it's far more inspirational and not depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived, disappointing & over rated with moments of interest","review":"The geographic, political and cultural perspectives are shallow but shallow if you nothing about the last 25 years in Kabul; if you don't know where Kabul is you'll find this pretty exotic. Were it not for the 'middle east to LA immigrant setting' this book probably would not have been published except as a potential screenplay. The last third is a real page flipper (get it over with) as the author runs through the cliche checklist and ties together the loose ends (which are pretty predictable). I was disappointed that I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bollywoodian/Sheldonesque tale","review":"I found some parts too predictable and forced.True, sooner or later, someone else from the Afghan diaspora will write a better book with the turbulent homeland as backdrop.However, this will still remain an important book. I believe that in academic jargon we call it a \\"seminal\\" work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two motherless boys............","review":"One of the reviewers blamed liberal guilt for this book's popularity. I'm a liberal and I think the book is a manipulative piece of......... Two boys, Afghanistan, class-conflict,... I also could not finish this snore-fest. Two stars rather than one on the slight possibility I am missing something here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent novel","review":"The Kite Runner is one of the best books I have read in a long time. It was one of those rare books I, literally, could not put down. I was reading sometimes until very late at night. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful, meaningful and encouraging","review":"Insightful because Hosseini shows the complexities of personalities, attributes one may not aspire to have, and the tools Amir needed to right his wrongs. The plot twists and turns, is dense and rather intense. It is latent with meaning and if you stop to think about how Afghani relationships exist in general, it sheds light and new meaning to what has happened to the civilians of his home country. It is encouraging to see his story, to watch him grow, make big leaps and strides, and come out a winner in the end.The pace of the plot quickens in the end, to conveniently close the story, but you get over that quickly because you cannot stop thinking about the plot when you are done.Page turner, very highly recommended. I will read this again. I also wonder how much of Hosseini's life is reflected in Amir's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story","review":"This is a great story -- almost like an epic movie. Except towards the end of the book, this book flows nicely and there is never a dull moment. The latter part is a slight letdown and it provides a slightly unrealistic edge to the whole thing. However, if you dont think too much about it -- you will enjoy the story.The author provides a good glimpse into the psyche of the Afghan people and there are lots of interesting incidents that provide us information on how life was in the Afghanistan of old.Though the story is in first person, it is not distracting. I will not be surprised if it gets converted into a movie.I recommend reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a rare piece","review":"I was pleasently surprised by this novel and couldn't put it down...it touched on many different aspects of life and if you're not moved by this book than you're not paying attention"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This book was an amazing read. It was simply impossible to put down with out immediately wanting to pick it right back up. This is a story of a young boy who pushes away the only family he has ever really known in order to suppress a terrible secret and gain the acceptance of his father. He later on grows up and is giving a chance to make thinks right. This is an extraordinary story that will be with you forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching","review":"It's hardly stop reading this book. I finished reading it within 3 days which I rarely do it.When I am reading it, I feel like this is the author biography, not just fiction.Don't really like the ending but I do like the meaning behind the story.Integrity, self identity is worthied to be stuggled of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, Simply Brilliant!","review":"Bar none this is the best book I have read in quite some time.

I can only hope that Khaled will soon bless us with another as literature such as this is a rarity.Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kite Runner","review":"I have been a voracious reader for over 30 years, and this is one of the best books I have ever read. I just completed it while staying in NYC. Every chance I had to gobble a few words I did. Profound, astonishing, exquisite are some of the adjectives I would venture to use in describing this book, but to be honest with you, there are no adequate words that gives justice to this superior novel. Anyone who reads this book will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"This book starts out so brilliantly that you are literally transported into a world of tradition, pain, redemption and love. I highly recommend that you read the first half of The Kite Runner because it's exceptionally beautifully written. However, once the protagonist and his father move to America and even more so when he returns to Afghanistan it feels like a different book. In fact, it feels like a very poor and predictable Hollywood movie. Maybe that's what it will be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Especially Relevant","review":"Read this book the next time the nightly news shows the latest horrific development from Afghanistan. You'll never look on that dry, destroyed landscape the same again. The author does a great job of making that country come to life, and pointing out that the lives that have been torn apart there are, really, not that different from ours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful! Fantastic! Unbelievable!!!!","review":"I find this to be the best book I have ever read. The characters will captivate you and you will not be able to put this book down.

I can't wait for Mr. Hosseini's next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliched and implausible","review":"This book disappointed me beyond belief. It started out good -- maybe a little overblown in how \\"angelic\\" the protagonist's childhood friend is -- but that aside, it was OK. The parts set in the US were also OK. But when the story returns to Afghanistan, it ends up being more like an Afghan Rocky story -- so cliched and implausible that I threw the book down in disgust.If this book wasn't about Afghanistan, no one would ever have noticed it, much less published it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book TODAY!","review":"What a gorgeous book...a masterful tale that will make you angry, hopeful, sad, laugh, cringe and cry. It will also make you examine yourself and your present relationships.It is wonderfully written and flows one page to the next, as we follow year after year of the characters' lives. I am at a loss to try and accurately describe how powerful a story this is, so I must simply say: read it for yourself...you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"This is a book that should be read.

It provides for great discussion at a book club gathering also, as people's opinons about various characters, especially the father, can vary."},{"rating":"2","title":"B+","review":"Nice read -interesting look into Afgan culture - the plot is just a little too convenient but with lots of twists and turns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great","review":"This is an excellent book, well written with gorgeous details and insights. I am always impressed when the author can grab the audience in the first few pages of the book. Hosseini does this very well. But I felt that the second half of the book became sloppy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"Given the US actions in Afghanistan, I think every American should read this book. The characters, scenes, and circumstances put a human face on the the Afghan people."},{"rating":"2","title":"astonishing debut","review":"Rarely have I read a first novel of such depth and power. It tells the story of a complex relationship between a boy and his family's servant, who is his age, and could be classified as being on the border between a friend and a subordinate. After the boy, Amir, betrays the trust of his friend, he emigrates to America with his father, in order to escape the political persecution of their family. But, he will eventually have to return to his homeland and make amends for his cowardly boyhood act. This is a brutal, moving and brilliant novel. If it is indeed the first Afghan novel translated into English, as one review claims, what a pity we've been missing the chance to read writers of this one's caliber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written, thoughtful novel","review":"Kite Runner is a thoughtful, well written book that takes a sharpleft turn with a shocking event, surrounding the kite running contest that takes place well into the book. The book is often lyrical and takes unpredictable turns. I had been hoping that somehow the two young boys would later come to terms directly with each other as adults as opposed to the incredible journey the kite runner takes for self redemption at the end. The book uses Afganistan as a backdrop for describing an unresolved self-unforgiven inner turnmoil suffered in victory by the Kite Runner hero in a class conscious world. Well done, well written and thoughtful journey as to how a single event early in life survives over a lifetime of world shaking events. The book strikes deeply into complex emotions shaped and warped by circumstance, class, religion, education, and family relationships, which emotions somehow survive over a lifetime to take an unexpected altruistic journey back to the beginning"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book, couldn't put it down!","review":"I had to read this book for my bookclub, I really didn't want to it didn't appeal to me but I read it and I couldn't put it down for 2 days until I finished it. It was soooooooooo good and it sure opens your eyes on how other countries are. I am so proud that where over there helping cause these people really need our help, this book was an eye opener for me, hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn that Kite Running = NASCAR in Afghanistan","review":"Very emotionally stirring story -- mostly about the human spirit, in a Crime and Punishment kind of way, but also about life in Afghanistan. I thought that the author did a great job of exposing emotions of betrayal, pride, and weakness that all of us feel to some degree, but we tend to ignore.I also enjoyed the portrayal of a son trying to earn his father's acceptance, of the struggle of pairing the bonds of friendship versus the power of social acceptance, and the search for God and his reality in our lives.I give the book my highest recommendation - it goes quickly and will have your mind churning for a long time afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kite Runner: A Search for Personal Redemption","review":"Hosseini's novel presents a poignant portrait of a man's effort to face into the moral cowardice of his past. Haunted by his failings as a youth, the main character acts to redeem himself. Painfully honest and full of self recriminations, the work shows a man bravely coming to terms with his personal demons."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good Bollywood script!","review":"What a shame, the story starts nice and strong and then it turns into a low budget Bollywood movie with many twists and turns that doesn't make any sense! I was able to go through the first 200 pages in less than two days and then I started losing interest and by the time I got to the part where he finds his brother's son with the same guy who raped the child's father, I knew I needed to stop!!! I gave it one star because of the strong start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"The book is written with good suspense and enjoyable ethnic color, but the literary devices employed are far too obvious, he uses a sledgehammer instead of a rapier in choosing plot events. Most students of a good college writing course could produce material like this. But the masters acknowledge the \\"rules\\" of creating fiction and then break those rules in unexpected and pleasing ways.Mostly this was a slog of a read for me, I had a hard time suspending disbelief."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book ever ...","review":"This is the best book I have ever read.I was completely taken by this book and could not put it down. In parts, it was so exciting that I would read too fast so that I could find out what was going to happen and then have to reread back a few paragraphs to understand what happened!There is some violence and extremely strong emotions. His reflection on the behavior and thinking of children is exactly how I remember being a kid. He really captures being a child, being a young adult, and being a retiring old man extremely well.Jack"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best fiction books I've ever read","review":"It took me only one week to read this book. I couldn't wait to have some free time to keep reading it. It's a very detailed portrait of the Afghans and their life conditions during the Republic and Taliban eras.Fascinating!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong start, slow finish","review":"The positives -The book is extremely well written and has magnificent flow. The first 150 pages are gripping and the book is difficult to put down.The negatives -Towards the middle of the book, the story starts to drudge. I also didn't like the fact that the ending becomes apparent in the middle of the book. There are a few twists (which are mostly hokey), but this book starts fast and crawls towards the finish line.After the first 150 pages, I thought I would recommend it to everyone, but after the last 200 pages, I would only say it is on-par with most things out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much here","review":"I'm still baffled at the great reviews of this book. I thought the characters were underdeveloped, the emotions trite and remedial, and the storyline implausible. The plot was somewhat compelling in places but I had a hard time getting over the heavyhanded foreshadowing and description of emotion. All in all...pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"I feel like I could have learned a lot about the time, the place, the people without being whacked over the head with heavy-handed ploys to wring tears and horror out of me. Afghan deserves to have its story told but I hope someone will take another, more subtle run at it.I wish I had read some of the reviews here before I had agreed to read this book for my book club, so I will reiterate what someone else said--if you have a low tolerance for violence (child abuse, rape, stonings), give this book a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of a challenge","review":"My biggest complaint with the book is the child rape and sexual exploitation incidents which, I felt, added nothing to the story and was added because ????"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I hadn't read this","review":"I had heard raves about this book and finally had the opportunity to read it. I wish I hadn't. Disturbing and tragic, the writing was good but the subject was absolutely awful. I guess that I will stick with \\"feel-good\\" books since this depressed me terribly. Life has enough bad moments, who needs to add to them a thousandfold???"},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED","review":"This is not a terrible book, but I can't recall ever feeling so LET DOWN. I think the critics greatly overrated this author and this book, and the disappointment I'm experiencing now is palpaple.When everyone is raving about an author and Oprah is basically annointing this author as Pope I was expecting brilliance. Instead I got a mediocre author who penned a vaguely interesting tale. I'd rate the quality of this book as comparable to a slightly above average community college thesis.Read this book then to see what really good writinglooks like check out Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle.Cat's Cradle"},{"rating":"1","title":"Manipulative","review":"This author really knows how to stack the deck. He has also created a main character who is pretty despicable yet always seeking the reader's approval--kind of pathetic. Anyway, everyone just love love loves this book, so I decided to read it and was VERY disappointed. Hosseini is not a good writer; he perpetually tries too hard. The more gruesome plot points are calculated to make the reader feel oh-so-outraged and superior, but paradoxically are also rather prurient. The villain is a caricature and there is no plausible explanation for his sadism. I want high quality writing out of a book. In my opinion, this book failed on that score. There is some interesting information about Afghanistan and Kabul, but that was an incidental positive in the mostly negative experience of reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased book","review":"Isn't it funny how this book never mentions the \\"Tajiks\\" of Afghanistan.. They are the second largest ethnic group after Pashtuns. Let me tell you why, because the author is a Tajik himself. The reason he wrote this book is to cause a fight between Pashtuns and Hazaras, or so the people in the west would think that only Pashtuns and Hazaras are crazy people of afghanistan. this was a money grab attempt, and he succeeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story!","review":"I loved the book and it took me almost no time to finish it.

So many opinions.....coming from a horrific back ground myself, I totally immersed myself in the book. It was more about the rape, but the deceit, the loyalty, the culture, friendship and family. We all have pain somewhere in our lives, needless, to say in a country such as the author's, there seems to be such emotional, physical and mental pain. Thank you so much for sharing this incredible journey. I did not assume what would happen next as I don't do that with real life either. I can't wait until the movie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"I do not typically read fiction novels, but this one was impossible to put down. I've recommended this to all of my friends and family, and have lent it out several times. This is a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually lives up to the hype...","review":"Usually when a book recieves this much hype it falls far below expectations. This book is one of the few that actually lives up to the excitement. A beautiful story with characters phenomenally developed and even an ending that satisfies. A very rare thing among the sea of \\"adequate\\" modern literature. Do yourself a favor and read this book. You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The novel is constructed in circular form as ...","review":"(***** = breathtaking, **** = excellent, *** = good, ** = flawed, * = bad)... a man from Afghanistan, now living in San Franciso in 2001, gets news from the old country that touches off all his shameful memories of growing up in Afghanistan in the 1970s, disappointing his ultra-tough father, and failing dramatically to be much of a friend to Hassan, a servant boy who thought of him as a best friend.Now he hears that Hassan's son is in trouble back in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, and he realizes he has a chance to redeem himself. Full chapter-by-chapter synopsis available (with spoilers, of course) at ImpatientReader-dot-com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving and heartfelt","review":"This book had me from the first paragraph and kept me reading eager to find out what would happen to Hassan and his young friend.

I too struggled to love this book but didn't. I finally just stopped reading about two thirds in. The story was there but I never arrived. I wonder, did the hero find redemption through the adoption of his betrayed friends son? I wonder, is my assumption correct? Well, I don't wonder enough I guess. I'll just assume it is, if not I don't care. Anybody wanna buy a book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great investment of your time","review":"Reading Kite Runner is a great investment of your time. The story is heart-rending with its plots and journey to a place we know little about and shows it as a very different place than we know today. I won't repeat the story's description since it's been done better than I could possibly describe. In fact, to put the experience of reading this book into words is difficult. One must experience that first-hand. This is a masterpiece for a first novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, emotional, educational","review":"Didn't know much about Afghanistan at all and couldn't put this book down. As much an anthropology for me as it was a powerful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for everyone","review":"It is rare that I actually send many people books because they simply have to read them. I have sent this book to so many people I have lost count. These are people of all religions, likes, and persuasions. This is a book you will remember for a long time and will read again and again. it is lyrical, engrossing, and touching. The author is so gifted at evoking emotions, landscapes, and times. Please do not miss this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are You Kidding???","review":"If this book is what this country thinks of as brilliant literature then I'd say our standards have sunk to a new low. There were times while reading the book when I had great hopes for Hosseini's writing. He does have a knack for describing places and creating an atmosphere. However, his dialogue, his plot and most of his characters are juvenile and derivative to say the least. His \\"bad guy\\" is one of the most ridiculous creations I've ever had the misfortune to encounter. No wonder Hollywood can't wait to make this novel into a movie, it reads like a bad script masquerading as \\"art\\". Believe me, If Hosseini didn't have the \\"cred\\" because he's from Afghanistan, this book would never, ever be the subject of so much fawning and hype. I was sorely, sorely disappointed because I came to it with high hopes. *Sigh*."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable soap-opera","review":"I found this book to be a disappointment. I enjoyed the \\"descriptive\\" passages; they were well-written. That said, the plot--and its \\"twists--were entirely predictable; the major characters almost stereotypes. Perhaps the basis for a \\"Hallmark\\" movie but not a piece of enduring literature, no matter its sentimental appeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"My mother recommended this book and I must say that it wasn't worth what little time I do have to enjoy reading a book. Hosseini was overtly revealing about things that were insignificant to the plot which annoyed me. I feel as though he forced some elements in his story and not in a good way like Vladimir Nabokov did. I agree that the overuse of attempted apprehension detracted from any potential this had to become a good, much less great book. I finished feeling cheated of valuable time and with a new sense of what\`s considered a \\"good read\\" by the overwhelming majority. But this is all one man's opinion; two stars for decent quality fiction. Thanks mom. I can't help but wonder if Oprah and Amazon have some sort of monetary arrangement..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Part travelogue, part propoganda","review":"Halfway through the Kite Runner, you realize that the book has metamorphasized from a memoir/paean to Afghanistan into bombastic political allegory. The book certainly fills a niche for those of us who are starving for knowledge about Afghani culture and daily life, and so I had the distinct sense that the book was rushed to market with clear marketing goals rather than given the time it needed to evolve into a solid work of literature.While Hosseini marvelously captures the culture and \\"feel\\" of pre-Taliban Afghanistan (whether he does so accurately I have no ability to judge), his characterization is too simplistic. Hassan, who in the allegory stands in for the Afghani people, is just saintly. The father is stern and proud. The villains evolve by becoming super-villains.After finishing this book, I realized I would have learned more by reading a true travelogue, without the necessity of wading through one-dimensional propoganda and clumsy political allegory."},{"rating":"1","title":".02c","review":"So much hype, unfortunately this novel was way over-rated. I couldn't take anymore of Hosseini's redundant sentence structure and stopped 2/3 of the way through...\\"The rifle roars with a deafing crack. I follow the barrel on its upward arch. I see the face behind the plume of smoke. I am the man in the herringbone vest. I woke up with a scream trapped in my throat.\\"This novel goes on and on with the 7 to 8 word sentences. Boring descriptions, predictable story, tired out characters.I closed the book. I returned it to the library. I wonder why society enjoys reading at a fifth grade level."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not good!","review":"Everyone loves this book, but I don't get it. The story is interesting, but I think a truly successful novel has a good story AND tells that story artfully. This book fails to do the latter. The second half is rushed and you can see the work the author put into the novel. By this I mean that you can actually tell when the author's editor told him to make changes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Whiny","review":"I hear people love the kite runner. The audio version was not so great. I was excited that the author himself was going to read it but the protagonist sounded so very pathetic, due to (i think) the particular phrasings and accents by the reader, that I couldn't end the book -- one must find the protagonist at least understandable but I had such contempt for him that I had no interest in continuing the audio version. I spoke to others who read the book and they didn't find the protagonist whiny or pathetic, which leads me to believe it was in the reading...who knows."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book stinks","review":"If you like books written by teenagers then oh boy is this book for you.It is poorly written about a boy who never lives up to his father'sexpectations. Boo hoo. Sob sob. And it's real nice reading about castsystems and race - again, as written by a teenager. I thought it must havebeen a translation but no suck luck. It's no wonder it landed on the bestseller list along with all the other tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic and predictable","review":"Maybe I had too high of expectations for this book, because it waa recommended by a friend, but I found the writing style amazingly simplistic, and the story trite and not novel in any way. It was difficult to like any of the characters in the novel, which made it hard to maintain any interest in what happened to the characters. I learned nothing about Afghan culture, other than some (I'm sure) oversimplified justifications for the way people act."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tale of enduring cowardice and betrayal.","review":"I am compelled to write this, my first Amazon review, as a warning. As clear an image as Mr.Hosseini relates, I don't want his characters, especially his central character, Amir, in my mind.Amir, though gifted in many ways, is a bone-deep coward who never outgrows his shame through repeated, lifelong betrayals of the people that love him. Even his final hope, a potential for an expected redemption, is both late and half-hearted, disappointing any misguided empathy.The story gives a sad, vivid glimpse into Afghanistan under the Taliban, and Mr.Hosseini has developed the story, and it's characters, very clearly. I just don't want my kids to imagine them. Ultimately, there is nothing redeeming here."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't know what all the excitement is about","review":"It basically comes down to being a somewhat interesting and sad story with a happy ending. That's about it. Really....I thought I was going to learn a bit more about Afgan culture, the Russian occupation and the Taliban. I guess I should have read more of a history book instead. I hope you find it more entertaining than I did. Not a real page-turner in my eyes, but maybe it will help you fall asleep at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"Having just finished this book, I am keen for everyone to read this wonderful and touching novel. The writer is very perceptive..managing to detail the heroes flaws yet keeping us, the reader, hoping for his redemption.I disagree with one reviewer who says it is a man's book..I think it is a book about the frailty and the strength of humanity. We are also given a slight glimpse into Afghanistan, a country we hear about constantly but fail to really know.The plight of Afghanis is examined and it is hard to come away from this book without having sympathy for these people.I also liked the way the book came full circle yet did not end with a neatly packaged \\"happy ever after\\" ending.Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fave book of all time","review":"There is no reason why you shouldn't read this book. I've never come across anything more thrilling and insightful as this book. Stop wasting time and read this book now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book had lots of story line and was well written. I gave it only 4 stars because the subject and topic has been overdone in the world of novels. If you don't mind reading yet another book about India...it is a very delightful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!","review":"When I first read this novel's description, I thought that nothing could interest me less than a novel about two boys growing up in Afghanistan. What could I, an American woman, learn from such a story? The answer is more than I ever hoped.This is a story of human struggle, redemption, loss, and forgiveness. It is a story of suffering and love. I laughed and wept and was deeply moved. You will be too.This is a novel everyone should read."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated as literature","review":"The plumbing is okay as are the rivetting plotted stylings of pulp fiction and as the book is meaningful at least in real world terms. However, it is a strange apple. It's adolescent fiction parading around, dressed up as literature. In this case, for me at least, the prose in its complete simplicity and in too many cases, flatness, hinders the message and the drama, that lies within."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, contrived and made for TV","review":"The worst sin of this book is not that it is trite, contrived and made for TV -- although it is all three of those in spades. Rather, the most appalling thing is that the author was so calculating in his taking advantage of the interest in Afghanistan, for his own profit. If you buy it, burn it. (I would have given it a \\"0\\" star, if the rating system permitted it.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Yawn","review":"So boring. Thin and watery. Milquetoast. Most unsatisfying.

The plot is an absolute straight line from here to there. What are supposed to pass as plot twists are as subtle as a cesspool on a hot summer afternoon. The only reason I finished it was to see if the happenings I had foreseen actually occured (they did, without exception).One word? Drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"Well written, but more depressing with the turn of every page.The stark differences between the characters polarized them to the point of not being believable, and it seemed that the story tried to intentionally deal with brutal issues to distract the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Typical","review":"First I am supposed to read The Secret Life of Bees. I did. I hated it. Next I am supposed to read The Five People You Meet in Heaven. I did. I hated it. Next I am supposed to read My Fractured Life. I hated it. Next I am supposed to read The Kite Runner. No surprise! I hated it. These are all books that only someone who likes mainstream books is going to like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful!","review":"This book was just awful. Boring, and without an interesting plot, the whole book can be summed up in four words: \\"Afghanistan really, REALLY sucks!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Kite Runner","review":"This book opened up a world to me that I never fully understood. Before reading this book I knew practically nothing of Afghanistan, or the city of Kabul for that matter. But after this book I understand so much more about what has happened over there, and also the impact it had on families.The Kite Runner was a fast and interesting read for me. It starts off with a young boy, Amir, and his quest to get his fathers approval. His obsession with this quest comes at a price though, and he ends up betraying his closest friend Hassan, and in the end, himself.Through out this emotional roller coaster of a story, Amir finally receives the approval from his father that he's always wanted, and finally makes it up to Hassan in a way that you never see coming. At the end of this book, you will wish that you could just keep on reading, and that the story never ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE This Book!!!","review":"This may be the best book I have ever read! Everyone in my book club loved it, some even saying it may be the best book they have ever read.The storytelling is masterful, engaging, and easy to follow. The story is gripping. One little note: about one-third of the way through the book there is a scene that upset me so much; I almost stopped reading the book. But the book wouldn't let me go, and after a day or two I had to pick it up and finish it. And I am so glad I did.I have one friend who didn't like the book because some of the events were too disturbing. There are disturbing events, but not unbelievable, and from the safety of my armchair, here in America, I was able to get through them.I don't give out 5 stars easily, but I would give this book more than 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The heart-wrenching story of a friendship.","review":"The Kite Runner, written by Khaled Hosseini, is a well-told story focusing on the firendship, betrayal and loyalty of two Afghan boys. Unthinkable lies are brought into the open. Startling plot twists capture attention and create shocking reactions. The personal redemption in this novel is enough to bring tears to a reader's eyes. I found The Kite Runner to be a very interesting and enjoyable book and I recommend it to various readers. This is really a heart-wrenching debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Afghan Story","review":"A very readable book. Authentic and moving story of Afghanistan within last few decades. A society, not modern by any measure but harmonious nevertheless, able to maintain order and balance at some level, but systematically destroyed, first by Russia then by Taliban. A disastrous encounter with modern World, another failed attempt at nation-building.Some of the characters are too black and white, cartoonishly evil or pure noble. Writing is not presumtuous. His generous use of Pashtun (never quite clear what language is actually spoken there) words made me realizie I had a good knowledge of a whole new language."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Really As Good As Everyone Says It Is...","review":"It's not often that I read a book that turns out to be as good as \\"they\\" say it is, but this was one that did. I wouldn't say that this book is riveting or one that you just can't put down, but the story was very interesting and I was sad to see it come to an end. Hosseini has created a main character whom you don't like, but are still interested in which makes the book a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"I've put off reading this book for about a year. I finally picked it up and reluctantly read it. What an amazing book! I got so wrapped up in the characters and the story that I found myself right there with them.

Wonderful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible and full circle novel","review":"This book was chosen for my book club and I was hesitant to read it. Now I'm so glad that I did.

An amazing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart wrenching tale of friendship and growing up!","review":"Every time i think about Amir and Hassan the hazara boy - my heart warm's up!The emotional roller coaster that Amir rides even now makes me think that this is a memoir by Khaled and not a fiction.the Taliban and the Afghan setting are portrayed wonderfully. Amir's insensitivity towards Hasan after his rape and the conflicts that he goes through are dumbfounding.I am going to regret putting this out to the world but - here you go! I cried for Amir's immaturity and wept for Hassan's maturity, the phrase \\"For you a thousand times, Agha!\\" is carved on my soul for eternity.It is a must read for friendship and loyalty from a man's perspective - and Khaled Hosseini is in my favorite writers list - with the top guns!"},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"I read this book a year ago for the first time and recently read again after seeing the movie...amazing story, amazing author"},{"rating":"2","title":"redemption???","review":"this book took me took me through a life of a person that i never grew to like. his good deed was not enough to win me over. i did enjoy the book but did not like the character and his spineless existence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was all right.","review":"At least it was an interesting read. I had trouble caring for the main character - he seemed like sort of a jerk. I mean, his best friend as a kid, and he wouldn't stand up for him etc? Wasn't believable not to mention terribly depressing. Even the \\"Happy ending\\" isn't happy at all. Everyone seems miserable. It reads well and it won't take you long to finish, but I had trouble connecting with the people in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful story, beautifully written","review":"I had just finished reading his second novel, \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" and knew I would have to order this book also. Incredible! Both books are so beautifully written, I couldn't put them down. He brings the Afghani people to life, and brought me to tears several times. He is definitely one of the best storytellers of our time. Don't miss this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Student Experience.","review":"In one word, i could describe this book as refreshing, however, this book deserves more than just a one word description. A passionate novel-not memoir, although it seems like one- that literally pulls you in and gives you a connection with the characters and the struggles they face. The Kite Runner also educates, as Hosseini sheds light on the world of the Afghani people and the division between their people. All most Americans know about the Middle East is from the media.And through the media,the people of that region are not shown in a positive light. In this diverse world, I enjoyed reading about people from another culture and religion and seeing that the are not that different from me. Anyone who enjoys reading should take the time to read this, because if a high school student can enjoy it, you can too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. As we search for an understanding of the middle east and it's inhabitants, this book forces you to feel a deep empathy for a life that we will never experience. I believe this book should be required reading for both it's subject matter and as an example of how a beautifully descriptive writer can change your view of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"For You, A Thousand Times Over","review":"A courageous and stunning work. A first novel? Evidently, we owe some appreciation to the author's writer's group in San Francisco. I don't have to say much more because there are more than 1,200 reviews already. I happened on the book before I heard about it and had no idea what to expect. I was selling books for a fundraiser and someone had contributed it. Then I sold it to a grateful bookbuyer who hadn't read it but had been hearing about it. Unforgettable, I said. It becomes part of the organic whole of yourself, I didn't say. Now, everywhere I turn someone's got it in their car and by their chair. It was 4:30 a.m. when I finished reading and knew I was changed.For this writer, a thousand times over."},{"rating":"2","title":"the kite runner","review":"This book did not disappoint! Well written, well characterized and well worth the time to read it. Would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlike any other","review":"It was unlike any other book that I have ever read. I wanted to hate the main character because of his weeknesses, selfishness, and cowardice. But I simply couldn't because most everyone at some point in their lives would like to shut their eyes and pretend like they never saw something happen. That was why I loved this book so much. It didn't give me a sugarcoated picture of human character. Instead it gave me a nasty helping of human nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Book","review":"I had to read this book for my senior year so I wasn't expecting much from a school assigned book, but I was completely blown away and I will recommend this book to anybody that is looking for an absolutely stunning story. I could not put the book down! It's about love, tragedy and the rocky road to redemption. It gives a riveting and real picture of modern day Afghanistan. The author did an amazing job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written","review":"This is the kind of book that you can't put down. I had trouble finishing it because I was crying so hard. There are some disturbing images and scenes, but overall, well worth the read. Don't pick it up if you have to be somewhere, you will have trouble putting it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatutiful","review":"This was an amazing book. Arrived on time & was in excellent shape. The story is so inspiring. Read it at least 3 times already over the last 2 years. Wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kite Runner takes you to another place","review":"Kite Runner really makes me appreciate growing up in America. Sometimes we don't realize how good we have it. We don't always see how much harder it is in other countries. No matter what culture you are from there are some things that don't need to be translated: Unconditional love, friendship, honor, respect are all covered in this novel. It also covers abuse, neglect, shame, guilt, and fear. This was a book that takes you to a different place (Afghanistan), a place that most of us would not be familiar with. Even though it's a different culture, I felt like I was right there with them. It was sad when there was loss, happy when there was joy, etc. You get to feel a lot of emotions when you read this one. This novel was certainly well done. There is a reason the reviews are so good. Read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Engaging, but juvenile","review":"While the story is certainly engaging, the plot development is predictable, the characters almost too perfect, and the writing a bit juvenile. I knew what was going to happen before I even turned the page, and not because of good foreshadowing.How many times do we have to read about Amir coming to terms with the horrible act that caused he and Hassan to become separated? After Amir's horrible pummelling, are we really expected to believe he makes a full recovery, so quickly? And how neat and tidy is it that we learn who the Taliban pummeller is? And that he ends up with a harelip, just like Hassan?I'm glad I read that book, but I can't understand why everyone raves about it. I wish there were more passages detailing the travesties of the Taliban, instead of yet another passage of Amir realizing how he did Hassan wrong.It becomes repetitive, culminating in a story that ends with a pretty bow on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible story","review":"I understand growing up here in the states is different that growing up in other countries, but when I read the first so 100 pages and the main character still treated his \\"friend\\" the way he did, I questioned my uncle's reasoning for saying this is \\"the best book he's ever read\\" I am an open minded person, but seeing how this child treated his friend who he knew would do anything for him. I wanted to tear the book apart and burn it. then find the man who wrote it and really just yell at him for writing such a filthy horrible story. I thought at first it really was a good book, then it turned ugly and horrible. I do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good","review":"Although The Kite Runner is a good read it is not and never will be a classic. It is a very predictable book which leaves a few loose ends. It is like a predictable movie which you still keep watching to make sure you were right about the ending. There are no strong female characters in the movie which just strengthens the stereotype of Afghan society and the female role in it. The cowardice of the main character is far too frustrating. The number of coincidences in the book make the story too unreal. The good thing of the book is the depiction of an Afghan refugee in America. It seems to be quite real. Afghanistan from an outsiders point of view seems to be more written from watching the country on CNN/BBC rather than a first hand account.Overall, you can read it but if you don't expect too much, you will enjoy it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Since when is humiliation entertaining?!","review":"If your idea of entertainment is reading about a child being sodomized while his \\"best friend\\" watches, too scared to intervene, then this is a perfect book for you. I bought it based on the positive reviews, but I have to say that a story does not need such vulgarity and brutality to be powerful and effective. Don't we read to escape from the harshness of reality?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the edition or printing of the book I wanted","review":"The book was good but Amazon sent me the wrong edition and printing.I only wanted a 1st edition and 1st printing of the book in hardback, I wish I could return it for the book version I ordered and wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-serving junk","review":"This book is horrible. The plot is so obvious it's embarrassing, the protagonist is a despicable coward yet the author clearly wants us to like and forgive him. Was it Shaw who said that a slingshot in the waistband of a 10 year old in act four must be fired by act five? It's not even particularly well written, and it is junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old same old...","review":"There is no doubt in my mind that this book will be on book club lists. It's not badly written, and it will keep you fairly interested. However, there is nothing new in this book. It's just another one of those novels about how someone's life in another country is just horrible. You know, one of those \\"pc\\" profound things we're supposed to read to keep us \\"culturally aware.\\" Seems that all you have to do to get published these days is put one of these novels out. I found myself rolling my eyes on many occasions. If it takes you a long time to read a book, don't invest that time in this one. If it takes you just a matter of 2-3 hours (and you have them to waste), by all means, dip into yet another of this stew of pretentious publishing malarky."},{"rating":"1","title":"caveat lector...","review":"While this novel does contain much rewarding material, potential readers should also be aware that its raison d'tre is a violent act of sodomy luridly and explicitly described by an author who apparently found a certain delight in the telling. Despite what other reviewers have claimed, the book has much more to say about this event than about conditions in Afghanistan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbed me","review":"I had to throw my book away because i was having nightmares of the little boy being raped. So if you have problems with the idea of a young boy raping another young boy dont read this. As I said I stopped reading this book and threw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking story, captivating writing.","review":"I think I read this a few years ago, but refound it on my bookshelf last week and couldn't put it down. Paints a great picture of one man's struggle with his inner demons and various relationships through life as well as a more general cultural picture of life as an Afghan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving and powerful story of Afghanistan","review":"Its hard not to love this book which is a tragic but moving story of Afghanistan. You'll experience a roller coaster of emotions as you read the story of Amir growing up in pre-Soviet Kabul, his new life in America, and his attempt to make amends for his past sins. This book is about culture, life, love, and pain. You'll leave this book with an aching heart for the people of Afghanistan. Its not necessarily great literature, but it is compelling and a quick read. This book is not as dark and disturbing as the author's second novel, but it is quite dark. I found this book very worthwhile. The movie was also well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"best seller?","review":"Okay, spoiler here. go away if you don't want to know what happens.I liked most of the book, I didn't know much about Afghanistan, so it helped me know something . BUT, as an adoptive parent of a child from central Asia, I nearly had a breakdown when he had to tell the boy he must go back to the orphanage. I had to stop reading and find a summary online about what happened next. okay, the boy attempts suicide, I nearly threw up on my computer.I could write the sequel to this. Poorly adjusted, sexually abused child, getting no psychological help from anyone, either DOES kill himself quickly, or slowly through drugs and alcohol. He would probably be put on many different mind-altering drugs until zombied out. He is committed to a psych hospital.I am not entertained by this plot device. Don't really see why it is a best seller. I won't read any more of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book discussion","review":"We chose this book for a book group I am part of and it was an excellent choice. We had a wonderful discussion, and learned so much about another culture and a part of the world few of us understand very well. For a first time effort, we are all agreed that we want to read more by this author. The story was illuminating, soul wrenching and yet hopeful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Story!","review":"The Kite Runner is probably the best book I've read in years. It has everything; drama, suspense and plenty of surprises. Do not miss this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Amazing read and can't wait to read Khaled Hosseini's next book! I absolutely loved the story of Amir and his journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb, as usual...","review":"I enjoyed this book as much as \\"The Kite Runner\\" and actually read it in one day, which left me sad since the author hasn't yet published a third novel. Hosseini covers such large, sweeping themes and takes you into a land that's so foreign and teaches you about their ordeals. But honestly, I fear that women all over the world experience the hopelessness that plague the protagonists of this novel. It made me appreciate my own husband more than ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"The kite runner","review":"The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini is one of the best books I have read in years. This is a page turner with complex characters and situations that will make you think hard about friendship, good and evil, betrayal, and redemption. It is intense and contains some graphic scenes; however kind of disappointment about the end but a great book by many measures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live The Life of Afghan People Through This Book","review":"For those who want to have a good understanding of the modern history of Afghanistan and how all the major events impact people's lives there, there is no better book than this one. Often, I'd be concerned that a book like this can be dry and hard to follow since most of us lack knowledge/background of the region. However, the author wrote very well. He led readers through the lives of the main characters with all the major political events in the background. He dropped hints about the destinies of the characters at the beginning of the book skillfully, making you want to know what exactly happened to them. The flow of the book is amazing - I can hardly put it down once I started! It is amazing that this is the author's first book. Because of this book, I now have more perspective on the lives of people in the Afghan community near us (Fremont, CA, where the second part of the story was based.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"This book does not compare to the other. It is the same type, but not as engaging. Didn't even finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Although this book was somewhat entertaining, I ultimately found it dissapointing. The characters are largely one-dimensional, even formulaic (the all-good devoted childhood friend, the sadistic bully, the conflicted protagonist who hits you over the head with his internal conflict ... over and over, the weakly drawn female afterthought). To make things worse, the plot twist in the second half of the book defy credulity, even for fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing story, couldn't put it down","review":"Just a great story with wonderfully complex characters. Probably the best book I have read this year. Hosseini makes us laugh, feel deep sadness and then redemption, a chance to be good again or something close to that. Read this book; You will not be dissapointed. I can not wait to start \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\".Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tear Jerker is a Tear Jerker","review":"Even with the tears streaming down my face, I knew this wasn't the real thing. I felt the author pulling the strings and soon could see each plot twist coming because it was needed to make his point. It's a shame because he can write well when he isn't trying to manipulate his characters and his readers. This is a perfectly balanced book - for every bad act, there's a redeeming act. If you like tidy, comforting books, this may be for you. Don't let the setting and politics mislead you, it's just a tear jerker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revolting tale of humanity","review":"For the first half of the book I was really enjoying it. Then towards the end the main character makes a pathetic deal with (what until then had been an imaginary) god to heal the boy. Then, most disturbingly, they bring a SAVAGELY sexually abused child to the U.S. and DO NOTHING TO HELP HIM!!! Did they think that the trauma would just...go away...? \\"Look how he smiled at the kite!\\" That is how psychopaths are created! What a revolting tale of humanity. The author is either clueless, lazy or steeped in cultural poisonous dysfunction. I won't bother with his other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"a parable for our times","review":"Kite Runner tells the story of the narrator's betrayal of his childhood friend and his quest for redemption in simple, linear prose. The strengths of this novel are the plot and subtle details that will move you as a reader and bring the character's surroundings to life, whether it's Khandahar, Afghanistan or Fremont, CA. The linear and almost plain prose style is an advantage in this story as it allows the character development, story arc, etc. to come through more clearly.My only critique is that some of the aspects of plot such as**SPOILERS***the childhood bully becoming the head of the Taliban group in charge of torturing his dead friends son, the fact that his father''s secret affair resulted in the dead friend being his half brother***END OF SPOILERS**are a little too coincidental and Dickensian in their neatness and timeliness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the read","review":"This is definitely a book that tugs on the heartstrings and makes the reader intent to find out what happens. Though the writing is not the most sophisticated I have ever read, it provides some insight on the historical occurrences in Afghanistan and reminds us that the same longings exist in each person, no matter their culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writing","review":"I enjoyed learning about the culture of the Afghan people thru the eyes of the narrator. The author takes the reader on a tour of the family values, the ethnic conflicts and the social structure of what it was like to live in Afghanistan before it was practically destroyed. The reader then learns of the unrelenting struggle required to survive in a country invaded by Russians forces and then taken over by the Taliban. Many families fled to the U.S. seeking asylum, safety and a new way of life shaped around their own traditions. It made me wonder about all of the Afghan immigrants that I have encountered while living in New York City. How many of them have fled similar circumstances?

I'll definitely be reading his next as soon as it comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I know why this book was on so many lists. . .","review":"I use Amazon a lot to find my next book. I kept running across The Kite Runner on different lists that contained books that I really liked.There are plenty of great, detailed reviews out here. I am willing to bet that one could spend more time reading the reviews than the actual book. I will cut to the chase.This Novel ranks way up there in my list of favorites. I felt \\"drawn in\\" every time I picked it up. From the very first page (I know, this sounds like the Editor's comments) I was hooked.I have a rule with books, you give a book/Novel 50 pages to convince you to continue. I think I was convinced on page one.I have but two complaints:1) It ended (Hosseini is such a great story-teller, I could have kept on reading for thousands of more pages...)2) I have no idea how Khaled Hosseini could possibly top this. For his first Novel, I think he may have set the bar too high. Though I cannot wait to find out.Read this Novel!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting. Absolutely riveting.","review":"I don't have a lot to add to the other reviews. This is the best book I have read in a long, long time. Amir, Hassan, and Sohrab will stay with you.

I'm sorry I didn't read it sooner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to remember","review":"I knew nothing about the history of Afghanistan before reading this book. This book is about ethnic cleansing and how he escaped to U.S. After reading the book, I am so grateful to live in this country where every nationality can live without fear. I would love to see the movie based on this book, such a beautiful story. Now I want to read a book on Afghanistan from a woman's view."},{"rating":"2","title":"I rarely give 5 stars, but this one is worth it","review":"Unbelievably great book that I still remember after reading only once. The storyline is exciting and the characters evoke true emotion. His writing style is smooth and you can read for hours because the dialogue flows well. I actually read almost all night because I just couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this story","review":"I read this book recently on the recommendation of a friend.

It'll do a lot and still fit in my pocket. Other knives do more but you need a belt holster to carry them. Slimmer knives leave me wishing for this or that at times (like a Phillips head screwdriver or a pair of tweezers). This one is perfect for me. I should have bought a dozen of them to guard against losing one from time to time for the rest of my life, just in case they quit making them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Victorinox Swiss Army Tinker pocket Knife (red)","review":"This is a good solid knife that doesn't take alot of pocket space.

I have destroyed several of them by using them for tough tasks. The knives can of course be dulled by being used on hard materials; this must be avoided. They are great for neatly cutting out UPC labels on cartons to send them for rebates, with less than full cardboard thickness. This use alone has made this knife a great investment. I used a knife sharpener on one large blade whenever it dulled and eventually it became the small blade. I broke the tip off a large blade. Worst, I turned the Phillips screwdriver too hard and twisted it partially out of the knife handle. Within the limits of what it can do, this item is indispensable. I find it a good size, not too big to carry in pants pocket, but with good size attachments. The toothpick is silly, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swiss Army Tinker","review":"The Swiss Army Tinker Knife is Great it has a lot of uses, this is my Third one over many Years, only because I tried to use it for something it wasn't designed for.

The author writes with wit and charm. The plot...well, it was a bit weak. Why would a witch in Texas be working for the British government, would not the USA government have made more sense? And why is a 272 page paperback $14.00? Even with a discount at Amazon it is over 11 bucks, hat is why I brought it used, and I am so glad. It is a nice light read, with charm and wit. Even with the minor plot flaw I enjoyed it and would have rated it higher but it just is not worth the price.

As a result, I only had a passing interest in the characters even though the spirit was fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, flirty, fun","review":"This book wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but I like to be surprised. The voice is hip and funny, the action zips along, and I found it a treat from beginning to end. Bronwyn is strong and likable, if a bit relationship impaired.I think the interesting thing about this book is that the diary style reads like a diary, not like a first person book posing as a journal. The character is honest, doesn't edit herself (though she spells a lot better than I do in my blog), and she enters only the things that interest her. Normally I like more detail into places and magic systems and world stuff, but Bronwyn knows those things, so why should she put them in her diary?Once I figured that out and let myself relax and \\"eavesdrop\\" on Bronwyn's exciting life, I was carried away by the engaging character and the fast moving plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get from the library","review":"I saw this on a library shelf. It sounded interesting. After three nights of trying to get into it, I gave up! I understand the diary format but it was a bit confusing. Times didn't match up.

Doesn't cost anything and you can always put a hold on books and have them delivered to your nearest branch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended...","review":"Hate to write a bad review on a book, but I have to say this book is pretty horrible. I purchased it hoping for a nice paranormal romance kind of novel with a decent plot. This book has neither of these. I found the plot slow and boring when the protagonist wasn't male-bashing. And I am usually someone who can read anything. It wouldn't have been so bad, except I paid $14.00 for this paperback. I'd recommend passing on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly awful","review":"One of the worst books I've ever tried to read.

But her characters are consistently annoying (what is up with the way the 5-year-old talks in this? She's old enough to be semi-coherent, and when she says stuff like \\"He broked it\\" her father should correct her!) and the situations are just ridiculous. There are several instances of thinly veiled racism (or at the very least, stereotypes) in this as well, which I found pretty offensive. Sorry, Ms. Herron, you've had more chances than most authors get. \\"Free\\" isn't cheap enough for your stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a horrible waste...","review":"This is by far one of the worst books I read.

Take this one to the beach, or on Holiday... Or as I did just sitting in bed all night cause I just had to know what happened next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute story!","review":"I enjoyed reading Under the Covers very much. Hunter was a great character and I loved that he was so devoted to his daughter, Lizzie. I could really identify with Abby because I was also a professional counselor, although I was never as naive (but charming) person as Abby. The secondary characters also had well-defined, three-dimensional personalities and you would have to look far to find sleazier villains. The dialogues were snappy and sparkling and they were lots of fun to read, with the exception of Lizzie's. I really didn't like the way that she spoke; it didn't seem at all to be the voice of a five year old. I have read Rita Herron's books before and I've always enjoyed her quirky sense of humor and this book lived up to my expectations. It was both well written and well edited and the story flowed smoothly throughout the book.

I have read everyone of their books and was less than excited about Cabinet of Curiosites. However, this book was good. It was a quick read and allowed us to see more of Special Agent Pendergast, who is turning into a fabulous character.The plot begins to fade at the end with a less than thrilling capture of a serial killer in underground caves (there is at least a recurring theme of being underground as is Pendergast's want), but the story is quite fun and the writing is compelling.It's definitely worth your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A creepy page-turner","review":"I don't know if you've missed Special Agent Pendergast, but he's baaaaaaaaaaaaack! On 'vacation' from hell, he gets involved into the mysterious happenings at the little town of Medicine Creek, somewhere in Kansas. You can expect many twists and turns as he investigates multiple murders that just keep on coming, never, of course, losing his cool.A definite must for all Lincoln Preston fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top rate entertainment","review":"See book summary above.Preston and Child. These are two names I love seeing on a book cover. What they deliver is pure entertainment. Fast-paced action with an original theme.The protagonist, Pendergast, is also a mystery in himself, but still one of my favorite characters.The action, along with a surprise ending, makes this an exciting and thrilling story.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad read......","review":"This book is not as bad as the major book reviews might portray it. Preston & Child know how to build a suspenseful story to its climax. The problem is that there are early indications as to who the killer might be. Relationships are the key to this book, and I had a good indication 1/2 way through who might be involved. That doesn't take anything away from two very fine suspense writers at the top of their games."},{"rating":"2","title":"time well spent","review":"As always, any book by these two is worth your time. Itstarts with a bang, then slowly builds to an unusual chase(in the dark) finale. The characters are easy to care about;especially Pendergast's \\"assistant.\\" As I was reading, Irealized that Pendergast is one of my two favorite characters--the other being Repairman Jack. I was a little bit let downby the ending as it seemed a rather standard plot device forthese great authors.

The plots are always engaging with plenty of twists and surprises to keep the reader guessing. I'm always predicting what will happen in a book, show or movie, but I always seem to be surprised with a Preston & Child book because each novel goes to unimaginable places without being unbelievable or wildly fantastical. My only complaint is the overuse of adjectives and vocabulary that at times comes off as pretentious and/or outdated. Other than that I strongly recommend that fans of authors such as James Rollins and lovers of history, science, and detective novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yus","review":"This book came pretty fast, which was great because October ended up being my reading month.

It is sent in rural Kansas and has a lot of interaction between Pendergast and small town law enforcement which was an interesting touch. The main story is eerie even by this series' standards. It starts as a presumed serial murder spree but takes an unusual turn as it progresses. Pendergast teams up with a local goth teen which is a bit of a precious plot twist but turns out OK in the end. A good example of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down!!","review":"So far I've read Relic, Reliquary and now this book. These authors are great! I couldn't turn the pages fast enough in this novel. It's a horror slash mystery novel that you will blow through in a couple of days.

Not only that but I don't know if a fifty year old malnourished human being who never had enough vitamin D for proper development could be strong enough to rip another human being's arm off.

If he did he would know that there is no way in hell this killer could be precieved as being a beautiful child like face.I'm sorry but in my opinion these guys had a one-struck-hit with the 'RELIC'and aren't able to pull something like that of again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"This book was amazing. And so scary. It was well written and I recommend that anyone who likes suspense to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"And the Pendergast \\"plot\\" thickens!","review":"I waited such a long time for this book but I admit the hardcover was more than I wanted to pay. Then I found an excellent used copy and I'm so glad I did. I've read all the other books in the series and I love Pendergast being the main character. And the \\"Ghost Warriors\\" aspect was fascinating! But there's still the big Pendergast mystery. Who is he really? I hope there will be another sequel out on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not as good as past books","review":"This book in which a killer is terrorizing a small town. While this is a good book these two have done better work. Such as there last book together and there first book. Read it but do not make it you first book of the two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Born With Crows","review":"They had me. They really had me. Killer on the loose. Pendergast on the investigation. Killings with strange, inexplicable clues. Then...we reach the end of the book and...BAM...Preston/Child have now officially succumbed to Crichton Syndrome (meaning it's impossible to end a book on a high note) Without revealing the ending for those of you who will want to read it, let me just say that it's the most ridiculous, ludicrous ending that I've read in a long while. I expect so much more from these guys and they have let me down in their last 2 books. C'mon guys. I dare you to top \\"Relic.\\" I dare you to surpass \\"Riptide.\\" I dare you.Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"A relaxed effort not a winner","review":"I guess the authors took a break on this one--it is certainly not up to their best. The plot is given away way too soon and is rather boring. They really have to stretch to tie up the loose ends by the last few pages, and one wonders if earlier they intended to write something else but got tired and just decided to use unconvincing explanations for why certain objects were used in the killings. This gets 2 stars just for the appearance of Special Agent Pendergast--though he too is on vacation in this one. Perhaps the writers should spend longer than a year coming up with new ideas. Given the authors' hot and cold reputation, one may want to wait for reviews before purchasing their next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice To Get Away from The NY Scene","review":"First off a lot of Pendergast novels deal with the same characters. While I enjoy the usual New York group of friends he calls on or rescues multiple times over, I really liked the fact that this book takes him away from all of that. This is a nice stand alone case that isn't tying into several other story lines/previous characters. It's a real gripping murder mystery that leaves you contemplating what kind of monsters are out there. It truly creeped me out. This story really holds it's own and it is one of my top recommendations to friends who have not yet had the fun of getting to know Agent Pendergast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seen better by these two.","review":"I was disappointed with this one. I LOVED Relic, Reliquary, Ice Limit, Thunderhead, etc. But this one was weak plot. Lots of gore and a forced plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast paced ride with lots of thrills!","review":"I might be biased here since these are some of my favorite authors. That said, I thought the book was great. I did figure out the ending but it was a twist that I got lucky on. I loved that one of the characters is reading what I assume to be their next book, Beyond the Ice Limit! Maybe we even get a bit of a preview:-) Anyways, this is a great book for those who love crime/mystery/science fiction mixed together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed","review":"Seldom am I dissapointed in a recommended book, however, this bookwas really weird.

Hopefully, the authors realize they have a winner with this character and the more works they use him in, the better! I eagerly anticipate the next Pendergast novel to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"\\"Still Life With Crows\\" is one of those books which one wants to like based on previous works by the same authors. While \\"Still Life...\\" wasn't a bad book--it kept my interest until the last scenes--it seemed to be too self-consciously written, self-referential, and tried too hard to be clever and funny, both of which it failed at. Featuring a sub-plot that seemed to go nowhere from their previous book, \\"Cabinet of Curiosities,\\" \\"Still Life With Crows\\" also featured the odd and eccentric FBI Agent Pendergast from the same story.Preston/Childs stories are always well-told, but this one isn't one of their best. Even so, I recommend reading this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for book","review":"It Arrived rather quickly, as stated, and came as listed. The binding is well worn, but the pages are perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This is a good book, hard to put down and enjoyable to read. Takes the reader to the midwest in \\"corn country\\" and does a good job of describing true life rural people in their rural setting. I believe the same story could have been told with a third less words, which is my only reason for giving it a four star review instead of a five. This is my first read of these authors and I'll definitely be reading more of their works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining but Predictable","review":"I liked this book - it was a quick, intriguing read that draws you in. My only objection was that it was too predictable. It seemed as though the authors went out of their way to make obvious aspects of this book different than some of their other ones - a teenaged girl rather than an academic, a small town in Kansas rather than New York City, etc. Unfortunately, the plot itself, particularly the ending, was pretty much the same old thing. These guys love the \\"scary\\" chase scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous Pricing","review":"19.99 for an ebook? Under $10 for the paperback? Sorry, this makes no sense. Glad I bought this one used at Half Price Books, send a message to greedy publishers that while they may want to kill the e-book trade, it's only going to empower the used book market!As to the book, i'd say this is the worst in the Pendergast series. Most of the others are amazing, but this one you can skip"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eeewww good to be true...","review":"Rarely am I challenged by a mystery novel. This one, however, was flecked with minor revelations and a final, jarring, and lingering surprise. It is a bit gory, but any forensic fan will find it interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of a \\"The Hills Have Eyes\\" Retread","review":"This here's sort of a retread of Wes Craven's \\"The Hills Have Eyes\\". It's been reworked as a serial killer mystery in a small rural Kansas village, with FBI Special Agent Pendergast appearing instantly on the scene while on vacation. I believe this is the 4th Pendergast novel and while I enjoyed the others quite a bit, I really couldn't wait for this one to end. A by-the-numbers thriller, with about as much life as the title implies. The SciFi/Supernatural element from the previous books is missing here as well. Nothing much happens in the continuing story framework, other than it seems someone else is in the house that Pendergast inherited at the end of the 3rd book. Recommend to skip this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining book... but not Preston & Child's best","review":"If you are already a fan of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, then you will like this book, which is another one featuring the popular character of Agent Pendergast.I personally did not prefer it as much as others because no other recurring characters (Laura Hayward, Constance, Nora Kelly, Smithback, Nora Green, etc) appear, and it is a standalone book. The character of Corrie acts as a pretty entertaining sidekick and interesting character, though I would be surprised to see her reappear in another novel of theirs.This book also one of their most gruesome in my opinion.If you are just starting to read Preston & Child, I would not start here. Maybe try Cabinet of Curiosities, which I think is one of their best books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not be fooled by the picture, it is missing important item","review":"I agree with previous reviewer that it come with missing piece and this is very unethical of seller.

Alterman has never been a part of the mainstream media so he relies on half-baked theories and circumlocutions to arrive at his conclusion. The conspiracies that Alterman hallucinates resemble the most absurd Rube Goldberg cartoon, while Bernard Goldberg's arguments and evidence are very straightforward. This book is trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"A liberal columnist can't get it right","review":"This book is a weak attempt to disprove the obvious. Alterman's liberal bias shows through completely. I notice he didn't mention Dan Rather, who is definitely a liberally biased newscaster. ...This book is just another laughable attempt to give life to the silly notion of a vast right wing conspiracy.Alterman doesn't even mention interviewing techniques. Liberal newscasters and morning show hosts always give softball questions to liberals they interview, but are always confrontational to republicans and conservatives. But, addressing this fact would repudiate the thesis of his book, wouldn't it?Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selective Evidence","review":"Alterman selects his documentation as carefully for his work as Bellesles did for his.

Not Eric Alterman and he'll tell you why the media is far more conservative than you think.

If they have anything to add, prevent them from rating it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alterman does reference.......","review":"I think that to be fair, and to gain an accurate and complete view of the political landscape one should not only read this book but also the right-wing counterpart, Slander by Ann Coulter.If you read both books and do a quick search on lexus-nexus,you will realize something; while both authors use citations, Ms. Coulter does NOT present her sources out of context."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suspicious","review":"I feel this argument is like trying to convince another whether the glass is half full or half empty. I think that a lot of us project our own suspicious insecurities onto the news that we watch. We can listen to either side's cries of conspiracy and take in valid points from both, without becoming unreasobly fearful and hysterically accusatory. But admitting this does not thrust us into the drama that a partisan war creates and therefore we feel compelled to choose a side. Choose if you have to, but consider what you might end up sounding like:(another reviewer writes) \\"This shift has been strictly engineered, with maximum efficiency, by a large cabal of millionaire conservative wackos seemingly hell bent on creating a one party system for this country.\\"Sound a little paranoid? Maybe it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Liberal Obfuscation","review":"This writer uses one of the oldest tricks in debating to prove his point, that there is a conservative bias in the news media. What he does is to skip the need for proof and says that everybody knows the media is conservative. If you accept his argument, he does not need to prove anything, and he doesn't. He then goes on the attack, belittling many of the very people who do use proof showing a liberal bias: Bernard Goldberg in Bias. The book has no proof, uses no intelligent arguments, and supports no evidence other than, \\"I said it therefore it is as I said!\\" The book is not even worthy for use in the outhouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes his point","review":"This is a fun book to read if like me you are fed up with the right wing press complaining about how 'Liberal' they are. People who have read the book will understand that Alterman is not really trying to prove that the media is 'Conservative', he is actually showing that it is something else, completely irresponsible, sloppy and pandering to its owners and advertisers.Alterman does dish it out to people like Ann Coulter but no worse than Coulter dishes out to others. But the biggest indictment of these people are their own words. Coulter saying talking about assasinating Clinton, and yes pretty much anything that Rush Limbaugh says.If the media really did have a left wing bias Alterman would have been on as many talk shows touting his book as Coulter and co. Somehow the invitations don't seem to be made to liberals, funny that."},{"rating":"2","title":"read the book, then review it, ok?","review":"I get a little upset when someone reviews a book without having read it. To say that this book isn't worth discussing or debating is very short sighted. It's a critical question, and it is one that Alterman answers in an annotated and clear, convincing manner. First of all, he has been writing on this subject for years, and he is actually a journalist, something that most people who call themselves journalists should take note of. If you don't believe that the media is anything but liberal, look what has happened to Peter Arnett when he hasn't toed the line when it comes to reporting on a war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alterman is right on the mark....again!","review":"If you like Eric Alterman's columns in the Nation, or read his online blog, this book is a must. His analysis of the great American corporate-sponsored media hits home. The right wing for years would have us believe that there is some sort of liberal bias, or even more outrageous, a liberal control of the media. Alterman points out the fallacy of this, and the hard right turn the media took in the post Watergate years. Conservatives have done an admirable job convincing the American public that the media is controlled by the left, when in reality the exact opposite is true. Alterman's book turns the table on the likes of Ann Coulter and points out which side are the slanderers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I might find this book useful...","review":"... if I owned a cat and wanted to provide that cat with a comfortable place to squat.

I was interested in examining the other side of the issue but this book is guilty of what it claims the extreme media such as Rush Lindebaum do. In short it argues from emotion and biased. The author had an opportunity to he intellectually honest and discuss facts with his readers but instead spent his time bashing the other side. All the rhetoric bores me on my fact-finding mission.

Can anyone make any sense out of that statement?\\".The reader from Lakewood, Ohio took this statement out of context. The comment was that the French along with Eric Alterman were so liberal and leftist, that in comparison the liberal couple of Bill and Hillary Clinton are considered moderate in comparison.This statement appear to be intended to show that different people come from different perspectives of liberal, moderate, and conservative. Then the reviewer from Bristol, TN went on to say that since Eric Alterman was so far to left of most Americans and liberals in particular, that Eric Alterman would view all media sources other than the leftist \\"The Nation\\" as conservative.The debate on liberal and conservative bias is based on your own personal perspectives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please!","review":"The premise of this book is nonsense. The newsrooms of America are permeated with liberals in denial about their biases.

(It's astonishing how much time he spends on this!) In the author's mind this somehow disqualifies them, never mentioning the educational credentials or work experience of either of these highly successful women.When he's not talking about Laura Ingraham's mini skirt, he rambles on making bold assertions without providing a single piece of supporting evidence. According to the author, Richard Nixon was more liberal than Al Gore, but he never gives an example of Nixon's alleged liberalism (or is it Gore's alleged conservatism)! This is just one example. There are numerous other unsubstantiated claims.The book never makes the point of its title, quite the contrary. The author spends most of the time whining about journalists that are more successful than he."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable attempt...","review":"What you need to keep firmly in mind when reading this is that the author is a strident liberal, so his frame of reference for his subject matter is already skewed. There were many factual inaccuracies in his book that have been picked apart already ad nauseum, but the main point is that he tries to prop up his argument by comparing supposedly factual broadcast news to examples from conservative commentators. You simply can't take Ann Coulter, a rabid social conservative, and Sean Hannity, a Republican shill, and say that because this is so obviously right-biased that NBC's nightly newscast is centrist by comparison, because they aren't comparable media. I read it hoping that the absurd title was just an attention grabber but no, if anything it becomes even more ridiculous the deeper into it you get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book, even worse idea","review":"This book was terrible. Not only to Bernard Goldberg's book crush it in sales, the country widely believes the media is liberally biased. If this election didn't convince you, you've been living under a rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"The perefect example of the problem with the media","review":"The author creates his own definitions and believes he proves a point by merely explaining his own a-priori assumptions. The bias is not just in the ratio of talking heads but in the assumptions made and excuses accepted. The mainstrem media never challenges the intellectual failings of liberal politicians. Lets face it - Ted Kennedy, Al Gore, John Kerry, John Edwards, Cynthia McKinny, Robert Byrd, Mary Landrieu, Barbara Boxer, and many many more are not bright people - but the media treats them with kid gloves....Conservative with low wattage brains are considered fair game."},{"rating":"2","title":"A carefully researched look at trends in the media","review":"Eric Alterman's book is a fascinating read and revealing look at the gradual shift the media has made to the right. Moreover, he exposes the intellectual dishonesty of many of talk radio and TV \\"talents.\\" It is obvious that he is passionate about his subject - and at time can be a little too dogmatic. At the same time, his careful research and thoughtful presentation stands in direct contrast to the shoddy work of some authors on the right who argue that the media is liberal. Give the book a read and decide for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of the audio CD","review":"I ordered the audio CD. First of all let me say that Eric Alterman is correct in his assertions and I completely agree with most everything he says (although his partisanship is strong to the point of being annoying sometimes with his Gore/Clinton love). So, that is why I gave him 5 stars.With that said... DON'T BUY THE AUDIO CD, BUY THE BOOK!No offense Eric, I'm sure it was hard to read the book aloud, but you've got a terrible reading voice. I had a difficult time understanding what you were saying at first. I think it took me until the last CD to actually get used to your voice. The CD's also seem kind of quiet."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Big Fix","review":"Anyone who hasn't followed the TV/Print media from the seventies on just might buy into the notion peddled by conservatives that there is something called liberal bias in their dailies. That the truth is totally the reverse is obvious to anyone who has watched said/same liberal media seem to bite the dust. The public has been knocked senseless by this propaganda tide. Alterman does a very good job of skewering this Big Lie and exposing the Big Fix that has been going on, especially since the Reagan years when the really vicious streak and lowball vulgarity began its ominous career. Let's hope there is still a chance for a comeback. I think there is because it can't get any worse unless it turns fascist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liberal who knows that all conservatives are not evil!","review":"This is a surprisingly candid appraisal of the media's move to the right (following the country's rightward movement). While it is partly a polemic, it is hardly a direct response to Bernard Goldberg's overstated book, \\"Bias.\\" An iconoclast, Alterman hardly hews the party line for the liberals. It is a good read for both conservatives and liberals as long as one retains a good skeptical ear. I liked it very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and Invaluable","review":"This is a first-rate piece of work, clear, tough, self-aware and often brutally funny. It's also remarkably fair, praising journalists as well as criticizing them--even praising the rare non-liberal journalist, such as Michael Kinsley, who is able to think for himself. I cannot recommend it too highly. My only criticism is that the book is not good for one's blood pressure, and you will finish it hoping never to encounter certain public figures at parties or on the street for fear of what you might say or do to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bogus bad reviews","review":"One only has to ask how the media would have handled almost any point in the first 2 years of Mr. Bush to know Erik is right.

They have learned sophistry well at the feet of that Great Sophist Limbarggh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent primer on the conservative media","review":"I picked up this book with hopes that it was not 200+ pages of name-calling and put-downs (i.e.: the 'conservative' method sometimes employed by liberals to compete with conservatives). I was pleasantly suprised. I wish I had been able to read it one year ago! I found it to be thorough and complete discussion of the conservative media, from print to tv to the internet.I have spent the last year roaming numerous websites to become familiar with the conservative and liberals pundits I see peppered throughout the industry. If I had read this book sooner, I would have had the information in half the time.I would highly recommend purchasing this book regardless of whether you identify yourself as conservative or liberal, simply for the conciseness of information. I highly suspect I will refer to this book numerous times in the future when identify names and media affiliations to friends and peers in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"O yes, it's Grimmer! :> but well worth it","review":"About 20 years or so ago, I first sat down on a bookstore floor to begin the book, and hunted it down for myself years later. Some of the tales so haunted me that I had to find them and reread them to see if I recalled them rightly, or had confused them. Tanith Lee's style makes for a perfectly warped yet new angle to see fairy tales from. Was Snow White's stepmother Queen so wicked? Was Cinderella so abused? Did the Brothers Grimm ever make you ponder such things? If not, the Sisters Grimmer will!Please be warned, if the macabre and morbid are not your cup of tea, you won't like this. But if you can stretch your mind, allow other images and/or interpretations to be possible, lush and frighening that they might be - then I highly recommend the Princess-Royal of Fantasy. :> And if you've tried her Paradys books, that will prepare somewhat for this - not always as colorful, but as starkly mad.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a MUST for fans of new takes on old fairytales","review":"I took a cutting of the title story, \\"Red As Blood,\\" to the State Speech Tournament in Prose Reading. Tanith Lee's beautiful prose is at its height in this collection; even the stories that weren't my favorites were so wonderfully descriptive I couldn't help but read them through. I think the best stories in this are \\"Red As Blood\\" (Snow White), \\"When the Clock Strikes\\" (Cinderella), and \\"The Golden Rope\\" (Rapunzel). The only reason I don't give this book a 10 is that one or two of the other stories weren't as interesting as the rest, which was a bit of a letdown. However, this is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Grim Yet Beautiful Fairy Tale Retellings","review":"Exploring the other side to many classic fairy tales in a fluid and sharp prose style, this book is unforgettable high art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tanith Lee plus fairy tales equals perfect combination.","review":"Tanith Lee is a poetic writer which works perfectly with the re-telling of fairy tales. My only complaints is this book is out of print. Too many of Tanith's works are hard to get. Somebody really should do something about that and while they're at it, how about a generous volume of Tanith Lee short stories. Some of her short works are available in smaller volumes such as \\"Tempting the Gods\\" but I would love a door-stopper sized collection. Until then I'll have to be satisfied with the few thinner collections out there and using Amazon to find these out-of-print treasures."},{"rating":"1","title":"permanently stalls halfway through game","review":"We had a CD of this game that permently stalled before we were halfway through it.

After reading \\"The Gatekeepers\\" I have gained a greater insight and understanding to God's plan of prosperity. I was raised to believe that it is wrong for Christians to have wealth. Therefore, I had no clue that it is indeed God's plan and desire for His followers to be prosperous.

The author touches little on any substanative military or psychological theory that might be of use to any professional member the military or law enforcement. This book is nothing more than a collection of the infantile ramblings and anecdotal, \\"war stories,\\" of an ego-inflated right-wing extremist. The content, organization and basic writing craft exhibited by the author, falls well below what is to be expected from a professional writer, not to mention a professional soldier. This book is not for the serious student or practitioner of interrogation. The book reads like the pure trash and tripe that comes out of a publication such as,\\"Soldier of Fortune,\\" Magazine. As far as Mr. McDonald is concerned, I have this to say, you are an embarassment to both the US Military and intelligence profession. I want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Make 'em Talk","review":"This book casts more light on Patrick McDonald's personality disorders than it does the the subject of interrogation. In the course of my 22 year career in law enforcement and corrections, I have never seen an instance where Patrick McDonald's loosely formed ideas would be relevant to an interrogation practitioner. Mr. McDonald comes off in this book more like a person who would more likely find himself in the position of being interrogated by a policeman rather than conducting an interrogation! From an academic point of view, Make'em Talk is not to be taken seriously. This is nothing but a venue for McDonald to validate his improverished ego and self-image by making himself out to be much more than he is. I deal with this same genera of pathological behavior in my work in counseling youth offenders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read","review":"I agree with the other reviewers.

Rather, it gives a great foundation for moving on to those subjects through clear coverage of the data storage and architecture models as well as many of the great monitoring tools available to SQLServer7.

Upon calling customer service for setup support, I was told that they could send out BY MAIL new adapter plates, meaning that I would have to wait 14 days. Also, their fix for the crooked display was that they would send me a new washer to replace the defective one. This product was a complete disappointment and so was the customer service!

Pictures of spraying lacquer with no nose or eye protection and instructions such as \\"insert a sheet of asbestos to protect the top\\", might raise a chuckle and date the text a bit but Sloane's writing is clear and to the point.

I'm contemplating whether to send it back or just junk it to avoid the hassle. The nine year old machine I bought it to replace has better sound quality. Apparently the quality varies from unit to unit. It is a roll of the dice and I got snake eyes. On the unit I received, even the clearest messages are difficult to hear. Many are unintelligible. Even the pre-recorded announcements that tell you such things as how many messages are on the machine are so badly garbled they are difficult to understand.

However, what the reviewers do not say and what GE or the company that now owns and sells GE electronics do not say is that this machine is virtually useless if you have DSL Internet services. I have tried it with and without the DSL filter and the results are pretty much the same. To put it bluntly the product really sucks in this capacity.

That machine had the exact same defect.I wanted to be able to give this answering machine a good review, I really liked the features and it was very user friendly, but with messages so vulnerable it is useless to me.

I must admit that the answering machine has a very good interface. The problem is that a few months after I bought it the speaker started making this crackling sound. It sits on a desk where we're working and it's very annoying to listen to this continuous random crackling noise. It was inexpensive, so I just bought another one. A few months later, the new one started doing the same thing! I assume there was some sort of manufacturing defect. I just can't figure out why I don't see anyone else mentioning this problem. Maybe this issue has been fixed by now, but let this be a warning that yours may do this too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great features, but unreliable","review":"In terms of features & price, this answering machine is one of the best deals you can get. With 4 separate mailboxes and 40 minutes of digital recording time, what's not to love, right? Well, after less than a year of use, the answering machine no longer answers incoming calls. After 4 rings, the outgoing message begins to play from the speaker, but the answering machine never picks up! It took my wife and I several days of not getting any messages to figure this out. Who knows how many important messages we missed because of this? Very infuriating.We have since replaced the answering machine with a Sprint SP-812 that we picked up used from Craigslist.org for $10.

A phone reset did not correct the problem with the answering machine.

Then I tried Amazon.com and found it about eight dollars cheaper and received it in a matter of 3 days. I think it's a great machine to have and I've never had any other problem with it. Once I followed the instructions on programming it, it was ON, like popcorn. That's a little slang my grandkids taught me.

The Deep Repair Cream used to make my skin feel enveloped in moisture, but not heavy, just beautifully, perfectly moisturized. With this jar, I felt like I needed two applications in order to keep my skin from feeling dried out. The conditions in my apartment have actually gotten less dry lately since the heat has been on less with the warmer, more humid weather. While the old formula used to be super concentrated and I could use very little and feel completely moisturized, I went through this jar in twice the time, so its just not worth the money to me.

I forced myself to finish it, because I apparently hate myself. The author tries to be clever and unique by bolding the words, sigh and end on each page, linking it to the title of the novel. He also uses one phrase repeatedly (approximately every 1-2 pages), which isn't even a good phrase and becomes quite annoying.There are numerous grammar and spelling errors, which are clearly mistakes and not some original use of the English language. The plot could have used some work. If you want a good novel about changing time continuums, then read The Time Machine. Don't waste your time reading this one. Save your money. Buy something else.Every Sigh, the End: A Novel About Zombies"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this, but about 1/3 into the book (still no zombies) I had to force myself to finish. The main plot was a really good idea, about a zombie reality TV show and the millennium, but it had too many jumps and flashbacks that talked about nothing and didn't hold my attention. It is also one of the few books where I wanted to see the main character, Ross, get killed so he would quit whining. And the time travel/astral projection sub-plot?!?! I won't even comment on that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zombies+ Bret Easton Ellis = this book","review":"I can't believe that someone has not noticed the similarities in these books.

For horror fans, its original mixture of bumbling, sullen twentysomethings struggling with life in an America going CRAZY toward the Apocalypse ... and zombies ... and family-perpetrated cruelty ... and ... and ... the book just seems like something the author didn't know where to take, so it danced around and made such a mad jig that the thing thrills me to the core.This is a book about America and the world, and makes the year 2000, which has been gone for years, seems suddenly relevant and frightening again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and not really about zombies","review":"Avoid this novel if you are looking for a book about zombies. The writing tries to be way too clever for its own good and fails miserably. The plot is often confusing and the zombies don't appear for a long time, and when they do it doesn't make any sense at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Money","review":"Written in a format that I feel was an attempt to be original and clever, but reads worse that chinese stero instructions, just as frustrating and overall, I feel was likely and attempt by the author to impress himslef with his unique vision and story telling ability.

And boy can I not thank enough for the chance that brought me there.I have to agree with most other reviewers - this book is the best. It has become my guiding star in the weird world of CSS at a time when I almost gave up on making sense out of it.It has that perfect size when it is still small enough to read it full. And yet it has all the needed details to give you the full picture. That precious feeling of having the full picture - it was lacking after trying to read through multiple other book volumes and sifting through dozens of Web sites. This book at last gave me the foundation to lean on.The author clearly has a talent of explaining things.I only wish this book had been written 6 months earlier when I just started looking into CSS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Dosnt treat you like their target audience is new to computers, but still covers everything from the basics to advanced css with great details and examples. Amazingly enough the book actually flows nicely from topic to topic and is enjoyable to read unlike most technical books. I highly recomend this book if you are interested in developing webpages with proper css and are a quick learning beginner or intermediate to web design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Beginners","review":"The style of the book is well laid out, and gets to the point pretty quickly with some practical beginner's concepts in the use of CSS.CSS books have a tendency to waste a lot of paper preaching about the importance of separating design from logic and blah blah blah, whereas this one only skims that topic and gets into the basics of CSS positioning and styling within the first 2 chapters. Concepts such as the box model and CSS hacks are explained pretty clearly - at least they made more sense to me after reading those chapters.My one issue with this book is that the author could have used a more appealing design to have the reader work on at the end - would have made a bit more sense given the need for CSS to be used in creating good looking layouts. Apart from that, it's a good read - but NOT for advanced CSS users."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-par","review":"There's not really anything this book does well enough to recommend it to anyone.

It's a light overview of css, with only basic examples. Disappointed for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful Instruction","review":"As the title of my review states, this book provides - with its conversational tone and very clear writing - a delightful nuts-and-bolts take on important aspects of CSS coding. It really feels as if the author is at your side, even anticipating your questions along the way.It helps if the reader has read at least one primer on (X)HTML and CSS before starting this book. A mark-up/presentation language newbie can certainly benefit from this book. But with an introductory text behind him or her, the reader can really appreciate the best-practice advice Charles Wyke-Smith has on offer here.Can't wait to read the author's \\"Codin'\\" book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I have seveal books on CSS but this one is my favotire.

The author explains CSS very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, concise and funny","review":"Charles Wyke-Smith has written a very clear CSS book. I thought it might be too elementary. No way! It helped me right from the first chapter, and I've been coding in CSS for 5 years. I'm so glad to have this new tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"It makes the complex simple","review":"I had dabbled with CSS but did not really understand it. In fact I was intimidated by it because I had heard several other IT professionals say that they just didn't get CSS. This book was so clearly written with such great typography that I felt I completely understood how CSS works by the time I was halfway through the book and that I could understand the most complex use of CSS by the time I finished it. If you want to understand how to use CSS I know of no other book that comes close to \\"Stylin' with CSS\\" in depth and clarity. Whether you are a beginner or an old pro I am sure you will find this book easy to understand but comprehensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CSS Reference Book","review":"I have read various books on CSS and this is by far my favorite.

It is so much better than the other \\"chick lit\\" novels I have read of late. I could just picture Clarissa and Paris Hilton hanging out at The Ivy. Definitely recommended for a fast entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!!!","review":"I try usually to give a writer some respect and finish the book. But this garbage was beyond endurance. The main character was horrible and after 20 pages I threw in the towel and the book. I am not even going to trade it for a new book. I am going to dump it in the trash where it belongs. Wouldn't want some other unsuspecting poor thing to pick it up.I don't mind a heroine having some character flaws but this was just too much. I used to live in L.A and I didn't like the shallow social climbers then and I don't like them in the book. I thought it would be a hilarious send up(those desperate girls are begging for it) but it wasn't funny at all. I guess her famous connected husband pulled some strings to get this insipid poorly written book published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful and boring","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book after the reviews posted.

In fact, it may be the worse book I have ever read and I have read a lot of books. The plot was lacking and total idiotic, the characters were cliched and truly loathsome and worse of all, the editing was non-existent. I have heard this book described as fun and light and instead argue that it is torturous to read. I truly believe the only reason this book was published was because of the author's married name. It just goes to show that in Hollywood it's not about one's talent but about the talent they marry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moralistic Tone-Ambitious but Empty","review":"Hello, if this book had been written by anyone else it would be hardly noticed. The writing is awful, a 1 out of 5, and the plot is very empty. There is a lot of talk about things that already happened, a girl decides love is what she wants after all, and there is a moralistic ending.Cue Christian romance novels.In Christian romance novels of the 50's there was always an evil girl or boy and one was redeemed at the end.Explicit sex followed by a moralistic tone?Feed it to 12 year olds.You will only be entertained if you are under 20.Everyone has been there and done that.The writing is really awful. ...Sandy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This book was so bad that I feel compelled to offer a review any and every where I can just to save other poor readers from it. It's plot line is predictable and boring. I would be hard pressed to say that there was even one original thought in the entire book. I see now why Ms. Grazer felt the need to apologize to her parents in the dedication. I would call for a refund!"},{"rating":"2","title":"guilty pleasure","review":"This book was a guilty pleasure. The impressive thing that Levangie Grazer manages to pull off is that it's about the LA rich and shallow, yet I still cared about the main character and her quest to marry well. As the \\"wife of\\" the author knows first hand about the sharkfested Hollywood culture, yet she manages to satirize those she is swimming alongside. I thoroughly enjoyed sitting by the pool on my vacation and getting to enjoy that world without actually having to be in it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, fun, FUN. All empty calories ... but tasty nonetheless.","review":"The characters are so shallow and one-dimensional (almost) that you have to love them. The sheer chutzpah of Clarissa, delivered with an almost childlike ignorance. Sure, she's shallow... sure, she's self absorbed, materialistic, and narcissistic... but she's actually likable and funny. And the single-minded determination with which she pursues her (seemingly) unsuspecting victim is so fun to read that I couldn't stop.The Star Chamber (her gaggle of friends) is like a meeting of every girl you ever knew when you were in HS. And the LA men are... well... LA men. Shallow, beautiful birds. I fell in love with LA all over again.I laughed, I cried (a tiny bit), I gasped in outrage and surprose, I stayed up until I finished it. I recommend it for a light enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"MANEATER","review":"I just received this book a couple of weeks ago. I have not yet read it, and therefore cannot give it a review. However, it was highly recommended to me by two co-workers. Other than that, I did receive my product in a timely manner, which is very important to me. This was my first time to do business with Amazon, and it was a pleasant experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"What LA is that?","review":"Whenever I read a book set in \\"LA\\" I ask myself-- who are these horrible, sick, twisted people??? As a Los Angeles native, I've never had the misfortune to meet anyone as disgusting as the Clarissa-types. While I knew the book wasn't exactly going to be literature, I got tired of the mean spirited, shallow, self-serving \\"humor\\" and profanity. A spoof or a satire might make an amusing short story, but page after page after page after page of the same snotty, rude and \\"not-funny jokes\\" are not only tiresome, but aren't a good substitute for a good, entertaining story. As I said-- what horrible, sick, twisted characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make no mistake, This is Chick Lit.","review":"Based on the hype, I was expecting a well-written novel with some depth, in the vein of Candace Bushnell/Laura Zigman, and instead what I got was something that could have just as easily been a Little Red Dress Ink property.The characters aren't anything close to loveable, the trite cliches are not just peppered throughout the book, they are poured over every conversation that takes place.PLEASE don't waste your time with this. Read \\"Trading Up\\" or \\"Cooking for Mr Latte\\" or \\"Family Trust\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The main character reminded me of a Monica Lewinsky wanna-be. If you want a good read, try Trading Up. I wish I'd checked out Maneater from the library. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Funny","review":"This book will make you laugh so hard! The main character becomes more and more endearing as you read on and her take on the world is absolutely hilarious! Also, Grazer manages to perfectly capture the modern world we live in and all of its trivial luxuries that are so much fun to mock yet even more fun to enjoy, at the same time. Light and easy- good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soooo Bad","review":"Although I think Sex and the City, the book, was just average (unlike the TV series, which was fantastic), by comparison with Maneater, Gigi Levangie Grazer makes Candace Bushnell look like Leo Tolstoy.Oh, my God, I can hardly believe how bad this book is. Clarissa is one of the most annoying and shallow characters in publishing history, and there's nothing in the \\"people\\" who surround her that's is even slightly interesting. I would criticize the plot for being stupid, but it's more accurate to say that there's no plot--and not a single well-written sentence either.The only thing Maneater is good for is as proof that today in publishing is not what you know, but who you know. If Gigi weren't the wife of producer Brian Grazer, this ridiculous novel would have never left the slush pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny stage for a hilarious comedy","review":"Hoolywood and Los Angeles entirely contemplated from a woman's point of view, and not any woman, but a young woman who wants to marry a rich man. Her theory about that manhunt, her practice of that sport, her prey and her hunting technique that leads her to a quick marriage and a quick pregnancy. Unluckily she did not check who the man really was and accepted who he was supposed to be. Of course he is not who he is supposed to be and this leads to a tremendous imbroglio. The book is funny, extremely funny and positively optimistic. The author does believe in love and does believe love can survive any small or big detail that may be thought as capable of pooping the party. In other words, this book is not - and it does not pretend to be - very deep about women or Los Angeles. It is a vivid and dynamic picture of the scene and the action that takes place on that scene, or shouldn't I say that stage. Entertaining and relaxing.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the required effort...","review":"Only rarely have I not finished reading every page of a chosen novel, but this uninteresting story with uninteresting characters has become one of those instances. Thankfully, it must be returned to the library, and I can finally start reading something worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody awful!","review":"I'm a fan of all kinds of books and can usually say something nice about them (even the ones I didn't particularly like). In a nutshell: I didn't even finish this book. I didn't want to finish the book! It's supposed to be a witty story of an \\"IT-girl\\" type heroine who wants to land a husband. However, the way it was written makes you not care about the protagonist. This story was written pretentiously with over-the-top descriptions about people \\"in the biz,\\" and many side comments about people in the book (in parenthetical form) that make you just want to roll your eyes at them. It was very hard to like this book, the characters in them, or to even find the story remotely interesting.

And there were so many she loved! It is a sweet story that demonstrates the art of giving and kindness (as well as those who don't show those qualities), as the central character seeks a home.

Terrible Script!","review":"There is almost no character development in this movie. Within the span of ten minutes the two characters, Barbara and Sheba (Dench and Blanchett) meet, become friends, then Barbara becomes obssessed with Sheba and Sheba becomes obssessed with a teenage boy. The acting by the two principles is great. The script is terrible. It is shoddy, slipshod, and totally unbelievable. Dench makes a \\"creepy\\" obsessed lesbian with a penchant for younger women while Blanchett is perfect as an unfulfilled wife and mother with a penchant for young boys. Worth a look for the great acting but if you want a good story.....forget it. The ending is predictable and stupid as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't make a good movie with a bad book","review":"Well, I haven't read the book, but it's probably airport trash. Barbara \\"Covett\\"? Bathsheba \\"Hart\\"? Steven \\"CONnelly\\"? We're talking Joan Collins level, or a bodice ripper that Fabio is on the cover of. I'm amazed that two great actors would find anything to give of themselves to this exploitative, prurient stupidity. Only in terms of taboo breaking does this film have any impact. Cate Blanchett makes out with a 16 year old, and Judi Dench is a vampiric,creepy,aging lesbian. Both are teachers at an English high school and Dench lures the confused Blanchett into a bizarre relationship using her knowldge of Cate's teen tryst as leverage. I don't know if these actors are stretching their boundaries or naive, or both, but if you like a good train wreck, oh, baby, is this the right flick for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The nominations and accolades were all well-deserved","review":"This film is a fine example of the quality craftsmanship that goes into the best British filmmaking, with a powerhouse cast, led by the ever-luminous Cate Blanchett and Judi Dench in one of her darkest, most powerful roles to date. Blanchett plays a naive, somewhat rudderless woman who has become a schoolteacher for lack of anything better to do. She falls under the dominion of an older, more cunning schoolmarm, played by Dench, whose evil, serpentine glances play perfectly off the repellant voice-overs taken from her character's diary. The two lead actresses have a strong on-screen chemistry that compliments the immense power struggle between their characters. A taut script, beautiful cinematography and a wealth of strong supporting talent makes this an outstanding (if thematically icky) piece of work. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent performances all round","review":"Really top class acting by all concerned. Judi Dench has it to a tea, the buttoned up school mistress, down to the way she smokes her cigarettes and deals with the death of her cat. A stellar performance.Cate Blanchett doesn't get as much screen time, obviously, but when she does, all eyes are on her. She does an excellent job of the sensitive issue with her relationship with the young man-great acting job by Andrew Simpson.Bill Nighy as the wronged husband is pitch-perfect.A very serious subject, dark and repressed, if not depressed, but it ends on a high note with all having learned their lesson, except the sinister 'vampire' Judi Dench.A gripping movie you should watch at least twice to get the full picture of every nuance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst piece of trash in years","review":"When I rented this is came highly acclaimed. Watching this felt like a two hour dramatized episode of Jerry Springer. Absolutely nothing of real value in this film. None of the characters have morals. You can't even use them as societal harpees because we spend the first forty minutes of the film getting to like them. Horrible story. Awful direction. Atrocious editing. Avoid at all costs!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOW YOU KNOW WHY PEOPLE HOME SCHOOL","review":"One thing this movie did was hold my attention. The two lead actresses are two of the best working today and they defiantly made what could have been just a sickening story something worth watching. To have two so different but equally unfit teachers in one school and make it not seem over the top is a credit to the writers of this movie. One teacher like either of these women would have nearly closed down some schools.My favorite scene: The mother of the boy coming to the art teacher's house.Least favorite scene: Art teacher using the bathroom. Wayyyyyy unnecessary"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tightly Wound","review":"With today's spate of teacher/student sex scandals, this one feeds the appetite to understand how these things happen. You'll hate Judy Dench, but her acting is top-notch. The plot has a nice twist, not well concealed. The 'romances,' both of them, are not especially believable. A freak show, really. But worth watching, and definitely compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birds of prey","review":"Barbara is one of those gargoyles of a teacher we all had in junior high. Her students regard her with apprehension, but few who know her know what she really is. Barbara's a predator. A master of manipulation, her victims remain trustfully unaware of the danger that lurks until it's way too late. Notes on a Scandal is populated by users. Sure, they can differentiate right from wrong, but when it comes down to something they want, they're consciences are very flexible. But Barbara alone possesses the insidious killer instinct. Too bad she doesn't know enough not to write it all down.Once, again, Dame Judi displays her acting genius, and is unafraid of appearing physically as well as morally unattractive. Blanchett does well in this movie too, but her character is less compelling because her motives are rather cloudy. Notes on a Scandal is a stalker story that leaves the viewer feeling cold and in need of a long, hot shower when it ends.5 stars for acting, 3 for screenplay = 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"RICHARD EYRE, OPUS 6","review":"***1/2 2006.

This film is a torch at the edge of our educational system.I think this may be a British fault as I saw another story about an homosexual British history master.In any case it was delivered by an American company that should have known better.As an art film with an X rating , I would approve of such a film as drama and art, but not as a popular widely distributed as we see here.The acting is first rate British even in the smaller parts.The film editing and photography is first rate.The script is gripping and very well written.It is the subject material that is so suspectand socially contaminated.This film is a lot like giving small pox infected blankets to the Indians,as the modern American is morally unable to see the danger here."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 2 stars are for the acting ONLY!","review":"For those of us who bothered to read the book, the movie was sub-par, to be polite. The character of Barbara (Judi Dench) is villified beyond need and that of Sheba (Cate Blanchett) somehow manages to get our sympathy. No! This is not the feeling I got from the book! If I have to say something nice, the acting is good.On further reflection: why did they have to make the lesbian tendency SO obvious??? It was a little bit more than a hint in the book but it's FULL blown in the movie.

The fact that she gets caught by a rather elderly and matronly teacher seeking same sex companionship is a an unfortunate coincidence.

Also, I have missed several phone calls since the answer button works whenever it wants.2) the battery: it doesn't last too long and it doesn't warn you battery is low.hate this phone, and I especially don't recommend it for anyone with babies or toddlers because this phone can't take the abuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It","review":"Pros: Nice looking, easy to use, good control from remote phones, feels solid, lasted 2 years and still same as new.Cons: Occasional bizarre loss of connection with base (needs to be turned face-up in base for 10 seconds to reconnect!), 1 hour talk time between full charges (which is totally unacceptable), very poor message clarity.I would just pass on this one even though it was relatively cheap for its day."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Wow! A 900mhz cordless phone with digital answering machine for under ..., that's amazing! Sounds almost too good to be true. Well, it is too good to be true. The ... you pay is great for all the features, but one of the most important qualities of a telephone is lost in this product: hearing the other person's voice. Not only is it difficult to hear people you're speaking with, it is nearly impossible to hear most messages. Unfortunately, I've had the phone for almost 2 years, so I know what I'm talking about. While the range is impressive, and the features are easy to use, not being able to hear the voice on the other end clearly earns this phone 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"DECIDE FOR YOURSELF!!","review":"First off, I *had* this model of phone for 11 months. It was fried during a lightning storm. However, before that, it worked FOR ME flawlessly....up to the bitter end. It had simple features, the answering machine was adequate, the handset was very light-weight, the base was compact and could be wall mounted, I could hear the caller, the caller could hear me, etc. etc.I think what is important to note here is that the phone was fine FOR ME. Maybe not for the other reviewers and maybe not for you. Don't read these reviews, for any phone, and then purchase the phone that has the best reviews. These reviews are so, so, so skewed. Buy your phone from a store that will let you return the phone for 100% of your money back with no questions asked should you not like the phone. That way YOU can find the phone that is right for YOU! Don't listen to me, don't listen to these other people.

It is undoubtedy the worst Myth adventure that I have read(even worse than Myth-ing Persons(!)). No one can be as stupid as Skeeve is, particularly someone with his experiences. He should have grown up by now, and he hasn't. Usually the books work because his companions are interesting, but in this one Skeeve has an adventure of his own, and handles it, and himself, badly. The book wasn't worth the effort of reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works with my ThinkPad T22 and Win2000 without any drivers","review":"This card is a little pricy but it has several features that I haven't found on many other cards.One, this card has two ports with one running at full power (500 mA) without having to use an AC adapter. Most of the other cards will require you to plug in an AC adapter to get the full 500 mA. Some of these cards don't even come with the AC adapter even when one is needed.Two, like someone else on this review said, this card uses a cable extension which makes the card itself very flat. This will prevent the card from blocking any other slot whether it is on the top or bottom slot.I have tried this card with my Maxtor 200GB external hard drive and my Sony DRX510UL external DVD burner without any problem.Overall, I gave it a 4 stars instead of 5 because of the high price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alternatives for IBM Proprietary Products","review":"The other review for this product suggests there is no other USB 2.0 Cardbus adapter that fits a Thinkpad.

Our befuddled Englishman meets a couple of beach bunnies and we're off for a wild romp with impossibly funny situations coming at a quick clip. Crocker knows his California babes well and his English Gentlemen better - pace, language and action are nearly flawless. Too often inter-cultural conflict hams up or misses the mark on one or the other sides. It would be great to see an opposite side of the pond version from Crocker.

The reader soon gains a genuine appreciation and fondness for the \\"stiff-upper lip\\" of the Brit and a real admiration for the author who can so effectively mix Jamaican drug dealers with British noblewomen, crusty tweed-clad generals with leggy California blondes, and black nationalists with red-neck special operatives for a surprise ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"The novel is a dud.","review":"I bought this book after reading an ecstatic review praising it as \\"an absolute gut-buster.\\" Although there are a (very) few funny moments in the novel (mainly in the beginning), most of the story is pretty stale. The author tries to punch up the plot with various action sequences: someone pulling a gun on someone, scaling a building, etc. Unfortunately, these scenes don't work as action or comedy and just bog down the story. The author tries to create humor by featuring wacky groups of characters: a Jamaican drug gang, a Mexican drug gang, black muslims, redneck vets. Unfortunately, he doesn't do anything very interesting with them.I really wanted to like this novel. But it is, as General Haversham might put it, \\"a crashing bore.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A rollicking adventure","review":"I will give this book the highest praise that one can give any novel: It's a great read.

Not one wet morning since we started using them!!! Great Product!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They run SMALL","review":"My son likes these because they are more comfortable than Pull Ups. They are softer and the sides aren't scratchy like the velcro-ish stuff on the sides of the Pull Ups. He also is a Diego nut so that is a plus. We only need them for overnight so they aren't getting pulled up and down much so I don't care that the sides do come apart after a lot of pulling up and down. And since he doesn't poo in them I don't need the easy open sides. My biggest complaint about them is the size. They run about a size smaller than Pull Ups. He is 3 1/2, wears 3T-4T clothes, weighs 33 pounds and is in the 4T-5T (size 6) Easy Ups. Pampers makes DIAPERS in size 7 but not Easy Ups? Really?

We had been using Huggies Overnights which were great but he started wanting to get up and potty in the middle of the night and the diapers were too difficult to get on and off. That turned out to be a major plus with these Easy Ups - they can be pulled down and up quickly and easily overnight when my son gets up to go. The downside of these is that if he sleeps all night and has had a lot to drink that evening, he will leak through - they don't seem to hold near as much. We are having fewer and fewer of those nights though, so I can say overall, I recommend these for kids who are on the path to being fully trained but just not quite there yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip easy on pull up!","review":"These are nice for absorbency BUT i didn't realize that these didn't fasten like a diaper which would be fine but they are not as big as i thought they would be.

They are totally useless during the night time or when we are away from home. I went out with him today and he went through three pairs of shorts!! I even had to change his shirt once because the urine got on it. (Thank goodness I was prepared with extra outfits.) I'm very disappointed because I am a fan of Pampers. I'll try Huggies Pull Ups next or just go back to standard diapers. His size 3 Luvs worked just fine, plus I got 204 of them (at BJs)for the same price as the Easy Ups.

If your child goes # 2 you have to rip the sides open to avoid getting it all over their legs.

When switching to the easy-ups, however, he didn't want to wear them, was constantly itching himself and then developed a diaper rash that would almost go away with medication but never completely. I decided to switch to the Huggies brand and he actually wants to wear them, doesn't scratch anymore, and the rash has gone away (without medication). I'm not really sure why he had trouble with them (I would assume they are the same \\"formula\\" as the cruisers but maybe not) but have always loved Pampers and will probably try their line again when our third arrives later this year but will just keep a close eye on any rashes or redness and be prepared to switch if necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy these","review":"i usually buy huggies brand but they were out of stock.so i thought id try these ,bad mistake.i was putting them on my toddler and one side tore half way off.this happens everytime i put them on him.there is no velcro on the sides,everytime they have to be changed i have to undress my son,which is not good when you have to do it in a public bathroom with theyre filthy floors.these leak like crazy,also when my son pulls them down the rest of the training pants tears off,so even if they werent full they have to be changed again,which means i have to undress him yet again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Pampers","review":"I have always loved pampers for my son. Now that he is at potty training age i have transitioned to pullups. Only these are horrible. They rubbed a sore on my sons bottom from the elastic.

Ill be using huggies for potty training."},{"rating":"1","title":"The product is fine but the strategy is bad","review":"I had my kid in underpants.

His little butt is constantly sticking out. They are bulky on him and he complains about them being uncomfortable. He can easily pull them down, getting them back up is another issue though. Because they are so big, they roll funny and he needs help to get them back up. They also do not reattach once you tear the sides, and this is a tad annoying. It means that anytime he poops I have to completely undress him to put another on. They also do not seem to be very absorbent and have leaked when he has pooped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft, but they run a little small","review":"These pull ups are the softest ones I have found, many of the others are stiff and scratchy. But also they tend to run a bit on the small side compared to other pull ups...so plan accordingly! Also they don't have the easy detach sides which mean you have to tear them to change a dirty diaper, which is not very fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sd","review":"These are good diapers. my son loves the cartoons on it. absorbancy is good....but not too good for potty . helps him potty train faster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad for the larger size","review":"I have a five year old who sometimes has trouble controlling his bladder at night. Thankfully, the EasyUps come in the larger 4T/5T size that I can't find in other brands of pull-ups (and, thankfully, my son is very slender, so they fit). Easy Ups and Pull Ups are much less expensive than the Underjams and other brands made for older children, but I have found that the EasyUps are absorbent enough that if he has an accident, it is contained. Especially when we go on vacation or to Grandma's house when he doesn't want to risk anyone knowing he's had an accident, these are still working great for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I was hoping for","review":"These do not have the easy open sides like the Huggies Pull-ups do. You have to tear them off if you need to change a dirty one. They are also difficult for the child to pull all the way up on their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUCH better for overnight than Huggies!","review":"My kid used to always need a change of diaper half way through the night when we used Huggies Overnight pull-ups.

This expensive little (273 page)book was very disappointing. My expectations were high - based on this author's first book - but this one just didn't deliver. Half of the stuff in this book is great - just what you would expect from this author - but the other half is incomplete, inaccurate, or just plain biased toward the author's pet ideas so the reader suffers by the lack of serious in-depth analysis in places where it is sorely needed. Sadly, this subjective approach is also what I have come to expect from this author in recent years, but I had hoped that he could now be more objective.

Brown ignores the dogma and presents some of the same concepts.Regardless of their different approaches it seems that they agree on the need to release both guilt and fear.Try both books one should work for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant, Redundant, Redundant!","review":"I have read several Sylvia Browne books when I really only needed to read one.

I have moved on to more credible authors and have learned FAR more in doing so. Sylvia Browne's books are a waste of your money in my opinion.Take my advice, always beware of someone charging 850 dollars for a generic 20 min reading over the phone.

This author has a knack of talent writing, by which I mean she doesn't drag a story along, it moves at a fast and feverish pace. The characters are all new and exciting, her opinions of others are opinions that some people do have in this society. I loved all the characters and laughed my butt off. Some of the conversations the main charactere had were so real that I felt I was in the room. I could visualize every scene. I loved when Jack sat down at the table with Alice and Miles at the resturant like nothing was wrong and for once, Miles had absolutley nothing to say. I was gripped up on my couch reading to the bitter end and didn't want it to end. I cheered as I finished the book and wanted to see what she has coming next. Cheers to this author.

I found the plot, or shall I say stumbled upon it in the midst of other wavering issues, to lack any depth. I purchased the book in support of my sister who has to eat and is following her dream.

I was almost not motivated to turn the next page. It seems as if Mrs. Little just threw in plots everywhere throughout the book to make it seem interesting, when actually it did nothing for the story.

Not really many characters.The Put Down the Duckie song gets 2 stars. The rest of the footage doesn't even get any stars. Yes there are a few random old-school skits.

Two days ago, using this product to secure my bike on a rack in front of a very safe Whole Foods, the lock was picked/cable cut, and my bicycle was stolen. There were security guards and parking lot attendants and security cameras, so this lock was cut incredibly swiftly and easily.There's good reason this product doesn't have an anti-theft guarantee.

The lock must have internally broken, or somehow the combo changing ring got turned before I locked it (unlikely because it's pretty hard to turn).

Most of the exercises consist of repeating in writing what the book has already written. There are annoying typos and unhelpful repetition abounds.

I believe this is deliberate, in order to allow the listener to follow each part of the round easily, for learning purposes. So if you're looking for a polished, blended sound, this isn't it.

Mr. Hardy tracks down a terrorist group. I think the author forgot to include something in this book, like a plot. The book doesn't really seem to be about all that much. What story there is, is incredibly boring and terribly unoriginal. The book is lacking in both action and excitement. Only about 2 or 3 of the chapter endings made me want to read more and I found that I wanted to get through the book only to be finished with it. The title of the book is not very appropriate. The terrorist group is called the Scorpio gang, but they could have been called the Barbie doll gang with little rewriting of the story. The whole book is uninteresting, don't waste your time reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run out of gas","review":"I always thought that from Volume #36 on, the writers had run out of gas.

The action was almost impossible to find and the story dragged on throughout most of the book. The only good thing that I could say about this book was that the Hardys stayed in Bayport for a change and all of their friends were included in the book.

It use to be mostly clear with a yellow tint, adn had a slightly skunky smell. I liked it because it seemed very natural and authentic, with lots of vitamin C. Now it looks sort of thicker with an egg yolk-type consistency, and the smell is weird, like they reduced the strength and tried to cover up the smell. Maybe some dummies complained.

Have you hung suspended with your branches entwined in heaven and your roots deep in hell? What price have you paid for wisdom? Odin gave an eye.

I think I will just throw it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jerry Springer Revisited","review":"I was unable to get through the first episode, being a big fan of the Soprano's, profanity used creatively and with a purpose does not bother me, however, using it to where it becomes a comedic distraction does.I really doubt, in the era they have sorely attempted to depict, did they repeatedly use the words \\"mother f@#king c@nt\\" and that is just the tip of the iceberg.I did not find this to be entertainment at all, best used as a door-stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadwood is like watching dead wood.","review":"If you like the word c**ksucker and c**t you will love this show. After watching Deadwood I feel dirty, and not in a good way. When you watch this show you actually feel like you are covered with mud and later the plague. The show tries to make up for the lack of action and uninteresting plotline by stretching out the scenes with surly looks and by swearing a lot. I was really looking forward to watching it because it had so many GREAT reviews. Liar, liar pants on fire. With that said Keith Carradine, Robin Weigert, Brad Dourif, William Sanderson, Ian McShane, Dayton Callie, and other cast members did and amazing job. Unfortunately Carradine and Weigert departed the show early on. Don't waste your time with Deadwood."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"wild west\\" with tourettes syndrome!!!.","review":"if you are looking for a classic western series like \\"gunsmoke\\" and \\"lonesome dove\\" you will be not only disappointed but disgusted by this trailer trash ,sewerage content equilavent,excuse for a so called \\"western\\" series. this \\"western\\" series offers nothing but endless,\\"i really mean endless\\" profanity .every second word \\"i really mean every second word,\\"i kid you not. the use of profanity in this series makes a quentin tarantino movie look like a walt disney production. there is no logic reason to use such excessive profanity , only perhaps if one was suffering from a mental disease . indead intolerable and an insult to modern television. this series is nowhere near the leagues of the classics \\"gunsmoke\\" and \\"lonesome dove\\" these series were intelligently written and acted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie lover","review":"Awful, useless, meaner than reality was, historical use of language as presented is very doubtful.Even if this was exactly the condition of the world in that area it could be presented with some purpose in the production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for sissy wuses.","review":"Yes, there is constant vulgarity (but no profanity) in this series. But the idea is --- that's the way it was in an illegal mining camp made up of loser men in 1870. duhhhh. So if youre only comfy with John Wayne's waddle, stay away from this series which threads the development of a mining camp into a town in the wild wild west in Dakota. It shows why our democratic form of government is a necesity. Its pretty great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incoherent","review":"The language issue has been discussed at length, but not in enough depth. I am in no way a prude, but I found the bad language to be gratuitous, ineffective, and highly distracting. After a while, it sounded like little kids swearing just to show how grown up they are. Similarly for violence. I felt like the makers were trying hard for unusual depictions of physical violence just for the challenge of surpassing previous levels on film. I have watched and appreciated other films with the same degree of language and violence. I gave up on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just can't get into it.","review":"I was pretty excited to check this series out. It has a lot going for it, HBO, great setting, good actors. For some reason I just can't get into it. I don't need a lot of action, I don't mind the sometimes slow storylines, But I dont feel compelled to continue watching beyond this season. I care very little about the characters or their plots, the bad guys are too bad and the good guys are too flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Show On TV!","review":"I don't even know why anyone offended by the language on the show would have HBO,but if they bought the dvd set and weren't aware of the excessive profanity and are offended by it I will buy it for 40 bucks from anyone willing to sell it for that price.For season three I plan on having a dvd recorder,only having the first two seasons on vhs. Deadwood is gritty and lifelike,you can almost taste the mud and smell the greasy food in E.B. Farnum's dining room! The characters are very multi-dimensional and complex.To balance out the profanity(which I even find excessive at times,please David Milch,get rid of that toilet mouth Trixie!)there is beautiful dialogue obviously influenced from letters from that period in time.Realistic,gritty,violent,dramatic,funny,profane,eloquent,philosophic and character driven, putting the events in history in the background,instead emphasizing the people living through them,Deadwood has it all! Too bad some people can't get past the profanity to see that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply The Best, For Those Mature Enough","review":"First off, virtually all of the negative reviews for this show stem from the fact that the characters swear...well, a lot. Frankly, if those people aren't mature enough to handle the word \\"c*cks*cker\\" they can go back to watching boring broadcast TV.This show is simply addictive; the flow of the story keeps you hooked, pushing the plot ever-forward from one episode to the next. One of the best aspects of the show is that, as the season progresses, more and more of the day-to-day nature of Deadwood is unveiled...simply watching the camp in daily operation is enough to make this a first-rate television masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"the series: deadwood, is NOT fashioned after the book by the same name.","review":"i just wanted to say that i do not understand why anyone thought it necessary to bring THIS type of production to television..i've thought about this and from what i watched, this could have been filmed in a way that it would have had comparable impact but without subjecting the viewer to such a bird's eye view of impersonal but intimate sexual acts, and i ask you: how many times does it take to satisfy any director that \\"we get it\\" that men cursed back then and had little restraint when it came to common expression..as it is, my copies of all three seasons i have destroyed as they are not watchable to me, and i could not, in good conscience, pass them on to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Sopranos-level","review":"Having just rewatched the Sopranos and Mad Man, I was in the mood for a high-quality serial drama. And as a big fan of post-modern westerns like Cormac McCarthy's novels and There Will Be Blood, I figured Deadwood would fit the bill. Unfortunately, the show disappoints. All the dialogue is dense bloviation, peppered with profanity. The actors often don't even seem to understand the words they're reading and the profanity, apparently, isn't historically accurate. Timothy Olyphant is miscast as a gritty former sheriff prone to violence.Whatever its faults, you have to credit Deadwood for a few truly great performances, especially Ian McShane as an amoral saloonkeeper, pimp and opium peddler. His voice is as cracked and leathery as an old saddle. The preacher and doctor are also great, the latter being essentially the doctor character from Kurosawa's Drunken Angel."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets...","review":"...for a TV series. After having seen many of the other HBO productions one can defenately spot out certain elements that recurr in their series, whether it be Sopranos, OZ, The Wire etc. Nevertheless even if one was to cut out the foul language, nudity and violence one would still end up with one hell of a TV show. One that no major network like NBC, ABC, WB or CBS would be able to pull off....or at least haven't to this day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough at First","review":"I tuned in because I've been to Deadwood, SD. At first, I had trouble hearing- accents, so much swearing, etc. - but then I was absolutely hooked. I've been waiting for the 2nd season for so long. Even though I could watch it on HBO, I won't because I need to catch up! Truly a great series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great actor but wanted more","review":"the main reason to see this dvd is to see actor Ian Mcshane. He holds this whole series.Every time hes on the screen your transfixed. Im not familiar with his work,, but I want to be. If you like the bad guy in a movie. or your upset when the bad guy looses. This guy is for you. yeah the sets are cool, great filmed, but without Ian you have no series. I was kinda bored by the story not to much happened. Again only when Ian was on the screen did I rejoice. So if you wanna see the best bad guy that you love to hate rent this boxed set or borrow it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgar language only part of the problem.","review":"This series is weird. I kept getting the feeling that each actor had his or her own director. Something just didn't connect. Such great actors, many are my favorites, but I had to force myself to watch four episodes before I had to stop. And I had all four seasons to watch. So much anger in these characters, it was hard to like anyone. Actors great, writers and director awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Dramatic Western Series Ever","review":"After watching all of the Soprano's and Carnivale episodes over the years I figured it would be nearly impossible to improve on them. I was wrong! This is unquestionably the best dramatic western series ever done for television! Imaginative and captivating while keeping historical perspective, it never ceased to keep you eagerly anticipating more of the same. Unfortunately, just when it seemed there would be much more to come, the brain-donors in charge of programming at HBO decided to cancel this immensely popular, award winning, hit series (in the same delicate fashion as Carnivale). It will be sorely missed. Nuts! to HBO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Deadwod","review":"This series had us captivated. The actors were well chosen for their parts. The off colored language didn't become offensive to us as it seemed to fit right in to the story and become part of the character. We were sorry to have it end. Maybe if they had been able to finish the story and build up to the end it would have been easier to accept."},{"rating":"2","title":"dead wood","review":"i loved this i used the first season from a guy at worked i enjoyed it so much i bought all 3 seasons the only reason i did not give it all 5 stars is it was going to run 4 seasons so i did not like the way it ended at the end of the 3rd season it left you hanging but it was still a good show"},{"rating":"1","title":"shallow","review":"This was a big disappointment! So much profanity as to make it just stupid. Story line poor and a lack of action. Just couldn't hold my attention. Haven't a clue how it got so many good reviews. It lacked class. It was just bad taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turned it off after 5 minuets.","review":"My wife and I turned this off after less than 5 minuets. There was hardly a sentence spoken without 1-3 unprintable words, and not just the usual stuff one might expect to hear in movies today. We just could not take the crude language. I was in the army for 3 years and didn't hear anyone that talked as crude as this, even drill sergeants. I would expect some foul language from most anything that Hollywood does today, but this is beyond any normal persons sensability. I don't know anything about the plot or acting and don't care. We never got that far. If the bad language stops you every few seconds, nothing else matters anyway. Do not buy this product!!! Do not waste your time to see it, even for free!! Do not let your friends see it!!! I have never done this before, but I'm going to send it back and see if they will give me my money back. Even if they don't give me my money back, I want them to know how bad it was and that we were absoulutly disgusted with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too obscene to enjoy","review":"I agree with some of the other reviewers. This show was so over the top with the profanity that I could not follow the storyline. I watched the first two episodes to give the show a chance, but nearly every scene contained very offensive language and a lot of it. I too am no prude (I think the Sopranos is the best show on TV). If you don't appreciate constantly hearing derogatory referrences to female anatomy parts, then this is not the show for you. I gave it 2 stars because it did create a unique mood of depression and confinement that made it stand out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profanity is way overdone - distracting","review":"I rented this one based on some of the reviews here (with a thought of buying it eventually) because the premise of the show is just so good. I wanted to like it; however, I have to concur with some of these reviews. The production is great, the acting is sometimes good, sometimes flat. But, the amount of profanity is just too much. I'm by no means a prude. I don't mind a bit of \\"colorful\\" language, but the amount used in this show is just plain distracting. It's a shame - great concept, poorly implemented."},{"rating":"1","title":"gutter-trash","review":"This would have been a truly great epoch of a western saga but the dialogue must have been written by a couple of high school drugged up drop-outs who have no skills at conducting a real conversation.The packaging and advertisements should have a warning on it as to it's vile and poorly used dialogue. It seems the writers can not hold two conversations together without falling back on their own childhood slum-talk.The idea that people of the old west really talked like this is completely ludicrous as most of the slang did not come into \\"usage\\" until the 60's and 70's.I truly regret purchasing this and I will be selling this as soon as I can.... any takers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadwood - almost a dog","review":"I agree with another reviewer who gave the show a 1 star. Perhaps the sets are realistic, who knows? There are no living survivors. Miners, and others of that age were probably even more filthy, and evil smelling than portrayed. I would doubt that so many folks used such overwhelming profanity, all the time, particularly the \\"horrible\\" \\"f---\\" word. No doubt they swore, and probably quite a bit, but every other word????? No way.On the other hand, it is an interesting portrayal of what really went on in the Black Hills during the gold rush days, probably quite close to actual events and conditionsI am not a prude, spent almost 20 years in the Navy, and heard lots and lots of profanity, even used some of it myself, but the constant use of vulgar words began to turn me off, and definitely turned my wife off. If not for that, I would have given the show at least a 4 or 4 and 1/2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadwood - The \\"F\\" Word","review":"If you like the \\"f\\" word, you'll love Deadwood.

The dialogue was ridiculous. I have no problems with the use of \\"bad\\" language in movies, but this was extremely juvenile! I would guess that at least half the sentences include the F word at least once. It was so gratuitous, e.g., \\"I ain't f*cking goin' down stairs!\\" The acting was ok, but it must have been hard for the actors to keep a straight face with the asinine dialogue.The story line was very week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should call it Trashwood!","review":"What an awful show, it really insults a persons intelligence, how difficult is it to write nothing but cussing over and over.

This book will tell you!Each chapter unfolds as a series of mini-essays on the home life by experts, with the COO of a pest control company teaching how to prevent household pests, a field editor for Audubon explaining how to select and use a birdfeeder, Dr. Joy Browne offering suggestions for learning how to compromise, pediatrics professor Harvey Knapp instructing on how to discipline your children, etc. The pieces are compact, and most have at least one \\"take-away,\\" so it's easy to pick the book up, read for five minutes and glean some useful bit of info. On the downside, a few areas beg for a more in-depth explanation, and the vast array of advice covered means that there are some odd juxtapositions (e.g., \\"increase your energy\\" is followed by \\"secure a mortgage\\"). Still, few books can manage to instruct readers on selecting window treatments, making time for yourself and hosting a dinner party with such streamlined simplicity."},{"rating":"1","title":"George and the Virgin","review":"There were some pretty funny moments in this book but it was bordering on stupid rather than funny some of the time.

An uplifting book that leaves with a great feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"By George, this medieval time travel romance was a fun read","review":"This kindle freebie (well it was free when I got it) was really cute, a professional wrestler taking on a stinky dragon named Belch and a castleful of virgins adds a bit of humor, and a virgin who doesn't want to stay that way forever adds a bit of steamy stuff.George 'The Saint' is really a nice guy, and a gentle giant with a self deprecating sense of humor, so he makes for a satisfying, if at times a bumbling, hero. And his heroine Alizon is just so repressed that it adds to the steamy build up of sensual tension between the pair. All in all a fun magical time travel read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little afraid to read this book....","review":"A little afraid to read this book, crazy title and crazy cover, but it was so fun!

Yet, as this book discusses, Africa has a very rich human rights treaty system (including a new continental court). The book combines a textual analysis of the treaties, jurisprudence, and practical experience to provide a nuanced and realistic assessment of the human rights mechanisms, the African Human Rights Commission, and the state of first and second generation rights. Hopefully more activists and legal scholars will look to this book and try to make use of the continent's own human rights law to address human rights problems in Africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost anyone will find this book very interesting!","review":"This yearbook of sorts is a must read for anyone interested in staying abreast of the important world happenings that don't quite get the coverage they deserve, if any, by mainstream media sources.

I suggest to the editors two little baby steps: 1) read Waugh's novel Scoop - you'll understand \\"journalism\\" much better than you do now and 2) subscribe to The Economist.

Most discussions of Trafalgar concentrate on Nelson's slow death on the orlop deck, while the really decisive actions of the battle rage out of view. In this book Pope gives readers a thorough and vivid discussion of exactly what happened between the whole engaging fleets, AFTER Nelson was hit and taken below. The victory was Nelson's, from his strategy and leadership, but many other men on both sides fought to reach that crucial military decision. Dudley Pope brings this to life. If you've ever wondered why Nelson's last order, knowing he was mortally wounded, was for his flag captain to anchor the British fleet, read on! I also highly recommend Pope's other works, including his fictional Lord Ramage series, which gets visibly better from book to book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Program is more complicated then learning HTML","review":"By the time you figure this program out you could have learned HML.

It is a very powerful tool and is so much better than fumbling around with DreamWeaver. While I'm not a mind reader, I feel that some of the bad reviews are from folks that thought it would be super EASY as in you snap you fingers and your website magically appears. You do have to read the manual and the instructions, but with taking a little time to learn you have a lot of functions at your disposal that are very easy to use. I have to admit that I haven't tried to access the HTML code yet, but my understanding is that you can't do this which I could see becoming frustrating.

Yes, their web site design is fairly easy once you catch on to it, but don't expect the manual to be of much help. It assumes you are an expert to begin with and doesn't define terms very well, so plan on doing a lot of guessing and experimenting. The really hard part is getting your site published. After several unsuccessful tries (WebEasy congratulates me and says my site has been published successfully, but when I go to look at it, it says the site has not been uploaded properly) and after an e-mail from their \\"help desk\\" that started out by saying \\"What you should try is...\\", I gave up.

For all of these authors, the reader doesn't learn anything useful about the destination, but the author's wit and command of the language make for an enjoyable read. Hammond's all-too-flimsy premise for his book is that he, a London resident, will play the role of tourist in his city, while referring to various existing travel books. But really, what makes the book so much fun is the author's witty stream-of-consciousness style of writing. It was fun to read, but is no replacement for a real guidebook to London. Also, not incidentally, Hammond's book presupposes a thorough familiarity with London; otherwise, it will all go over the reader's head. It might be the last guidebook to London you read, but it shouldn't be the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I love Sinbad but this wasn't even funny!

Excellent video to show at a party, family get together or just with friends hanging out. Every DVD of his has hilarious insights into male-female relations, but with not one repeat of material. This guy sees into the humor of the dymamics with a fresh perspective every time and leaves you saying, \\"Yep, that's me!\\" or \\"I've done that!\\" while rolling on the floor cracking up. The only thing that surprised me was that he didn't use \\"We Want the Funk\\" by Parliament as the song when he was musically describing what \\"Funk\\" was.

Nothing like the Sinbad I was used . There was nothing funky about it , the only reference to funk was at the end and the music they used in the finale (that they called funk music) wasn't funk music at all.

The first couple of episodes gave me a few laughs, but as the show goes on it develops very quickly and the characters become much more interesting and real. The style of humor might be different from what some people are used to so I would recommend watching a couple episodes online before buying. Each character is funny in their own way and the diverse ways they interact with each other is where the show shines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's rehash The Office!","review":"I, like you, became interested in this show because the commercials made it look like a great compliment to \\"The Office\\" with it's same quirky humor. Unfortunately, that's true to a fault. It's nothing more than an unfunny rehash of the show, with Amy Poehler taking the role of Steve Carell's Micheal Scott. All of the other characters can be easily matched with their Office rip-off counterparts as well. I have only seen the first episode, and maybe I should have watched more, but I feel that a GOOD show will captivate you with just the first episode you watch. If you are looking for a great show to compliment The Office, watch 30 Rock. It's unique and has its own style that doesn't make you feel like you're watching a cheap cash-in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Argh!

I can see that it's reaching for a \\"dry-humor\\" type of style but it pretty well misses the mark. Oh, it does hit the \\"dry\\" but doesn't ever get to the \\"humor\\". I think it's maybe trying to be like that show Samantha Who? in that the main female character is flighty but really upbeat while her co-workers / friends are jaded. Unfortunately, the woman in this show comes across with some racist insinuations and does it in a way as to appear ignorant of her blunder. It just makes it more offensive. I won't be watching it again. Of course, this is just my personal opinion and some folks might find this show really entertaining so go on and watch this free one and judge for yourselves.^^"},{"rating":"1","title":"ehh...","review":"I found this to be mildly amusing, but rather chintzy overall.

I think her character is supposed to be slightly mentally retarded, or maybe it's just Amy Poehler. The Office got pretty boring and \\"lovey dovey\\" after season 2; this show just picks up that trash, with boring, extremely dull comedians, and wraps it in one big mess of a production.Parks & Recreation is symbolic of the downfall of modern television.

Watch the show and give it time and you will not regret it. Parks and Rec is witty and clever, and a great political satire. The characters develop more as the seasons go on, so some that are less likable early on will grow on you.

The story is presented from the perspective of the camp counselors, who are of high school age, mature enough to deal with some, but not all, the issues presented to them by the girls in their charge. The title derives from a camp song favorite of the girls, but this book for young adult readers is not one that will please overly protective parents. The characters in Ms. Phillip's book are real teenagers that have sex and smoke dope, and their trials and tribulations bring on the real-world angst personified so well in Stephen King's Stand By Me. This is a fascinating tale of teens as they really are. As long as you can read past the misleading title and ho-hum cover, you will find a carefully crafted, realistic story inside that deserves a place on your bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book conveying the science and \\"something more\\" of universe origins","review":"This book is a fantastic explanation of the origins of our universe.

The story of the big bang is told in the first person, from the perspective of the universe. It mixes the universe's \\"thought process\\" with some real science and produces a result that often seems more like fiction than science. The universe describes its' dreams; wonders if it could ever \\"feel feelings like love, sadness, and wonder;\\" and states that it is proud of creating hydrogen atoms. The scientific part of the book is intermingled with such sappy drivel that it is hard to separate fact from fiction. It is true that many of the pictures are beautiful but they have no real scientific merit.I bought this book for my eight year old daughters to supplement the science curriculum at their school.

One could even say that the book has a spiritual dimension of a secular sort (as previous reviews attest, this isn't a book for reductionistic materialists).Most importantly, my daughter really loves this book, as evidenced by her unusually focused attentiveness to the text and her vivid recollection of the graphics.

A bad idea, I agree, and something which should be fixed on any feature releases, but the credits aren't really completely missing.The series was filmed in B/W for the first season, switched to color film for seasons two and three, and then went back to B/W for the final year when it moved to CBS. I guess they weren't as interested in promoting early color TV as NBC was at the time. The color is a bit faded, but not that bad, and I would bet the color schemes were chosen for how they would appear on B/W sets because very few people had color TVs in 1962!For 39 shows, I'm happy.

This company really took care of me and didn't charge me much (I can't remember what I paid but it was under 30 bucks). The only problem with these is that they sit on the ear and after an hour my ear would start feeling sore. I replaced the pads once because I'd sometimes use them all day for work.

They are used in conjunction with a V-DAC and V-Can using a USB connection from an iMac and also from the line out of an iPod. My 84 year old ears are able to distinguish between every instrument in a classical setting, including full symphony orchestras. There is no need for boosting any of the frequencies as the reproduction seems accurate. I have not yet tried them with my jazz collection but expect similar results. You need look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best headphone","review":"I had this, audio-technica M50 and Bose QC15. After 2 weeks, I returned the other headphones.Bose QC15 was worst among these three for music. It was good only for noise cancellation.M50 was great sound for the price ($150).This is the BEST sound I have ever had. Both Mid range vocal and treble are very smooth and clean. Base is tight and precise. Unless you are in tight budget, you should get this one. Look no further.This is open headphone. The person seat next to you can easily recognize the song you are listing. This can be an annoyance for some people.I take away one star because of comfort. I feel pain after like 30 min of wearing this.

It is very easy to set up and configure and requires minimal desktop space allowing it to be positioned within easy reach. The scan quality is excellent for all scanning tasks but it excels at handling routine documents. Now rather than mailing a filled in form or a document requiring signature, I can convert them to PDF and immediately return them to the sender by email. Receipts, invoices and bills no longer need to be filed but now can be converted to PDF and stored. Rather than taking heavy stacks of papers for reading while traveling, I can quickly and easily convert them to PDF.

However, I value my time too much to babysit the feed mechanism of the unit I received last week. It inconsistently graps multiple pages as other reviewers have disclosed. So, if you're scanning a 10-page doc and it misses one somewhere along the way, have you really accomplished anything? No. You must either try the whole thing again (with likely the same result), or you must figure out what page(s) is missing, scan it separately, and go thru a simple yet not expedient Acrobat process to insert the omitted page. In the end, this machine made it +90% of the way to being a really great product, but the shortcoming fouls half the machine's overall utility.

More than one page may go through together. The scanner recognizes this & stops scanning until reloaded. Software is 4 out of five & very easy to use.

Karen Garcia (the main actor) starts off by stating that as we age, our sight and hearing diminish. She then proceeds to speak almost in slow motion. I kept thinking she would start speaking normally, and was horrified to find out that that was the way the entire \\"beginner\\" section was presented! And this is TRULY for a first time, never- exercised-before beginner. The DVD changes actors for the challenging section, but that girl is really just interested in her hair. It's annoying because each segment (arms, legs, abs...) is just a few minutes long and doesn't run continuously, so you need to stop and click the remote to get to the next segment.

Now that i see there are more reviews, i'd like to agree with the negitive ones. This DVD was so awful that I could not do the workouts. The first set of workouts has an instructor that spends more time talking about proper form and less time doing the actual moves. The second set of workouts for advanced moves, is okay, but I did not feel sore the next day like I would if I had done a great ball workout. Also, the second instructor, was even more annoying than the first one, because she is very cheerleader-ish and too upbeat/blonde/barbie-esque.

I was expecting a challenging, yet instructive dvd where I can both learn the basics of using the ball, and at the same time, challenge myself. The workouts (if you can call it that) were very slow moving, boring, and not in the least challenging. There is a segment in the dvd where you can select a more \\"advanced\\" workout. Eager to get a real workout, I was greatly disappointed because the so-called \\"advanced\\" portion of the dvd was a few sample snippets of another workout DVD. Very disappointed with this purchase.

It has a ridiculously long warm up (17 min!) followed by a \\"balance\\" section that was the same exercises as the warm-up but done with your eyes closed. The remaining sections were not much of an improvement with very easy routines and the main instructor always seeming awkward.

It's much like poker in that respect, in that knowing what your opponent has is half the fight. There is strategy involved in playing \\"good\\" or \\"evil\\" dragons, how much you ante, etc etc.Good dragons usually result in card draws, where evil dragons steal from the pot or force other players to pay you gold.I especially like the rules for playing a game in character. i.e. a character with 5 ranks in sleight of hand, when forced to pay another character gold, pays one less (min 1).Very well thought out and more complex than you might expect with your first playthrough.

Her eyes are twinkling, her mouth is upturned in a big smile, and she is laughing. How is this person feeling? If you were to say \\"angry\\" because you felt that it is possible that the person is angry, you would most likely be wrong.'Well, I surely didn't need a \\"scientific\\" book to tell me that - nor to tell me so many other similar things.

I should write a book !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial and obvious","review":"Although well written and easy to read, there isn't much insight or useful information for someone pondering the issue of retiring outside the country, what the living circumstances might be like, what the alternative countries might be like. Instead, the book gives a chapter called \\"Personal Packing for Runaways\\" with advice on what sort of clothes to pack for your exit departure. Well, that would depend on where you are going, your wealth, and many other factors. The book's advice is mainly to pack light. The list includes taking a watch, travel alarm, reading material, sunglasses, and camera. Oh, it advises taking \\"film\\" for the camera, whatever that is. Once upon a time there was something called \\"film\\" that was used with cameras.The book focuses mostly on Europe, as the author moved to France and gives advice most suited to those with similar interests, which are different from mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!!","review":"The Grown-up's Guide to Running Away From Home: Making a New Life Abroad is a really great read. I'm planning to retire to Europe and it is proving very helpful. It asks many questions, some that are obvious and some not, has check lists (such as how many months before the move you need to have a mail box set up, find renters, move furniture, change subscriptions, etc.) It also helps solidify the process of making decisions about where to live and why.

I loved the character Evens played. He's the guy all men wish they could be! Without a doubt this movie is a movie I'd love seeing again.I won't bore you with rehashing the plot only to say that if you have not seen it you should see it as soon as you can because you won't be disappointed.Why Four Stars? Well, I felt towards the end the good cop became a bit too tough for his character. That and his leaping marksmanship was a bit too Hollywood for me. I would have preferred a more conventional ending. Too, Ryan's beating up a cop in the very end was unrealistic. But these are small quibbles. Overall this is a great movie.A.

This is a B-grade movie with a few twists here and there to make it appear like an A-grade thriller.Premise: a whole bunch of crooked cops are captured on video committing murder, and they kidnap the family of the guy who caught them on tape. One lonesome guy on a cellphone outwits the gang of cops.I could understand if the movie was made in the early 90's when cell phones were starting to become a part of daily life, but in 2004??...the director must've lost his marbles!Verdict: absolutely un-*&$king-believable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For a really bad movie, press 1...","review":"There is a major problem with making a movie centered around gee-whiz technology: It almost immediately looks dated. The cell phones used in this cinematic sleeping pill look primitive by today's standards. This could be overlooked if the story was compelling, but this one isn't. It is a totally unbelievable setup that begs the question: \\"Dude, why don't you just get this babe's info and call 911?\\" Instead our hero fumbles around in a police station that apparently has no police on duty; steals a car; causes numerous traffic accidents; holds up a store at gunpoint; etc., etc., etc. Kim Basinger does her emoting best to add some real drama to this snooze fest, but it is out of place as the whole show is so utterly stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the @%&@?","review":"Was this moved suppose to be funny and i just don't get it?

The movie is a Nokia product placement, highlighting what awful danger you are in if you are not connected and, conversely, what a phone can do for you if you have one. The plot centers on Jessica (Kim Basinger) who is abducted because the bad guys think she has something that they need. Mystery #1: What is it?After lots of running/driving in various parts of L.A. the bad guys round up Jessica's family, while on the other end a pretty guy turned superhero and a would-be day spa owner cop are trying to help them.

If I were rating the movie, I'd give it five stars for being a fun suspense thriller to watch on a lazy day.About the product, I have no issues with the DVD or the casing. I do have issues with the fact that this is a Blu-Ray and there is no captioning. Even TV shows from the 1980s have captioning today on DVDs; there is no excuse for a Blu-Ray of a 2005 movie to not have captioning. Especially since the regular DVD version does have captioning.

And BTW, subtitles programmer, \\"lose\\" is not spelled \\"loose\\"!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad.","review":"Don't watch this pathetic movie, it's horrible and I am being kind. Cellular was marketed as a suspense thriller but it is full of fluffy jokes and robotic acting. Chris Evans is nice to look at but he has no emotional depth and Kim Basinger should know better than to pick this as a serious role. The only funny part of Cellular is that Ricky Martin joke and that's it.

The premise is fine, but why this kid couldn't just find any of a hundred cops to pass this call to is beyond me. And on a phone like that you can bet he has 3-way calling, put her on hold, call the cops and patch her through - DONE! And no more worrying about if he is going to have reception, which he has everywhere EXCEPT the police station. Nice. Of course, that wouldn't take 2 hours, so naturally that is not what he does. Instead he runs all over creation, breaking a bunch of laws in the process that seem to go unnoticed, even stealing a person's car at gunpoint, and all the while staying on the line with the leading lady, who's acting in this was so painfully bad her crying scenes made me want to cry too. The ending was done OK, not great, and certainly not unique, but fair enough to get this movie a 2 star reveiw instaed of only 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat entertaining, but really stupid!","review":"If this were meant to be a comedy, I might have liked it more.

Macy can play any type of tough guy, he's such a dork!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Stupidity","review":"I'm not sure what movie the other reviewers were watching, I found this to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The premise of the film is so far-fetched, I found myself groaning at every plot turn. I threatened to turn it off several times, but my wife was somewhat fond of the actor who was trying to save Kim Basinger, so I stuck it out. Almost constant, shameless product placement throughout the movie, a totally contrived plot, and, with the exception of William H. Macy, poor acting from start to finish. You'll probably watch it anyway based on the other reviews, but don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this movie a joke or something?","review":"I cannot believe this movie even made it to the theaters. Even the supposed \\"funny\\" scenes are corny and played out. Acting is weak and I actually began doing other things while watching this movie at home. By the way, in the special features the producer of the movie calls Chris Evans \\"the next Tom Cruise\\". The Rampart scandal special feature on the DVD was more interesting than the movie itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot interesting, several actors were awful","review":"Kim Basinger isn't known for her acting chops, but she does a decent (for her) job in this movie. What amazed me was that Chris Evans was just as hammy and over-acted just like he did in Not Another Teen Movie. Did someone tell him this was supposed to be a comedy? His facial expressions were over the top, and he acted like such a drama queen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Movie","review":"I can't understand why this was not a highly featured film. It is a great action picture, with lots of humor. I've watched it 3 times now, and enjoy it just as much each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprisingly good film","review":"When Cellular first hit the theatres, it had all the marks of a B film, unknown male lead, fledging female Oscar winner, and talented odd-ball William H. Macy. However, when you watch this film, you realize that it doesn't deserve it's B class status. This is a really good action-suspense story with a viable and nearly realistic storyline. It doesn't even loses it entertainment value when you watch a second time. I do like that Kim Basinger isn't a helpless damsel in distress. She is an active participant in her and her family's rescue. Overall: This movie is worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw it three times","review":"I saw this movie three times in the movie theater. Other movies came and went and this one stayed in the theater. What did I like most? The fact that the story was unpredictable. I wanted her to escape, I wanted to know why her husband was being sought by these bad guys. It kept me wanting more. And trust me when I saw it the second time I picked up a lot more. I can't wait to buy this on DVD. Kim Basinger was faboulous in this movie, her expertise was believable. Her acting was genuine. When she was scared, I was scared for her. GREAT MOVIE!! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of action for nothing","review":"Silly, technologically unsavvy and overlong, Cellular is almost a good turn-off-your-brain thriller. It's just that it is so hard to turn your brain off that much! Basinger \\"phones in\\" her performance (sorry). But you think: She is an Oscar winner!? Nobody else is really of any consequence. How the Great William H. Macy -- who has the only thing to offer in this film -- ended up here is a the biggest mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it's laughable.","review":"Seriously, this is one of, if not the worst movies I've seen. The acting is horrible, the dialogue is even worse, and the plot seems severely thrown together. This all adds up to making this movie entirely unbelievable. There's little to no character development and you honestly couldn't care if Kim Basinger's character makes it or not. In fact, I wished she hadn't have so she wouldn't have to repeat the same exact lines over and over again. Nothing in this movie is realistic and nothing in it makes you care about it.So if some reason you feel overly compelled to see this movie, please, rent before you buy. You won't regret it. In fact, you might get a laugh out of how utterly bad this movie is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame beyond belief","review":"With all the talented actors that are in this movie, you would think it would be better. Unfortunately it's not. Can't comprehend why William H. Macy and Jason Statham would even consider doing a movie like this.

Basinger's character is constantly terrified, but always resourceful in a crunch. Evans's character is cheerful, energetic and opportunistic in the best sense. Stratham's character is menacing. There are many hilarious situations and the cell phone (and all it can do) is always moving the plot along. Great minor characters and performances add to the mix. Not deep at all, but exceptional entertainment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"RE: Subpar at best","review":"William H. Macy and Kim Basinger must have needed the money. I was a fan of \\"Phone Booth,\\" the screenwriters' first script, but this one falls short. The dialouge is not only up with the cheesiest of the year, but lacks anything close to substance. I lost count of the plot holes, and the story just seemed a little too far-fetched. The director had 2 great talents with Macy and Basinger and came up with what had to be some of the worst performances of both actors' careers. Please don't waste your time, because I did for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I see a number of five star reviews for this film. We can'tgive any film a higher rating than five stars, so that meansthere are people here on earth who rank this movie withRashomon, Sullivan's Travels, Children of Paradise,and Dr. Strangelove - when in fact it's about as estimableas an episode of Starsky and Hutch.The most irksome thing about Cellular is the completeabsence of accountability for the crimes committed by itsprotagonist, Ryan. Let's see: armed robbery, auto theft,willful damage to property, reckless driving - that results ininnumerable automobile acidents ( which surely causedserious injuries ), resisting arrest, etc. He swipes a man'sPorche ( at gun point ) - and apparently the director thinksthis is OK because the Porsche's owner is a repugnantlawyer...Ryan gets away with everything, and winds upwith the babe on the pier.There's another annoyance, smaller, but annoying never-the-less. Jessica says that her husband is a real-a-tor...Bill Macy is very good, as always."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie should be disconnected","review":"Watched this yesterday on the way to a basketball game.

It seemed like a great parody of suspense thrillers. But then I was informed that it was actually supposed to be a suspense thriller. So I guess the acting was supposed to be terrible. Even Kim Basinger didn't seem that great. Poor William H. Macy, he deserves so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth wasting too many long distance minutes on","review":"William H. Macy is becoming like Christopher Walken in that he just makes movies that shouldn't be that good at all a little more bearable. Case in point, Cellular where he plays a police officer who really wants to start a dayspa. He meets a normal joe, Ryan (Chris Evans), who has this woman, Jessica (Kim Basinger), on his cell phone who says she's been kidnapped. The entire movie consists of Ryan running around town, trying to help this poor woman, and usually screwing up.Yes, if you watch it you'll find out why she was kidnapped, and before you can say \\"improbable shootouts\\" and \\"high speed car chases,\\" it's over. The film does have one good gimmick (the cell phone) and a good bit humor to make it worthy of a cheap rental or a cable viewing.

The book was not that good before, get it right and publish it once!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt like I wanted to scream","review":"There are few books I have liked as little as this one. The writing itself is not the issue, but more so the fact that she attempts to put so much mystery and suspense in the book that it doesn't progress. I found myself wondering why I cared about the characters and when it would be over. I believe that the biggest problem with this book is that it had so much potential and yet it left me wishing that I hadn't decided to read it in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Improved? I don't think so","review":"Unfortunately I missed the'reprint' on the book cover. As I started to read, I thought, this sure is familiar. Then I found the 'reprint'. The longer I read and started skipping pages to get the end faster, the less I thought the additions were any improvement on the old book. This clunker just kept going and going and going and going...nowhere. Don't even waste your time if you are loaned a copy. This book isn't worth the time to turn the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the....?!!","review":"I am angry at myself for even finishing this book.It's awful; a mess.The writing was trite and cliche', the characters made no sense, had no decent motives for anything and were ridiculously stupid. Even the supposedly \\"intelligent\\" characters did the dumbest things. And the big \\"shocker\\" twist that we had to wade through nearly 500 pages to get to?! Uhh... again, how stupid were these people?Total cop out and way beyond anything that I was willing to \\"suspend my disbelief\\" for.So lame.So very, very lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and easy meal for kids!","review":"I own the version without the heater for the tortillas, and love it.

He specifically went to Columbia Records because they promised that he would be allowed to record an occasional gospel album, which Sun Records wouldn't allow him to do. The album contains Johnny's originals and his take on his favorite gospel songs. It is a very good example of \\"country gospel\\". There is one bonus track, which is the mono EP version of \\"It Was Jesus\\". It is the same recording as the album version of \\"It Was Jesus\\", but the chorus that sings backup is missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Johnny's early best","review":"The story is that Sun Records owner Sam Phillips wouldn't let Cash record religious material, so Johnny up and split for a more lucrative contract at Columbia. I bet if Phillips knew how good the album gospel album would turn out, he wouldn't have been so stubborn about it. A really nice record -- one of Cash's best and most heartfelt early albums on the Columbia label.

Very egocentric, Ed tells himself he is a genius, and part of Brazilian press agrees. But, for most people he is only a complete [disappointment]. Dwitza is a proof: no creativity, no originality, a retro album using concepts assimilated (ie, robbed) from over 20 artists like Steely Dan, Marcos Valle, Azymuth, Joao Donato, Crusaders, Kool & The Gang etc. His old fans felt the album very disappointing, and its poor sales already led him to be fired from the cast of Universal-Brazil. News on the press tell he will sign with a small independent label, Trama, which will will be very bad for Ed's career, a very promising one until this erratic Dwitza."},{"rating":"1","title":"Temp alerts are preset and can't be changed.

This is not workable for me (I'm in Tucson and keep my house at 85 or so in the summer) so I returned it. Part of the description also talks about 4 alert features.

The temp alarms (2 not 4 as claimed) are preset to alert you if the temp drops below 75 or above 82 degrees, they claim it has 4 alerts which is not true . 75 degrees is max for my tank so alerts are useless. So be sure you can use it before you buy it. I bought 4 different types of digital thermometers and put all 4 in one tank with the probes side by side and all 4 have a different reading.

The hits \\"The Wah-Watusi\\", \\"Don't Hang Up\\" and \\"South Street\\" appear on the Cameo-Parkway Story box set, but having \\"Not Me\\", \\"Crossfire!\\" and a pre-British Invasion version of \\"Don't Throw Your Love Away\\" (The Searchers) on this collection justify the bargain price of this single CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful CD By The Orlons !","review":"Really a best of CD by my favorite girl group The Orlons !

My previous light of this type didn't. I couldn't get one of my computers to power down its USB ports when the machine was off, so my choice was to either not use that old light or fiddle with unplugging/plugging the light every time I shut down/turned on the computer. With this Iogear model, I can leave the light plugged in all the time and only have to move the switch to turn it off on that one recalcitrant computer. The only slightly negative thing I can note (and the reason for my four star rating instead of a five star rating), is that the \\"shaft\\" of this light is somewhat too flexible: if you don't position the light properly, it tends to flop over. The flip side of that \\"problem\\" is that the shaft's flexibility makes it easier to reposition the light so that I can slide my keyboard drawer in an out without too much trouble (my light is plugged into my keyboard's USB port). Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Trip","review":"Outstanding publication.

It was then and still is a fantastic thriller that is hard to put down until you have finished reading it. I researched the earthquake precursor facts mentioned in 8.4, and am planning to read the book again (more than a decade later). I am now in a location near where birds fell dead from the sky and fish floated up dead from the river. Could it be from radon gas escaping due to the buildup of a new seismic event?? This book is riveting reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Earth Didn't Shake When I Read It","review":"If you want a vague idea about what life will be like in the U.S. when a big earthquake hits, don't bother to read this book.

I felt that the character's in this story were too uninteresting and almost made me fall asleep I thought that they could've been developed a whole lot better espically in the face of what they expirence in the book. Anyway skip this book 8.4 it's not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard characters, off-the shelf 'plot'","review":"Don't buy this book. The characters are from central casting, and the alleged plot has been used in countless Hollywood disaster movies. The author assures us that the science in the book is solid... even if it were so: \\"SO WHAT!: buy a good geology book and be done with it\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"About the only thing that fits this novel is the word lame. You are asked to believe that a group of scientists are simply handed a nuclear bomb to set off an earthquake in hope that it will stop another earthquake?!#@$! The sole basis of their belief is that \\"We have just got to do something.\\" Occasionally the President pops up on the scene for some unknown reason. The evil guy in the book is trying to stop them from exploding the bomb. He seems to be the only one with a brain. I think the real bomb was the one the author dropped on his audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"A yawner.","review":"A formulaic disaster story that takes too long to build up to the Big Event. The main characters were bland and boring, and I lost interest early on. I then skipped to the end, and the payoff wasn't enough to justify sitting through the entire thing. (A better, more suspenseful earthquake-type novel would be Ken Follett's \\"The Hammer of Eden\\".)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Thriller","review":"The most interesting parts of this book had to do with the factual descriptions of the New Madrid Seismic Zone. Knowing that the faults in this area are all too real, the underlying idea of a devastating earthquake's hitting this area is believable. Nothing else in this book kept my attention. The plot was weak and the characters annoying. I read the entire book because I always give the author a chance to redeem himself, but in this case I should have just put it down 50 pages into the book like I wanted to. The stereotypical characters all lacked depth and development and were practically Hollywood parodies -- the image-obsessed politician, the beautiful earthquake scientist, etc., etc., etc.This book actually would've been far more interesting as a documentary about the New Madrid Seismic Zone instead of the weak semblance of fiction that it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shake Rattle and Read","review":"I really did enjoy this novel. I do happen to agree with the other reviewers that there are several places that the book comes up short (the romance and some of the road names come to mind.) however, the book is fast paced and interesting. Having lived in the area and also having lived thru several earthquakes (in other parts of the country) I found myself drawn into the story several times. Especially when they are underground with earthquakes activity around. Sure it plays on several of my primal fears; however I found myself REALLY believing in the danger to the characters of the novel. The science is accurate, the characters are more than adequate, and I find that I must really recomend this novel if you are looking for an evenings escapist enjoyment. Read it, and enjoy it. It does have its flaws, but very few novels don't. I think you will enjoy it and get caught up in the situations that the author puts you in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gave me chills","review":"I had the mixed blessing of bringing this book with me on a trip through Kennett, MO to Memphis, TN. In the evenings, I would be reading about all of the earth changes that devastated the places where I had just visited....If you live anywhere in the Midwest, this book is terrifying because you can picture what's happening!The author's plot holds together as the earth splits apart, and he allows us to visit some ordinary citzens as well as the scientists ands and politicians dealing with the disaster. Some grammatical problems (incomplete sentences) kept me from giving this 5 stars, but in a way this flaw (fault?) causes the novel to read like a news article. This makes it more realistic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating Idea Poorly Constructed","review":"8.4 is a fascinating idea . . . an earthquake in the Midwest. Best of all it is based on history which makes it even more unnerving.Unfortunately the frequently changing point of views, the predictable romance and sabotage turn a great idea into a miserable read.If you love science, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Tried","review":"Technical research was great- living in a fault area I found it to be the most, only, interesting aspect. I normally drop a book if after 100 pages my desire to read on is not there. I stayed for 200 pages so must give the 2 star rating. The short paragraphing, jumping too quickly from scene to scene found me leafing through instead of reading through. I am eagerly waiting for \\"The Rift\\" to compare two authors approaches to the same catastrophe."},{"rating":"2","title":"This should shake you up!","review":"I've known about the New Madrid Seismic Zone for sometime, but I never realized how catastrophic this area could be. The story is fast pased and factual, giving clear explanations of seismic activity and its aftermath. The best thing I can say for a book is when it inspires me to look up more information on the subject. This is just such a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accesible introduction to patterns","review":"This book is quite old now, but the material covered in the book does not suffer from its age, because the book is not supposed to be a language reference.The book starts with some words of wisdom on the basics of the language, for example spending just long enough talking about inheritence and polymorphism to get to the heart of the issue. There are some of the simpler idioms introduced earlier in the book (virtual constructors, reference counts, handle-bodies) and then the book moves towards more advanced material, including multiple dispatch, and the best discussion of the prototype pattern (\\"exemplars\\") that I have seen in any book.If you're looking for a way into \\"pattern oriented programming\\", and you found \\"Design Patterns\\" completely unreadable, this is a good book to get you started on some concrete examples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waking Up and Ending Day Nicely","review":"I've bought many fitness and yoga DVDs and I find that this is the one that I use the most often because it is really effective.The AM section really helps when I've got a stiff back or just at stretching me out and getting me ready for the day.The PM has been really helpful in getting me ready for a very good sleep and unwind at the end of the day.This is a very useful DVD. It's accessible for beginners and also beneficial for people that have done yoga for some time. Great for anyone looking for focused, effective and easy to follow routines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this DVD","review":"I purchased AM/PM Yoga for Beginners after Christmas and have found it to be almost unbelievably wonderful. I am not an exercise girl, but I'm getting up early in the mornings so I'll have time for a routine before heading off to work. I'm a high school librarian so I can have 10 kids needing something, printers not printing, computers not cooperating, etc., etc., etc. all at once. I'm stepping back, taking some calming breaths, relaxing my stomach and body, and quietly lining things up to be done in order, thanks to these gentle routines. Barbara Benagh's voice is relaxing and calming. I like the soft melodies in the background and practicing yoga does not feel rushed or stressful. No \\"no pain, no gain\\" sentiments here. I highly recommend this soothing form of exercise and this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect start to my day","review":"What a great way to start the day.

They are very good for getting loosened up and focused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan!","review":"I really don't like this DVD very much. They have select poses and stretches that they just cut and edit to and put together making the \\"10 + routines\\" The cutting and editing doesn't make for good flowing routines. They don't prep saying \\"This is what you'll need during this routine\\" so you're grabbing things, getting out of the position quickly, etc... Also, You're laying down, they you have to stand up quickly to get to the next pose which puts a lot of strain on your body. The cutting and editing doesn't help you to know what is coming next. I would much rather have a boring dvd with 1 morning routine and 1 night routine where you see the instructor the whole time doing what your doing and it actually flows and you get to the next position in the least straining way possible. Versus the up, down, up, down, up, down of this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This dvd is awful. There is no yoga practice to speak of.

I find it really annoying on this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Excellent DVD for a beginner like me. I started with Basic Yoga Workout for Dummies to learn in greater detail positioning of 12 poses (and good yoga information), and moved on to Benagh's Beginning Yoga DVD, which is especially good for learning deeply the Sun Salutation. Then, I graduated to this DVD. Love the music that has been added to the already healing sound of the waves. Great routines that vary in length, allowing me to choose which will fit into my sometimes hectic days. Her verbal guidance and cues are helpful and supportive throughout. Her yoga poses are also an inspiration. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners","review":"I purchased this dvd so I could get back to doing yoga after three years away. I didn't practice regularly even then, but I was certainly more flexible. Well, this dvd has increased my flexibility. The PM section really helps me to get a good nights rest and relax my strained muscles after AM kick boxing. I did not give it five stars because there is a PM portion that has you sitting then standing, then sitting and standing yet again. There seems to be no flow there. There is a lot of breathe work which is great for relaxation, however, I am now ready to do more positions. Overall this is a good dvd and will purchase the next one which I hope will be more challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"Very pleased with this video.

The morning sessions are not more then 35 minutes long and a nice way to start the day. They get your energy flowing and your body moving. The evening sessions are a little longer and are nice for relaxing, getting rid of some tension and just unwinding. There's one for getting back some energy which is great for those days when you get home and need a kick-start to get through a full evening agenda."},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatile and Relaxing","review":"This DVD is a wonderful DVD with a great selection of practices on it for both the morning and the evening.Barbara's voice relaxes me and she offers great guidance and instruction on how to get the most out of the poses.

Furthermore, the listed bonus material (TGP short films, behind the scenes) are not on the disc. What you do get is a trailer for the film and for other Tokyo Shock releases.The transfer is expectedly average (these cheaply shot and quickly made features are never going to sparkle), and there are DTS-HD 5.1 audio tracks in both Japanese and English.It just boggles the mind that these kinds of oversights happen in this day and age.

Fuerst's commentary and analysis is stronger on Esther, Ruth, and Song of Songs than on the other three books. His thoughts on the Song of Songs are refreshingly unorthodox, and he rejects the straw men set up by scholars of various persuasions.There is a definite Christian bias which is understandable and is not troublesome even to a Jewish reader.

That may seem harsh but is the truth. I have always been a fan of Entombed and I really liked their last album, but this one is just, uhmmm not very good. Even with the exterme musical change, it isn't very good. The few bright spots (ignoring the covers) is 20/20 vision. Which isn't awsome by any means, but has a catchy little riff.

And what better kind of book to use when debating other evolutionists than a book by an evolutionist which puts many arguments to rest. He shows very clearly and mathmatically how \\"random variations cannot lead to the large scale evolution claimed by the neo-Darwinians.\\" However, he tries to persuade us into seeing his theory of NREH, or Nonrandom Evolutionary Hypothesis.

This book reveals that such hopes are empty.Materialists must hold that inanimate atoms can accidentally give rise to self-awareness, love and intrinsic value. You want reason and logic?

If you're a naturalist taking refuge from intelligent design in evolutionary theory, you have three choices: 1) Insist that evolution is some how above or immune to the natural laws of mathematics and probability (i.e. evolution is \\"super-natural\\"). 2) Abandon your self delusion. 3) Press the back button now.

While it does provide accurate basic information on a few common varieties, it doesn't even try to cover the many variations on the SKS, nor does it give much detail into the workings of the gun's parts.If you're on a *very* tight budget and just want a basic guide to your SKS carbine, try to pick this up for under ten bucks (including postage).

The problem with the movie is....well the movie itself. Eric Roberts is featured prominently on the cover, yet his total on screen time is maybe 3 or 4 minutes. The story is about the rapture and the events of what happens to the main character afterwards. He relives the same day over and over again (think Groundhog Day), and finally accepts Jesus Christ and is \\"taken\\" with his friends. I find this irresponsible, because we do not get \\"do-overs\\" in life. If you make the wrong choice regarding your salvation, then it is game over with the coming of the rapture. You will be \\"Left Behind\\". there is also another plot in this movie of a singer who is kidnapped, and then by implcation, it is found to maybe be her boyfriend. This story line never goes anywhere, and is only a further hinderance to the main plot of the movie.

The acting stinks. The plot is ridiculous. The film is preachy and phony and fails to do anything more than provoke it's viewers to become exasperated with the corny lines and wooden acting. It's repetitive and furthermore, the theology is all wrong. No one knows the hour or the day of Jesus's return. Not even the Son, but only the Father. The movie gives the cop chance after chance to get saved so that in the end he is able to predict exactly when the rapture will occur. He even sets the timer on his watch. UGH!

Nancy along with Christopher Golden is one of the best writers out there of Buffy novels. The 2 of them have been doing so since the early days and have the BEST grasp of the characters next to Joss Whedon himself. I have been reading the books since they first start publishing them as I've been a fan of Buffy since it's debut in 1997 and Angel in 1999 and Nancy is one of the authors I know without a doubt will never disappoint. She does portray the \\"real\\" Spike, I'm sorry the so many can't see that, he was no knight in shining armour in season 6.

The author obviously never watched the 6th season and it shows. She wrote Spike out of character for this season.

Also are we really suppose to believe that after 4 years Buffy is still not over Angel?

Anyone who has watched the series knows that Spike's chip no longer works on Buffy, but this book has him wanting to get rid of the chip so that he can kill her. Did the author ever watch the show? This book is poorly written and comes across as bad fanfiction. In fact, save your money and go read some fanfiction, you will be a lot happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Spike bashing nonsense!","review":"If you're a Spike fan, don't bother wasting your money on this book. Just like many of the other BTVS books on the market, this one portrays Spike as a stupid, one-dimensional villain. In other words, the characterization is terrible!Anyone who actually watches the show knows that Spike is anything *but* a flat character. He has a multitude of layers, something the author of this book doesn't even begin to recognize. Between the poor characterization and the constant \\"Spike bashing\\" by the Scooby Gang, the book left me more irritated than entertained. So unless you despise Spike, steer clear of this book (as well as any book by Chris Golden). It's not worth your money or your time.Instead, try \\"These Our Actors\\" or possibly \\"Little Things\\". Those two novels have much better characterization and are more Spike-friendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute dreck!","review":"This book is *nothing* like the series. It's set in Season 6, after \\"Dead Things\\", and Spike says in the book that he can't bite Buffy??? He knew by then that they chip didn't work on her! Spike never wanted to kill Dawn. Spike is not the evil creature that he's been painted in this awful dreck! He spent the entire summer taking care of Dawn with no hope of impressing Buffy, because he wanted to keep his promise to \\"a lady\\".I suggest that Ms. Holder actually *watch* the show that she's writing about before attempting another one of these books.I'm a fan of BtVS, but first and foremost I'm a SPIKE fan, and I won't buy any more of these things unless they paint Spike as he really is: either on the way to redeemed (from Season 6) or redeemed vampire with a soul that he is now!High School is finished.Angel and Buffy are finished.Spike and Buffy 4 eva!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyable","review":"The story was interesting, escapist fiction.

However, this version of the single has two remixes of the album cut \\"I'm Alive.\\" This track, co-written by Lopez's soon-to-be-ex hubby Cris Judd, gets a discocentric remix by the ever-trusty DJ team of Thunderpuss (Chris Cox and Barry Harris). The end result is a winning groove that could be one of this summer's club anthems. So, if you're going to get this single, skip the versions of \\"I'm Gonna Be Alright,\\" and go directly to the Thunderpuss remixes.

The tracks with guest rappers sounded interesting.The afforementioned decline began with her second album, Where the majority of boardwork was helmed by love-him-or-hate-him P.Diddy, it had a few great moments but was sub-par overall.\\"I'm gonna be alright\\" continues this streak. The simple lyrics lag on, and the music was built around a Club Nouveau sample, and \\"I'm gonna be alright\\" makes uncreative use of it. The Luniz sample of the hook was superior.J.Lo gets a little help from her friends, rappers 50 Cent and Nas, they're presence doesn't help at all.

But honestly, this is a book only for those intimately involved in the 10th Mountain Division's history.

The Catholic Church put the Bible together!! Before 395 AD, there was NO bible!! All we had was the Traditions of the Apostles which have been handed down through 2000 years. \\"The pillar and foundation of Truth is the Church\\" -Timothy 3:16. Not the Bible! The CHURCH.

With regular floss, it just rips, tares and cuts my gums...this does not. This tastes great, works great and does not tare.

It does slide pretty easily between teeth, but the mint coating on the floss flakes all the time and it doesn't taste good. I have to rinse after I'm done flossing because I hated the way it tastes. Even worse, after using the floss several times, the coating sticks to the cutter -- as a result, you can't easily cut the floss. I have to resort to a scissor to cut the floss now, because pulling the floss hard would either shreds it or detaches the cutter from the case. I hate this floss so much that it makes me not want to floss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading Duchess for a Day, I was looking forward to this book.

From correspondence, documents from the college from which Rico graduated, it's cleverly done, something to make the series all the more \\"real.\\"Again, of course it's hype.

Set in 1969, in a small town in Florida. An alcoholic father has abandoned his wife and child. The child is slow and has all kinds of problems, so the mother is forced to open up a business. In 1969 what kind of business does every small southern town need? You guessed it, a sex shop! It's a different plot and seemed like it would be a very interesting story, but looks can be deceiving. They hire writers to make the \\"official\\" description of the movie, so it sound great and you'll go see it, and in this case they got me. This has got to be one of the slowest and most pointless movies I have ever seen. Everyone is portrayed as stupid, the film is choppy and makes no sense, and on top of that it's just a total bore!

It picks up most all of the crumbs, hair, grass, or whatever else seems to find itself on our carpet or kitchen tile. It leaves vacuum marks on the carpet, and it does a great job of cleaning up crumbs on the tile. It is lightweight, and my 5 year old daughter is having a blast vacuuming like a \\"big girl\\".

I know kevin nash, goldberg, and other stars are good wrestlers but they can't compare to the rock, HHH, stonecold, and etc. also what's with this general manager ... I don't want to watch raw just because HHH and the rock are on it. any way I will talk about bad blood. the event was very dule compared to vengance. come on I know ric flair and sean michaels are legnds but this match would of only been good ten years ago. of course the hell in a cell wasn't all bad.

Since neither man is known for risk-taking moves, this one was average. Goldberg vs. Chris Jericho had a nice build-up which led to the eventual Goldberg squash. Shawn Michaels vs. Ric Flair was a \\"dream match\\" of sorts but didn't exactly play out like one. With no title involved and Flair more or less playing a Helmsley lackey, these days, this match really didn't have the emotion it deserved. The rest of the card was nothing you couldn't and don't see on a weekly basis on RAW.

He said they made him look stupid. Did he forget about his stint in WCW? Hell in the Cell was a good match but short. It started off as a match then got into a street fight. The hammer shots by Triple H on Nash's leg were brutal. The head shot faded away, so I dont know how he pulled that off.

I would expect them not to be the highest quality for 20 bucks but I didn't expect them to be this bad. To the sellers credit, they did give me a partial refund due to the rust. Still not a quality product at all.EDIT: Tried out a few more bits today. There is actually a flash from machining on the cutting edges of at least two of these bits and both of them had a wobble.

The application of economics and game theory to this problem is most definitely original and is the greatest achievement of the book. It is a tribute to the authors that such a simple model that so ruthless applies Occam's razor can explain so much, however the work is flawed it simply does not reflect reality. The reasons behind democratisations are more complex than this model, as powerful as it is, can reflect. This book and the model developed within should be viewed as beginning which other works can develop and expand upon. I have no doubt that economists will continue to contibute to this field with more advanced and better models.

The scenery mostly looks dreary, because of the dreadful videography. A lot of stuff is shot through dirty train windows. And so on.

It gives no clear picture of the university, supposedly a California Ivy. Eve, the heroine, is poorly drawn and not terribly sympathetic. She has no ambition other than to become head cheerleader and marry well. Kendra, her roommate, is a far more interesting character. There is no motivation for the Fata Morgana's choice of Eve for doom. Even the cheerleading tryouts (for a major university!) are a farce, as is the size of the squad.

First and foremost, the author has never been to college, maybe community college. Or she would have had a more accurate description. The book is written for fourteen year old girls but she adds in cheesy sex scenes, so there goes the teen category. The characters are flat and dull and show the authors own dislike for girls who are different then her.

The only good reviews, I see are probably from her friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This book was suprisingly good! I really enjoyed it, I couldn't put the book down!

Constable's work shuns naive generalizations of maids as passive victims (as many other works have), although I felt that domestic workers' acts of resistance and agency could be interrogated in greater scope and detail.

There is practically nothing to recommend GAME OF DEATH 2. One of the earlier reviews says that Lee imposter Bruce Le (star of MY NAME CALLED BRUCE, a very obscure chop socky flick) stars instead. Simply, this movie is garbage, shame on Raymond Chow for producing this. When will people realise there was only one Bruce Lee, and the Bruce Le's, Li's, Lai's should be ashamed as well.

Currently, I vacuumed my whole house and smelled that familiar hot smell and thought I was burning through a belt. Not so. Upon opening the bottom of the vacuum I found that the beater bar had caused so much friction with the vacuum casing that it burned through 2 layers of plastic casing on the vacuum unit.

The name \\"Powerglide\\" is a misnomer. It did not move easily over any of my carpets. I got a very sore back the few times I tried to use it. Going at any kind of angle, it simple would not move. I had to muscle it around everywhere. The power attachment worked once, but then it didn't the next time I tried to use it. It would have been great for my small places, but it just didn't work. The attachments kept falling off as I used the vacuum. Also, the filter would just blow right out of the side. The door holding it in would just pop open and the filter would fall out. I put a big rubber band around it until Bissel sent me a new door, but that did the same thing. When I called Bissell again, they said I would need to bring it to a repair shop. I didn't.

I will say that it tends to wash away easier when I've eaten, due to saliva and drink,so I do find myself having to apply it numerous times a day, but that is far better than being in the pain I am in ordinarily. It has been an absolute Godsend for me. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing CD.","review":"This is a great lounging cd.

Joe Lando (Dr. Quinn) stars as a city engineer who believes deadly gases are somehow being released into the city's underground sewer system, resulting in deadly fires and deaths. Greeted with skepticism by the egotistical fire chief (Michael Gregory, overacting shamefully), Lando must convince the mayor and everyone that he is right. Of course, a greedy oil baron (Michael Gross, looking woefully embarrassed) is the one responsible for the gas releases, but he doesn't want Lando to uncover this. A subplot involves Lando's troubled marriage to Gabrielle Carteris and their son's involvement with the daughter of Lando's old flame, who is now a newscaster(Susan Walters). Directed with little regard for common sense or pacing, COMBUSTION fizzles instead of sizzles."},{"rating":"1","title":"not closed captioned as listed","review":"I bought this only because it said it was closed captioned and we can't watch movies without words due to hearing problems which resulted in us wasting our money on the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fantastic","review":"I just started reading this book to my two year old daughter two weeks ago and now she is beginning to use the potty for all the right reasons!

I had said that this was my first death metal cd in a long time but I am going to wait and say that for the Cynic cd I'm going to get at the end of the week. Anyway, this is a combination of death metal like Death but mixed with melodic guitar playing similar to Iron Maiden. This is a good package here and has some sick songs on it especially Everlost part 1 and part 2. This style of death metal is usually called melodic death metal or Gothenburg metal. Gothenburg is the city in Sweden where this style supposedly originated from. This is a well done cd and I suggest to those who like good metal, In Flames, brutal metal mixed with melody, or good music to go pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty baker","review":"I ordered this baker because it was less expensive than others in different colors.

I bought a cushion once before that was much like the Tush Cush, but not as firm. So, if firmness is a must for you, this is it.I ride on the NYC subway every morning and carry it with me to work everyday.

Your butt still gets numb and achey over a short period of time in an office chair. I was hoping the cushion would be a little more comfortable. When first sitting in your chair, it also takes a while to get everything positioned, as it is either too far back, or too far to the right, or too far to the left, etc...

This time I decided on the white pie dish and was very happy to find a 9-inch one, because it's the most used size for recipes. I was confused, however, when I received the pie dish and there was a sticker on the bottom stating it was 10 inches, which I didn't want, so I measured it. Strangely, it measured 8 inches on the bottom. To be sure, I measured it against my Pyrex pie plate that measures 9 inches. This one fit inside. I love Emile Henry and the pie dish is beautiful and they are very functional, but I just thought others should know this measures just 8 inches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful dish; a little tall!","review":"I received this as a gift back in December.

Ireland, and maybe the former Soviet Republics. The new front in the war on terror, according to this book, is Southeast Asia. Authored by a CNN reporter from the Philippines, this book traces the individuals that have formed the beginnings of Islamic terrorism in the countries of Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand. The book names names, places, and events that together resemble the beginnings of an Al Qaeda style organization in SE Asia. The book also shows how governments are dealing or not dealing with these troublemakers. Underlying these movements is political disenfranchisement, economic poverty, and frustration with corruption, a topic that the book addresses to some level, though not one deep enough to satisfy this reviewer.

I mean a biker chain match? What is this the 1980's? and VKM's run-in to help Brock made it worse. The US title match between Big Show & Eddie Guerrero was sad & pitiful.

If you're obsessed with movie morbidity, read Kenneth Anger's excellent book \\"Hollywood Babylon.\\" If you're obsessed with dead rock stars (I am), read \\"The Death of Rock 'n' Roll.\\"Sometimes I don't know when to take Jeff seriously -- does he really believe Jerry Lee Lewis made a deal with the devil?

This book is based on historical events following World War 1. It focuses on a young African American woman coming of age in a world that at times hates her. She is greatly loved by her parents whose belief in God and prayers perserve them all through very hard times. I loved this book because it was a Christain romance and did not any sexual content at all. Instead it focused on what relationships are supposed to be based on - true love and concern for others. This is a book I will read over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice story...average craft","review":"I picked up the novel to give \\"Christian fiction\\" another shot. As usual, I was disappointed with the craft itself. The story depended on dialog too much to give a lot of information, quickly.

I mean pages connected to pages of just dialog.I managed to finish to see what happened, but thejourney itself was unrewarding.Foster's book addresses important issues and it is a good story. My low rating is due to poor craft, which only distracts me from the story. Ernest Gaines also uses simple language and is sensitive to characterization, but he manages to help me see and feel and think without \\"telling\\" me everything.This is book is, however, a pretty good first novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Delivery","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of several others who had read and were praising it.

It was funny when Henry put two strings on a bone tied the two string to his two teeth and summoned Ribsy, and Ribsy ran with the bone and pulled out Henry's two teeth.It was descriptive when Henry told about how he was going to pull out his two front teeth.

Leonora Leet wrote this book, and the other three in the series, as a labour of love. The culmination of a lifetime's work. The quality of the writing is incredible and serious students of Judaism and Kabbalah are bound to gain from its perusal. I myself learned a great deal about Judaism from it, but the majority of it remained a mystery to me.

Also, it shows when WWE signed Brock in April of 2001 to a developmental contract. Then it shows his first official match at Backlash 2002 VS. Jeff Hardy. To the match for the WWE Undisputed Championship VS. The Rock. To winning the 2003 Royal Rumble and beating Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship at Wrestlemania XIX. Also, it goes in depth and behind the scences from Brock flying on the WWE plane and pre- match and post match interviews.

Brock and Big show in their stretcher match was great too surprisingly. It goes into detail how Brock got started in the business and all. He went from a skinny little kid to a big monster.

About 10 minutes into it he was more interested in going to play with toys in the other room.If you're a Yogi die hard, and a fan of the new movie, this may be up your alley.

The saddest thing about this book is you could have spent the time saving lives and fixing teeth instead of writing a book that bored me to tears. I had to force myself to finish.

They depend on each other for support... this is \\"The Pact.\\"I'm glad they were successful and hope they will continue to be successful. I am discouraged that they did this while they, on occasion, beat people, stabbed people, sold drugs, and stole things from stores. This is inspiring? What is the message here?Break the bones of a white boy if he is staring at you (page 134)? Steal a sweatshirt because somebody told you it was easy (page 137)? Armed robbery (page 93)? \\"I jabbed the crackhead lightly in the thigh right under his butt and quickly closed the blade, hoping I hadn't hurt him\\" (page 81), after punching and kicking a helpless person for 20 minutes, wrote Rameck.None of these messages were inspiring.

What I like is that this audiobook is the unabridged version, so my kids are able to open up their book and follow along with the reading as they're listening. The second thing (probably the best thing) I like is that this audiobook is ready by the authors themselves. It'd added an air of authenticity and realism to my lessons, because the kids are listening to the actual people; for some reason, they're able to better visualize the story, knowing they're listening to the real people in the story. It's been so quiet on days that I play the audiobook, and not because the kids are sleeping! It's because they're so intent on the reading!

I was not expecting to lose this much though. I only used this for a couple of days and gave up because the quality of the image was so bad. I think it's just the nature of the product.

The receiver only outputs on the type of interface that the signal comes in on and I really didn't want to have to run RCA through the walls to the TV now. So I opted to convert the RCA to S-Video for the input.It does work - sort of. I do see the picture, but the quality is very poor. Perhaps it's just the nature of the conversion and any manufacturer's version of such a converter would suffer from the same issue.

After reading Dalton's Mind Over Markets, which I thought was phenomenal, I was excited to read Steidlmayer's contribution.You learn about his background, which is interesting. He describes some auction market theory and tools to apply. But mostly he advertises his capflow 32 product. Annoyingly so.While I was able to pull out a few nuggets of wisdom I'd rather have my $45 back. My bottom line recommendation to you is to go spend a weekend at Barnes and Noble and read it for free while spending your hard earned money on Dalton's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Understanding to the Markets","review":"This is an excellent read and well worth the investment. It will give any trader a better understanding of why markets do what they do. This book does not give a specific trading strategy (which was one of the things I was looking for) but rather insight into a tool that will support your trading and help you make decisions. This is the type of tool that the pros use. My biggest disappointment is the acknowledgement that Market Profile doesn't work like it used to, now you need new sophisticated tools and techniques that leverage Market Profile data as a starting point, which is convenient because the authors happen to have the software to do just that, Capflow32."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy Foam","review":"The inner foam comes bent, I guess because of the way it is packed for easy shipping, it never gets the right shape.

This book takes what is a very interesting subject matter and sucks anything that might possibly be interesting out of it and turns it into something overly complicated and dry. The book is dull and leaves me searching out other sources for examples to the points it brings up.

The bias of this book is that it considers actual experimentation by published studies to support its points.

In other words, this book fills the gaps."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting idea, deftly rendered.","review":"Someone said elsewhere that this felt like an exercise for Wolfe, and I know what they mean-- using a Memento-like plot (a main character who loses his memory at the end of every day) Wolfe sketches the world of ancient Greece through the eyes of a soldier named Latro.The details are compelling-- I was uninterested in the real historical value (people should not be trying to derive history lessons from fantasy novels) but Wolfe does a good job, as usual, of creating a realistic and detailed world for Latro to inhabit.The plot is somewhat less compelling. It is nearly a necessity of the trope that he chose that the plot becomes confusing (particularly in times when Latro couldn't write his journal) and I'm sad to say that I often didn't feel any kind of guiding line that was coherent enough to motivate me through the confusion.Interesting for Wolfe completists or real fans of historical fiction, not a place to begin with his work otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A correction","review":"Another reviewer thinks that Latro is a legionaire. Tain't necessarily so. Read the book yourself, the history lessons of ancient Greece and the Romans, Latins and Etruscans you can work out at for yourself.

It had terrible lyrics and no good song concepts. There were 1 or 2 good beats on the whole album, but overall its a really bad album.

The state of Mass is'nt really on the Hip-Hop map, but by releasing this, it only sets us back even more. And what type of ryhming style is he using? It never seems to go anywhere. Some of his beats are O.K at best but he should of spent more time on his lyrics. His BIG single on this CD was \\"Rock the Party\\" and it just feels so flat.

He has a great voice and its a shame that its used for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Get Cheated","review":"If you wanna waste your time and spend some money, go ahead buy this bad album.

Please, Ben--retire. Your time has passed."},{"rating":"1","title":"F Zino","review":"I'm not saying that there may not be any tracks on this CD from The Source legend, but i think Zino personally is a sleazy, cocky mofo who abuses his power as being one of the head in charge at The Source. Ja's R.U.L.E. only got 4 stars 'cause he worked closely with Zino before. I will admit that Game who was in G- Unit got a 4 mic Cd even though he saif f--- the source on one of the tracks, but I still believe that Zino had something to do with Ja getting four stars on that CD. Plus, I know it sounds kind of strange to call a black or latino guy dissing a white guy racist, but tht's what benzino really is... A racist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad I can't give it no stars","review":"This is possibley the worst record by one of the worst rappers I've ever heard. Who told this guy he could rap? This is horrible. This is beyond horrible. I'd pay Benzino $14 to give this crap back to him. He can barely rhyme words...its pitiful.

Yo, this guy has been in the game for a like a long time, but I've just now heard of him. Anyone who believed his beef with Em, was legit needs to be shot, he needed something to make himself official in the rap world and playing the race card with Em was his ticket, to bad it like this album back fired on him.

First off, I know deaf & mute people who can pull off a better cd than this hazard. So what you recruited Scarface (.44 Caliber Killas) for the albums only highlight. Who are you to have the nerve to judge what \\"real hip hop\\" is? For someone with a head as swelled as Benzino's should have a cd with an example of what he preaches about in his Source Magizine. How in the h@*! can you say that white rappers have no place in hip hop when son is half white himself? Back to the cd, was it necessary to have three versions of one song on the same cd? I think not. And what the h@*! was he thinking to do the track Hula Hoop? Son needs to stick with publishing weak journalism instead of music.

This CD will NOT make you think, nor will it make you feel like the music is authentic or related to real hip hop. This CD will most likely be played in clubs or at some teen and/or young adult parties. Some of the songs are actually decent, and will make you move your head. But if you are a true hip hop fan, then you won't be feeling this CD. In my opinion, I rather listen to Eminem's CDs because there's more diversity, more thoughts, more feelings, more creativity put into his CDs. In Benzino's CD, there's too much glamour, too much flossing, too much \\"industry\\" type lyrics put into his album. But then again, I believe he made this CD for the clubs and parties. But to review this and categorize this album under hip hop would not be right because this album surely isn't hip hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"H a t i n g n e e d s t o s t o p","review":"All the hatin' on ZNO needs to end.There are like 10 reviews up here from low lifes who never heard this album.Homie is not that bad.People just get their panties in a bunch whenever anybody disses Eminem.Whenever anybody says anything real about Em or is critical about him they are labeled wack and a hater.But ZNO is neither and this album proves it.I enjoy this album and will be first to buy his next.To the haters at least listen to a album if you going to talk about it.Listen too Gangsta Touch and Redemption Rosary's."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important reference for any adult educator of daycare workers.","review":"A must read for those of us who train daycare workers.

On the 3 month plan you're going to be out $28 (for 2 months) at worst and on the 6 month plan you could be out $60 (for 5 months) if you quit in the month of the billing cycle.So your costs are less, and so is your exposure. The only drawback is: you'll need to get another card in 60 days or sign up for the month to month plan while you wait for your next card to arrive.It turns out, month to month is cheaper then anything, except the 60 day card, if you count money lost when you decide to quit the game but have a couple of months outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey Marketplace sellers: Here's a hint...","review":"To all Marketplace sellers:Why oh why would you sell this for more than Amazon does?

The return window was closed the moment I had purchased the item. Essentially, this was $28.99 down the drain, and I doubt I'll take my chances purchasing another game card from Amazon. I guess someone from their shipping center must really love the game that much to slash the seal and take the card out of the box.

Sure enough, after I used this cleaner, there was noticeable white haze on my wheels. There's no excuse for any modern cleaner to do this! I assume they test everything at some stage, but when it starts to make wheels hazy, it's back to the drawing board, lads. I noticed I'm not the only customer who has had this problem, so I wish now that I'd read the reviews. The main reason I bought this cleaner is because it was cheap; now I know that's the wrong reason to buy an automotive product.

Perhaps with a mildly dirty wheel this product will do the trick. My wheels were not completely gunked up, but they had a medium amount of brake dust on them. This product, plain and simply, did next to nothing with the brake dust. The regular dust around the center of the wheel and near the tires came off just fine, but I imagine soap and water would have fared as well. The brake dust didn't come off after applying a liberal amount of the T-159R, nor did it come off after rinsing with water as directed.My review specifically targets the product's claim, \\"Quickly penetrates and removes tough brake dust and road grime from all wheel surfaces\\". This is simply not true in my experience. If you have your car professionally cleaned and you need an interim light dust cleaner, by all means pick some of this up, it does fine.

It grabs you right from the beginning with the events of 9/11 and then continues with the story of a firefighter's life in New York. It is full of heart and makes you feel proud of our firefighters and law enforcement personnel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Irony of the Burqa","review":"Khadra's novel is sensitive and stark. The heartbreak of lives broken by Taliban rule is present on every page. Good men and women turn to violence and irrationality in a culture bent on denying all human rights. However, the final irony is that the burqa both suffocates and shields. It protects a woman from sexual advances yet turns her into an object of such mystery that her female form is a cause for intense arousal. While a woman's identity is lost under the burqa, the final act of sacrifice that allows Zunaira to live is only possible because two women can trade places anonymously. The stoning and execution of burqa-clad women both dehumanizes and intensifies the agony of the bound and helpless victims. The novel is haunting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful tragedy","review":"A gorgeously and eloquently tragic story of love gone wrong in Afghanistan. It seems to suggest that there is no such thing as a happy ending in such a society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turner","review":"This is a very revealing story about the terrorism felt by citizens of Kabul under the Taliban rule. The lives of two couples cross paths and each person is effected. The city of Kabul is portrayed as another main character. The destruction of the city's legal and moral structure is paralleled with the destruction of the two couples. This book gives great insight into the feelings of males and females who are confronted with constant adversity, destruction, poverty and who are challenged by very different ideals. Well written, easy to read and absorbing. I will enjoy reading it again and discussing it with others who have read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A painful glimpse of Kabul","review":"A poignant, sad tale of life under Sharia law. The characters are clearly drawn and the situation depressing. Well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Book","review":"The writer did not succeed in drawing you into the story. I found the book very depressing.Again, this was a book chosen for our book club and we all had essentially the same response to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"The Swallows of Kabul is an interesting story of the entanglement of the lives of two couples in Kabul. The first three-fourths of the book follow the two husbands closely as they coincidentally run into each other but never meet (somewhat like in Ulysses). Kabul is impoverished and the story takes place during Taliban rule and after the war with the Russians. All four of the characters struggle with living in Taliban ran Kabul and the question of existence develops into a poignant theme. The last fourth of the book moves to target the wives more and here the story became very predictable and I quickly began to lose interest. Khadra does have a rather peculiar writing style (or perhaps a result of the translation) where I found myself often feeling I was reading a play rather than a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shorter story","review":"Great quasi-fictional story. I found myself not wanting to turn the page to find out what would happen, but so anxious to find out what locals really think of the Taliban. It's great how the author was able to intertwine the stories. Overall, I saw a beautiful love story that many people may not understand. I saw how culture and the Taliban can be so oppressive to their own people. I think this should be read in all high schools. It was an easy but very descriptive read and the message was conveyed clearly."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Top Books of the Decade","review":"The Swallows of Kabul by Yasmina Khadra is a heart piercing book about two couples living under the Taliban in Kabul. In one chapter a husband begs his wife to go for a walk with him and she finally agrees, only to have a solider abuse her and physically force her husband to attend the mosque, leaving her to stand in the heat boiling under a burka. The helplessness of both of them to protect each other in the face of such random brutality haunts me. A second couple is struggling to survive her illness while the husband tries to succeed as a policeman in an arbitrary system. His work scenes contained the tension I feel when reading about working in royal courts where the king is a tyrant. The desperation of people trying to live under the radar in a Kabul ruled by the Taliban is gut wrenching."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful downer","review":"Yasmina Khadra, The Swallows of KabulThis wonderful book is also a real downer. Khadra tells us what it's like to live a totalitarian society. You feel the oppression and see the violence and horror of living in a brutal society with an even more brutal government.The book hinges on a moment when an otherwise sympathetic character participates in this brutality. With this, his life unravels and, with it, the lives of those around him. Some of the other reviews already have too many spoilers so I will not add to them.Why read this book? It's memorable fiction that also gives you insight into a country that has helped generate a lot of trouble in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tightly Woven Tale","review":"This tightly woven tale invokes sympathy and sorrow over the people of Kabul suffering under the Taliban---and women under their burquas. The tale is interwoven between Atiq Shaukat the prison guard and his ill wife Musarrat and Mohsen Ramat and his once progressive wife Zunaira. We know the two stories will eventually collide and Khadra does this skillfully so that it does not feel forced or contrived. I picked up this book because it was initially compared to a favorite of mine-The Kite Runner. For me, the comparison was misleading statement because it is not the same type of story other than the fact that the characters all fall under the harsh regime of the Taliban. This book stands on its own and is helpful to those of us not there in understanding the painfulness of a life left behind for one that is now under a Taliban regime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atrocity and passionate love merged into a city in ruins","review":"It is hard to put down this book once you've started reading the first few pages. You become intimate with a drama that you know will turn into a tragedy. The descriptions of Kabul are vivid and the characters of the story palpable and human. There's neither rhyme nor reason to the destiny of people, but in Kabul, brutality and ignorance have to meet and the result in darkening the brightest souls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misery..... disappointing read ....","review":"After reading The Kite Runner, a story about friendship, loyalty during the adverse times in Afghanistan during the Taliban, I was looking for another read centered on these harsh times in Afghanistan. The Swallows of Kabul was endorsed as book for those that enjoyed The Kite Runner however, disappointly, other than being set in Afghanistan the books similarities end there.I appreciated the descriptions about life during the Taliban rule. The author painted a vivid image on what it would have been like to walk down the street during these times. You felt sympathic towards the two couples, eventually their lives intertwined but not how you would have expected them. I was disappointed in the outcome of the story and was left with a feeling that the book was incomplete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking","review":"I heard an interview with the author on NPR which piqued my interest in this story. I requested it at my local library. When I curled up to read, I was shocked and actually appalled by the first sentence, which I'll reproduce here: \\"In the middle of nowhere, a whirlwind spins like a sorceress flinging out her skirts in a macabre dance; yet not even this hysteria serves to blow the dust off the calcified palm trees thrust against the sky like beseeching arms\\" (1). If this sentence doesn't make you roll your eyes and check your calendar to see if it's overuse of adjectives and bad similie day, then you may like this book. I don't know if it's was \\"lost in translation,\\" but I couldn't get past the distracted writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like 2 Different Stories Put Together in 1 Series","review":"I rented the first disc(ep.1-4)and after watching it I then bought this collection at a great price. I thought the first 6 episodes of Scrapped Princess was really fun. It had a little bit of action, interesting characters and moved pretty quickly. I mean the story rarely fooled around. Then something happened. The characters stopped growing, the fun left and the story took on some kind of matrix feel. The cool side characters left and in came in my opinion dull and boring characters. It was like someone started the story and then gave it to someone else after episode 6. It got to a point where I really didn't care what happened to the characters (and the story) after episode 12. Anyway it looks like I'm in the minority here but I felt I needed to put up my opposing view so as too keep the rating honest. Just my opinion like everyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up there in my top 3","review":"Well I ordered this anime collection without any real knowledge of whether it would be good or not. I am extremely glad that I did order it, just the kind of amazing animation I would expect from BONES. The plot was very captivating, characters were very well done and the story was very Matrix esque. This is a great anime to add to your collection and one that I will watch over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series-- A bit of an Abrupt ending.","review":"Scrapped Princess has a great cast of characters and an interesting blend of magic and scifi. The dubbing is actually quite good and the voices aren't too childish, some of the phrasing will give you a chuckle though. The first couple disks of the series are amazing and action pack. On the last couple disks though the action stalls a bit in favor of pulling the heart strings a bit. The ending is good but feels rather abrupt and leaves you with a lot of questions.Overall it's an awesome and enjoyable series and I highly recommend it to any Anime fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not Scrap","review":"I was expecting something along the lines of Himiko-Den. The spoiler on the ads only cover the first disk or two. It gets much better. It turns Sci-fi as it goes and even has some interesting points to make. Not a real thinker's anime, but not kiddie anime either. It has a good story and the English translation is easy to follow and seems well done. A good and entertaining series if a little generic (other than the sci-fi). Some comedy and rommance, fan service. Overall a well rounded story and worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scrapped Princess Review","review":"OMG! I loved this series! At first I was skeptical because the first few episodes are a tad weird and make you hate the main character, Pacifica, because she starts out rather obnoxious. However, once you get into the story, you get sucked right in. I ended up watching the entire series in one day!I give this anime two enthusiastic thumbs up! (Because two is all I have... *sigh* Why can't I be like Lucy in Elfen Lied??? Then I'd get four more hands AND I'd have awesome horns!)If you liked this anime, you will also like:Rune Soldier.

I hesitate to say that the price listings are accurate and up-to-date, but then again this book is not really for those seeking a price guide. This book is really the large, all inclusive, postwar Catalog that Lionel never would have produced. It is a wish list of sorts that includes a photo along with a brief history and description of almost every train product Lionel produced during the postwar period. This book is a handy reference for the collector and operator, and is just pure fun to peruse from time to time. A must-have for the postwar Lionel lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"Excellent guide to Lionel's sets (outfits) as they were called.

The book gives good background information for each segment of Lionel train (locomotives, flat cars, etc.) as well as insightful commentary on each train car model. The pictures are excellent but if you are looking for detailed information on the parts and assembly of the trains then this book will not help.That said, the book is highly recommended for the Lionel fan who wants to see the full lineup of Lionel trains produced (post-war) and their approximate values."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Reference","review":"This is an excellent reference work.

I didn't want to damage it anymore than it already was so I ordered a copy from Amazon's list of used book providers. I don't remember which company it was that I ordered from, but what I received was in such bad condition when I got it, I had to start paper clipping it together ONE day after I got it in the mail! What a mess it's been to try to read! The creepy thing is, when I opened the package, the book looked like it was in good shape, together, in one piece with no pages falling out. I don't know how they did it, but the company must have had it on their shelf for YEARS while the glue disintegrated and the cover separated from the pages and then not examined it before they sent it to me. One reason I ordered from this company, was the fact they are located in Reno, Nevada, where I live. I thought, because of that, I would get the book faster. I won't do that again."},{"rating":"2","title":"So authentic it hurts","review":"Lame Deer is an authentic look at traditional Sioux tribal beliefs. The author pulls no punches and western audiences may be disturbed by some parts - eating of dog, hanging by flesh to have a vision of the creator. However, as Lame Deer points out, many things about American culture are deeply disturbing to Native Americans too - from Mt. Rushmore to convenient religion practiced only on a Sunday. This was written a few years ago, before the casinos started seriously plowing money back into the tribes,but I doubt Lame Deer would be very pleased at the social costs of that either. All in all, a profound, deeply moving, provocative, funny and disturbing look at Native American culture subsumed by American white culture, but never defeated. I found it a good source for my own novel as well: Neitherworld, a sci-fi epic that takes place among the Ojibwe.Neitherworld Book One Akiiwan (CreateSpace Version)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book","review":"This book was wonderful.

He writes eloquently and convincingly of a Bombay populated by real people not the angst-ridden characters laden with 'history' that one is apt to encounter in books by the Indian postcolonial male. The story I loved best was the one about computer programmers racing to save their business told against a wrenching story of homosexual love interrupted by the brutal punch of right-wing religious politics in Bombay. The figure of the young man mourning his lost partner and their abruptly extinguished love on the beach is one that haunts me as does the account earlier of their lovemaking. Chandra is an exciting new writing talent who like Arundhati Roy sets new, higher standards for Indian writers than an earlier generation of largely over-rated scribes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirty city, boring book","review":"Mr. Chandra's creation, from the title onwards, is a ruefully falsified description of the city of Bombay, one of the most banal and dirtiest cities in Asia, as is well known.

Bombay has no such capacity; it only breaks down people into miniatures of themselves, to the level of the grim and the persistent human defecation abound in public places.

The first third of the book shows basic techniques for working with polymer clay. The instructions are simple and there plenty of pictures for each technique. The rest of the book is devoted to small, quick projects - projects that a beginner can do in an afternoon. They include some pieces of simple jewelry, little figures of people and animals, cards, fridge magnets, etc. Be aware that the projects are mostly cute and whimsical. Those with a taste for \\"sophisticated\\" crafts should look elsewhere for projects. I could only see one thing that would have made this book better - a discussion of the merits of various brands of clay. However, that omission doesn't really detract from the techniques presented. Overall, I would say that the book is very well done and I wouldn't hesitate to give it to a complete beginner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book Every American Woman should read","review":"The Story of Meena is a remarkable one of love and dedication to the women of Afhanistan.

Her life is one to be remembered and honored, and this book will give you insight into the difficulities the Afghani people have gone through, and the strength of women we don't hear about on the news.

Maybe it's because they lost their good-luck charm -- I was listening for John Ratzenberger and didn't hear him anywhere.Don't worry, Pixar! I still have faith in you.

I thought it would be fun to do a workout on my stability ball but I was totally wrong! There is no lower-impact option... which is especially nice when you're just starting out. She also sometimes says the wrong word and doesn't correct herself, so it's hard to understand what you're supposed to be doing.Biggest problem: If you're above 5'6\\" (I'm 5'8\\") you get a slightly bigger stability ball. This workout doesn't have that larger stability ball in mind. Some of the moves are impossible because of the size of the larger ball. This is a problem for me and I wish I would have just bought a dvd copy of windsor pilates to replace my old vhs. What a waste of ten dollars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard on Core!!","review":"This is a good pilates inspired workout on the ball. The ball really challenges the abs. This is not a beginner's DVD. If you are weak in the abs, MODIFY the moves. If you have a bad back, find something else. This workout needs a warm-up segment and a stretch segment. You will need to do these on your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"I have done Pilates for some time and also worked with the balance ball so I thought it would be interesting to put the two together, and as I hadn't done that before I thought a beginner program would help.

If you have some free weights, it is easy to add some upper body work during the beginning section, for a full-body workout in just about half an hour.The instructions are clear, and once you have become accustomed to the moves, you can turn off the speaking and just enjoy the workout with the music.Instructor Lizbeth Garcia gives suggestions for adapting to different levels of difficulty, and there is also a special \\"challenge\\" workout, so you can continue to use this DVD as you get stronger.The combination of stretches and strength work is very relaxing, and the way the exercises flow makes this a pleasurable and peaceful way to begin or end the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Author Tonia Tomlin Chaos 2 Calm give RAVE review for This BOOK","review":"Loved this book.

Less than an hour including extras, more shots of crowd members than players, and the boring voice-over frequently reminding us that this is the only tennis tournament that really matters doesn't help a whit. A truly pointless dvd with very little tennis. Summing up hundreds of matches in about 30 minutes of footage? You do the math.Might be worth buying only if you were there and hope to see yourself in the many audience shots. Otherwise, with barely any tennis on the disc, what's the point?

This is a book that exemplifies how a short, concise, yet informative history can be written.Gilbert discusses how ideas about foreign policy in the eighteenth century related to actual US diplomacy. Although the Latin headings of some chapters may be intimidating, the prose is not. The book flows and does not lose momentum in exhaustive analysis or a burdensome number of pages. At 169 pages, this book can be finished in a weekend.Gilbert focuses on the period from 1776 to 1796, culminating with Washington's Farewell Address. In doing so, Gilbert provides depth and insight to this formative period of US diplomacy. The roots, context, and controversies of US diplomacy from 1776 to 1796 are described and explained in the book. Much of Gilbert's analysis is still relevant to this day. In general, the book is a scholarly, yet short and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE - NOT FOR KIDS TO DO!","review":"This is not a push in decoration kit for kids age 3 and up as the package showed at my local Target.

After listening to the \\"Teach Me French\\" tape from the same serie, (What a wonderful job they have done on that one!) we couldn't wait to get our hands on the Chinese version. However, it only turned out to be a major disappointment! We loved the ideas of teaching the phonics in Pin Yin and the format of printing both Pin Yin and the real characters in the book. However, rhyming is very unfortunaly lost in the translation. It is so plain and dull! In quite a lot of places, the words are not even \\"singable\\" at all. Besides, the singing is unberably out of pitch and the rhythm is majorly wrong in some songs. I hope they will get it redone. It is such a huge difference between the French version and this one! Go figure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost couldn't be worse","review":"The idea of recording Chinese language children's songs is great, but unfortunately the music on this CD is terrible. The singing sounds like a bad female impersonator, and the music sounds like super-cheapo eletric organ samples. It's almost unbearable to listen to. My spouse who speaks chinese says the pronounciation was unrecognizable, maybe because of the very high pitched voice.I hope someone else will give this idea a second try and use native chinese speaking children to sing and professional musicians for the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This book and tape set was somewhat of a disappointment. The female vocalist in the audio recording valiantly attempts to sing Chinese lyrics to familiar American children's tunes. In this case it just doesn't work. The lyrics sound like they were \\"squeezed\\" into the music. Many of the tunes are completely out of rhythm. My children were also turned off by the singer's voice which is somewhat high pitched and grating. It would have been nice if the songs were set to Chinese melodies instead of western tunes. When learning a foreign language why not also learn the music of that culture as well?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disorganized book, nice audio.","review":"I got this hoping it'd help me improve my Mandarin since I only know Cantonese Chinese. It was a great disappointment.The audio portion is lovely, but the book that accompanies it is poorly organized. It does not contain all the lyrics in Chinese characters, and you need to flip back and forth in the book to get the \\"additional lyrics\\" in pinyin. The English translations are in the back of the book, so you cannot cross-reference meanings easily either.The pictures and vocabulary words in between each singing section are cute and useful, but I would not recommend this CD and book set to anyone wanting to learn Mandarin Chinese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"My kids screamed, \\"Turn it off! Please!\\" They could not stand listening to the very high pitched and out of tune voice. Needless to say, Teach me Chinese did not work for my children.

Leisa Hart goes much too fast for anyone to catch on to her moves. The dance moves she does are much to fast to learn and so is her pace with which she teaches. She does not set a very relaxing tone to her yoga poses, either-she sounds very rushed and does not teach any of her moves before she performs them. It is extremely difficult to keep up with her. Also, I thought there would be more exercises with your baby. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring and unimaginitve","review":"I bought this after reading the reviews online and was very disapointed with the video.

I began using the yoga portion at just a few days postpartum. As a yoga practitioner of several years, I can honestly say it in no way resembled any yoga I had ever participated in - it was just a few poses over and over again. Terrible. As I regained strength, I tried the dance/cardio segments. I'm sure would have liked them if I had any background in aerobics or dance, but I don't, so I had no idea what she was talking about and she didn't describe it very well (what, for example, is a grapevine?). The pilates section required props, as did the yoga, which I did not have on hand at my house. If you are serious about yoga, or have limited dancing and aerobics background, or don't have the room or $$ to buy a bunch of props, this is probably not the DVD for you. I will give Leisa props for being high-energy and for the DVD including multiple types of workouts, but overall it was a waste for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best! I actually look forward to it.","review":"I've never stuck with workout videos for more than a couple of weeks, but this one is great. I look forward to doing it. The dance steps aren't anything fancy, but that just makes you be able to concentrate on what you're doing rather than trying to keep up with complicated moves. When this video is over, I feel so great. And in just 2 months of using it, I've seen an improvement in my energy and flexibility. I wish I'd gotten her pregnancy video. The little bit of the video that your supposed to be able to do with your baby isn't really that great. My 4 mo old gets bored. But- over all, definitely a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"great postnatal moves, perfect pace","review":"Leisa Hart is superb in this video, her timing and pace is just what my giggly body needs. I have her FitMama & Me baby video also love both of these, she does a funky type dance routine that was fun and easy to learn and toned you with some pilates or yoga type moves, they were great! I usually don't toat someone who looks so good and makes it look so easy because I feel jealous, but this women is so positive and beautiful she is inspiring. i love her videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 months post partum","review":"I didn't really care for this video. The areobics portion was full of cheesy dance moves like the Grapevine. The yoga portion did'nt feel like real yoga either. It was full of quick movements and fast breathing in and out. Leisa Hart is definately not a yoga master. What I really wanted was a video that was geared towards mom and baby working out together. I felt disapointed because there was only a short part under special features section and most of it was sitting and stretching while massaging the baby. My son did seem to enjoy it the first time but he cried the second time so I stopped doing it. I purchased Lindsay Brinn's post natal boot camp and I liked it alot better. Over all I'd say I wish I never bought this video. The aeorbics part also felt like it was from the 80's and the music was a really cheesy calypso sounding track. It was anoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"great workouts, loved this as much as FitMamaPrenatal","review":"this is a great workout to slowly start getting back into action. I went to the doc and was told I could begin working out five weeks after delivery and i am doing really good three months later, and i owe it all to Leisa Hart. The FitMama Postnatal workout is prefectly paced, Hart is great at telling to watch your body and take it slow, she is precise and fun and motivating. I loved the funcky fat burn, and really felt good after each workout. i am now doing her Gym IN A Box dvd and love it, it is fabulous.....i highly recommend getting the FitMama Postnatal and go at your own pace, itf its not enought, get something else, but i think you'll love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"this will help me you get back into pre-baby shape","review":"I loved this workout, the dancing and aerobic moves were great and my energy has already began ot pick up.

I loved this video alot, and really love the FITMAMA & ME workout that uses the baby for resistance, boy was that more than I thought it would be. Both of these of must-have videos for post pregnancy recovery....matter of fact, my ob/gyn thought they were so good when she reviewed them for me that she is telling all of the patients to buy these and have them ready to use(plus do the FItMama Prenatal while prego!)

I read before another book that was difficult for me to take into action. This workbook gave me the intellectual material to ruminate and at the same time a clear path of action to follow. This is a difficult topic for me, the last feeling that I want have is feeling lost. This book provides with the general vision of where I am going, what it takes, and and the specific details of how to do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conditional Security is true if you believe the Bible","review":"Dan Corner has used all of the Bible to support his view on this topic. Most everyone else will only use the parts of the Bible that will support their view which makes their view very questionable. Dan allows the Word of God to speak for itself. If you want to know the truth about OSAS, this book is a must read. You owe it to yourself and everyone that you love. You owe it to God because of what He has done for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Theology, Bad Book","review":"Dan Corner boasts about writing the most exhaustive refutation to eternal security ever written\\" with 801 \\"shocking\\" and \\"blockbuster\\" pages. This book is quite easily refuted by simply reading the Bible instead of reading into the Bible what isn't there; Eternal Insecurity in Dan Corner's case. The author's ill-guided crusade has a very faulty foundation based upon a complete misunderstanding of mankind's fall in the Garden of Eden. From there he continues to build his doctrine on a false and very humanistic free will presupposition. Indeed, this book Semi-Pelagian Arminianism to the core. I truly feel sorry for anyone who reads this book, believes it, and then lives the remainder of their life wondering each day if they were good enough to maintain their salvation. What a sad existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Glorious Truth!","review":"As I read Dan Corner's book, all I could think of, is the glorious truth that he presents in such an easy reading format that any normal reader can comprehend. His use of Scripture, logic, and historical facts, makes for an excellent tool in the use of combating the false doctrine of Eternal Security. I thoroughly examined the references and began on my own to study the History of Christianity, the early church, the dark ages, and the Reformation. I believe that Dan is very honest in his research, to the point, and holds to the clear truth represented in the Bible. I personally believe that anyone interested in the teachings of John Calvin, or the 'myth' of Eternal Security, should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"SPIRITUAL DYNAMITE!","review":"Wow this book is dynamite! It demolishes every aspect of eternal security. No stone is left unturned. It's hard to pick a fav chapter. The one answering all their arguments is terrific and very handy if you like to defend the faith. This is a good book to keep right next to your Bible. You can look up whatever verse or subject you want to address and go right to the spot in the book to get the answer. It's obvious the author has been thinking about this for a long time! Another good chapter gives hundreds of questions to answer from the Bible along with the verse to look up. How anyone could still believe once saved always saved after that is beyond me. He's got the real, complete Romans Road, explains about true and false grace, tells what true freedom in Christ is, tells how important it is for a Christian to forgive, explains God's faithfulness, etc. And it's real easy reading--great food for the soul. A must have in every believer's home."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Life-changing Book!","review":"I highly recommend this book if you are dealing with wanting to know if eternal security is what the bible taught or not. Dan Corner does the best job in refuting Eternal Security that I have ever seen! If you have any doubts or questions this book answers them all. Very well done and a very indepth and thorough job."},{"rating":"1","title":"A for Effort, F for Quality","review":"Dan Corner has truly put a lot of effort into this book. I will give him that. Anyone who writes an 800+ page book should be congradulated for their efforts.That being said, this book is greatly lacking. Firstly, the print quality of this book is not the greatest. The text is ridden with too much bold text, changes in font, and italics. The ink, in certain places, is also fading on the copy that I have.The content of the book is quite whimsical. Even the advocate of Conditional Eternal Security should be ashamed of its whimsical approach. It is heavily rhetorical, plays on emotion, and in all the steam it puts forth amounts to very little in terms of solid, indepth exegesis.It is hardly \\"exhaustive\\" as many claim, though it will \\"exhaust\\" your eyes due to all the bold typeface utilized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Pump!","review":"Used this pump to replace my boat's original salt water pump for my toilet.

I should have waited. I think this was the WORST book I've ever read. The whole book is about zombies from the sea that keep a village hostage in an old fort. Big Deal. The end of the book he blows up the fort as a sacrifice. The little boy in the story, keeps telling the father about something in the basement, but you never find out what it was. Why? Simon Clark should put his pencils away and read a real author like Dean Koontz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clark, Nailed By The Heart","review":"Nailed By the Heart is better as far as my Clark experiences go but I still did not find it good. I found it to be mediochre at best. It's one of those books that has a great beginning but then unravels for me into a giant mess with only a scene here and there being interesting to me. Books involving drowning in any form always creep me out (John Saul's The Unloved had a horrifying dead body in ocean scene) and this book had some \\"stay away from the shoreline\\" stuff, but nothing groundbreaking. Nothing special here but I'm sure fans of Simon Clark would like it. It is his first novel after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 100-word book review","review":"Nailed by the Heart, Simon Clark's debut novel, is a gripping, visceral story of ancient evil and supernatural powers, which I found occasionally reminiscent of John Carpenter's movie The Fog. I liked the story's location, a half-derelict fort at the very edge of the sea, and encountered plenty of uncomfortable and scary moments as the forces of evil started to close in on the good folks. This is not for the squeamish, as it contains some stomach-churningly gruesome scenes, and the writing does have a few rough edges, as befits a first novel. However, it is definitely worth a look!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Nailed\\" Left Me Numb","review":"The title caught my attention. The plot rather intrigued me. However, Simon Clark's debut left me numb and nauseous. Not from the horror. From his overly descriptive clumbsy writing, (how many ways should one describe clouds?), repetitive cliches, and lack of control of leading the reader to emotional curiosty.In \\"Nailed By The Heart\\" we meet a family that buys a seafort in England. A village of weird characters. And the Saf Dar. A supposed religious group of horrific murderers. Half way through the book I found myself saying, \\"Ok, get on with it already!\\" and skipped to the last chapter. It was as if I had not missed a thing. The conclusion is sappy.

I stand absolutely amazed. Only a short bit into the \\"twist\\" part of the movie, I was murmuring things to myself, likening the portrayal of insanity in this movie to such classics as A Clockwork Orange.And then the ending of the movie came... and entirely too soon... and I was floored. I am willing to say that this movie is the single most gripping foray into such a theme as I have ever seen. Bar none, a classic worthy of watching at least twice. This movie is something shot out of time, not carrying itself on a big budget and over inflated visuals to get its point across, instead relying on an incredible performance by both leading men in the movie, and a script so well written that the twist alone elevates the movie from one I would have rated four stars, to five.I watched for free. I'm going to buy it now. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"David Hyde Pierce delivers a great performance in \\"The Perfect Host\\".

Another superb Indie flick that twists and turns and takes you on a ride.Clayne Crawford, on the run for bank robbery, knocks on a suburban L.A. door and talks his way in. The owner, DHP, invites him to stay for dinner. Crawford soon tries to take control and terrorize DHP but, DHP turns the table and takes Crawford on the terror ride of his life.Who remembers Helen Reddy ? Well she's the nosy neighbor who plays her part so well and tries to get involved.I'm a big fan of Indie flicks as they rely more on the story and the characters as opposed to effects, egos and bank roll. This one delivers. The acting is top notch and DHP delivers a crazed character with a Niles Crane overtone and a Jeffrey Dhammer undertone that has you smiling at his antics when you know you shouldn't be.Great movie which I recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Suspension of Disbelief","review":"I find it hard to classify this movie, and perhaps this is what has brought mixed reviews to it. Warwick Wilson seems to have come out of a Patricia Highsmith book, although with a funny twist.If you are looking for a comedy, parts of this film are funny, but this isn't really comedy. The same applies if you're looking for a thriller. Whatever it is, I think that David Hyde Pierce's representation of a character who is a role model in the public eye, but a complete psycho behind closed doors (a funny one, though), is the highlight of this film.If you're looking for a movie where all of it has to match, work according to reality and be feasible, watch another film. This film is a little like \\"Burn After Reading\\", where you need to turn off your disbelief in order to just enjoy this character that shows a new twist every half an hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Psychosocial Thrill Ride","review":"this movie was awesome.

It had many \\"unexpected twists\\" that were very typical of this type of movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Twists, Not Enough Straightaways","review":"David Hyde Pierce stars in this odd, twist-heavy home invasion thriller, in which he suddenly turns the tables on both a desperate assailant and the unsuspecting audience. It's a cinematic contortionist, so desperate to shock and surprise that it gives every single cast member a chance to swivel one hundred-eighty degrees. Unsurprisingly, that trick quickly gets old and we're left to make bold predictions on a shallow, random plot while the puppets perform their jangly, awkward little dance. Pierce is loads of fun as the ludicrously demented straight-lacer with a secret, but the film isn't particularly well-acted and the greater story arc makes almost no sense. It looks terrific for a low-budget production, but desperately needed a few more rounds of screenplay revisions and the caring touch of a proficient editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT PREMISE DERAILS","review":"David Hyde Pierce is Warwick Wilson, the consummate host. We see him carefully prepare for a dinner party - he impeccably sets the table and times the duck for exactly 8:30 p.m. And then career criminal John Taylor (Clayne Crawford) enters the scene posing as a friend of a friend. He tells a sad story of being mugged and losing his luggage. But as the evening progresses and the alcohol flows, a very different dynamic is revealed. This twisted psychological thriller reminds that appearances can be most deceiving. Although the critics did not embrace this film, I kind of enjoyed the LA based story, especially the apparent premise and first half. Before the story derailed, it captured a lot of what the City of Angels is all about in terms of how far we will go to satisfy our fantasies. As the poster says, \\"Dinner parties are a dying art.\\" Nick Tomay is co-writer and director."},{"rating":"1","title":"DHP's only dud","review":"I've been an avid fan of David Hyde Pierce since I first saw him on the TV show, \\"Fraiser\\" He doesn't have to work at being funny, just a slight change of his expression can make me laugh, he was the star of that sit-com.Then I went to Broadway to see him in the most fantastic Kander & Ebb musical, \\"Curtains\\". He was phenomenal in that show. I wound up seeing it a total of 17 times, the number would be greater if the show had not closed.That's why I pre-ordered this movie. There is nothing wrong with DHP's acting, he is always great, but the script, or the director, or some thing was terribly wrong. If you like strange, weird movies, you might enjoy it, but if you are looking for comedy, watch some \\"Frasier\\" re-runs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very 90s-type independent movie with little value","review":"First off, it was in the comedy section of Amazon streaming. It's definitely NOT a comedy.Second, it's very dark and twisted, edited very slowly, and has little redeeming value.The only good thing about it is that David Hyde Pierce played a screwed up character very well. But it's directed and edited so badly that doesn't redeem the film at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repulsive","review":"If you can believe David Hyde Pierce as an LA police Lt.(think prissy, pompous Niles Crane on steroids) this movie may appeal to you.

I liked it so much I may buy another and give it another chance, but not cool to have to replace it so quickly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Dryer - Flimsy Brush","review":"I don't usually leave reviews but, since I'm going to return this product to Amazon, I thought I take the time to comment on why. The dryer is fine; it doesn't overheat and yet it still drys quickly. The major problem with this dryer, though, is the brush attachment. No matter how many times I've tried to snap the brush in place, it continues to come off while I'm drying my hair. There's not much point in an attachment dryer without attachments!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another one bites the dust","review":"Bought this to replace another Conair that burned out. This one lasted several months before it began shooting sparks out of the base and caught fire. It had been handled gently, banged on nothing, and except for the flames shooting out looked brand new. Very dangerous product that doesn't deserve its Underwriters Laboratories seal."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous hair dryer","review":"I am amazed how hard it is to find this hair dryer in stores. With the popularity of straight hair, it is so easy with the brush attachment! I love it so much - I bought tHree!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good dryer, bad brush","review":"I have used these brush attachment hair dryers since the 3rd grade... which was a while ago. This dryer is one of the better dryers I have used with a big BUT. The dryer works great and doesn't short out / over heat like many of the other brands do. HOWEVER, the brush fell off the first time I used it and will not stick back in the grooves. I have it attached by hair bands and it less than ideal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dryer - shame about the combs","review":"Between us, my daughter and I have owned 3 or 4 of these. They are fast, light-weight and not too noisy (considering how powerful they are) but the big drawback is that the combs don't last long; once the first tooth falls out, others follow rapidly. Replacement combs are not available through the Conair site. My daughter, who has very thick, curly hair, has burned out at least one of these dryers but I have never had that problem, and my hair is medium-thick and wavy. It really bugs me that I will have to buy a new hairdryer just to get the combs. Oh, and in my opinion the brush is so soft, it's totally useless. If it weren't for the comb and brush problem, I'd give this 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dependable Hairdryer","review":"I've owned this hairdryer for as long as I can remember and continue to buy it when my old one breaks or starts to overheat.

I have to tape it together to keep the brush attachment from falling off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best dryer on the planet","review":"If you smooth out your hair, you must have this dryer-period. It even eliminates the need for a flat iron! I've been using this dryer for 15yrs! It went from black to silver ionic & now there's a black ceramic one out. It also doubled in price this yr & is now at $49.99 in stores. I have long, frizzy, wavy, colicky awful hair that has to be smoothed out 1x/wk. This dryer allows me to blowout my own hair beautifully with awesome shiny flips in 15 min just by taking wet sections & brushing them till dry. Without this dryer, I'm completely screwed...I keep 3 brand new back-ups on hand at all times. It's not abnormally loud or heavy, and SO much easier than using a round brush & regular dryer. Do yourself a favor, try this dryer. You'll be amazed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dries, but doesn't style...","review":"I was under the impression that I could get style and volume from this device, but it didn't do too much of anything for my hair. I have relatively straight and fine hair, so it dried my hair with no problems, but it didn't look like I had styled my hair at all. I ended up with a weird in between straight and blow out look. If you've got wavy or textured hair, this could help dry and straighten it before you then style it, but for me it just did the same thing my blow dryer does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I am so disappointed with this hairdryer. I have been using this hairdryer for 15 years and have never had a problem with it. This one however would not attach the brush part to it. Every time I would put it thru my hair the brush would fall off on the floor. I threw the box away before using it because I didn't think there would be an issue since I have used this dryer so many times."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP - OFF!","review":"Useless! Poor engineering. Thoughtless. A complete waste. Attachments fall off as they expand from heat during use. Didn't anyone test this product before it went on the market?A complete outrage + I certainly would never consider another Conair product in my lifetime. DO NOT BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless.","review":"When purchasing your item I was not made aware that it was not under the Australian standards I do not have an American power point in my home no one does here in Austraia, so this product is useless to me and I have no return address to send it back to.

Brush attachment falls off!","review":"I had a wonderful previous model for many years that died so I figured I'd go with Conair again. I have shoulder length hair that's wavy and use the brush attachment to straighten my hair. Within a few seconds the brush attachment falls off! I tried taping it on with packing tape and the heat melted that. I have to keep attaching the brush and put it on LOW setting and go very carefully...even then, the brush falls off. It takes me forever to dry my hair now. I see they make another model (ceramic, more expensive) but someone reviewed it and said the brush doesn't fall off. I would say try that one. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this one unless you plan to use it with no attachments (in which case a regular blower would do). I am really surprised that a company like Conair would put this on the market with this obvious flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"dries my long hair quickly","review":"I like it because it dries my hair quickly and has the brush attachment for the ability to style while drying"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great dryer, but...","review":"This dryer works really well, but the attachments won't stay on.

I won't be a repeat buyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Conair SD6X Ionic Styler","review":"This Conair SD6X, 1875-Watt, 3-in-1 Ionic styler with 3 attachments works really good. This product didn't make my hair static like other regular hair blow dryer. It also style my hair the way I wanted and make my hair more softer than other ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I have long (past shoulder-length) hair which is frizzy and wavy. Typically, it takes me at least 30 minutes to straighten it. (with an expensive straightener nonetheless!) This hair dryer dried my hair completely in FIVE minutes flat. It was straight, soft, and shiny. I slept on it, woke up, straightened it for TWO minutes then was ready to go with perfectly straight hair.True, it was a bit loud, but if it can make my hair straight in less than five minutes.. I really don't care.Best hair purchase yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Hoped For","review":"I am have researching hair dryer stylers. I purchased this item from Sears and thought it would work. I used the brush attachment which kept falling off. I thought it was defective but I saw no chips in the frame of the attachment. It did not dry well and even after styling it was still frizzy. I used Herbal Essense anti-frizz leave in cream no mousse though. I guess it depends what type of hair you have (ie. thick hair vs. thin hair). I would recommend you buy this styler from a walk-in store so if it doesn't work for you you can return it without having to pay return shipping. I also noticed this styler is available at CVS, Walgreens and Harmons. I have tried other stylers and still have not found the right one for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for thin straight hair","review":"I have thin straight hair and when I get my hair cut and styled by someone else it looks great, but I have the hardest time styling it myself. I have tried the round brushes and standard hairdryer but I just can't get the hang of it. This hairdryer helps out. My hair never looked so thick (with hair products of course)! The dryer is easy to use and the comb options are nice. If you have problems with the round brushes I would recommend you to try this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just O.K if it works","review":"I was glad when I got this hair dryer. It was not great but i thought it did the job just about O.K. The dryer is very loud and it is not easy to handle. But the bigger problem with it was that it stopped working in three days. What more can I say then if it works then good for you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It!!!","review":"This hairdryer stinks! If you try to use the brush with it the brush finds a way to work its way off the base. Very frustrating! I have long, thick hair and I need the brush to get that smooth finish that I like. Since the brush is always flopping off, all I get is aggravation. Look for another hairdryer, this one will make you furious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great styler but accessories awful","review":"I love connair hair dryers and Stylers and have Been using them since i Was a kid.

He tends to dawdle a bit when exploring the sexual side of his heroes (darn near stops the book, in fact). He explains in excruciating detail what he is doing with his girl in bed (an embarassing look at his ideas about women and what he THINKS they want) while glossing over important plot details that would explain his protaginist's motivation and goals. If you enjoy the types of books that Bill Branon is trying to write, a better choice would be any of the books in the 'Bob the Nailer' series by Stephen Hunter. I will probably buy his next book, but if it has the same 'narrative stoppage' with his sex scenes that this book does, I will not buy any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Branen is like no other.

Clearly at least 10 year old titles which are not compatible with current XP system. Surprised that this is even put into the market for sale. Simple advice, do not even think about buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an over rated piece of software","review":"This is one of the worst pieces of software I have purchased so far for my preschoolers. The Sesame Street CD has 20 pages! of credits that you MUST watch just to exit the program. Believe me, I tried every exit button I could think of to bypass them. What is with that? Just exit the program already. It is worse than a video, at least you can turn that off. The Dr Seuss CD has only 1 'game' and it is just the Dr Seuss Alphabet book on the computer screen. Nothing new there for my kids and I would never call it a game. Granted, I have only gone through these two so far, but if they are any indication, I will be taking this sucker back tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!!!","review":"In Sesame Street Toddler, the sound will not function after the opening credits. The packaging states that it is compatible with Win2000 SP4, yet the FAQ on the distributor site says that this is a known problem with Win2000 SP4. Without sound the software is useless.I haven't tried the other software in this package, perhaps one of the others will make it worth the price. Certainly this CD title is a coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me up!","review":"As a daily rider of the New York subway system, I find it dynamic and exciting piece of living history. This book, however, was not. It is a plodding academic treatment that focuses more on politics than the actual system. The pictures were too few. The maps were poorly realized and uninformative. As the system is still in place largely as it was decades ago, I would have liked references to the current line and station names instead of trying to guess or sit there with my own maps (something you can't do if reading while riding the subway). The subway system represents both a technological marvel and an instrument of great social change. Where is that book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not A Tourist Guide?","review":"In response to other reviewers: this book is not MEANT to be a tourist guide, it IS, however, an academic study, and a very good one indeed.

I know, the quest never ends!The scope at the highest magnification x9 is just right for 100 yards at the rifle range but it would be a challenge for shooting at target further than that and knowing your not hoping and praying you'll hit the 12\\" bulls eye target.To compensate though is the BDC reticle which I have not yet had a chance to prove at a farther distance tha 100 yards.Since the target object would really be visually small looking through the scope at the max 600 yards it would really be interesting at that distance if you can really hit the target!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikon Buckmaster 3-9x40 Riflescope (Matte, BDC)","review":"My oldest grandson bought this for his dad one year for Christmas.

I knew Rania is a famous dancer, but until this video I did not realise her fitness instructor abilities apart from dancing. After I bought it and brought it home and read the box copy, I started to wonder if there was any dancing, but the title should have made it clear.

If you're looking for an instructional video, you will be dissapointed. In fact, there really isn't much bellydance at all except in the waist shaping segment. However, if you want a good strength and flexibility routine for fitness and dance conditioning, this might be just the ticket.I like to do the entire 50 minutes as a single workout and I feel that it addresses all the major areas that a dancer needs to work on. I love the way this video makes me feel and I look forward to seeing what continued use will do for my dance. I also apreciate the clear, steady camera work and the lack of \\"special effects\\" camera work that spoils so many bellydance videos. The moves were clear and the naration was encouraging without going overboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I enjoyed this book, because Colleen was a likeable character.

Thau has a vintage Ph.D. in French Literature and is careful and thorough w/o being pendantic--more auntly than professorial.

Lacking in subtlety, driven by formula, generally generic - that's the plan for so many albums and artists who make up the CCM scene. And this album fits that scene perfectly. Yes, their vocals are powerful; yes, their harmonies are tight; yes, their tunes are catchy. But there's nothing original here, nothing unexpected, and to that end, nothing truly human. The album has a great veneer, but it lacks any soul.

This book was all about the magic of story, and how to help your reader enter the wondrous world of imagination. Your book is transforming my inner and outer world as Collier's did.

It is nice that even wizards can listen to an outcry begging for substance. Round two seems to answer that call with some good tidbits. The problem remains, as with the first, the author. \\"The Wizard\\" remains a self proclaimed messiah that hopes to enlighten us. Maybee book three will include relying less on ego and more on real world solutions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of fluff, little info","review":"I found this book lacking. On almost every page I found myself wondering, \\"Where's the great info I was expecting?\\" It seems I read an outline of what, when finished, would be a good book.The packaging of the book was eye catching ... the information, unfortunately, was woefully incomplete. I have read that others found this book \\"inspiring.\\" This leads me to wonder how dull their ad skills were to begin with.Great package ... little substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh!

It leaves out many important steps in woodworking. This tape should be a freebe for people who buy a Shop Smith. It seems geared more toward demonstrating the Shop Smith than a teaching tool.

Running Windows XP, I could not get the software to work properly. After several hours on the phone with Kodak tech support, they couldn't get it working either.They said they are aware of the problem on some computers running Windows XP. It is now several months later and they still don't have a fix. They don't really seem to care either.It might not be a bad idea to consider other brands, instead of Kodak. Since, if the software won't work properly, then what good is the camera?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Camera - software?","review":"Just had it a few days, great camera ... many useful features.High quality photos, can shoot in many kinds of lighting. Easy to use. The software is easy and does everything for you, but has no easy way to opt out of its default file locations. The photo editting software is pretty basic. Other software such as GIMP for windows is available free that will do much more comprehensive editting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golf ball reteiver","review":"I have used this for a couple of months.

You can slip under your shirt as well for those times you want extra security.I was able to pre-pack this and know I had all my needed documentation and payments ready.

Again, this is my honest experience, I end up throwing it away for the safety of my skin being protected from usuage of a spoil lotion...

Instead of snowing your prospects with every conceivable feature of your product or service, you can follow the format given in the book to produce a short, one-page presentation that adequately covers the major aspects of whatever you're selling plus how the product or service will provide benefits to effectively address the prospect's needs.
