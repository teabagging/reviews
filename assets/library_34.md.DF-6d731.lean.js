I always heard people say things about exercise tapes about how they look forward to working out and i always thought i did too whenever i went walking, but i think i do even more so now. All the different moves keep your mind interested rather than just zoning out like with walking. It doesn't involve as much dancing as i figured it would from the infomercials but i still like it. Someone said they thought the music was great on this tape but i only like the cool-down music in them. But everyone is upbeat and slap-stick happy so they keep you motivated!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting","review":"This video is so exciting. I just got it in the mail and can't wait to begin the workout. I have watched the video all the way through a few times just to prepare myself for the moves. A must have, better than other boring workout DVD's I have purchased in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT WORKOUT DVD YET!","review":"I love this dvd!! I just got it in today and i already worked out to another one but i decided to put this one in just to see what it was about. As soon as i put it on i was already working out for the 2nd time this morning and i didn't stop til the end! Its a great video and it really makes you sweat! I would certainly tell others(already started lol) about turbo jam! Certainly worth the money i paid for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible workout","review":"This workout it's amazing. I got the dvds about 3 weeks ago and I started with \\"learn & burn\\", I found it easy to follow and Chalene is really great about pushing u through. I started one week ago the 20 mins workout and I love it love it ... I already see improvements in my figure and it doesn't get me bored, major thing for me that I already tried a lot of home workouts such as slim in 6 and some dvds by Denise Austin. That's the best ever... the music is good to make u in the mood and it's just fun do it. I'm so happy that I bought it and for sure I'm gonna buy some more turbo jam dvds. I can't wait to meet the goals I set. I think it'll be so easy 'coz I'm really enjoying it. I'm hooked I love turbo jam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous and SO much Fun!","review":"I ordered TJ after seeing an infomercial and reading a lot of message boards. I was not disappointed at all! I was so excited after doing the Learn and Burn that I couldn't wait to do some of the others. The sequence of moves does take some getting used to, especially in Cardio Party, but it's hard to get frustrated since the music is so upbeat and they go through them several times. I've only made it through Turbo Scuplt a handful of times but it is a full body workout like you wouldn't believe. I would recommend this as a good cardio workout, especially during the winter months when it's harder to get outside. Once you start the workout you will want to see it through. I started seeing results in the first week and I just felt better overall. Every workout isn't for everyone but this was certainly a good one for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot.","review":"I had a hard time keeping up with the video. Didn't really like the way things were flowing. Some of the move hurt my back. I gave the take away after trying it three times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good workout if you can put up with the OBNOXIOUSNESS","review":"I like this workout a lot, but you have to put up with a lot. The music is horrible. The back-up dancers are so obnoxious. They all make googly-eyed faces at the camera and do their own version of the workout (making it distracting) - Mindy, old lady, and chubby girl (three of the dancers) - I'm looking at you! Also, I'm not really interested in close-ups of Chalene's boobs the whole time (yikes!). Lastly, I have done Brazil Butt Lift (I LOVE) and P90x and have to say thta Chalene's que-ing is AWFUL."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO REPETITIVE!!","review":"Do not waste your money buying more than one of these \\"Cardio Party\\" DVDs. They are basically the same workout just rearranged a little bit. The warm ups are the exact same on all of them. And I don't know about anyone else, but I can't do airbags and uppercuts for 8 minutes without wanting to fall asleep!! I get bored with these DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too confusing for me...","review":"I normally like workouts that make me sweat and make me feel as if I've had a \\"workout.\\" This video just wasn't for me. I much prefer Jillian Michael's workouts because of how I feel the day AFTER. During this workout I was easily confused and a step behind (admittedly, that's my own coordination issue), and while I got a good sweat, I just didn't feel like my fitness level was increasing. If you love coordinated move videos and cheerful instruction, try Turbo Jam. If you are more into the straightforward step by step video, try something else. This just wasn't the workout for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turbo Jam","review":"I bought this as a replacement set for my wife. Our daughter broke the last one and my wife just HAD to have a new copy!My wife LOVES Turbo Jam and has a daily routine--she recommends it to all her friends.

Time flies by and the workout is over before you know it. Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"I really like this DVD alot! The workouts are all choreographed and have moves to them that are really fun. They are easy to learn. This is not for someone that likes dance routines and moving around alot and punching and kicking. This DVD requires a lot of movement! My favorite part of this DVD is the AB Jam. This is a 20 minute AB workout that is totally awesome! It starts with ten minutes of standing AB workouts then ten minutes of sitting or laying down AB workouts. While I was doing this I didnt notice too much of a burn. It was the next day that my abs were really sore. I though it was so cool how easy it was at the time to do the workout but the results come out amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Turbo Jam: 5 Rockin Workouts","review":"OMG!!! I absolutely love this item :-) Its seriously amazing!!!! I am in love with Turbo Jam! I get such a great workout with the 2 DVD's.

At $10 on Amazon, I thought I'd give it a try. Never regretted it! I do one workout a day and, while keeping the same diet, lost 15 pounds in 3 months. Would recommend it to anybody who's trying to get fit and/or lose weight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"these really work!","review":"I did these workouts for almost two years, and I have to say that they really do work. The only complaint I have is that my lower back pain increased while doing these exercises, but that may be just me.The dvds are fun to do, albeit a bit cheesy. If you can get past that, Chalene is actually a really good teacher and the moves are fairly simple to do. It's the repetition that gets you. There is a 3-4 minute warm up and then you go through several (i think it's 5) seperate cardio segments- all about 7 minutes each. Within the workout there is a TURBO section- about 1:30, where you step up the cardio. There is also a timeline timer on the bottom of the screen, so you always know how far you've come and how much further you have to go.You will feel sore the next day- at least I did. Once these become routine, she also has another group of \\"advanced\\" videos - which are not anything new, just longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Fuss","review":"Product is just as described. Shipping was quick. No fuss transaction. I reviewed all the workouts and did some of them. Yes, this is going to be a good workout regiment for me. I was already sweating just sampling some of the routines. I will alternate this with some high demand lower body work. It'll break up the monotony. Thanks a bunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"I have not got to disc two. I am just taking it slow. Anyone that want a good 20 min. workout this is the video for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not completely Happy","review":"I bought Turbo Jam to workout at home when I can not make it to the gym.

I went back to working out with my Biggest Loser Cardio Max DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have difficulties in reading DVDs, though I have repeatedly cleaned them they are ejected 9 times out of ten, and the workout is damaged in various points. Disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best workout I've ever had!","review":"This workout is the best workout I've had in years!

And I don't regret any penny of this! Chalene Johnson and crew make these workouts a lot of fun. I turn to this DVD a lot still, especially if I don't have a lot of time to workout. Some days I just want to do abs, and a quick cardio, or want to do some sculpting with light weights. It's all here in this one DVD. Even the 15 minute intro workout is nice to add to one of the others. I'm totally hooked on Turbo Jam! I recommend it to anyone who really wants to see results!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am sold!","review":"This workout is fabulous. I have been doing workout videos at home for years and this one really is the most fun cardio I have ever done. After I do one workout, I want to do another (and have done so).

I enjoy Chalene's instruction and I look forward to buying more of her workouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turbo Jam Workout DVD","review":"I ordered this workout DVD because I enjoy all Beachbody products/workout DVD's. I chose to order a new DVD rather than a used one. The workout included 2 DVD's. However, both DVD's did not play well. It started skipping about 10 minutes into the workout. I could not finish. I am very disappointed in this purchase. I plan on returning it to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad DVD, Skips, stops and bluury sequences, Super bad quality.","review":"Bad quality DVD.Couldn't use it because it kept on stopping in middle of program.

Even cover was in brighter colors.This has been copied and I should get my money back but I can't be bothered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turbo Pajama Party","review":"This has to be the worst workout video ever. I can't believe everybody loves it because you could make up your own Turbo Jam by dancing around the house in your PJs to your favorite music.Compared to other workouts, I personally feel that it has little fitness merit. \\"Getting my groove on\\" is not what I want to do in a workout. The instructor is obnoxious, and the whole thing is just goofy. Save your money and try Cathe Freidrich videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely awful","review":"What a waste of money and precious workout time! I can't believe anyone would like this! I wouldn't even call it a workout; it's a bunch of people (kind of a weird mix of ages, races and bodytypes) pretending to \\"get down\\" and get a workout at the same time.If you're completely overweight and have never exercised before, you might like this. If you are a serious exerciser you will feel stupid doing this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bying Turbo Jam","review":"I love it ....i love it..... :-) This is a greet workout .... An i live in Denmark but i can still use it :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Work out","review":"I was looking forward to this \\"turbo\\" workout...however, the second CD was distorted and very low audio. She really didn't move me with the workout but was very upbeat. I didn't return it because I don't work out to the same thing all the time so by the time I decided to check out the second CD, it was too late to send it back. So I had to keep it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll stick with tae bo","review":"I don't know why these beachbody workouts get such good reviews. I would be really mad if I had paid full price for this. I bought mine used. This is some kind of spazzed out rip-off of tae bo without the talent, proper form, or professional quality. She keeps talking about how great the music is, but you can't hear it and she never shuts up anyway.I wear a heart rate monitor and I burn more calories with less annoyance with a Leslie Sansone 2 mile walk! I'll stick with Tae Bo for this type of workout. Like the other beachbody workouts you are paying way too much for a lot of filler and very little substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow","review":"I was into this dvd less than five minutes and had to turn it off. What a waste of money for me personally. I had a difficult time with the routines in general because she was going to fast, but also because if you aren't familiar with the moves and proper form how are you supposed to go from one move to the next? I also thought it was really cheesy and didn't feel like it was a serious video for me. I guess looking at the commercials on it, it looks fun, but there really is no instruction and you have to take time to get the moves down to really do the workout with everyone on the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"it is awesome...","review":"I have never had any formal exercise regimen before (nor done any reviews)but feel compelled to write this review. have had it for a week, i do feel the sculpting going on...as chalene says..it is what you put into it that makes the difference...so if you put more effort, you will definitely see the results"},{"rating":"2","title":"very challenging","review":"this is a very challenging workout once you get the hang of it...I love the 20 minute sculpt for my morning workout...if you can keep up, you will break a sweat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Turbojam DVD Review","review":"The product was exactly what I was expecting, a very good price for what it contains, and came in a timely manner.

I'm sure it does burn calories and fat, because the dance exercises just keep on going. I enjoyed it...just too much going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good workout","review":"You really feel the burn after the Dance party workout. My only complaint is that they advertise 5 'rockin' workout but in reality the Dance Party is the only effective one. The 20 minute workout is also good but for a quick sweat. The other two are really toning workouts. I like the bonus abdominal though, you see results by the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this dvd!","review":"i have been trying to lose weight for a very long time! I have gone through so many different workouts and this is the only one that keeps me going!

Her workouts work. This was my first attempt at kickboxing & I fell in love. I am glad I tried Turbo Jam first because it made working out to be such a fun & enjoyable part of my day. Never thought exercise could be this fun. I had to give this set to friend and she also loves it. This is probably among the most enjoyable workouts in the whole world, you get results if you put enough effort. There is no magic here."},{"rating":"2","title":"really enjoyable work out","review":"I've been looking for an enjoyable cardio workout for some time now and really think this is it. I first tried to do Tae Bo, but found that about half way through the workout, Billy Blanks would put together some routine that left me saying 'How in the %^7**^$ does he expect me to do that?!' and/or something requiring balance that I just don't have so I stopped doing that.Honestly, I was a victim of the Turbo Jam infomercial which happens to be on in the morning when I first turn my TV on - so I thought I'd try it. It reminds me a lot of Tae Bo, except without the impossible routines/balance of an acrobat moves. I've been working out in some way for about 15 years and the 45-50 minute workouts have me soaked in sweat by the time I get done - it is great!I haven't lost any weight yet, but I can't really follow the meal plan because I'm vegan and the meal plan isn't. However, I believe the claims that it burns LOTS of calories and I expect the weight loss to start soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout Video","review":"I love this workout series... to date I have lost 45pounds and 6 dress sizes... and picked up some great dance moves along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Didn't believe it could work this well, this fast","review":"I've watched the infomercials several times, but still never made the commitment. I have a gym membership but with my work schedule, I needed something to help me be more consistent and help me BURN calories. I love cardiokickboxing, I love to dance, I love music. This tape has it all and BONUS, it has sculpting/weight lifting. I HATE lifting weights because for me it was boring. I did the Learn and Burn then explored the other workouts on the DVD. A few minutes into the Sculpt portion, I picked up my hand weights and joined in. I was lifting weight, but I was still sweating majorly! She has good instruction throughout and is very encouraging. I felt good! I felt energized! Even with limited sleep and after a long work day. Then, I checked myself out in the mirror and I can already see my abs starting to get more definition!! My worst area and I've NEVER had any definition. I can't wait to see how I change after weeks of working out and sculpting."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Beachbody products","review":"It's completely worth every cent.

I barely worked up a sweat. I don't really understand how it would burn calories. I switched to Jilliam Michael's \\"Burn Fat, Boost Metabolism,\\" and I like it much better. I work up a sweat and really exercise. I suppose that's because it has simple moves, like jumping jacks. I have absolutely no talent when it comes to dance moves. As others have mentioned, I think her cuing in Turbo Jam is not very good. I never knew when she was going to do the next move."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy & quick to do","review":"This vidoe was easy to order, pretty quick to recieve & much cheaper than other places.

My girlfriend and I completed the Cardio Party on Sat. and I was still sore on Wednesday. You workout your ab and back muscles throughout the entire segment. You can feel how much of a workout you've completed. I highly recommend this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love hands be gone!","review":"I love turbo jam! In the first week my love handles were pretty much gone! I mean there is still a little, but certainly do not have a muffin top!:) I feel so energized after every work out. I feel so much happier too, not just because my body is looking more of how I want it to, but because I feel like I can do anything! Thank you Chalene! I tell everyone about Turbo Jam! Some people think her videos go too fast but just do it more than once and you'll catch on. Also, if you listen to the music she uses it to lead into a lot of things and that always helps me. Get up and try it! You'll be happy you did!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"I'm completely hooked on TurboJam. My sister recommended this program when I complained about being bored with other workout videos. I wanted something that was fun and provided a good workout. This DVD is awesome.

I think I might try that next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"My friend had this Turbo Jam dvd set & I was always borrowing it from her. So, I decided to finally get my own. I went to the Turbo Jam website & found that it was going to be around $70 and that's just crazy. Of course, my next step was turning to Amazon and $25 was a way better price. It shipped out to me quickly and was able to start working out! The Cardio Party is my favorite; combination of kickboxing and dance. Plus, the instructor is pretty motivating.

I like it. she's fun. and it really makes you SWEAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great workout!","review":"This workout is another great one for those who need to gradually get in shape. It is built off of 11 moves and you are able to progress into togher workouts, instead of just being thrown into something you can't do. She is a great leader and these DVD's have the potential to help you lose weight! The only cons I have are 1) the music isn't as great as they build it up to be 2) somtimes you can get lost in the routine and moves. Of course, number 2 can be solved over time as you get used to the workouts. The greatest thing...the timer at the bottom of the workout. It lets you know how long you have left in the current segment of moves, as well as in the entire workout! Definitely a good workout to add to a healthy eating routine if you're trying to lose weight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ploopers","review":"I own over 60 workout dvds.

Oh, and for the above comment Turbo Jam does have an Advance workout, just check out the website!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want results choose this workout","review":"This video produces a flatter stomach after a couple of workouts. It is much more effective than all of the sit-ups and Pilates that I have done. Both the 20 and 45 minute workout is so quick and fun that it goes by without a struggle. These workouts can be done low impact and at the same time you can gradually increase to make them as high impact as possible. One of the best features is the time scale that shows you how much time is left and how much time you have on this particular segment. It helps to keep me motivated to finish. I have purchased at least 30 workout videos over the years, plus had various gym memberships and this workout is absolutely has produced the most results in the least time. I have already lost 10 inches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have taken the classes at the gym","review":"I haven't bought this product yet, but I spent over a year taking Turbo Kick Box classes at my gym. For me, it's the perfect workout. I cannot workout on my own on machines, I just don't feel like I'm hitting all the zones, but in the TKB class, I definitely feel the difference between cardio, strength, endurance, etc. After taking my mother to a class, I can see how some find the workout daunting due to the choreography, but if you have any semblance of being able to mimic motions, you should be able to catch on after a few tries. I now live in a new area and it seems like none of the gyms teach turbo kick, so now I am left with the decision to buy or not to buy...but after the weight loss success I had with this class at the gym, it's worth a 35-dollar shot"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed!","review":"I got this DVD because of the high rated on the reviews, but I found it silly and boring, and I wonder if you really work out your abdominals.

The moves are confusing, repetitive, and lack impact. Unless you enjoy bobbing around and shadow boxing for 30 mintues, I would only recommend this workout to people who like to dance and have only started their fitness journey. Then again some of the moves actually look dangerous for the joints. Glad i didnt spend money on this. If you are in decent cardio shape, use insanity instead. I dropped 12 pounds in 2 months using insanity. I am disappointed in this workout. I was really excited that a woman was coaching a HIIT workout, but this has nothing on insanity.

In the Cardio Party, the music is great, but some of the moves are hard to catch on to. However, if you do it more, you'll get accustomed to it better.Chalene looks a lot younger here than she does in Turbo Fire! I could relate the Cardio Party to Turbo Fire, because of the Turbo Mode about halfway through.

The book has three critical flaws: it's 100 pages too long, it's dated (especially the material on computers and sexual harassment), and the author has the annoying belief that social science dissertations are the only \\"full\\" dissertations. By suggesting that his own field of Sociology is the most difficult field of study, the author alienates many potential readers and loses any claim of impartial observation. All of the useful gems of advice are covered in a shorter and more optimistic book written by Evelyn Hunt Ogden on the same subject. Read that one instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"crucial for anyone a year away from and into their phd work","review":"I am one year away from beginning my doctorate studies and I needed a general, non-field specific, and intrapesctive look at how to maintain and complete a doctoral dissertation.

He also talks about how he hand tabulated the data. I wonder if his time estimates are accurate given Word, SPSS, Excel and the Web.

Amateur boxing is the film's selling point but Huston is more concerned with the inner-workings of these characters. Boxing is just the means to which these down-and-outers achieve some kind of glory in an existence that offers mostly rotten fruit. An excellent cast is assembled here with Stacy Keach as a hard-luck fighter who recently is more comfortable on a bar stool than in the ring, Jeff Bridges as an up-and-coming young fighter with impending fatherhood, Susan Tyrrell as Keach's drinking buddy girlfriend, and Nicholas Colasanto as a colorful boxing promoter. Gorgeous cinematography delivered by Conrad Hall."},{"rating":"2","title":"The seedy side of the ring game","review":"Directed by John Huston, this movie is about an over-the-hill boxer (Stacy Keach) and a young protege (Jeff Bridges) who hasn't the talent to make it anywhere near the top, but he doesn't know it yet. Keach captures well (without overdoing it) the man who is on the way down and falling fast but can still hang on to a few dreams. The difference between Keach and Bridges is that Keach learns (finally) that they are just dreams while Bridges remains disillusioned (mainly by his youth and lousy manager [Nicholas Colasanto]) and thinks that the dreams may come true. They never will. The boxing scenes are well photographed. At times the acting is stiff and forced, but the sad and poignant ending is the perfect closer for this fine movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"...as if a curtain had been ripped aside and there was the diamond business, spattered with blood, sorting through the goods.\\"","review":"p.187This book made me glad that my wife and I twenty years ago decided to get neither the traditional diamond engagment nor wedding rings.

I expected a history of power, influence, and science relating to diamonds, or perhaps an expose on a ruthless and unethical industry.

But behind those symols lies a world of deceit, monopoly, and war...\\" But the book handles the substantive topics with kid gloves.

I haven't heard of either group yet. By 1968 I wsa used to hearing Johnny Mathis,Dean Martin and always knew that soemthing would come along and really rock. THe Archies had done just that. For me,this Lp to cd is no exception. It is a feel good cd.It wasn't out to set the world on fire,but eventually did so with \\"SUGAR SUGAR\\". From beginning to end of this cd,its pure innocent fun.

The quality of these books is in line with the Left behind and Christ Clone Trilogy series. The one draw back is that according to Thomas Nelson Publishing, Author Gilbert Morris has held up the release of the third book until he decides if he is going to extend the series or begin a new project. I would recommend waiting until he makes a decision before reading these books so as not to be left waiting for the conclusion. Mr. Morris has shorted all of us who have purchased his books and been left waiting over a year for the conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most but not all","review":"There is no question that this series is far better than the Left Behind series.

It was pretty much your typical romance with typical plotline. I liked that the heroine was strong-willed and able-bodied without being overly so, and the hero even showed some weaknesses. The genre-standard conflict towards the end was mild enough that it didn't make me want to just smack either of the characters. They actually had pretty good communication, which I appreciated. The sex scene was hot without being ridiculously lusty. There was sufficient hardship and peril, but not so much that it wore me out reading it. The writing did a good job of taking you back in time to that hard place, complete with chaps, cowboy hats, and covered wagons. In all, a thoroughly enjoyable read.

One of the highlights of this fantastic cd is 'Beck's Bolero' which, btw, includes work from Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones and Jimmy Page.

The book unfortunately doesn't read like the philosophy text I hoped for, but rather reads as a guide to understanding and communicating our Catholic conception of death and the significance of it.I would recommend this book stangely to the people who mourn because, like Chesterton's writings, it gives many valuable insights into the great universal mystery which death is.

As a consequence, the reader gets a sense of the mileau of clubs, studios, band and record label politics, and Washington DC and Southern Maryland music and lifestyle from the 60's to the 90's. A great deal of attention is paid to Danny's interest in cars, and his family life, as well as his early days gigging in various teenage bands and with Liz Meyer & Friends before he became \\"unfamous\\".Also, the book comes with a bibliography and discography, as well as a useful index, showing the author's almost academic thoroughness."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about a great guitar player who left us too soon.

I'd describe this book as fancy magazine you'd look at the pictures and you'd read some interesting titles or few paragraghes- waiting in doctor's office and when your name is called you'd just put it down and forget about it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cosmology Lite","review":"Trying to simplify, in order to target a larger audience, Hawking left out all explanation, leaving bare statements without any support. If you haven't read other authors on these matters, you won't get anything out of the book other than pretty pictures that aren't very relevant.I recommend Brian Greene's \\"The Elegant Universe\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Think the Unthinkable With Hawking as Your Guide","review":"Let your thinking expand to the outer reaches of the Universe, and experience the unthinkable with today's greatest living genius, Stephen Hawking. His explanation of the inexplicable is brilliant yet easy to understand. You may even ask yourself \\"Why Didn't I Think of That?\\" As Hawking demonstrates in this wonderful book, and Einstein repeatedly observed, great complexities most often reduce to surprising simplicities, which only an active imagination reveals in the first instance. Hawking's book, like others such as \\"Why Didn't I Think of That? - Think the Unthinkable\\" show you that the unthinkable is indeed thinkable by the ordinary mind, and often what you consider unknowable is in fact within reach of your curious mind and its powerful imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illustrations are second to none","review":"Let's face it. You're not buying this book to teach yourself physics. Hawking knows this, and it the reason the book isn't full of equations. What sells this book is the incredible artwork. This is the kind of book you would put on your coffee table for visitors to see. The pictures alone are worth the cost of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bah!","review":"The only reason I gave this book two stars is that the illustrations in it are very nice to look at. Hawking is not very good at explaining all of the highly speculative theories he and those in his profession make their living off of. Indeed, the illustrations mentioned above actually do more to confuse than enlighten in many cases. His first big hit, ABHOT, was far more interesting, informative, and better written. It would seem that in \\"dumbing down\\" his material for this book, he simplified it to the point where crucial information was actually left out. Get ABHOT if you want a good read. Get this book if you want pretty pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daren M. Williams must be one of those \\"Book Burners\\"","review":"This book was entertaining however not entirely enlightening. There is no question in my mind that Stephen Hawking knows what he is talking about because he has the mathematical and physical intuition to understand the intricacies of cosmology to back up the bizzarre images he writes of in his book, however most people reading his book do not. This poses a problem because there is a vast gulf between the mathematical reality of the universe and human intuition and there is no way the material hawking is presenting can ever be totally understood without math. Sorry to have to say this, but Hawking's book only creates more confusion than there already is about the universe and people like mister williams (an earlier reviewer) are examples of what happens when you write about cosmology for the masses."},{"rating":"1","title":"(Some) good pictures... nothing more","review":"Look,I don't consider myself to be stupid, and I usually catch up pretty fast.However, it seems to me that when this dude writes a book, he writes it for others like him.Now, you do the math...

At least for me...the not so stupid guy.He is NOT getting into details like another reviewer wrote, he just throws in his explanation and moves on, without more proper examples.I was a very dissapointed, although I'm not gonna quit, and I'm gonna try again!-RoNNY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Dr. hawking provides readers with a stark and perplexive outlook on space and time.

He is truly a piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The hardcover is well worth the extra dough!","review":"I urge each and every one of you to spend the extra money on the hardcover version and not to waste your money on the paperback. Both contain hundreds of pictures, graphs, charts, doodles, etc. However, the pages in the HARDCOVER version are rendered in beautiful glossy color; while, the PAPERBACK version (including all illustrations) is plain BORING black and white. The difference is amazing. There is simply no comparison. You will NOT enjoy the paperback! The hardcover pages are of the highest quality paper - so splurge or you'll be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Making it nebulous","review":"In trying to put the universe in a nutshell, Prof. Hawking had left out most of the interesting details. Some of the conclusions would even be misleading without the necessary details. The diagrams too are truly artistic but lack information. In \\"Brief History\\" Hawking was bold enough to hint ever so subtly that God is the Architect of this universe. In Nutshell, Hawking manages to cleverly wheel around this critical matter. The Brief History may be long-winded but it has the facts! On the other hand Nutshell makes a good coffee table travel brochure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hawking At His Best","review":"Although The Universe in a Nutshell is not as good as Hawking's first popular book, a Brief History of Time, I'd give it two thumbs up. The book covers the major advances in cosmology since the publication of a Brief History of Time. The book covers relativity (not as in depth as a Brief History) and Quantum Mechanics (again not as in depth as it should be) to introduce and familiarize the reader with the two subjects. The book then gets out of the physics catagories and looks at the world in a futuristic way. In this classic, Hawking covers what the future may be like and the advance of technology with time. The book was not what I had expected but it is a classic none the less. Good for anyone curious about the science of physics."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Universe in a Nutshell","review":"His work is all bogus aimed at puzzling people with false pictorial work, wrong concepts.

Hawking's book is a major disappointment. That which is understandable (such as the Uncertainty Principle) is given no new treatment. The latter half of the book is completely incomprehensible. Hawking just throws out one assertion after another with nothing to link them logically or even to show how they relate to the physical world. The sections on time travel and p-branes are especially weak and not worth the time trying to read them. Kip Thorne has done a much more lucid treatment of time travel in his book, and Michio Kaku has done a better job explaining string theory.The strong aspect of _The Universe in a Nutshell_ is its illustrations; even if you didn't read any of the text, the illustrations are worth the purchase price."},{"rating":"2","title":"heroism in face of big questions","review":"Stephen Hawkings \\"The universe in a nutshell\\"is filled with good natured humour, deep insights,brilliant illustrations and a passion for the wondersof the universe.It is of course a popular book,but even if one should know most its subjectmatter in advance, it is never boring.The author says he \\"doesn't answer God questionsanymore\\". Still, he answers a lot of questions thatsounds a lot like ersatz theological questions.And no doubt Hawkings fame is the result of hiswillingness to tackle such hard problems head-on.

What he refers to is a completely different book. Universe in a Nutshell is a new work based on Hawking's new theories and the author and illustrators spent two years creating it. I know this because I was responsible for the artwork. It's a pity that so-called reveiwers are so ignorant and loud-mouthed without having the knowledge or intelligence needed to make comment."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Picture Equals One Thousand Words","review":"An aphorism which sums up Professor Hawking's effort on this book. Abstract concepts are hard enough to grasp with an adequate description, even harder when staring at the symbolic representation. The visual medium is the linchpin of those connections. Some of the inserted humor seemed awkward and forced. The real amusement was more subtle. The universe in a nutshell of \\"ten or eleven\\" dimensions.

Sadly, I was disappointed. The book is dumbed-down to the point of being almost incomprehensible and the pictures are largely useless (pretty, but useless). Hawking makes statements without providing explanations or, worse, he makes statements that literally make no sense. How can the outside of a sphere make contact with the outside of another sphere (branes in the book) except at one point? What does it mean to say time might be represented by lines of longitude? (The lines of latitude I understood, at least.) Why does the intersection of two time streams produce an area where time stands still?

It is as though Mr. Hawking's word processor had a \\"make it fit\\" key that did so by deleting every second paragraph and maybe a few random sentences to boot.The book is a beauty. Its illustrators should win a prize.

The text does not really explain anything, but merely references developments and theories which are pertinent to the subject. What the book lacks in Hawking's generally fascinating expositions, is somewhat compensated by the great graphic illustrations, making this book more of a coffee-table decoration than a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very nice illustrations...that's all!","review":"I definitely did not like this book. It is basically a list of names of past and recent model theories of the Universe.Very far from true popularizers of science authors like Sagan, Rusell, Dawkins, etc. the author does not give any explanation of its topics to the amateur nor the specialist.The illustrations are very well done, they are the only pedagogical value although some of them are as difficult to understand as the corresponding text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hawking has dumb ideas","review":"Hawking's book puts forth dumb ideas in some fancy language. For instance, he advocates the big bang theory - a theory which has been proven to be bogus. He claims every bit of matter in the universe was compacted into the size of a pea. Then one day, everything explodes and we have the universe. The big bang could not have possible. If it were true, all the planets should be currently spinning in the same direction.

The book describes WWII in Europe from a soldier's point of view. Ambrose does a wonderful job weaving the personal stories of soldiers who experienced combat in Europe during WWII, to tell the tale of how the Allies won the war. Unlike other books focus mainly on telling the overall story of WWII (the Operations, plans, tactics, and strategy from the General officer level), this book aims to give the reader a glimpse of what is was like to actually fight the war. My admiration and respect for the WWII generation continues to grow, the more I read about it.I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in WWII, especially if you are looking for details about how the soldiers lived, fought, and died in the major battles that followed D-Day. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"Citizen Soldier is another excellent read into history from the author. The one thing that I enjoy about this book is the authors focus on the soldiers on the ground and not necessarily the major commanders that one reads a lot about. Very educational. This book is packed with well documented information that is presented in a format foreign to many history authors and that is the ability to tell a story, keeping the the information fresh and informative.Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings history to life","review":"On the positive side, Citizen Soldiers masterfully interweaves the large-scale strategy of the European campaign with the day-to-day experiences of individual GIs. As such, it offers non-veterans an insight into the horrendous slugfest of 1944-45. I have to agree with previous reviewers, however, that Ambrose is more interested in cannonizing GIs than writing history. Particuarly suspicious is his central thesis - that there was something unique about American \\"citizen soldiers\\" that led inexorably to the defeat of Nazi Germany. I imagine that the British, free French, Russians, and Poles who fought bitterly throughout the war might have a different viewpoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unmatched courage and commitment","review":"As I read this book, I wondered if I or anyone of my generation would be able to sum up the courage to fight as bravely as the American GI did in the ETO. The generation that fought in WW II and preserved democracy in our world may have been unique. This book tells the tale, in vivid detail, of the soldiers who fought and prevailed against Hitler and the Nazis. Ambrose leaves no stone unturned as he successfully conveys to us the experience of the GI. It's not meant to be a complete history of the war, but rather a history annotated with scores of personal accounts by the men who fought it. After reading this book, I salute these men and thank them for making possible the free country I live in today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding and engaging","review":"I have read numerous accounts of WWII and this is outstanding.

Steven Ambrose is obviously a cheerleader for the American fighting man, and what's wrong with that? He makes no secret of his pro-G.I. slant. So he's a pop historian--that doesn't make his books any less readable. Take a trudge--a long, drawn-out trudge--through The Guns of August or The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich for grindingly thorough detail. Ambrose's books are simply different from these in-depth tomes--his are fast summaries of WWII events laced liberally with human interest details...it's the men he writes about more than the machinations, and he reveres the American G.I.--his personal childhood hero, as he's said openly--without stint. Good for him.

It is a long, drawn out account of battles beginning with the D-Day invasion and ending with the Allied victory over Nazi Germany. It is difficult to keep up with his characters, as he jumps sporatically from one story to the next, giving haphazard accounts of the progress of the war. For a book of its length, one would expect to get more \\"meat\\" out of the reading. As it stands, once completing this compiliation of hosh-posh, the reader is left feeling somewhat empty, and confused. The book does provide some entertainment value, but from a European historian's perspective, it is grave disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many better and more accurate accounts elsewhere.","review":"I was very disappointed with this book.

Ambrose does an excellent job of using the memoirs of GIs to tell the story of the pivotal months that led to the end of World War II.In the process, the reader develops an appreciation for the men and women -- in fact, an entire generation -- who sacrificed their youth -- if not their very lives -- for a noble cause.My sense of admiration for my parents' generation was further heightened by reading the accounts of soldiers, medics and nurses who mostly accepted what they were asked to do, did it, and then got on with their lives -- with little or no self-congratulatory chutzpah over their collective contribution to Western civilization.It makes it easier to understand why the actions of their Baby Boomer children seemed so self-indulgent and trivial in comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnifique!","review":"As a young girl I watched as American GI's liberated my village. CITIZEN SOLDIERS rekindled so many memories . . . I loved this fine book, and was very touched by another very moving book I ordered from amazon, THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY. It is one of the best novels of the war that I have ever read. Thank you for permitting me to record my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"The WWII equivalent of Shelby Foote's Civil War Trilogy","review":"Having read both Shelby Foote's masterpiece 3 volume set on The Civil War, I was very pleased to find that Ambrose's book felt very much like Mr. Foote's. A detailed, yet accessible book on WWII in Europe, such as this is, has been needed for a very long time. This book should be required reading in High School history, instead of the dry, boring textbooks which do not even scratch the surface of WWII events."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed and I expected more.","review":"Although I agree with the author's premise that the American troops fighting in the Western theater deserve modern recognition, I found that Mr. Ambrose repeated himself over and over again throughout the book and resorted to slang terms like \\"Jabos\\" and German \\"88's\\" to fill in detail. This wore thin quickly and after several chapters I began skimming for something fresh. In addition, Mr. Ambrose rarely introduced much less explained long quotations from the many veterans he interviewed. Such an approach might work in a Ken Burns' documentary (which I would not be surprised is in the works based on Mr. Burns'praise on the jacket cover), but it is not a satisfying substitute for real history. In short, I was frankly disappointed especially in light of Mr. Ambrose's experience and the vast wealth of materials, documents, and resources available to him. I'd take John Keegan or Cornelius Ryan anyday of the week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful stories form the backbone of this riveting book","review":"Steven E. Ambrose's Citizen Soldier is an exhaustively researched and prepared book on the battles from Normandy to the fall of Berlin during World War II.Includes information and collected stories from the soldiers (from Privates and NCO's to Colonels and Generals). Extremely riveting and well organized. A must for military history buffs. But it provides any reader insight into how and why men manage fight and survive in even the most horrid situations and condtions. It portrays personal acts of heroism, cowardice, and just plain struggles to endure and survive. I have yet come across a reader who regretted reading it.Citizen Soldier is probably better to listen to it on tape...14 tapes...but each hour is well worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new look at an old familiar story ...","review":"My late father donated three years to WWII & I had the temerity to be born in the middle of the conflict.

The top brass catch hell from Ambrose with well documented criticism. A must read even if you have only passing interest. On a down note - I doubt we could win such a conflict today. I could go on but I won't.

McManus)and lets you see the ETO as they saw it. Instead, I got a book that that focus's on the 12th Army Group (mainly 1st Army, 3rd is also mentioned, but in a secondary role to 1st Army, 9th gets some mention, and 7th barely exists) and attempts to bolster a rather weak analysis of the strategic view with the voices of veterans and snippets from other books. While this may not be bad for introducing people to WWII, I would suggest that those who are interested in the US soldiers exploits in WWII read Joseph Balkoski's Beyond the Beachhead or Gerald Astor's A Blood Dimmed Tide to understand what the citizen soldiers went through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening","review":"Stephen Ambrose tells what really happened...the color behind the black and white newsreels and stills we use to mark these moments in time.

Without throwing too many of the numbers at the reader, he brings the battlefield to life. In Citizen soldiers, Ambrose tells the entire story of the European theater through interviews with the veterans while still interjecting the bigger picture. Ambrose also has interviews with German veterans, something few other American historians tend to do. Ambrose shows that the men who fought in WWII were regular people who did extraordinary things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Publisher should be ashamed","review":"The publishers of any Stephen Ambrose book should be called out for printing his work.

Simply put, Ambrose successfully puts color into black & white the war that many of my generation have forgotten.

MUST READ!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good narrative","review":"I enjoyed this book. I felt it was repeating alittle,but that would be the nature of this type of book. It read well, and left me in awe several time. I enjoyed the immense amount of details.My grandfather landed at Normandy on D-Day + 2. I was amazed to read the landing beaches were under fire on the second day. I read that part and felt a deep connection, like I knew more now, and maybe understood my grandfather a little more. There were not many guys like my grandfather; he landed at the beach in the early days, and fought through France, and Low Countries, and into Germany. The amazing thing was the attrition rate; the loss rates were unrelenting for the Americans.Ambrose has his critics, but any historian would. The usually critism made is that they don't write their material, which maybe.All I can say is I enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating history from the foot soldier's perspective","review":"This book is a fascinating picture of the final American push in World War II, focusing on the experiences and perspective of the average soldiers. I found the descriptions of close-quarter fighting gut wrenching.Anyone who has not read much about World War II would do well to start here because it will help you maintain perspective on how much sacrifice the average soldier truly made.Many books are written focusing on the deciscions made by the commanders such as Eisenhower or Patton, but this book gives you both a sense of the overall strategy and a real picture of what the GIs in the thick of it felt and did.There are also excellent chapters focusing on the experiences of medics, nurses, airmen, and others. The only criticisms I would make are that there are a few typographical errors and some of the photos seem to have been captioned wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is a great book. It is written for the common person that may not be all too interested in history. I could hardly put it down. After having to read hundreds of tedious history books for my degree, it was nice to read something with a bit of emotion. While he cannot be 100% accurate all the time it is still very good for people who want a swift read about WWII soldiers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk about heroes!","review":"My father was a B-17 pilot stationed in Northeast England in the latter stages of the war. Citizen Soldiers is the story of men like him. Average American young men, coming out of the depression enlisting for a great cause. These are the people who are the true \\"stars\\" of our society.Only until I read Citizen Soldiers was I fully able to comprehend the horror of battle and the awful conditions our troops faced. Mr Ambrose does a great job of telling the story of the men and women who literally saved the world. In a few years I hope my eleven year old son reads this book so he can better understand what others before him have done so that we can live the easy lives we have. Bravo Mr. Ambrose!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was a Corporal once - felt like it again!","review":"Ambrose masterfully tells the tale of Allied Forces in WWII Germany. Thank you, Steve A.B. Montgomery was one cowardly bastard - Patton should have attacked him after handling the Germans!My respect for Eisenhower has deepened with this telling of the Bulge. If the saying is true that there is 'opportunity in crisis' than nothing more poignantly exemplfies this than Ike taking advantage of the Bulge. Bravo, General Eisenhower!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Similarities between today's Army and yesterdays","review":"Ambrose's book really gave me a sense of appreciation for the sacrifices of our veterans.It also helped me realize that the more things change, the more they stay the same. The parallels of the Army's soldiers and the Junior Military officers of World War II and today's Army are amazing. Perspectives really haven't changed. For example, veterans always feel that the new recruits lack training and necessary discipline that only experience can give.In addition, Ambrose teaches readers that the soldier is the person who loses the most in times of war, and it is the senior leadership who gain the most from it.In sum, a great book about the greatest generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent history of WWII from soldiers' perspective","review":"I had to force myself to put this book down, as I found it quite fascinating. Ambrose does a wonderful job of enlightening the reader about the historical overview of various aspects of WWII in the ETO, and then providing soldiers' stories of what they experienced. It's a vivid snapshot of a moment in history, both from the large scale sense and from the smallest nuance, such as a soldier describing his battle from his perspective. It's a magnificently done work. After I read this book, I immediately bought \\"Band of Brothers\\", which I also highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"War from the grunt's perspective","review":"This book should be read after you have read D Day by the same author. It is written in the same style with real recollections from the war fighters who participated in the battles following D Day until the German surrender. Ambrose is simply one of the best writers of history to ever have lived. After reading D Day I wanted to read everything that he had ever written. This is my second Ambrose book and I'm going to read his book on the Lewis and Clark expedition next. If you love history you will love Ambrose' style. He's gone now and the world is a worse place for his passing. What a magnificent contribution he has made to America's history! He was simply a master."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable history from D-day to fall of Berlin","review":"I bought this book because my father is quoted in it. He occasionally, and somewhat reluctantly, tells stories about his experiences as an Army infantryman during the war. This book gives the entire story of the western front from D-day to the fall of Berlin, from the overall strategies of the generals to the day-to-day life of the soldiers on the front. This is the best book I have read on what fighting the war was like on the front line--the ever present danger, the incessant cold, the lack of sleep, and the other details of daily life. Ambrose's extensive use of quotes of the participants brings these stories to life. It's hard to imagine this story could be told any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best potrayles of combat from the men who fought","review":"This is by far the best book about the horrors of war.

If your professor requires it, buy something else to complement your studying (I liked Anatomy and Physiology The Easy Way) or pray you have an awesome professor. This text book is not concise at all, incorporates pointless analogies, and does not describe things in order. I had to read through some sections multiple times in order to understand what was being explained. The only redeeming factors were the IP-9 System Suite, which did a good job of explaining things and had helpful quizzes, and some good illustrations in the book.

The rest of the songs range from the sparse Country Blues ballad \\"Halfway to Heaven\\" to the Johnny Cash on acid beat of \\"She Ain't Never Gonna Stay\\". In between are snatches of Western Swing in \\"Darlene\\" and Texas Honky-Tonk in the aptly named, 7 1/2 minute \\"Way Too Long Song\\".

The USSR was an aberration, just read Trotsky and his comments on the regime to get a better perception of this.

It is incredible that after such an appalling result, a fellow reviewer, and communist sympathiser, considers Stalin's excesses to be somewhat forgivable because he hastened the introduction of electrification into the USSR. The Soviets could have struggled on with oil lamps given the choice, I would have thought. But, under communism, only a special few had a choice.The fundamental flaw in communism is that it integrates economics with political power, which, ironically for the communist critics of capitalism, achieves exactly what they maintain to be the shortcomings of capitalism vis-à-vis the little guy.This is a must read for contemporary Chinese readers who should also read Capitalism: a Treatise on Economics by George Reisman."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Are Moral, Read This","review":"The Black Book of Communism is one of the most important books of the 20th century.Written by learned and honest scholars, it goes to the heart of one of the two great catastrophes of our times, whose criminals remain untouched."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"A real eye opener.

He proves only that salvation is possible, but he offers no guidance for how it will come about. It's nice for Leo that he \\"bloomed,\\" but the child is still miserable. You think I am kidding. I wish I was.I do not blame the book per se, though. With kind, insightful parents, it could help a child talk about his hopes and dreams, and with their encouragement they might come true.

Sid Caesar dominated, but all the supporting actors were good, especially Swen Swenson doing \\"I've Got Your Number\\".

Loved to read and to re-read their books. This book looked promising and came highly rated. However, I considered this book to be overrated and boring. Contrary to what others wrote, the lack of punctuation alone drove me crazy. The book skips around so much that not only do you lose any perspective of what the author is supposed to be saying, but you don't get a chance to connect with anybody in the book. Having any type of punctuation could only have improved upon it. You are never sure when one person has stopped and another picked up, or even to when you have left one place to visit another. A book of this size and on this topic really needs a writer who is going to pull you in and allow you to \\"feel\\" what the players are feeling and thinking.

Not for those with a weak stomach!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Civil War fiction's second greatest title","review":"Michael Shaara's novel \\"The Killer Angels\\" is often considered to be the best novel written about the Civil War. If you're wondering which book is #2, this is it. McKinlay Kantor's haunting fictional book about the very real Andersonville prison camp is a masterpiece and well deserved the Pulitzer Prize it received. But, unlike \\"The Killer Angels,\\" \\"Andersonville\\" is a very long and at times difficult book to read. Kantor employs an unusual writing style by not using quotation marks around the spoken sentences of the charactors. This is a bit disconcerting to the reader at first, but as the story progresses one realizes it contributes greatly to the other-worldly, dream-like \\"feel\\" of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"PRIMUS","review":"An excellent read.

Plus, it's been a while since I read a mindless romance novel. The first story provided MILD entertainment value, but I have to say that the second and third story get so bad I actually felt sorry for the authors. The story lines are weak and in some areas almost non-existent. The plots are predictable, and too much like other recent books I've read (the third story is just like Bridget Jones' Diary).

It's destined to join the short-list of classic rants. She did her own translation, and her sometimes fractured English contributes a good deal to the effect. I was sent to the dictionary more than once (and discovered, to my surprise, that \\"parvises\\" actually is an English word). The odd hyphenation adds even mo-re to the effect.Be that as it may, one must admit that she makes some telling points. It seems that every day's news brings some new Moslem outrage -- the attacks on Pim Fortuyn and Bertrand Delanoe are, I fear, just the beginning of the religion's crusade (or, as Fallaci puts it, \\"anti-crusade\\") against the values of pluralistic societies, especially in Europe (but America's day is coming). Her occasional homophobic comments are a bit grating: American society \\"deifies\\" homosexuality, she says... Hello?."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rage and the Pride","review":"I have read this book and I found it quite interesting in describing why we are in such a global instability.

After the 9-11 attacks, she has dropped all of her masks and revealed herself plain as an embittered closet Mussolinian fascist shrieking \\"Italy for Italians\\"--essentially, kick out all blacks, Arabs, etc. Fallaci conviently forgets several things in her demagogic rant: that first of all, the Italians invited the Muslims into Italy to clean their streets(among other things)and in the ensuing decades stopped having babies and giving jobs to their own young, thereupon exacerbating the problems they now face. But of course, it's the dirty wog's fault, if we were to believe Fallaci.

But, this is because she wrote it in Italian and then translated it in to English herself. However, I enjoyed reading it. It is her mind, her soul, her rage, and her pride poured out on paper, but not corrected, not prettied up, and unaltered. This is acutally quite refreshing seeing as how every book on the face of the earth needs to be absolutely perfect before it can be put on teh market.

(This translation from her native Italian remains clear and on message.) Her writing is straightforward and heart wrenching; her personal involvements are startling; her recitations of historical precedents place today's situation in proper perspective. She dares to call a spade a spade, and is not weak enough to bow down to the political correctness that has allowed this jihadic invasion to spread to its current level. Ms. Fallaci's pen provides a opportunity for the world to awaken from its stupor and begin to convincingly address this stone-age menace. Bravo to a true heroin of Freedom, bravo to a true heroin of Truth, bravo to a true heroin of Patria."},{"rating":"2","title":"brutal","review":"Imagine if you had a neighbor with a huge wart. Good manners decries that you ignore it. Ms. Fallaci doesn't. In Rage and Pride she points out that there is a wart on the neighbor's face and proceeds to describe how big and ugly is and notes that it's growing. In other words this fire breathing little book is not polite much less politically correct. Is Ms. Fallaci a latter day Cassandra speaking the truth to unwilling listeners?

Her objectivity, fairness and compassion has impressed me when reporting on Vietnam, Mexico City, her interviews with History, her letter to a child never born.However The Rage and the Pride deeply disappointed me. It seems to me that Oriana in her age has lost her valleys of understanding, compassion and objectivity and is living in the peaks of irrational and passionate hate.

Sadly, she does not here display the writing skill, the organization, or the preparation to take a solid swing at this.Oh, I agree with most of what Fallaci writes here; it's just that this particular book is not worth your time. It was obviously too hastily written, it suffers from an irritatingly self-important style (e.g., the author's constantly referring to the reader as \\"you\\" and \\"my dear\\"), and it features a unnecessarily huge introduction.The thing is also swiss-cheesed with intrusively awful English. It certainly wasn't translated.

Muslim are women beaters, savages, polyagamists, terrorists and bearded fanatics.The only difference with her is that she did not even bother to present it in a way which is acceptable, in simple writers standards.It is full of Historic errors, Prejiduced statements, and emotional unrational, even personal attacks.Her describtion of Western Civilization as the contrary to the savage and backward mentality of Islam is so outrageous and tremendously ignorant that only the most naive headnodders will follow her.The Democracy of the West is not a result of its enlightenment, but of a long perioed of Wars, suffering, torture and pillage...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passionate pleas for some sense","review":"Passionate, and original thinker unafraid to be different, whether you agree with her or not.

I confess to having read only the Buddhist sections, but they were so misguided and innacurate I won't be reading more.The author seems to be disinterested and even have disdain for the subject.

After 4 feeding, he decided to slow down and play the bottle's game, and this is when I was elated. But after a couple of feedings like that, he simply refused to spend nearly 5 times longer to feed than he was used to. By the time he sucked a couple of ounces, over 1/2 hour would pass. I tried making the nipples hole a little larger by making a tiny slice in the silicon, and this did improve things, but in the end, even the nipple's shape was not to his liking.

I am going to return these and I do not recommend them to anyone. He did much better with the Born Free bottles and those are also BPA free.

He walked around the house saying bye bye bye, bye bye bye. Translated (Aint no lie... Bye Bye Bye)I only wished that they would have focused on showing you the entire routine for maybe 2 videos instead of excerpts of routines from 4 or 5 videos. AND I wish that they had done more side by side shots of the actual video and darrins crew.

Dance is a passion that I have dedicated myself to.I really enjoyed this DVD. I have found that DVDs alone (or on-line instruction and books) cannot substitute for learning from others at clubs or from a private instructor. But this DVD showed me what kinds of steps are possible, and gave me some insight into how to choreograph my own moves.What I have learned so far from \\"Darrin's Dance Grooves\\" has been a lot of fun to try on live dance floors--and has added welcome new moves to my repertoire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of $","review":"I don't know who could learn it in a day as one customer had claimed, but it definitely would not be me.

Also, he does not show the whole dance to each song. He is very skilled, but he is not very verbal in explaining how to move when he moves. Also, the camera angles stink. I think that they should show you the whole body at all times, sometimes Darrin is talking about moving his feet when you cannot see his feet! He does not seem very personable and it is not very exciting & enjoyable to watch the video, esp. discouraging beginning dancers. I could hardly follow him, if not at all. I would recommend Fatima's video which is more aimed towards beginners, although she does not show the whole video dance either."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Low Down on Darren's Dance Grooves","review":"The energetic advertisement for Darren's Dance Grooves along with the sprightly celebrities of collaboration were enough to make me purchase this DVD. However, looks can be very deceiving as in my case. The actual \\"dance grooves\\" one learns are merely the chorus sections of \\"Crazy,\\" \\"Bye, Bye, Bye,\\" \\"Give It to You,\\" and \\"Digital Get Down.\\" The actual instruction is too hasty, not specific, and shot at inconvenient angles that ultimately confuse you while you are trying to learn this amoebic mesh of bodily movement. Along with the instruction, I was also inconvenienced with the pointless, superficial interviews of Darren, which should have, for the sake of mankind, been deleted and replaced with more thorough instruction of the dance moves, and more OF them to say the least. I spent [amt] on a DVD that should have been entitled: \\"Darren's Superfluous Drivel and --oh yeah-- Some Dance Stuff.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY IT. JUST WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY.","review":"I and my daughter (17 years old) and my son (7 years old) could not follow his instructions even thought we tried very hard. Just a waste of my money. Disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I've been dancing for about 6 years and consider myself to be a fairly good dancer. But this tape offered little to no help. Not only were the rather large female backround dancers annoying they were also discusting. Darrin's feet were cut out of most of the video so you really have no idea what they are doing down there. Another annoying feature were the interviews that graced this dvd. Darrin said that he didn't choose dancing, dancing chose him........well Darrin I'm afraid dancing made a wrong choice. Kiddies don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok so it's not JUST me.","review":"I really thought this video was very hard to follow. I thought it was just me because I am not the best dancer in the world. Darrin goes way too fast, not just that but he doesn't really show you how the steps are done/broken-down. Also it is very confusing the way he is facing I got confused just trying to figure out what was my right/left vs. his right/left. So I would not recommend this video to anyone who is trying to actually learn how to dance like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I was very disappointed with this video. Darrin does not do a good job of breaking the routines down. He teaches an 8 count slowly but does not go into detail with each move. Then, he just keeps adding on 8 count sections in slow motion until the end and then expects you to just do the whole routine in regular time from the beginning. Because he does not go into a lot of detail, you have to watch him very carefully and there are times when the camera only shows his upper body, so it is absolutely impossible to know what your legs/feet are supposed to do. The routines are short and there are songs from only three artists/groups. I was very frustrated trying to learn these routines and i've been dancing for almost 20 years, since I was 5. Don't waste your money on this one, folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here are better videos","review":"Darren doesn't repeat his moves. Doesn't do them facing away from the camera (which is how real dance classes are taught). And the camerawork is horrible. They need to a)not show the music videos and b)keep the camera in 1 position.There are better videos/DVDs: Paula Abdul's Cardio Dance. Culture Shock hip hop workout. Hip Hop Body Shop Twister Abs. They take things at a pace where someone at home can actually learn something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough Breakdown","review":"I got this DVD a few years ago. There is no music playing while he teaches, he only show 5 moves at a time, no breakdown other then to day 1 and 2 and 3 and..., he would never call out the move before you did it, so the first time you'd have NO clue what was next, he would do it 1/2 time 2x, then on the next 5 moves & would go through all 30+ moves before doing the whole thing 1 time at 1/2 speed then with music full speed with video playing.Only a few moves throughout the whole routine would he give a second instruction on minute hand gestures. He never broke down the footwork, the camera would be zoomed at their faces, hardly ever at the feet.The moves are decent, the backup 3 guys & about 5 girls seemed nice, Darrin seems nice, the extra pop/locking tiny routine with him & 2 guys is cool but your Rew button will get rubbed down. There are plenty of better dance workout DVDs out there.There's a trailer at collagevideo com"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"I have to say, I was totally stoked when I ordered this awful video...it looked like so much fun! Well, I watched it once and gave up on it. First of all, whoever mentioned that he was confusing about distinguising his left to your left was totally right....i couldn't follow the moves at all! And this whole video was so narcisstic-it was Darren promoting himself for 3/4 of it! Total waste of money. PLEASE don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PATHETIC!","review":"I HAVE NO CLUE WHERE TO START!THIS TAPE IS FILLED WITH JUNK AND IT GOES BY TOO FAST.LIKE 60% OF THE FILM IS FILLED WITH BIOGRAPHY AND UNKNOWN PEOPLE INTERVIEWS.IM BEGGING YOU.

I love working out to dance work out videos, but this has been the worst. I like to to dance, but it takes a comprehensive break down of each 8 count for me and then practice at the normal beat of each 8 count before I can move one to a new set. If you are like that too, I recommend getting something else before buying this one. I do recommend Paula Abdul's Get up and Dance. She breaks down each 8 count and then practices each 8 count up to tempo before moving on. It is challenging and yet completely doable and offers a great way to sweat off some calories, whereas with Darrin's Dance Grooves, I didn't feel any real calorie burning sweat at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darrin's Dance Grooves","review":"Basically, this instructional video is poorly shot. I agree with Amazon's review about having to reverse the \\"right\\" and \\"left\\" directions. It is a little confusing. It also does not help that the camera seems to be on a slight angle. Many times it is also in so close you can't see feet when he's telling you to step. I've been a dancer for 20 years and was too frustrated to finish the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"I thought this video was a waste of money(even though it was a gift). He is the worst instructor. He basically doesn't explain barely any of the moves and just shows you the dance with counts. You would get the same affect from watching the music videos and pausing and slowing and rewinding. He goes through the moves so quickly, going over it about once. They are trying so hard to make this video look cool with cheap camera effects that it makes it hard to follow along with him and the dancers. Half of this video is just him talking about himself and his career which I personally fast forwarded through. So I deeply do not recommend this video. Fatima's video was much better, at least she teaches it to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"As a dancer and as a dance coach, i was very dissapointed in this video all together.

He gives you the first move of a sequence, then goes through the sequence without breaking it up first. He doesnt even tell you how fast you will do it in the \\"real thing\\"Since Darrin is facing you, it is extremely confusing from your rights and your lefts.However, the moves are fun and simple, but it would help a lot if they were broken down first."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not bad--not great","review":"I have danced for a few years. I can tell that this was made for the average person, not a dancer who wants to excel in dance. There is no technique. It's like, \\"learn this and look like you know what you're doing.\\" Darrin's the teacher nobody likes. He's doing his best to teach you. He's nice and all, he just doesn't teach well enough. I was also disappointed to find out that you just learn the chorus part of the dance. I thought it was the whole dance.On the plus side, it's fun and challenging. I would really recommend getting a bunch of friends together and have a dance party. Hey, make a video of the choreography, send it into TRL on MTV, and get on TV. Isn't that worth it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I shoulda ordered Fatima's tape!","review":"I have several dancercise tapes and I Love 'em all! Can't say the same about \\"Darrin's Dance Grooves\\". Unless you're some kinda seasoned dancer, BE WARNED! I was looking for something fun and healthy. This was just plain frustrating! Darrin should have used more time breaking down the \\"dance grooves\\" and less time hyping himself.Next time, I'll pay better attention to the other customer reviews before purchasing a product!Before I go, I'd like to recommend Jody Watley's \\"Dance to Fitness\\" and MTV's The Grind Workout: Hip Hop Aerobics! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"{Bad] beyond belief","review":"I would absolutely not recommend this video to anyone. Let me tell you what it contains:If the video is 40 minutes long, about 32 minutes showcase Darrin talking about himself.It promises to teach you the steps to three videos. The problem is, it only contains the steps to about 20 seconds from each video. And even those parts are badly explained and hard to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!","review":"I bought this as a way to add some structured dance moves to my workout program. I wish Wal-Mart would take it back! This video is a fluff piece about DARRIN! Most of the video is him or some other blurb meister hyping him up. Even if you are a great hip hop dancer, (I am) you can't keep up with his nonsense. Example, DARRIN will explain one move and do something totally different. His suggestion to the viewer-KEEP REWINDING! Who wants to keep rewinding. Also, his terminology is for people who actually take formal dance. My advice to DARRIN is K.I.S.S. (keep it simple stupid) or just stop making videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darrin's Stinky Grooves","review":"I bought this tape with a friend we were so pumped for Darrin to teach us the moves! BOY WERE WE WRONG! First of all you would have to be a serious dancer to even begin to be good at this tape! Actually I don't know about that, a serious dancer needs to see half the moves before they copy them. Half the time Darrin is showing you the moves there isn't even a shot of his feet! It's kick turn pivot kick swish now you try! You might be able to master the first dance routine on the tape! But after that GOOD LUCK! We mastered the first routine but after that we spent the rest of the tape yelling at Darrin for his lying commercial!

While it is fun to watch, it is definitely not made to be an instructional piece. I agree w/everyone's gripe about the orientation and mirroring aspect. The \\"slow\\" part of showing the steps were laughable.Look to it for ideas and inspiration. Don't count on learning moves clearly and step-by-step w/this.There are good dancers and/or good dance instructors. It is not common to see both in one person. Darrin is an awesome dancer, but a visibly unseasoned instructor as demonstrated by this sad example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard To Follow","review":"This tape is really hard to do if you don't have previous dance experience. It is hard to follow especially because Darrin is facing you when he's dancing, so you have to reverse what he's doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fast paced for a beginner","review":"I was disappointed that many times the camera angle would shift and not show Darrin's feet. I found this to be very distracting when I'm trying hard to watch his every move and then all of a sudden I don't see how his feet are moving anymore! One of the moves being shown showed him spinning around one time a full circle, but no emphasis was given to show the correct way to spin so that your feet end up in the correct position at the end of the spin. I wouldn't recommend this for a beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"book review","review":"The book that I ordered came in less than two weeks. It was well wrapped and in very good condition.

Bradshaw has written a readable, slim volume describing cathedral and monastic prayer - their appropriate use, history, the need for both in a full spiritual life ...Cathedral prayer is the communal prayer with fixed roles, use of external signs, etc. generally oriented towards the benefit of the world at large. Monastic prayer is the private prayer with temporary roles, external signs only as training devices, generally oriented towards the benefit of the one praying.

If you've installed a car stereo (or anything that requires splicing wires), you can do this yourself.

She can play it so-so, but to hear the real deal, you need to buy and listen to Kevin's albums. He's a much, much better pianist. Just listen and that's all the proof you need. Where she gets off calling herself an expert on his music is just not right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatrix Potter with attitude","review":"An interesting combination of fantasy and mystery although the mystery is not important to the storyline.You may wonder as you read any book in this series how a town full of freedom loving, democratic minded citizens could be persuaded to call a silly, 70-year old harridan Master. Why they would endure her pettiness and mean spirited insults and why they obey her whimsical dictates. Those answers and others are never fully revealed to the reader.Brown shows an absurd lack of knowledge when it comes to all the animals in her novels. Foxes don't enjoy being hunted, nor do they sit around their humble dens at night and gossip about foxhunters. Horses don't enjoy being jumped over ice to give their riders a thrill. But wishing makes it so in this Virginia community, that is if you are one of the hunting-mad, rich gentry.Ignore the basic cruelty to animals and the unpleasant sense of entitlement felt by the fox hunters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Once again Rita Mae Brown has intrigued me. This is a great novel. Suspenseful, funny, honest. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a great book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"Mind-numbingly dull. The only mystery about this book was how it got published in the first place. Unlike other reviewers, I found the characters to be completely one-dimensional and pedantic. The plot was more predictable than a rerun of \\"Murder She Wrote.\\" And please, the talking animals were as absurd as they were annoying. There were such strong echo's of Disney's The Fox and the Hound, I thought I might be stranded in Orlando. Really, this book had no redeeming qualities. If your reading level is over that of a 10 to 12 year old, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I am a huge fan of Ms. Brown's previous work, but this one went right into the recycle bin. Too much time spent on descriptions of the clothes and the tack and the food and the whiny justifications for hunting in the 21st century. The characters were wooden (including the cutesy talking animals)and the plot reminded me of a previous entry in the much-better written Rita Mae-and Sneaky Pie series, where I think it should have stayed. This would possibly have made a nice essay about Southern heritage in some niche mag, but doesn't do a thing for mystery lovers or fans of good writing. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"More with Sister,Shaker and Doug","review":"I love the Mrs Murphy series so I was sure I would love Outfoxed---I did. Sister Shaker Doug Cora Diana Inky---I loved them all. Only problem with this book is it came to an end. I wish Ms Brown could write a book a month I would certainly read them all. I know there is another book out there with Sister--what happens with Walter Lundgren and that dirty little secret? I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't finished Outfoxed--but hey what's taking you so long?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-righteous","review":"As with all Ms. Brown's books, I found Outfoxed immensely readable. Yet as a former Brown fan, I found it also immensely disappointing. If I want Disney, I'll read (or watch) 101 Dalmatians. In humanizing all her animals, Brown shows her lack of true understanding concerning the lives of animals. I found that the novel's underlying bitterness detracted from it. Who is the Fontaine Burruss or the Crawford Howard in Brown's real life who wounded her enough for such a vitriolic nasty approach to life? This is a far departure from Brown's former novels. It is slight, stylistically poor, angry and self-righteous in tone. Outfoxed is very big on formula and completely lacking in literary merit. As a foxhunter for 25 years, I enjoyed the hunting, but others might find it a bit much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved every minute of it!","review":"The *only* reason this isn't a five-star review is because personally I found the mystery plot to be a bit thin. So if you're not into the equestrian scene, I can see where it might be disappointing. For me, however, it was a delight from start to finish, with excellent characters (both human and animal), accurate and witty social observation, and lots of lovely detail on the fine points of hunting, a lot of which I'd forgotten about. I'll be coming back to this one again and again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious? 5 stars","review":"I've read Ms. Brown for years and keep hoping I'll enjoy one of her latest books as much as High Hearts or her earlier books. Her snobbish Virginia characters and foxhunting settings have worn very thin. I believe in southern gentility as much as the next person, but in light of the issues we face today, lauding something like foxhunting as \\"civilized\\" seems a slap in the face.I don't mind the animal antropomorphizing, but I do mind her using that device to justify foxhunting as a sport that the foxes apparently \\"enjoy\\", even if she only portrays \\"no kill\\" hunts."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's definitely not Sneaky Pie!","review":"This is tolerable only if you really, really loooooove foxhunting. I don't. I fought through to the end, largely because I kept hoping it would turn into a Sneaky Pie level story. Unfortunately, it didn't. As others have said, wooden characters, thin plot, and entirely too much boring, tedious, trivial arcana about fox hunting. (Does anyone really care which way the ribbons on somebody's hat go?) Not recommended unless you're a foxhunter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book for Equine Enthusiasts","review":"Enjoyable reading with accurate descriptions of \\"fox chasing\\" and the politics involved. Having fox hunted in the past it was fun to read the supposed thoughts of the horses, the hounds and the fox. Many of the characteristics of the hunt members could be attributed to members of real hunts.While the mystery doesn't develop until somewhere around the middle of the book, it was enjoyable reading. It may also go along way to dispell the negative image fox hunting has associated with it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mystery about foxhunters - with clever dialogue","review":"I have enjoyed all of the Mrs. Murphy mysteries, in part because I'm a cat-and-dog person. The illustrations are a plus, done by people who really know and love animals. OUTFOXED is written in Ms. Brown's easy-to-stay-with style, with lots of commentary from the animals involved. The book may tell more about foxhunting than you might care to know, but Rita Mae Brown makes the human and animal characters so likable that you keep wanting to know what happens to them next. I hope she will give us more books in this style, as well as keeping on in her collaboration with Sneaky Pie Brown in stories about Mrs. Murphy's doings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calling all those that yearn for a kinder world..","review":"This is the right movie for everybody who wishes the world weren't quite so loud or so fast, who wishes 'gentlemen' still existed and that people were a bit kinder to each other for a change. That's not to say the movie is soppy - there's plenty of tension with asylums, amnesia, and false identity - but the pace and action is just a bit kinder than most things around.And for Greer Garson and Ronald Colman fans this movie is a must in any case. Each of them delivers one of their most genuine performances, and apart from that they just 'click'.

I wish this was colorized! I'm sure the costumes were gorgeous, and the scenery, as well. The story is a case of love lost and not found again till the last minute, leaving us in suspense all through the movie. Though dated, it is still worth watching, now.

The story could be made again, but there are no actors today who could play these parts the way Ronald Coleman and Green Garson did. They were at the top of their craft when that meant something real in Hollywood -- not that they had good publicists, but that they could tell a story without moving a muscle, screaming or taking off their clothes. Their acting is a prime example of \\"a picture speaks a thousand words\\".. And this movie has two hours of unforgettable pictures of intelligent, sensitive characters.

This of course, requires the case to be replaced with a more substantial one (with no holes) and the original case goes into a landfill.Light can also pass through the DVD case, which may shortening the life of the DVD.If a sturdier case with no holes were used this senseless waste could be avoided.I liked the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Little, Too Late...","review":"I just received my pre-release notice for \\"Random Harvest\\" and I am greatly disappointed. Why did WB delay the release of such a long-awaited DVD until almost three weeks AFTER Christmas (Jan 11, 2005)? And provide no technical info about the DVD's format or content. What are they thinking over there at Warner Home Theater? Do they want to sell any of these discs? With a little intelligent scheduling this release would have made an excellent 2004 Christmas gift! Releasing it in January almost guarantees it to have mediocre sale figures.

And the 2 stars are just for Jackie, because even when the movie is horrible he doesn't lose his coolness and charm. I love u Jackie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for Cable!","review":"The tuxedo is a pointless film about a super tuxedo that gives whoever wears it superpowers. Thats all I can say about the plot of this film. It has something to do with him teaming up with Jennifer Love Hewitt to stop bad guys from getting these bugs to poison the water that is used for bottled water. ... Jackie Chan is a lot of fun to watch, but to try and understand what he says takes a lot of the fun out of watching the movie. Jennifer Love Hewitt, usually very charming and likeable in her other films, comes across as an angry, unlikeable young woman who seems annoyed thoughout the entire film for no reason. The 2 have a few cute scenes together, which saves this film from being a total disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad.","review":"The stunts were not interesting, the women all portrayed either as sluts or neurotic, excessive and inappropraite references to sex, lame story, dark and unhappy scenery, all add to a very bad movie.

The plot was silly, and if the directors expect one to believe all the drivel surrounding the suit it needs SOME realism!! The suit was doing stuff Superman couldn't!! add to that the poor acting - the lines were trite and just not funny.Nobody looked natural (except jackie in his usual comic fight scenes...which weren't anything new). Jennifer seemed to be struggling with her Nerd-turn-spy role (but hey she looked pretty decent). The best part of the show was actually probably the NYC cab scene which DIDN'T have the suit involved.My opinion is to rent this...if you're willing to bear the loss for the tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the bad movies starring Jackie Chan","review":"It's one of the bad movies starring Jackie Chan.

Say it isn't so.","review":"Well, Jackie's getting on in years, and in order for him to wow audiences with his ridiculous skills, I suppose directors feel the need to stick him in a suspension harness and make him fly. I can't stand to see Jackie on suspension cables any more than I can stand to see Jennifer Love-Hewitt attempting martial arts. Although Jackie's movies are not known for being heady philosophical treatises or marked by fabulous dialogue, I found the writing and directing sub-par even for his movies. I didn't find this movie funny or exciting. It's perhaps one of Jackie's worst of the last 5 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and stylish","review":"Almost in keeping with the Mask, here we have a Tuxedo that gives the wearer super powers! Jackie Chan and Jennifer Love Hewitt are cast well and provide for lots of laughs!

The best scene is where Jackie does a James Brown Sex Machine routine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Choppy","review":"This is just another bit of Hollywood fluff rolled out to dazzle the eye and numb the brain. The plot was do-able but the directing was poor, the charachters were undeveloped, the events were unconnected, the story line was uninspired, just a lot of special effects rehatched and over done.

Seriously! Jackie Chan has fallen off notches from his usual acting course, since he's now acting in Hollywood. In fact, as of to date, Jackie Chan is perhaps the worst martial arts actor out now! Even worse than Steven Seagal! The plots to his most recent films don't even make much sense at all! (The Medallion, Shanghai Noon/Knights) Please! If you're looking for a decent action packed Jackie Chan film, get \\"Drunken Master\\" (skip the sequel) or any of his movies before \\"Rush Hour.\\" It's just a sorry sight to see such a great actor fall off this horribly!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Talent and Time.","review":"I'm a huge Jackie Chan fan, and I've always been saddened by the fact that, while some of his American films have been VERY entertaining, none have really captured his true essence, or conveyed the tremendous action sequences seen in his Hong Kong films. The Tuxedo is a HUGE step backwards...Jackie and co-star Jennifer Love Hewitt are charming and cute, but the dopey plot (about an evil bottled-water tycoon!) is horrifically bad, and the few fight scenes are too brief, plus the wire-work Jackie does stands out like a sore thumb. I guess I just couldn't get past the idea of a Tuxedo that can do anything...It seemed like Inspector Gadget. And the idea of a romance between Chan and Hewitt is just creepy....I still love Jackie, and will continue to flock to his films, but The Tuxedo was a BIG letdown. Better luck next time, Jackie! And please- NO SEQUEL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, that was dreadful.","review":"I only bought this DVD, because I'm a rabid Jason Isaacs fan, and I'm intent on eventually seeing everything in his IMDB listing, but yeesh. This was just painful. The only good parts were Jason as Clark Devlin and Debbie Mazar as Steena, and those parts were entirely too brief. In fact, there is a much, much better movie featuring those two particular characters implied in this forgettable little piece of nonsense.I really wish I owned that movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chan's Bond spoof should have been funnier and more exciting","review":"Though watchable and somewhat engaging, the problem with \\"The Tuxedo\\" is that it comes up short in the two elements one looks forward to in a Jackie Chan film: action and humor. To be sure, there's some action, but it's mostly of the generic action-movie variety than the amazingly-choreographed set pieces we've come to expect in a Chan film. And in place of the usual humor, there's a darkness and mean-spiritness that detracts from the other thing we expect from Mr. Chan: a good time at the movies. Less than a minute or so into the film, for example, we're treated to a [...] joke and a fairly graphic (though admittedly creative) murder by drowning. I guess I don't want to say that all Jackie Chan movies have to adhere to the same light humor/amazing action formula, only that this attempt to be a little different didn't add much to the mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"A struggle to even finish watching!","review":"The Tuxedo is an example of horrid movie-making. There are no comedic aspects present in the film. There are few action scenes that stick to punches and kicks mostly. I've seen you kick stuff before Jackie, and this is just awful. There is nothing in this film that is cool. No characters, set designs, effects, comedy, action, or anything that makes a film good. I don't even understand why this movie was made.... 1 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than one star!","review":"This movie sucked! Jackie Chan, you're losing it man! Teaming up with Jennifer Love Hewitt, god what a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackie Can't Fight","review":"If you don't go to see a Jackie Chan movie for his fighting style, or the comedic entertainment he brings using his fighting skill, then this is the movie for you.Forget the plot, and forget whatever the story is supposed to be - comedy, action, whatever. I think most people want to see Jackie Chan use his fighting skills in a movie, not \\"rely\\" on a Tuxedo to do it for him.Now, Jennifer Love Hewitt lends nothing to the story. Her character is beyond trite and common, but we are all used to the female's role being lame. This premise is too pathetic to give any enjoyment. I think the major flaw of this movie is that we know Jackie Chan doesn't need the Tuxedo. We don't see him as a bumbling fool who cannot pull off a roundhouse kick without falling on his behind. I know this is the major flaw because The Medallion was slight on plot, but still entertaining because watching Jackie Chan is fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 2 BILLION DOLLAR TUX","review":"For me this DVD is good but nothing compared to Rush Hour 2.The tux is full of accion but needs more comedy. One downside of the movie is that Del Blaine (Jennifer Love Hewitt) is way to serious. What my friends and I think is that it needs a big mouth someone like Chris Tucker to lighten up things.The borring part is that most of the movie is at Detrich's house.The person in charge of writing the comical parts and lines was obviously asleep. So if you are looking for accion buy this DVD BUT if you are looking for comedy you can buy it if you want but I would recomend buying Rush hour 2. Now if you are a fan of Jackie Chan and seeking a hi-tech movie this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt taken to the cleaners.","review":"WE all have to grow up at some point. No way around it. Unfortunately Jackie Chan and his production team have seemingly not grasped this yet and have tried once more to have him play the young naive character who is thrust into glory. Sadly, his age showed, as did the fact that they worked very hard to cover diminishing physical skills with special effects. Worse still, his innate charm was masked by the erratic pacing of the film and the surprisingly annoying performance of Hewitt.I hate to say it, I feel this was his worst film ever, surpassing Thunderbolt and those of the Lo Wei low budget era.He deserverd better: better screenwriting; a better leading lady and a better chance to be himself as he is now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"this movie is hillarious jackie chan does it again. jackie is awesome. i recommend this movie for every one"},{"rating":"2","title":"This machine surrounds hate and forces it to surrender.","review":"I consider this DVD a must-have for any Pete Seeger fan. He sings and plays entire songs, so it makes it great for musicians or people looking just to be entertained.

You'll have to buy his book \\"How to Play the 5-String Banjo\\" to get started. In this dvd he shows strumming styles, picking styles, how to make extra sounds with your left hand, and many other things. He plays many songs including \\"Ode to Joy\\", and a wonderful blues song...who woulda thunk, blues on the banjo? It is awesome.

The cases are randomly ordered.This all begs the question of the validity of the DSM or the usefulness of labeling people, but if you have to work within that system, this book will help get you up to speed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it.","review":"This was an optional text for my graduate Abnormal Psychology course, but I decided to go ahead and buy it anyway.

It calms me down when facing parenting issues and it provides hope. We all love our children, but a lot of times we are doing it in such a wrong way that we in reality push our children away and become negative forces in their development. That's why this book so stands out amongst all parenting books because the author's love for children and his profound wisdom on parenting is so evident throughout the book. He was so humble in his tone of writing that you don't feel condemned or pressured but just wanted to read on, read again and again and wish you could listen to him talk..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best and most well-rounded child training book I have re","review":"Of over a dozen child training books I have read, this is the best. Not only that it is full of Bible-centered wisdom, it actually put convictions in my heart on how to be a parent as God originally designed us to be. This is a God-send, so well-rounded in the areas of child training it covers. It does not just rest on the side of discplines nor does it just emphasizes on the role of love. It shows both the loving and righteous sides of our God in a good balance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not just print the script?","review":"Unlike the other books based on the TNT movies, I got nothing out of this book as a companion.

Peter David did a great job with \\"In the Beginning\\" of expanding on the film and really giving us material that could've been there if not for time constraints.Sheckley brings nothing interesting into \\"A Call to Arms\\" that enhances the story and much of the inner dialogue doesn't even seem like the characters.You might as well just watch the movie again if the basic story appeals to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing hack job","review":"Wow, this was bad. Sheckley has written some good stuff in his time, so I can only assume that he needed the money in a hurry and wrote this over a weekend. It's pretty much JMS's shooting script in novel form - there's certainly no character or plot insights (contrast this to Peter David's novelization of \\"Thirdspace\\", which was a mediocre TV movie, but a much better book). It's not been carefully edited, either - there are many places where word choice is poor, and a sentence or two that really are redundant. It's about the level of work one might expect from a moderately-talented highschool sophomore.Collectors of B5 books will want this, but I'd recommend others get the video - it's much better on film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low budget nightmare","review":"Doon't waste your money.

Bitter Apple does discourage our Havanese puppy from chewing on whatever we spray Bitter Apple on. She had a small wound on the tip of her tail which our vet told us would be difficult to heal because of its placement. He told us that chewing would be bad for the healing. She wanted to chew the spot so we would spray the tail every 12 hours and she stayed off of it. The tail is now healed. We also used it on a screen door that she wanted to chew on and that discouraged chewing as well. In addition she started tearing up the carpet near the tile juncture; spraying worked there, too. We have heard it does not work on some dogs but it was very effective with ours."},{"rating":"2","title":":D","review":"This is my favorite movie, and I'm so glad I bought it and it even came with a special edition cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rock, (...)","review":"This flick is carried by the charisma of THE ROCK. The plot, which centers around a 'recovery specialist' named Beck (THE ROCK) who is sent to the Amazon to collect the son of a mobster (SCOTT) who is on a treasure hunt, is solid at its base, but way too top heavy with silly fight scenes, hit or miss humor, and MTV style direction. This is one of those films that doesn't take itself seriously, hence the action/adventure angle is always on either side of the goofy line between funny and exciting. You can't help but like THE ROCK, there is something about him that captures your attention, but by the end of THE RUNDOWN, you feel slightly embarassed for him. It will be nice after a couple more movies to see him in full-on TOTAL RECALLish action mode. THE RUNDOWN isn't an awful film and does have a few entertaining moments, but must have looked a lot better on the printed page."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rock...rocks with action & laughs.","review":"I gave this movie two stars, but don't let that stop you from checking it out. If you like action, drama, hilarious laughs and fast pace...this is for you.I enjoyed it, but this is one of those movies that left me remembering the fight scenes, the funny scenes and the great performance of The Rock more so than what the movie was about. It didn't leave me wanting to remember why they were fighting, just that the fight was good. The comedy was not slap stick... just natural time & place humorous adventure.So if you are a Rock fan, like jungle adventure , action and want to laugh...this is a feel good kind of movie. There is a rhyme and reason to the plot, but so what."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"This is the HD version. My DVD player is HD but the DVD player does not read the disk.

Dwayne Johnson, Christopher Walken (haven't met anybody yet who doesn't like Christopher Walken!), Sean William Scott, Rosario Dawson... and Ernie Reyes Jr (He's unreal!

Just thinking about it makes me smile!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I have to say The Rock is a pretty good actor.

Reading the cover, I expected it to be the weakest of the three. Man, was I surprised. It's probably the best of the three! The Rundown has more humor and more action. It's easily the most fun to watch. The Rock is the next big action-adventure star so it's nice to see a brief cameo by Arnold Schwartzenager where he sort of passes the baton to The Rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable--Best \\"Guy\\" Movie in a While","review":"I had delayed watching Rundown because I assumed it would be poorly scripted with less than adequate actors. I finally got it when my dad and I wanted to watch a tough entertaining movie. We were definitely satisfied with Rundown. The Rock comes through solidly as an action figure--tough guy. His moves are good and his acting passes. The script is entertaning. Christopher Walken fills a gap lacking in many action movies. His character is ruthless but witty. The combination of actors and actresses gives a good balance, and the story is positive. If you are looking for a good action movie, check out Rundown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replay value is great!","review":"I recently bought the Rundown and I have been enjoying it ever since. The story is not too unique but it sure is exciting. Sometimes the old formula works well. Basically a bounty hunter named Beck is sent out to bring back the bossman's son. This bounty hunter is an aspiring chef. Now the chef part adds a new dimension to the character. The rest of the movie is a journey with Beck to bring back the biggest brathead treasure hunter on the planet. This guy even gets Beck beat half to death. It's funny and action packed! Seann William Scott proves to have good chemisty and physicality for action films not just American Pie gross out comedies.Of course, Christoper Walken adds a flavor that only he could add to this movie making it even more fun to watch! I would suggest this film for anyone who wants to have a good time packed with a punch! And just try and stop watching this film over and over again. I'm telling you the replay value is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"1) Some very funny things. Nice to see The Rock willing to do some comedy by making a fool of himself2) Christopher Walken was performing classic Walken dialog that just added the right touch3) Sean William Scott delivers his normal sense of humor to the screen4) Good action scenes5) Plot wasn't great...totally knew what was going to happen beforehand. Overused plot formula, but it was forgiveable because I didn't expect much to begin with and the actors and dialogue made up for it.OVERALL: Enjoyable movie. Worth watching at least once.

After 10 minutes I could take no more and shut it off. This piece of trash is an insult to the cinematic art form. On the other hand, if you know who \\"the Rock\\" is and are a fan, you might actually enjoy this.

The action sequences were good but other than that its a waste of time to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wack","review":"I love dude from American Pie (although B2K should've won the dance award) and the Roc is a major favorite (ever since that one episode of Punk'd), this movie was terrible. I fell asleep on it four times. The only good part was the beginning with the extremely gorgeous baseball player dealing with the ring. That's it. The rest of the movie was a little too cliche--eew, find a treasure. Great in bedtime stories, not good for two grown men who seem completely out of place in a jungle. I liked the short guy who talked about Ali \\"Float like a budda-fly\\" though. The humor wasn't even amusing because the movie was just too slow and far out for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lovely Rosario Dawson is the only highlight","review":"Rosario Dawson, who was the hot chick in Men in Black 2, is a co-star in The Rundown. She is the only reason why you should see this movie. Everybody else sucked.The action scenes are very watered-down. And Rock's fight scenes looked as fake as wrestling.This is a nice rental since it's better than the Scorpion King, but it is not worth buying to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rundown","review":"In order to get out of hock with mobster Billy Walker, restaraunteur-turned-\\"retrieval expert\\" Beck has to go down to Brazil and retrieve Billy's ne'er-do-well archaeologist-wannabe son Travis, who is searching for an ancient gold idol called the Gato del Diablo. This idol is prized by not only the local population as the path to their salvation, but by Cornelius Hatcher, slavedriving operator of the Helldorado mining town who oppresses said population in the name of profits, and Hatcher just won't let Beck leave with Travis.

I like to run and need a sports bra that will hold everything down so as not to cause pain. Well for me, this bra helped slightly it terms of upward motion, but not so much in terms of downward motion. The elasticity of the bra, which makes it relatively easy to put on, allowed the bust to peek out below. I found that rather uncomfortable. For just about every other type of exercise, it works just fine.And the funny thing was, the more I wore it, the more I liked it. I learned to put it on in a way where the peeking does not occur so much and can now use it on short runs. It is tight enough to minimize movement without being so tight that I'm sore afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shiny Seamless","review":"These are my favorite sports bras - they aren't so tight that they're difficult to put on, but they aren't loose either.

Instead of always keeping this mount in the sun, which can be pretty damaging out here, I would only install the mount and the Garmin on the occasions that I needed it. One day when I was using it, my Garmin came crashing down. One thing to note is sometimes you don't get a good suction. I thought this was the case this time, but when I went to reattach it, I saw that that part worked as promised (it sucked). Anyway, maybe the mount couldn't handle being taken off frequently or it couldn't handle the heat.

But there is no way that Mr. Poyer could keep me interested in his books for more than 20 pages. I don't know if its beause that out of 20 words 19 have to be naval terminology, or is that you must be on a naval ship in order to understand what's going on. Eventually at the end of each paragraph, I get a general idea of what the plot is. In \\"The Circle\\" I didn't feel any thrill at all and in \\"The Gulf\\" I was disapointed. It could be that Mr Poyer does not include much of what is going on in the other side of the battle. All we read is of the same seamen, the same officers, the same ship and eventually, it becomes very boring. I wish he would write like Tom Clancy. Mr Poyer has a lot of informaion.

As if there are ideas present, and they need to be fleshed out in order to make the story more coherent.As it--\\"Blind Man with a Pistol\\"--stands, it is a confusing mess. It was a task to read and finish.There are several plots or characters that are brought up, but never really resolved or delved into:-An old black man with mistresses that are nuns.-An African doctor who is killed.-A white man who comes to Harlem to sleep with black girl is killed-A radical black man who is in a relationship with a Swedish girl.-The first riot that occurs in the story.-The character Fat Sam.There is no character development, no one to latch onto.I am aware of Chester Himes and his other novels, specifically \\"Cotton Comes to Harlem\\" which was made into a film in the 1970s and \\"Rage in Harlem\\" which came out in the 1990s; \\"Blind Man...\\" didn't exactly cut it.I still am interested in Himes' other novels, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blind Man with a Typewriter","review":"For heavens sake, don't read this last book in Himes' Harlem detective series until you have read all the others. This last book is exactly how to kill a series. It's not a whole story at all. It's just three or four utterly unrelated pieces slapped together. Taken on their own, the individual pieces are good enough, and the opening chapter is gripping. The overall impression, however, is that Himes took unrelated pieces written when he was younger and slapped them together to make a final book. The racial politics also grows more radical and trite in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub Standard Quality","review":"I was looking forward to wearing this costume but was very unhappy on opening the box.

The chest is held in place by one strap of velcro on the back which does nothing to hold in place.3. The full mask was out of shape and did not fit correctly.4.

I would say that this cube is overallnot as durable as the regular rubik's cube, but thetiles are definitely better than the regular stickerone because they are unlikely to come off. Because ofthis, I would choose this cube over the others. I alsofound the fact that the cube can be easily taken apartand put back to together a great benefit, a lot easierthan the other one.

The quality is absolutely horrible. Yea, it has tiles, but it really does not make up for the poor quality of the cube mechanism. If you try to lube it with silicon, the pieces melt together.Seriously, spend a few extra dollars for a rubik's brand, or better yet, a DIY (do it yourself kit).

Carrie Preston was brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writers in Love with Their Cleverness","review":"There is a certain egotism in writing to display how clever one can be which is all that this movie leaves you with. The story is a copy of the standard fare of let's see how complex and unrealistic a plot we can flash forward/backward enough to create puzzlement in an attempt to show \\"clever\\" but which ends up being needlessly confusing.

They should have gotten Richard Gere instead.Fourth, I really, really don't like fluffy movies where the main characters end up with the short end of the stick.Fifth, if the main characters were truly professional spies then they would have planned for exactly what happened.The only two positive things I can say about this film are I rented it instead of buying it and Julia Roberts was great but Owen gave her almost nothing to play against."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to make Julia Roberts unattractive","review":"A \\"caper\\" about industrial espionage. Really? Yawn. However, this movie does accomplish something that will go down in movie history: the first time that filmmakers actually managed to make Julia Roberts unattractive.

There's a Great Story in Here Somewhere","review":"There was a great story buried in this movie.Somewhere.But this movie falls apart from poor editing. Coming in at 2 hours and 5 minutes, by tightening the story down to around 90 minutes, this would have been an excellent movie.Both my wife and I found the story-line confusing. Too many flash back and flash forwards, we often found ourselves saying to each other, \\"Now, WHEN is this scene happening?\\" (Good thing we watched this on DVD in our house ... I can't even imagine how much chattering there would have been in the theatre during this movie!)I was highly disappointed in this movie. The trailer looks good. I am a fan of Clive Owen, Tom Wilkinson, and Paul Giamatti. Not so much of Julia Roberts (but my wife likes her, so it's all good ...). It even had a pretty cool twist at the end.But the story was too confusing to follow.My recommendation: Save yourself 2 hours and skip this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAK IMITATION OF OCEANS ELEVEN TYPE FILMS","review":"Duplicity is a weak imitation of Oceans Eleven and other caper type films, with a couple standing in for the eleven, and duplicity clouding the waters at every turn. You're never really sure what is going on because you can't trust anyone, including writer-director Tony Gilroy. And you know the worst of it? I hate to say it, but Julia Roberts, one of my all-time favorite actresses, is starting to look a little worse for wear. I first noticed it in Oceans Eleven. I think she needs to start thinking about playing characters other than sexy, glamorous types. And Clive Owen is not a lot better. Any way you look at it, this is one weak film.Waitsel Smith"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neo-classic caper comedy","review":"This movie is kind of a new age caper movie...you know, where someone is scamming someone else. You have to watch it closely. I had to pause it halfway to explain who was doing what to whom to the better half.

BORING","review":"I love Julia Roberts. I love Clive Owen. I hate this movie. I could only get through 50 minutes of the 125 minute film. It was just too painful because its so boring. The dialogue felt really forced between the characters. I didn't feel like I was watching real people. Everyone is so busy trying to be clever and \\"cool\\" with every line that the focus of the plot becomes terribly lost. This is the first time I watched a Julia Roberts film that I couldn't finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd have to call it a waste of time.","review":"I'm with the negative reviews on this one. It keeps moving and the actors and scenery are attractive,but it doesn't add up to much. Maltin calls it a \\"shaggy dog story,\\" and Roger Ebert did like the acting whileadmitting that the plot is confusing - he said that even at the end, he wasn't sure that he understood everything.We recorded it from TV, then erased it. I'd suggest renting it. No way would I want to see this film again. My wife and I watched it over a 3 evening period, and finally just wanted to see how it ended, while hoping that it would indeed end sometime."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chemistry of the Leads Alone is Worth Seeing This For","review":"Rarely have two leads ever been brought together that have this much on-screen chemistry. I say this even realizing that Julia Roberts and Clive Owen were in \\"Closer\\" together and I think this film eclipses that. The story has one two many twists but the characters are so rich and the way in which some of the plot points play it out is just genius. Also, the dialogue is some of the best I've heard in any movie in the past few years which is important for a movie that is dialogue driven. This movie is definitely better than the two star ratings it has gotten on here so far. It's incredibly fun to watch and definitely worth a viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Duplicity\\" Double-Crosses Itself","review":"With the filmmaker behind \\"Michael Clayton\\" handling the eagerly anticipated reunion of Julia Roberts and Clive Owen, it sounds like \\"Duplicity\\" could not miss. Unfortunately, this contrived and overlong corporate-spy caper collapses at the starting gate. Writer-director Tony Gilroy botches a potentially clever premise while making Julia and Clive look incredibly boring! Gilroy's flat, gimmicky direction buries an excellent cast in a dialogue-heavy tomb. The repetitive double-crosses, flashbacks and flash-forwards become so monotonous that the \\"twist ending\\" has no punch whatsoever. A total misfire with more fatigue than intrigue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much slower than and very different from Bourne, yet watchable","review":"I think the writer/director of the Bourne series had set a very high expectation for all, even more so with the presence of Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. Sorry that fans of action thrillers like Bourne\\"s\\" and Taken will be disppointed. For those who can enjoy a classy romance with a good spy/agent plot (and shrewd script, too), better if you are a fan of Roberts or/and Owen, you will enjoy the film very much (perfect if you watch this with a glass of wine). Otherwise, please give this a pass. p.s.

Don't base your decision on renting or buying a movie by the moviecritic's I have found they have very bad taste in movies. As they gave this one high expectations-they are so wrong. They are just trying to keep Hollywood going.Not a thread of action in this movie. All Julia Roberts and Clive Owens did was Talk, Talk, Talk in this movie. At one point you just scream at the TV and tell them to shut up.The plot of the movie was totally boring. Rent it if you want a good nap.Not the way to come back for Julia Roberts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Surprise is the Ending","review":"One expects a lot more from actors such as these. This movie plot meanders around with flashbacks and forwards so much you don't know if you are coming or going.

Ending has a surprise but little fireworks by way of excitement, and then totally fizzles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unmemorable","review":"I can hardly remember it. Good looking people though I don't understand Owen's appeal beyond his looks. It's interesting he is now Hollywood buff where he was once British puny.

They tried to apply an Ocean's 11 type slickness, but the relationship itself could have been an interesting story if it was handled with more emotion. I liked the moving back and forth in time, but it was obvious there was a twist so that element lacked surprise. One of the bigger problems in this movie is that Julia Roberts' character is sophisticated and restrained, but in movies where I like her she is very emotional and the opposite of restrained!"},{"rating":"1","title":"conspiracy backfires","review":"I like both Clive Owen and Julia roberts, but this has got to be one of the worst movies for both of them, it is entertaining to be sure, but pulled by the hairs and spitting on himself Paul Giamatti and his sophisticated high tech goons are a disgrace to what could have been a neat scenario."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential...","review":"...and absolutely nothing to do with this movie. This was supposed to be a SLICK (am I saying this LOUD ENOUGH to the directo?) mouse-chasing-its-tail kind of movie. Instead, Julia Roberts falls in love. Instead, Clive is filled with doubt. Results: both are obviously suckered by the very people that hired them. From the very beginning, you can see that money is NOT the root of all evil; it's not even sex (though that's where the blame is being leveled). It's the idle mind; too bad neither character learned to think like the devil. If you don't trust anyone, you better trust yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH Dear LORD Make IT END!!!","review":"I am a HUGE Clive Owen fan and an even BIGGER Julia Roberts fan but this movie was hands down the most confusing and excruciatingly BORING movie I have ever watched.

Don't bother with this one folks...it's REALLY not worth the money, and even more importantly, NOT WORTH YOUR TIME! The editing stinks, the plot is completely lost with all of the back and forth in the timeline, and shockingly there is little if any chemistry between the two leading characters...how this is possible with such good looking actors is beyond me!

It basically annoyed me from the beginning with the several screen shots at the same time, which I understand some might see as more challenging and artistic.

It's a good spy story, with lots of twists and turns, and the mixing of present/past slowly reveals more details about what's happening. However, the acting leaves a lot to be desired. Julia Robert's character seems very flat and there is no chemistry between her and Clive Owen. I had just seen Clive Owen in \\"The International\\" and he was much better in that movie. Paul Giamatti's portrayal of a crazy CEO that's willing to do anything to crush his competitor was actually one of the only highlights. Overall, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't click","review":"Characters weren't right for each other, bad casting.

As soon as she asked for advice, this title came to mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance of Anger","review":"Dr. Lerner shows how to work through anger instead of acting out or reacting to it. Very helpful for resolving inner conflict and finding the source of anger. The insights are enlightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be compulsory reading for every woman!","review":"What an eye opener! I highly recommend it to all women. It's like seeing suddenly your blind spots - sometimes not pretty but what a relief to understand yourself better, to understand why we do what we do.

Thank your for writing it, Mrs. Lerner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful resource for both men and women.","review":"Dr. Lerner provides some excellent information on how anger influences our lives on a daily basis, particularly in interpersonal relationships.

There is so much wordiness. The real-life stories/examples the author shares are way too long and repetitive. I wish it was more concise and to the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent BOOK. A MUST BUY!","review":"This book is an absolute MUST HAVE. I have learned that Anger is not a bad thing or a good thing: It simply is. I love how the writer puts this issue of anger in the form of a dance, it really does make total sense and it helps you to put a practical application to something that is not tangible like Anger. I plan on reading this book again, because there is so much here that I know I'll learn something new the next time I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great--even for guys","review":"I bought this on my own...No \\"help\\" from any significant other.

Any one who likes shoegaze should have a lot of respect for this band. I love this album and it is so good to see bands like this who are keeping Noise Rock alive! The guitar sounds are loaded with tons of cool effects peddals, the drums are heavy and very robotic, and the vocals are smooth and dreamy. This band is of course influenced by different Shoegazer bands like MBV, but I think they certainly have their own sound. Don't listen to the other reviews that tell you they rip off other bands.

The band certainly has potential. But I can't shake the feeling that this album has been sitting in a vault since 1995, and that it was recently discovered by a producer who liked it and wanted to make it sound modern by remixing it using Nigel Godrich-esq producing techniques. The \\"modern\\" aspects of this are grafted so awkwardly onto the \\"retro\\" aspects that it's a bit tough to listen to at times. Nice try though. There's far worse out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"for the totally clueless only","review":"if you are oblivious to all the creation bands in the early nineties--and a little outfit called sonic youth--this will blow your mind. almost every riff is copped from the aforementioned band or era, and there isn't a single haunting, memorable melody here. i'm amazed that people are even remotely interested in this pap. it's terrible and oh so cynical. you're obviously interested in indie(ish) pop music so i'm going to refer you to some bands to investigate instead (really GOOD bands): THE SWIRLES, THE LILYS (early), THE BLACK WATCH, SLOWDIVE, THINKING FELLERS LOCAL UNION 242, and THE CHURCH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, is right","review":"If your into music for musicianship this is not your album.

Being a huge fan of musicals, the show was a real disappointment. However, it is a good play and I would recommend seeing it live if you ever get the chance. In my opinion, the performers were actors who could carry a tune, not singers. The songs are oversimplified and the recurring \\"Marilyn Monroe\\" theme drove me crazy.

If you read the reviews, you would think this bag is huge. Well it's not! It can barely pass for a medium size. There's no zipper whatsoever, and it's flimsy. You have to be careful when opening the flap where the buttons are because it can rip off. I think the only good thing about this is the material. It's soft, and can probably withstand some rough wear. Don't buy this if you're looking for space and reliability, you can buy a better bag at a Korean gift store!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bag","review":"Pros: Strap is easily adjustable. The side pockets are plenty big for a smart phone, pad of paper, glasses, etc. Placement of pockets and the over feel is very natural.This is a very floppy bag. There are no rigid parts, so you can easily fold it up to almost nothing, or cram a change of clothes into it.To consider: If you carry an electronic device, you'll want a case around it, or some padding. The bag provides no protection whatsoever. The magnetic clasps are pretty strong. You have to give a good yank to free them. The two zippers require two hands because there is no frame to pull against. But the zippers are on small compartments. I don't use them much (one stays open all the time, the other closed).This would be a good 'extra' bag - when you know you need more bags coming back than you do going. It also seems like someone who is into modding (embroidery, drawing, patches, etc.) would like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Bag","review":"My bag just arrived today. I bought mine in the color black. I couldn't believe the amount of space inside this bag! The soft material is very lightweight which keeps the shoulder strap from tugging on my shoulder (Unlike my old messenger bag which was a thicker sturdy material but was really heavy on the shoulder, especially when carrying contents inside). The downside of this bag being lightweight material is that it doesn't stand up on it's own when you put it down. You have to lean it against something or lay it down. But who cares. It has two zipper compartments inside, one small and the other large. Also, it has slim cellphone/cigarette pockets ON BOTH ENDS OF THE BAG. Now that's cool. Overall, I'm happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bag is good","review":"This bag is very good for it uses. The long strap is great and the size is ideal for everyday use.

Its not one of his greatest but it is a fine book. A young man suffering from an emotional shock is being manipulated by 2 groups. The first group is made up of friends who want to see him married. The second group is headed by a Catholic priest who wants to see the young man converted and return the Abbey* property back to the Church. [*Lands which were taken from the Church by Henry the VIII in the 16th century and given to the young man's family.] The 2 groups working against each other make the book humorous in the beginning. It only turns tragic later on with a somewhat happy ending.It is one of Collin's shorter works and well worth reading. If this book was being written in modern times. A fictional cult would be created, but the Roman Catholic Church is useful for the plot because of its views on marriage and divorce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now that's more like it.","review":"Yesterday I wrote a review about the cd tittled Time shifter by Mr. Hidalgo.

The cable is only about 2 feet long so its only long enough to sit on top of the PC which isn't too safe because it could fall. The car charger is cheap because earlier today the thing burned out and when I noticed it the thing was very hot to touch. I had to pull it out of the dc outlet with a napkin! I'm starting to question Pelicans accessories especially since the recall of the power brick now this.

The seams on the bottom of the bag have now come open, and I still haven't used it that much in the 2 years I've had it. My advice: spend a little extra and get a bag that's made to last.I've used this bag only a little in the 2 years I've had it. A few trips to the gym -- wish I'd made more! But even with light use, the zippered pouch has come unstitched. This isn't too surprising... they sewed it onto the mesh, so there's 50% less contact area for the thread.Anyway...

I use it to hold my swim gloves, cap, earplugs, and goggles. It can hold a lot of stuff but I use it to hold the damp stuff so nothing gets moldy or smelly. The top closes when you pull the drawstring handles (no zip) though there is a little zippered pouch to hold keys or I.D. on the front. I don't put my swim fins in as I don't want it to rip (not sure if they're too heavy.) A really nice bag that weighs nothing and keeps your stuff in one place.

It's the perfect size and shape and even sits just right when it is slung on your back. It fits snugly on your back even full with notebooks, pens and a water bottle with the bottom of the bag barely resting any lower than the small of your back. I would buy another in a heartbeat if they would fix the glaring issue with this bag.The bottom is made of a very cheap nylon and therefore is prone to ripping particularly on the seam where it started. After just a few months of being used daily to carry three 120 page note books, a 32oz water bottle and a handful of pens the nylon torn and now has a fist sized hole, right across the seam. Had they continued the durable mesh fabric across the bottom I doubt I would have any issues. Currently I have duct tape covering the nylon on the bottom and the adjacent seams on an otherwise flawless bag to see if the simple change in fabric was the culprit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worth it","review":"I was trying to get a bag for cheep and you get what you pay for here. The bag is kinda annoying because it slips around when you try and put it on so one strap always ends up being way larger than the other. Also where the straps get attached to the bottom of the bag it ripped the bottom and it is slowly getting larger. I bought two because the price was so good and it happened to both bags.

That means if I put my earbuds in there, they are getting dirtied by my shoes in the main part of the bag.- Straps are too small to wear as a backpack when the bag is full.. made for a child really.- Not really that big as the other reviews seemed to indicate. It's a tight fit for my shoes, a pair of shorts, and weight lifting gloves.- Mesh is very thin.Also, I don't think all the pictures on this page are for the same item. As you will see, some appear to be very dense soft mesh like a pair of gym shorts. My buddy has one like this and its very nice.

This bag started falling apart on day 4 of school! As a 2nd grader, there was very little weight in the bag during its 4 day lifespan so I know it was not due to the load it carried.

It is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I understand the bag is cheap so you really can't expect a lot but this leaves a lot to be desired.- The draw string and the shoulder straps are one piece going to each side making it hard to have the straps even when you wear it. I gave up after a few tries to even them and just hold it on one shoulder.- The draw strings are so snug in the pull top that the bag does not open very well. Seems minor but when you enter and leave the gym and you spend time tugging on the bag to open and close it becomes irritating.- After about one and a half months going to the gym the bottom of one of the straps where the mesh connects to the solid bottom of the bag had a blow out. I walk the half mile to and from the gym with an iPad and a pair of gym shoes in the bag so nothing heavy to cause a blow out and I had to have it repaired.All in all this bag is not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not hold up","review":"After one month of use, the bag started to rip by the straps.

I bought this CD mainly for the Shostakovich, a harrowing work that he completed only weeksprior to his death that he suspected he was near to. The 3rd (and final) movement is an Adagio that here lasts14:38. The other two movements are 8:12 & 6:58 (per my CD player), for a total time of 30:01, including pausesbetween movements. This is the fastest of the extant recordings I am aware of, but, reportedly, Shostakovichpreferred faster tempos for his music than are commonly played.

But the setting is murky Vichy France during WWII under the nasty German occupation. Not only is the plot intriguing, the characters well drawn, the writing intelligent, the suspense sustained. But the real benefit is the impeccable historical accuracy, the description of the social and cultural forces, and the terrible realities of occupation.

He was also an excellent outdoor chef, stemming from his childhood upraising on the northwest coast of the United States in the early 20th Century, all of which is detailed in the book.Beard's techniques are copiously noted herein and the volume is quite readable.

Several years ago, I read an entire series by this duo. After the first two books, the writing came off as repetitive, using the same words in each book to describe the main characters.In my experience, predictable writing such as this is acceptable, for a period.

The production is simple yet well arranged and effective and never becomes monotonous thoughtout the whole CD. All the artists comes in with confidents, solid deliveries and livens things up even more. Their flows are polished and they all raps with passion which shows that they really feels what they are talking about on each track. Overall, I'm feeling this and the message is positive with out being preachy which makes it a pleasant listening experience.

It did, but it was nothing I couldn't have gotten from their Web site.Buy the Eyewitness Guide to Amsterdam, which is organized by area. It's visually pleasing and really helps you decide what you would like to do. The Time Out guide is organized by topic (for example, Accommodations, Restaurants, Art and Entertainment), and it's impossible to tell where these things are in relationship to where you are or where your hotel is. There are maps in the back of the book that are helpful, and I do like how for many of the topics they list the \\"Top Five\\".

The common, affordable, and easier to keep turtles and tortises are given short shrift in this book.

However if you bought this book after you bought the turtle it doesn't really tell you much more than turtles are aquatic and tortoises live on land as well as basic diet overviews.Also the species profiles in this book are not worth the paper they are written on, you would be better off finding a care sheet written by a experienced keeper on the internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"even as a novice I find many mistakes","review":"I can't even make it through this book because of all the errors in it--many bad suggestions on habitats and food for example.

Maybe in the context of her day it might have made a little more sense, but not in this day and age.

It's much better to read some kind of atheist propaganda against God than this book. Deceiving harmful for all Christians.

Mrs. Eddy, the book's author, says that it is never God's will for us to be sick or sinful. That we have divine authority to rise above these problems and be conquerors, *because* God is all good!Mrs. Eddy proved these ideas in her own life and then wrote this book so she could teach others what she had learned.This book changed my life because it really introduced me to God and showed me that He never would create anything that would hurt His beloved child.

During the last moments of the approach, the flight crew failed to monitor the airplane's airspeed and allowed it to decrease to a dangerously low level -- as low as about 50 knots below the company's recommended approach airspeed -- and to remain below the recommended approach airspeed for about 50 seconds.

Much of the book is devoted to fawning praise. Far from a rational scientific approach to the death, the authors' outrage that Wellstone died shines through all else and taints their supposed scientific rigor.The authors have been investigating for years. If they have proof that Senator Wellstone was assassinated they should take it to either the United State Attorney or the St. Louis County Minnesota attorney so that a grand jury can be convened and indictment(s) returned Of course, they haven't done that because they have no answer to the simple question, \\"Who did it?\\"The evidence of assassination presented by the authors is about as substantial as the soup made from the shadow of a dead sparrow.

I ended up wood gluing the legs back together, adding wood shims and extra screws to fix them. Each front leg is only held together by two bolts into very soft wood. I weigh 180 lbs and I feel like have to be very careful sitting down in them. I seriously doubt they would hold a bigger person. One chair had the holes drilled in the wrong spot in the back.

I even love the parts when Gwen Verdon is talking to \\"Dutchie\\" during the songs. This music reminds me of Rogers and Hammerstein in it's fun,lively beat and hysterical lyrics. If you love those kind of musicals, say like Oklahoma or Carousal, you will love this. It's an older one without all the high tech engineering, but I love the vintage sound and innocence.

The author intimates, but does not divulge many, harsh Nun disciplines; but dispensed fairly to all. There are interesting notes about playing chess, learnt from his father; the whispered myth that a Jew would convert into a Christian and become Pope -- with the author learning many Catholic prayers by heart, in Latin, fanning hopes for such a possibility; snippets of fervent Nazi anti-Jew, anti-Catholic actions (\\"Jesus was a Jewish child...\\" as the Nazis murder a priest).

However, since Corel trashed PSP support, they never bothered to notify PSP9 users that a patch was available - even if you had properly registered your software.My advice is to stay away from PSP9 (and any other Corel software) until they realize that good tech support is a major reason for continued customer loyalty and subsequent growth in sales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, easy, and GREAT","review":"Paint Shop Pro 9 is my first professional photo software.

It's so much like Photoshop or earlier versions of Paint Shop Pro that I use tutorials for them on PSP 9 most of the time. One small problem, though, is that brushes on the internet are mostly for PSP 7 and 8. It took me months to find a forum that explained how to convert them to PSP 9 format. Other than that, this is better than any other program I've used a trial for and worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great program","review":"Love computers and love photography and this program is at a good price with some pretty high tech tools. It is amazing what can be done with an even average photograph. Now looking to go to a higher end Canon digital 20D because of the great results with Paint shop pro 9. Only concern is the frequency of upgrades. Purchased Version 9 and three months later version 10 is out with very little incentive to upgrade. I have had three versions of Jasc Paint shop pro and it seems like I am paying close to retail every time(even though it is reasonable priced at retail).There are still a few tools that could be improved: Selection tool and combining/resizing images."},{"rating":"1","title":"would not buy it","review":"I did not buy this book because the Look Inside pages put me off.

The title track is as heavy as he ever got---as it should be, considering that it's Led Zeppelin (minus Robert Plant) backing him! There's also the lovely \\"Jennifer Juniper\\" and a host of lesser-known songs that are some of his best; the droning \\"Perigrine,\\" the mysterious \\"River Song,\\" the swingy \\"As I Recall It\\" and the very pointed (for him!) \\"Hi, It's Been A Long Time.\\" Of course, if you can't get into Donovan's shtick of that time, this'll sound like, well, shtick.

The number is correct (1-6) but the list of stories on 3 and 5 are swapped and 4 and 6 are swapped.

I'm not up on the history of Miss Marple, but my vibe was this was the book that introduced her. It was first published in 1933. And I can see why it made Miss Marple famous, as there is something endearing and captivating about her. Agatha Christie strikes again. The only down-side I found to the book, however, and it's a relatively minor one, is that the endless numbers of unsolved murders and serious crimes without one tiny group of average people risk becoming ludicrous at a certain point. But if you can handle that, which it's not so hard to do, then the book's still a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Heaven There is No Beer........","review":"That's why we brew it here!Iodophor is a proven no-rinse sanitizer that makes brew day so much easier.

There's not quite as much humor in it as in some of the others, but there are still plenty of laughs (one of my main motivations for reading his work). The information in this book fascinated me.

A 15 year-old friend enjoyed it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy history","review":"I bought this book under a misapprehension. Bryson is a journalist and he is not diligent about researching his statements. He makes statements about words in other languages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Bryson is tops!","review":"I have everything Bill Bryson has ever written....I think. He is a brilliant writer, his sense of humor is superbly funny. There are facts that surprised me, that edified my repertoire of words and just made me laugh. Only one thing wrong with Bill Bryson. He doesn't write enough books to satisfy my craving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not trust the facts in this book","review":"This book is a quick read -- entertaining and light -- but no one should trust the facts that are tossed around in it. Bryson's knowledge of languages other than English is shaky at best, and he makes countless mistakes in his various attempts at translation. He also has a very superficial understanding of grammar (as evinced by Chapter 9). On p. 142, he claims that petroleum has both Latin and Greek roots, \\"(Latin petro + Greek oleum),\\" but it is the opposite: petra is Greek and oleum is Latin. Not a big deal of course, but this book is literally peppered with inaccuracies such as this one. I wish someone had fact-checked this book, because it could have been a valuable tool. As it is, the information is often imprecise, or just plain wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyable fiction. Fact it is not.","review":"Although the book has some entertaining segments, the severity of the errors in it makes me wonder just what the author considers research. The chapter on swearing claims that Finnish has no swearwords, and that Finns have therefore chosen the word \\"ravintolassa\\", meaning \\"in the restaurant\\", for use as an obscenity. This is utterly ridiculous. A professional should have kept in mind that native speakers of the less widespread languages of the world enjoy comic relief by teaching foreigners nonsense words as swearwords, and obscene phrases as confessions of love. Even as a second-language speaker of English, I found flaws in his depictions of dialects, flaws which many reviewers have cited before me. The author seems to have researched his book with a beer in hand, never bothering to double-check any of his information. If viewed as fiction, this book has its moments. Fact it is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Error after error bordering lying","review":"I was suspicious of many tales Bill Bryson tells in this book but didn't bother to verify because I read the book mostly during commute so it wasn't the most convenient thing to do. But when I reached the part when he talks about Chinese my suspicion was confirmed. See, Chinese is my first language. It appears that Bill Bryson is more interested in embellishing and exaggerating than writing a good book.This is not the only Bill Bryson book I had to put down part-way. It seems to be a problem with the author and not any particular subject he happens to be writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slap-dash, badly written book","review":"I love the writing of Bill Bryson and so it pains me to pan him but this book, while absolutely delightful, does play fast and loose with the facts. It feels like dear Bill put more of his energies into being clever and amusing rather than knuckling down to some hard research. An example? Bryson states that \\"Estimates of the number of languages in the world usually fix on a figure of about 2,700...\\" Ethnologue currently lists 6912 living languages in the world. I doubt that 4200+ languages were discovered between 1990 (when this was originally published) and today.I picked this up because I've really enjoyed Bryson's other works, especially his first-person travelogues. I think I'd better stick with those. I wish I hadn't invested in this."},{"rating":"1","title":"An enjoyable work for a non-specialist.","review":"Bryson's writing style is thoroughly entertaining, but the book is lacking in factual support. Particulary disturbing among the many errors of fact is the statement that languages apart from English do not have and do not need thesauri. This is simply not true, and implies that the English language is somehow superior to other languages, although Mr. Bryson claims to disagree with this belief. This could be due to poor research on his part, as Mr. Bryson apparently does not speak any foreign languages and therefore would not have any personal basis for comparison. It is regrettable that Mr. Bryson's enthusiasm could not be coupled with a corresponding amount of accuracy. Perhaps the author will revise and correct his work for future publications. (And for those who are interested in another mix-up, Mons is the French name for the city in Southern Belgium, and Bergen is its Flemish Dutch name. In the book, the names were reversed.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not everybody should write a book on language","review":"Sadly, Bill Bryson is most definitely not qualified. The book is sloppily researched all over, and Bryson's cheerleading for English as in some way superior to most other languages is tiring.Makes one doubt the quality of the information given in a work as A short history of nearly everything, which I thoroughly enjoyed at the time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill Does It Good","review":"Bill Bryson is a writer of fiction in many ways. You must always pause and wonder if what he is telling you is actually true. The Mother Tongue is classic Bryson. Chalk full of stories, anecdotes and questionable facts but so amusingly presented that you just can't resist. Sometimes you'll chuckle at his wit and other times you'll laugh at his inaccuracies but you'll have a fabulous time. Just don't quote him"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to read- -sloppy scholarship","review":"This book consists of a series of essays about various aspects of English. On the whole, the book is well-balanced between describing British and North American varieties of English. The writing style is quite fluid and the book is, for the most part, very enjoyable to read. However, Bryson was not always careful about the quality of his scholarship; he often gets his facts confused or repeats \\"factoids\\" that are known to be false. On page 14, for instance, he makes reference to the old Eskimo snow vocabulary myth, claiming that Eskimos have 50 words for snow (see The Great Eskimo Snow Hoax for a more accurate account). On p. 107 he manages to associate the Martha's Vineyard pronunciation research with Trudgill instead of Labov. Since he makes so many errors, a reader can't tell for certain whether the remaining material is trustworthy. Readers of this book may find themselves more misinformed than informed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever wonder why is English screwed up?","review":"If so, this is the book for you. Bryson takes you on a humorous and fascinating journey through the history of English, and explains the sources of many idiosyncrasies of the language, including odd spellings, irregular verbs, plural nouns like mouse/mice, and more. If you have ever felt stupid because you couldn't remember whether to spell something with ie or ei, this is the book for you -- your self-esteem will improve after reading this book: It isn't your fault, it's this crazy language!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mother Tongue","review":"A friend lent this book, knowing of my interest in language(s). I was sort of taken aback just from reading the bloody cover, which avers that English has more than 300 million speakers (can't remember the exact wording, but the number is correct, except that it's not even close to correct. What about India, e.g.?And then to read that the word schadenfreude gives an insight into Teutonic sensibilities? Good grief!

What I most enjoy about her mysteries is that romance is present but doesn't overshadow the mystery of the story. Here there are two men involved in the life of the heroine, Kate Tempest, as she is trying to find out what happened to the Italian child who disappeared while Kate was escorting her across Europe. As usual in Eden books, the resolution of the mystery slowly unfolds for both the main character and the reader.

Mullally, this \\"hero\\" has nothing whatsoever to recommend him. On the carriage ride home after the visit to the king he says such horrible insulting things to our heroine that I would never have forgiven him, much less worked for him another minute, no matter what he threatened to do if she quit. And marry him? Rather take the hangman's noose than this obnoxious, bloated, aristocratic bag of wind. He actually states that she's not good enough to marry to her face. Throughout his entire tirade, none of it deserved by her in any way I might add, I found myself actually growing sick to my stomach at his cold, cruel, and completely merciless attack on her character.Nothing he did afterward improved my opinion of him.

Here, Wilson provides examples of everything from apparitions to physical transfer across continents of a person, to scientific study of unexplained phenomena.

Not a mere impersonator but a true protege, like Dvorak was to Brahms in classical romantism, perhaps.

He was a singer, composer, lyricist... an intertainer in his own right!

Any time you pick it up to use it, it will be left covered with VERY visible smudges and fingerprints. There is just no way around it.

The jokes are overused, and lag behind his other work to begin with. For completists, however, this is a must-have; it clearly shows how his brand of humor and style of writing has evolved to where it is today, making it interesting in a way Clevinger probably never intended it.A good stress test to see if you'd enjoy this book is this: load up his comic, then read 25 or 30 of them at a stretch.

I found the story to be a decent enough mystery, although the ending seemed to be more of a fizzle than a climax, and the introduction of the main villain at the end being a character which had not really been dealt with throughout the book was to say the least confusing. The books biggest flaw, I thought, was the inclusion of the constant feminist commentary.

I found Peters dialogue annoying. Her husband's constant use of \\"Errrr\\" and \\"Hmmm\\" and the son's supposedly comical verbosity got on my nerves. The characters were extremely one dimensional and very unlikable.

Sorry loyal fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down","review":"There were so many wonderful possibilities and none came to fruition. The greatest part was seeing the family back together and having Ramsesback in the action - unfortunately that was not enough. Perhaps the lack of a compelling antagonist was what made this novel a flop... or perhaps the mystery was boring... or perhaps it was the fact that though it could have been an emotionally charged, possibly exciting, even highly romantic novel, it was not. I made myself read this to the end in the hopes that Sethos would rescue it... this was sadly not the case. Not sure if I'll continue reading this series because this one was such a disappointment. Part of me wants to continue because I'm curious about Ramses - his character is just a lot of fun but I'm beginning to wonder if the last novel may have been the best.

It is a heavy pack, and for that reason I have not used it, as I have not really gotten back into shape since having the baby. I would say this is a great pack for someone who is athletic and is going to use it enough to make it worth the extra money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"My daughter is 2 years old -- we received this carrier as a baby shower gift but didn't start using until last summer. I would guess that we've used it once a month for local hikes and then twice for week long vacations. The weight bearing straps that the adult wears have started to separate from the body of the carrier. My daughter weighs about 30 pounds ... well within the weight limit. Snugli (Evenflow) only provides a 90 day warranty on this item and won't do anything about it. We have a 6 month old too and I had hoped to be able to use this carrier for both kids but it seems unsafe as it is now. Stay clear of this product & look for a different backpack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belt Support Broken While Using","review":"I love this back pack design, but the belt support is clearly not as durable as it should be. I have owned it for a few months, but only used it about 10 times around the house. My son is about 20 lbs and there has been no extreme use or wear and tear. There is a plastic flat piece that is the back middle of the belt support. It has holes stamped in it to allow the belt support to be raised or lowered. As I was walking with my son, I pulled to tighten the belt and the whole plastic part split in half. This left the entire belt support split in half (see customer photo). I will be contacting Evenflo for a replacement and will update this review based on their support."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Love It!","review":"Our boy will be a year old next weekend and we bought this backpack a few days ago. We went for a walk around the block to test it out and he LOVED it! He was up so high, could see everthing, and I could tell he was very comfortable. Tons of padding, tons of storage (removeable if need be) and I have no complaints at all about it. It's definitely worth the money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not quite what I'd expected","review":"I was looking for an around-town carrier. I think this is really more of a hiking backpack.

In it's defense I must say my daughter loves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE OF SHOULDER PAIN!","review":"Initially, I thought a great purchase, but after an hour with a 20 lb. baby on my back - my upper shoulders and neck starting to kill me! It feels like a bar is stabbing me across my shoulder blades - I simply can't take wearing this thing for more than 30 minutes. The baby was safe and comfortable, but the wearer has to walk hunched forward, as it's a weird center of gravity shift. Maybe it's because I'm 5'4\\" and my husband is over 6 feet tall - but we both agreed that chiropractors should be the only people pushing this product - as it will definitely increase business for them! Buy something else - skip this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"returned it after 2 weeks","review":"We had search on the web for a while before we made the trip to overseas, and before we went for our trip a month ago, we bought the Cross Terrain Carrier, we would say that the price is reasonable as it is so many pads surround me, and my hubby. My daughter loves to sit inside it as well. However, the bottom support is very weak, even my daughter is only 21 lbs, it is difficult to secure, so my daughter always falls into the bottom of the carrier, that makes her arms very sore. Also, after 2 weeks, the back support nylon tore apart... RIGHT BEFORE OUR TRIP.... we became very upset and return it to Babyrus right away. Finally, we have to use stroller and normal infant carrier instead.. if anyone can find another good product, please share opinion as we will have another overseas trip at X'mas time this year.."},{"rating":"1","title":"not durable","review":"After owning the Evenflo Snugli Cross Terrain for slightly over a month, the waist strap tore off. This is because the soft material in the back that holds the waist strap to the backpack is made of a weak material. Without the waist strap to evenly distribute weight onto the hips, then I would have to carry my toddler with all the weight on my shoulders, which defeats the purpose of spending so much money on a baby carrier.Also, the \\"sun shade\\" is cumbersome and it doesn't fold into the pockets, and it has to be manually removed prior to taking the baby in or out of the carrier.Unfortunately, the Evenflo Snugli Cross Terrain is one of the highest rated baby carriers made (according to Consumer Reports) so there are not any good alternatives. I've given up on the carrier concept and gone back to strollers until someone can make a durable carrier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have!","review":"This is a great product!!

Our baby loves going on hikes/busy market places."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have a life again!","review":"We sprung for the deluxe(99.00) model Snugli Cross Terrain backpack (more padding, along with other improved features). You can use it from the time the babies are sitting up until they are 3 (which seems the longest time to use any baby item!). My 6 month old loves it...never cries...enjoys everything from our perspective. I can walk two dogs with her...I can do a day of walmart and grocery shopping without my infant shedding a tear. The other day and she just feel asleep on my back...like in a little pappoose. It is so nice to go grocery shopping and to be able to leave your cart--baby always with you...and she interacts with all the people because they are at her level, so she never feels left out. My back is sore after having her on at first, but if you use it often you just get stronger. I feel she is safe and secure in it, and happy! I bought it after reading these reviews. HIGHLY RECCOMMEND!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun!","review":"This carrier is wonderful and worth the money. My 11 month old daughter loves it. She is so content in it and very comfortable. It fits both my husband and myself very well and is very comfortable.

It is extremely comfortable for him and it does go ANYWHERE. I ride the subway and take the stairs and am healthier for it. He is much less likely to get fussy when shopping, etc and I even use it to do housework on his clingy days. Note of [...] although the waist support is adjustable for height, it doesn't stay secure and slips, and the carrier rests below the rear end region making it off balance and uncomfortable. It is difficult to keep it in place for my 5'3\\" frame, and have to readjust periodically. Otherwise it is very spacious and even with the extra weight easy to carry even on all day walks. My 1 year old has even learned to nap in it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST!","review":"I have used this backpack for 3 of our children. It is wonderful! It takes most of the weight of the baby off your shoulders and puts it on your waist. Our babies and toddlers had no trouble falling asleep...and staying asleep in this carrier. It makes trips to the grocery store and pretty much anywhere a breeze.I would have to disagree with one of the other reviewers about getting the cross country instead to save on price. It is not the same by far, though it looks similar. It is more narrow from front to back so there is less room for baby. Also, it doesn't stay opened nicely for you to put the baby in it like this one does. I found it uncomfortable in comparison. I like the way this carrier is easy to put on by yourself. I have had no trouble. There are many straps but really only 2 that you need to use regularly. The chest strap is most important for the person carrying it. It really relieves the pressure on your back when buckled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Tuna","review":"I bought a case of two flavors of the SAFCOL tuna and I have been very please with the taste and quality of the items."},{"rating":"1","title":"tuna with a sickly sweet taste....","review":"After trying some of the bumblebee flavored tunas and a few of the starkist ones I really hoped that this would be as good. I was wrong. To start out with the tuna in the can is not even close to the others quality. The other brands are more of a fillet stamped out and canned. This is tiny chuncks crammed into a can with a sickly sweey sauce. I would guess it is about 60% tuna 40% sauce. I like sweet chili sauce.... I like tuna.... I dont like this though.UPDATE: --- I thought I had come up with a good way to get rid of this tuna. I would feed it to my dog. My dog (which loves tuna) just refused to eat this. I guess she would rather eat dogfood than this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For My Taste","review":"I had high hopes for this product, especially since the calorie count and fat content are very good. However, I ended up being disappointed. The tuna is not as dense and packed much wetter than other brands. I also did not like the favor, which I found more sweet rather than chili sauce. The sweet chili flavor was not for my taste.

However, the movie had a lot of funny parts in it. It was also interesting to see how the working-half lived: their houses, their lifestyles, etc.The actors all played their parts well, and it was fun to see Stephen Lewis in his role as the tormented inspector, after seeing him as \\"Smiler\\" in The Last Of The Summer Wine. Lewis actually wrote several episodes in this bus series.And, Wendy Richard--\\"Miss Brahms\\" on Are You Being Served?--has a small, but distinctive role, in this film. She looks a bit different, but you can recognize her face and voice. Pamela Cundall, who made a guest appearance on AYBS? later, features prominently in this movie, as one of the busdrivers.The setting is a bit below BBC standards, but it is an enjoyable excursion, nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"ON THE BUSES","review":"First of three feature length movies that were adapted from the popular British 1970's sitcom and is easily the best. The film is entertaining along the way but again it comes across as one long ponderous extended T.V sketch. The basic plot line revolves around a bunch of women bus drivers causing the male bus drivers outrage with the men believing that women are not up to being bus drivers. Ususal double entrendes and comic misunderstanding but the sexist treatment of the script handicapps the film slightly with it coming across as very dated. However Reg varney and Anna karen sparkle in their roles and have some of the funniest lines to deliver. Apart from that it's enjoyably about average. If you asked me the same question about 15 years ago, I would have said excellent, but it's now just innocent, old fashioned fun and games.

Don't take my word for it, seeing is believing!I chose the Panasonic and have been very pleased with it.Don't get caught up in the Optical Zoom hype...who cares if the optical zoom is 16x, 18x, 20x, if the picture is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tape transport noise","review":"The camcorder I bought suffers from noise in the tape transport mechanism (a purring noise that makes the camera sound like an 8mm projector and gets recorded on tape).

You must have a working knowledge of Greek though, no transliteration here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easier than the real thing","review":"These tests are nice confidence boosters but not an accurate guage of the actual MCAT. I found the passages tamer and questions easier than the real thing. The answers are a bit skimpy on details too. I also think their scoring chart is a little generous - deduct two points (per section) from theirs to get a better idea of how you'd have fared if it'd been the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth buying","review":"This book is not really indicative of the real MCAT I took. It's great if you want to gain some confidence before the test but the sample tests are too simple. This book is really contradictory to the Princeton classes b/c everything in there is really hard. Overall, I wouldnt recommend neither the class nor this book. If you must, take Kaplan or buy a bunch of practice tests and just work on them. I increased my score from a 14 to a 32 after taking about 20+ practice exams over the course of 6 months. It's about stamina and strategy and lots of science knowlege."},{"rating":"1","title":"warning!","review":"This is a really great selection of tunes, BUT, if you listen to the samples you'll notice the music drags in tempo, which also means their voices sound slower too.

Well, I was screaming in rage 1 day later as I finished the book. The phantom had no heart what-so-ever and was the cruelest thing in the whole Paris Opera House! I wanted to rip this book apart! He was a monster, inside and out. Well, in the musical, I suppose you don't notice his monster side because of his voice. . .but still, that's not the idea!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst book that I have ever read","review":"This is a boring book.

That is all that I can say. This book goes into such detail about each of the charecters it's much easier to understand why each one reacts to the phenomenons that occur. Phantom of the Opera by Gaston Leroux is so different and yet helps so much. Throughout his magical and mystical world Erik takes a famous Opera House in Paris by storm. It's amazing how one man/creature is able to put such a firm grip on those that surround him. His mystical and mysterious voice captures those that come to near and holds them with an entrancement that lulls you to sleep. If you love a good read that won't disappoint be sure to buy and read Phantom of the Opera. Read it before you see the musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"see the play","review":"THis was a great book.

I am talking with the seller at the moment but it is clear that the ISBN matches the one in listing, but it still isn't the same book as shown. Buyer beware, sellers tend to just list by ISBN (as I have done with used textbooks in the past) and I noticed that there is another review complaining of the same mistake. Now, I'm afraid to try to purchase book again despite it being one of my favourites in fear I will waste my money on an error again."},{"rating":"2","title":"None of the flair and pace of the later adaptations....","review":"If you are looking for a faced paced gothic/horror/romance that will keep you turning page after page -- this is not the book for you. If you are a fan of classic literature, especially with a gothic or theatric twist you will find it more interesting. It is also worth it for the die-hard fans of the movie or Broadway versions of the tale. To me, as a fan Webber's musical version, I enjoy the original book almost as if it is a set of footnotes, documents, and details that never make it on stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, horrifying editing","review":"Shame on the editor of this book! The incredible research that went into this book is belittled by the fact that it is not very well written. Spelling and grammatical errors abound in this otherwise-excellent volume. This is the only book I own from this series; I sincerely hope that these problems were absent in other titles.Other than that, I can say that this is the definitive book about Chaney's Phantom. Facts in this book are repeated in the \\"ultimate edition\\" 2-disc DVD, which includes the best-they-could-do of the 1925 original, which eluded the original authors of this book.Regardless of my own personal pickiness, if you are a fan of silent films and/or Chaney's Phantom, please get this book. It's a wonderfully immersive read."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"I loved this book, you are left with questions at the end but I love the gothic horror style. I wish the musical was more like this book. I read it in one night, I couldn't put it down. The phantom is really much more interesting, clever and diabolical than the other subsequent adaptations of his character, he truly is an ugly evil man that you can't help but feel sorry for at the end. You will also get a better back history on the phantom and why he is what he is. enjoy :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is beyond great!!!","review":"This book remains my favorite book of all time. I can't help but love it. I am sure by now you know the plot. If you are unsure if you want to read this book or not just go ahead and do it. You can't go wrong with this classic. Then after you have fell in love with this book go and buy a copy of The Phantom by Susan Kay. You can thank me later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Romantic Era","review":"Once I began reading this book, I couldn't stop; I read it all night. I loved the lustful passion and terror of the Phantom. His brilliance is exciting to see unfold in the novel. The play actually was fairly close to the book, although the book's phantom is decidedly more murderous and also more magnificently intelligent.

He longs to be loved and falls deeply and obsessibly in love with the young sopranno Christine Daae. The story which unfolds is a truely touching one.

But the brief synopsis on the inside of the CD jacket was not enogh to satisfy me. I had toread the book. The book Phantom of the Opera goes in to more depth of the story than the musical. But the author's style was a disapointment. It may be that the pizaz many authors put into their stories was lost when Leroux's story was translated into english. The plot however is superb and Leroux did a good job of finding one so intense to base his story on. If you have'nt listened to the original British cast soundtrack of Phantom, do so. It will be no disapointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"His voice filled my spirit with a strange, sweet sound!\\"","review":"Oh my god! I love this book! Its just so scary!

Had Leroux not come up with this tale, none of the other adaptions would have been made (probably). I know I would be desperate to find another obssession to ocupy my time w/o it. Besides, it's a phantastic read! You should be proud of this legend. I love how different it is from all the other famous works like \\"Les Miserabs\\" and \\"Orthello\\".I fell in love with the character of Erik in this book, despite how horrifyingly ugly and creepy he is. and no, i don't mean Gerard Butler.Unlike the fanfix, Christine, Raoul, AND Erik all have character in Leroux's book. The plot is interesting and will keep you satisfied. I know I cried in the end and parts sent chills up my spine.Trust me, this book is worth it and is a lot cheaper than other versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"It's a very goog classic.

Boring In Between","review":"\\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" is a beautiful story: well-conceived, inspiring, overwhelming, original images. It starts off in a great way, and the ending is a tear-jerker. There were too much details in the middle ,however, describing The Persian's and Raoul's attempts to reach the abducted Chrisitine. These \\"boring: details also stray the reader from the heart of the story, and you couldn't help wondering sometimes if you are reading a boyish adventure book, or a deep novel about human struggle. Although all the events of the movie and the musicals were derived from the novel, they were able to do what Leroux missed: focus on the characters and deeply explore their emotional turmoil. The Phantom of the Opera is a great story, that could've been better written and handled (however the movie and musical well-compensated this deficiency)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"If you're looking for something special, keep looking, because you won't find it here. I suppose most people come to this book nowadays with Michael Crawford, Lon Chaney or Claude Rains in mind, the but story here is completely different. What it is is a fairly dull detective story, with no love story in it at all, and flatly unconvincing characters and a highly improbable plot. If you love the Lloyd-Weber opera like I do, don't expect to find anything sublte or beautiful here. This is one of the few cases when the films and musicals FAR outdo the original that they were based on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and badly written","review":"I was expecting great things of this book and found it a huge disappointment. None of the three main characters are particularly likeable. Christine is cold and manipulating, Raoul is petulant and Erik is just a total psychopath. The only characters that I cared about were Madame Giry and the Persian.The narrative is terribly choppy and the plot is full of gaping holes. No one behaves in a believable manner and character motivation is just a joke. Large parts of the book are totally boring with endless yadda from countless opera staff which just seems like filler. Scenes like the safety-pin mystery are drawn out for ever at the expense of the main story.Leroux's atttemps to be 'clever' with his narrative structure simply falls flat and destroys much of the story's impact.The book is just a rather poorly written pot-boiler. A good idea, but badly executed. I'm not surprised that we have never yet seen a pure Leroux version on the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rauol is a whimp!","review":"The story is not only long and drawn out, but it lacks the intimate love story the reader craves. I found the book to be very boring and hard to finish. I love Andrew Lyod Weber's version, which is the only reason I finished the novel.The novel lacks a realistic hero. The descriptions of Rauol display him as weak and childish. The phantom is depicted as insane. I found myself not caring if any of the characters died.I would not recommend this book to anyone. I cannot believe some reviewer gave this novel five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious!","review":"This book was not at all what I had envisioned - the play was so amazing, I guess I was expecting more from the book. Near the apex of the story, I actually considered discontinuing the book because I found the \\"intrigues\\" of the phantom truly tedious. Total waste of time... watch the movie, it's far more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappoinment of a \\"supposedly\\" good book","review":"My english teacher gave me this book, telling me how wonderful and how much I would like it. Well, suffice to say, she was wrong. Now, yes, I said right, English teacher. I may only be 14 years old but I've read everything from Stephen King to the Inferno by Dante Alighieri, and all I can say about this book is that it doesn't do justice to the wonderful play. The storyline skips around like a two year old playing hopscotch, and, although the French names are I'm sure essential, refering to them constantly by their three or four word name can become exhausting. All in all, this is not going to be a book I read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantom of the opera Andrew loyd webber","review":"The epic tale of the Phantom of the Opera by Andrew Loyd Webber is a stunning and sensational movie. I rated it 5 out of 5 due to its greatness in music and suspense.

I am going to see it for my birthday and after reading the book, I want to see it even more. They way it is written draws you in, and even though it is not real, you would almost expect it to be. Very rarely does a book touch me and make me feel for a character, but when Erik leaves Christine to go with Raoul, and then we find out about his broken heart and the effects of it, I felt as though I were there and really knew him. That is just one of the many things that make this such a fantastic story of love, pain, deception and lies. If you are looking for a horror/drama to read, this is it. I recomend this to anyone who likes classic literature, and even then I'd recomend it to anyone who likes to read at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think some people forget the book was writen BEFORE the play","review":"Therefore the book is the original story.The story was very intriguing and I had a hard time putting it down.

This is really a bad book.","review":"No seriously.I had the highest expectation for this experience. But the story is a mess.It's episodic to the point of distraction. The point of view changes randomly. At one point it's a confession, or a \\"verbal account\\". Then it is a written account from a character hardly seen in the first 70% of the story. To say the characters are weakly developed is an insult to...uh...weak people. The language is occasionally witty, but often repetitive and uninteresting.The best part of the novel is the epilogue, which gives details of the Phantom's origins, all of which are FAR more interesting than the contents of the book. I also loved a bit about the real Opera House that came with my Easton Press copy.I loved the stage musical, I loved the old films, I liked the new film...this was extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating","review":"Read the book and found it hard to put down. If Gaston Leroux seemed to some not to have been a good writer, I didn't notice that he wasn't. I was able to relate the book to the 2004 movie as it followed Leroux's story pretty well. While the movie concentrated on the romance aspect of the story, the book itself was more involved in what seemed a few plots, e.g. murder, mystery, romance, horror and I even found some humour. Good book, even with it's sad ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book. I thought it was awesome.","review":"I saw POTO, and I then decided to read the book.

There are *very* few books that are so breath-takingly beautiful, and so heart-wrenchingly sad. If you love dark thrillers, love stories, comedy, or mystery this book is for you. It's the type of book that will come alive in your hands and will stay alive in your mind long after the last page is turned.

Fell in love with all the characters. The Phantom Of The Oprah is a detective/love/myster all rolled into one. The story was turned into a Brodway play and a London Play.

The Phantom lives under the opera, for he fears others seeing his deformed face, but he falls in love with one Christine Daae after giving her singing lessons, which hightens her status at the opera. Yet, Raoul is in love with the prima dona as well; Christine has a choice. You will not be able to put this book, which describes everything in large detail, down one second, as you follow the gripping tale of \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\". Leroux brings out his characters' personalities in a such a way that the whole story is believeable. This book could make a GREAT movie if they stayed close to the book, so that means that you ought to read this VERY VERY good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help","review":"This answers things I did not understand from the movie. It is hard to imagine how ugly the Phantom is supposed to be because there is no way to Make Gerard Butler ugly. The problem with a handsom, sexy Phantom is that it is hard to understand why Christine didn't chose him. But the book does show the Phantom's great love for Christine. The story is hard to follow sometimes but hang in there because it is a fairly good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"Being a huge fan of the motion picture with the same title, I was in for a shock with this classic. I had no idea the Andrew Lloyd Webber's spin was so different than the original book. However, once I got past trying got past to compare the two, I found that the book was intriguing and drew me in.

It works quite well as an insecticide, and is in a high concentration, so it can be mixed down to about 1% and still be potent.This Permethrin smells pretty bad (apparently because of an additive, not the permethrin itself); some people are more sensitive than others. It really doesn't bother me too much. But the good thing is that it has a very low toxicity to humans and *most* mammals. I was using it for bed bugs, and it seems to do the job.

The only sparkling story in the collection is the first, entitled \\"A Sunset in Sunshine City\\" in which an old retired cafeteria owner retires to a condo in Florida to spend the rest of his days with a newly made female friend. The problem is that his daughter's husband is involved in some bad business deals and needs money. So he schemes along with his wife to wrest his fortune from the old man.The other stories range from unfunny to cliched to just plain silly. Especially bad is \\"Humans\\", in which Eisner's ill-suited style is put to use chronicling our human-like ancestors as they hunt a mastadon and learn the value of cooperation. You can see the endings of most of the stories before they come. They're trite. I would not recommend this to even the most die-hard Eisner fan.

I loved all of them. If they included a few more tracks(it was only a seven song EP) it would be my favorite at the drive-in CD to date. I hope and pray they will carry the legacy on in mars volta."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legends","review":"At the Drive-In will always be a legend, no matter what. They're just so awesome musically, but I think it might be good that they broke off, otherwise the Mars Volta and Sparta would have never been produced, but I'll talk about that later. This cd is so cool, it just makes you totally want to go write some kind of music to call your own. This was always one of the most inspirational cd's to me, as I grew into the bass player I am today. Get this cd if you love music; Great music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy on technique - Light on drama","review":"Lazer-Guided Melodies has a lot of interesting techniques going for it. First, the back cover shows that there are 12 compositions on the disc, but my CD players only read 4 index numbers. Rather cute because you can't select or forward to the \`hidden' cuts. The painfully slow and monotone vocals are electronically reduced to a drone. Imagine a group of stoned American Indians repeating \\"Hey, ya, ya, ya, Hey, ya, ya, ya...\\" endlessly. Floating around in a cold and thick soup of electronic swirl are snippets of flute, cello and violin. Although none of the methods used on Lazer-Guided Melodies are original, they are marginally interesting. The disc is heavy on technique, but drama and direction are hopelessly absent. Spiritualized is dreadfully unspirited. Like trying to pour pancake syrup on a freezing February morning, I kept saying, \\"Please, hurry up and do something, do anything.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Unmitigated rubbish!","review":"I bought this album simply because I had read so many good reviews of it. I like to think I have pretty wide and varied musical tastes and I have over 1,000 albums ranging from Sex Pistols to Miles Davis to Nick Drake to Captain Beefheart to Black Uhuru to Sun Ra.... are you starting to get the idea? I can honestly say that this is the only album I have ever heard that I cannot find a single redeeming feature in. Complete and utter self-indulgent, drug-addled, pointless, directionless.... If this system allowed me to give a negative rating then I would unhesitatingly do so!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best Spiritualized","review":"This is a terrific album. Each track is incredibly unique and thoroughly filled out, yet still manages to stick to the Spriritualized spacey sound. I beleive it to be better than both Pure Phase and Ladies and Gents..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album can help you float","review":"What a joy this album is - sleepy, relaxing, joyous, all these things. From the beautiful opening of \\"you know it's true\\" the album is just a pure delight. It's slightly in the shoegazing scene, but mostly it's got a style all of it's own. Put this on and within minutes you'll feel as though you're levitating. The music is dreamy and Jason Pierce's vocals softly spoken/sang on top is a perfect mixture. Chill music for indie kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritualized's Best Album","review":"This is without a doubt their best album. Listening to it is like being transported into an alternate dimension. Soothing melodies combined with synthesizers and echo effects combine to create ethereal bliss. Well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Perfect","review":"Perfect. The dizzy space sound takes me into Spiritualized's enourmous musical galaxy. If you get in; it don't let you out. Besides, it never lets you down either. I'm an addict. Every song is a classic. Believe me. The best Spiritualized album.But: DON' SKIP SONGS!!!!!!!! Just insert the cd, and let it play through.For every music enthusiast; this is a must-buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as powerful as Ladies and Gentlemen or Sweet Heart","review":"I recently heard a review suggesting that 2012's brilliant Sweet Heart/Sweet Light was the culmination of a trilogy of records starting with Lazer Guided Melodies and working through Ladies and Gentlemen, We Are Floating in Space (although of course, Spiritualized has released a number of albums in between). Somehow, I think that both of those records are stronger, but I am unable to articulate why that is. I keep listening to this album hoping that it will grab me at the level of the other two, but I have not been grabbed yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"truly a broken man is d ozman","review":"it's products like this that have me wondering why amazon doesn't have a zero star option for product ratings"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic ballads!","review":"Wow! Amazing CD. I'm impressed.There are four ballads that are worthy of \\"standards\\" status:\\"What I Meant To Say, \\"Keep Her In Mind, \\"Whenever You're In Trouble\\" and \\"My Perfect Rhyme.\\"It's nice to hear the vocals up front on the mix, especially with a voice as outstanding as Osmond's.This guy deserves a great deal of respect. He's got the goods and he delivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"He has done it again!","review":"Donny doesn't disappoint with this one. \\"What I Meant to Say\\" is an impressive mix of upbeat pop tracks and smooth romantic ballads. Donny's honest lyrics and rich vocal style really shine on poignant tracks like \\"One Dream\\" where you can actually hear the emotion in his voice. Great for relaxing after a long day, spending time with a loved one or just driving home from work. This is a must have for Donny fans and anyone who enjoys good adult contemporary music. I definitely recommend this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep it goin Donny!","review":"This guy has been through alot when it comes to the entertainment biz. But one thing is for sure, Donny keeps on goin. He's been to the top, to obscurity, and back. I'm not a huge Donny fan but you've got to hand it to him for giving us some of our most memorable hits, (\\"Puppy Love\\" for one).This album sounds as good as I've ever heard Donny sound, and that's great. He's half way between Paul Anka and Clay Aiken, and that's great too.As an American family icon I think it only fitting for Clay to join him on stage and on his next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best singers out there","review":"Donny Osmond is one of the best singers in the business, and also one of the most underrated. The public needs to let go of his teen idol image and just LISTEN to the music. He is a talented writer as well, having co-written most of the songs on here. He has an incredible voice and a way of singing with such emotion. All the songs are excellent, but my personal favorite is Broken Man. He delivers the song with such emotion and reality, it's amazing. If you're a fan, this is a must have. If you've never been a fan, then you need to hear this CD-without the teen idol image in your head-and you will love it. I guarantee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album","review":"I have been a fan for 40 years. I have all the music in the Osmond catalog. This is by far Donny's best and my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about some music samples?","review":"Don't like to purchase without hearing some music first. Despite buyers reviews, what happened to Amazon's sound clips?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh man","review":"OK, I admit it--I had the posters and the lunch box. And so a well-meaning friend thought I should have the album. Folks, this guy has been milking the teenybopper reminiscence crowd for way too many years, and it shows here. This is elevator music, and I gave it an extra star because it's not BAD elevator music. But it's not evidence of a comeback, but rather a fairly pathetic career of has-been bygone glory days that would have been much more nobly put out of its misery a long time ago. The Osmond craving for the public spotlight may appeal to the Branson crowd, but anyone who has grown up since 1970 will find this nauseating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Donny Stay As Great As You Are!!!","review":"I got this CD and loved it!!!

The characters were underdeveloped, the storyline was lacking in depth, and the writing was terrible. I noticed grammatical errors and editing errors throughout the book.Many times the author was telling the story instead of leading us on a journey through the life of Reb Barnett. \\"Let he who finds the Dagger use it for noble purpose. That was my father's plan. And now it's mine.\\" The story read more like a cheesy Harlequin novel than a serious work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful..... Really","review":"or should I simply say, really awful...I normally read non-fiction history books, but I figured that I would take a break and read something a little lighter... This was in the clearance section - or was it the 'last chance' section - of my favorite Barnes and Noble, and the word 'Medici' in the title caught my eye. I figured that for $5.98 it was worth a shot... It wasn't...I could go on and on with examples of the poor quality of the writing, but I have wasted enough time on this book.What is really discouraging is that for $5.98 I could have bought a newspaper and a soy caramel machiatta with an extra shot..If you are thinking about buying this book... don't. Take the money that you would have spent, and donate it to charity. You will feel better about yourself, stop yourself from wasting time, and get a tax break out of the deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Action Novel...needs to be edited!","review":"This was my first read of a Cameron West novel, and it seems like a poorly edited first novel withan interesting premise but lousy execution. Cameron's characters dialog goes from middle school childish to 'lovestory' over the top emotion to pop psychology gibberish. Only the actual action scenes are worth readingand the back ground on the Medici Dagger itself. It feels like a 1970s style novel with a kitchen sinkof characters and absurd situations and plot devices. I only give it 2 stars because of the basic plotand mystery/treasure hunt. This would be a good book for any college writing class to use as fodder for how NOTto write an action novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would have made a great movie!","review":"An excellent read...would have made a better movie than DaVinci Code.

I have found myself thinking, \\"Give me a break!\\" It is difficult to care about the characters enough to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a story","review":"I can't tell you that this is a bad book, I can't tell you that is a waist of time, but also I can't tell you that this is an excellent read, the book will keep you reading but not thrilling you, the problem is when Reb said that he knew the answer of The Circles of Truth because Da Vinci told him how to solve the puzzle, since there, and that the last one hundred pages are just to waist paper you will only read the rest of it to finish the book, if you have an other book read it instead of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"This would be a good tale if the author could try to avoid bad poetics. \\"...I hung up, gently this time, totally intoxicated with emotion, but thirsting for more, dying to drink from her well forever, to gulp quenching heartfuls of her.\\" I read that and was seized with an urge to gulp quenching mouthfuls of alcohol, but I decided to finish the book anyway. I had invested enough time in it already. I probably missed some of the story line as I tried to skim over similar cloying sentiments, however, if I were the author next time I wouldn't try to create a romance-action novel hybrid. It's just not a good combo."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book stunk","review":"To call Cameron West a third rate Dan Brown is an insult to authors who are a third rate Dan Brown type of an author. He slapped a few locations together with silly character development and called it a novel. I feel as though I am owed my money back from him.After reading the likes of Brown, Crichton and Grisham (and maybe even Archer), I am used to people painstakingly researching what they are actually writing about. This book didn't even attempt to make me doubt reality by weaving reality into the plot.Please... save your money and your time.

It says on the packaging that there are puppets in the video, which is one of the reasons I bought it. Are they joking? They show them in the opening and ending for about 1/2 a minute each time, ok, maybe 1 minute each time. If you want something musical, stick with Baby Mozart, Baby Beethoven, or if you like Sesame Street, my daughter's all time favorite is Sesame Sings Kareoke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this!","review":"I too bought this video because my 15 month old son has practically worn out his Baby Mozart video (which he's loved since he was 1 month old!). I figured since he loved Baby Mozart I'd give this musical video a try. I am on a tight budget but figured 10 bucks wasn't bad. I put the video on for my child and he shows zero interest in it. The cover of the video was deceiving, it showed bright puppets that are in the video however the puppets are only shown a maximum of 5 minutes. The rest of the time is soooo boring showing kids and adults playing instruments (like in an orchestra). It shows weeds blowing in the wind - I can't stress enough how horrible this video is. Buy Baby Mozart instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable!","review":"We really like this series. My little one was really engaged.

The Hits & More is a pleasant collection of George LaMond timeless hits & new tracks for your listening pleasure. I don't think I will ever say oldie on his music because his voice seems to transcend time itself. \\"Just In Time\\" is beautiful from its lyrics to its last chord thanks to the Barbosa mind. \\"Someone Like You\\" just makes me feel so good! LOL \\"More Than Words\\" demonstrates the low and high range of this dynamic singer. This Cd is a keeper for years to come and shows the true beauty of a natural tenor at his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs from a Member of Freestyle's Royal Court","review":"Definitely a must have for any serious freestyle fan. Not every song on here is great, but they definitely aren't terrible either. You will listen to \\"Where Does That Leave Love\\", \\"Look Into My Eyes\\", \\"Without You\\", and \\"Bad of the Heart\\" the most on hereIf you can find these songs on freestyle compilations, then no need for this cd, but if you can't, then here is a chance to have 4 really good songs by a man who always gets his full emotions into his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very close to home and heart","review":"Paul Overstreet is one of the best writers around. Many people do not realize all the songs that he has written. Paul writes straight from the heart and you can feel his love of God, home, and family in each of his songs. Love is Strong is an outstanding recording and touches deep."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's metal, but it's CHEAP","review":"I expected something much better. the part did not fit in the hole in my tank, and the lever was not even articulated in the sleeve---the rotation was solely due to the lousy fit.

The color is fine, my set was missing a button on the duvet closure but no big deal, I have a king goose down blanket and the fit was not perfect and there was a lot of shifting, also this duvet fabric wrinkles easily (makes things appear messy).

I have to have this CD in my car. Fav songs are 'Mother', 'Kisses' (both versions), 'I Love My TV', 'I Feel You', I like them all, but those are the ones I love. Conni Emerson has a versatile voice capturing three styles of singing: Bonnie Raitt, Shawn Colvin, and Melissa Etheridge. Her songwriting is rich. I compare this CD to Shawn Colvin, Sara McGlaughlin, James Taylor, John Prine and Bonnie Raitt. It's Great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why oh why?","review":"BMG's decision to release this album is unfathomable. With the exception of the disastrous Lanza on Broadway LP (mercifully unavailable - at present - on CD), this was the tenor's worst album. Recorded around the time of his first heart attack, Lanza was in very poor spirits indeed when he recorded this, and it shows. Unlike the Broadway album, his singing is not downright bad; it's simply devoid of the tenor's trademark warmth and vitality. O Christmas Tree is, perhaps, the only exception on this otherwise gloomy offering.For an infinitely more sparkling alternative, check out the singer's beautiful Christmas with Mario Lanza CD. It's available through Amazon, and reviewed on these pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mario Lanza Sings Christmas Carols","review":"Haven't heard these beautiful songs since I had the original RPM records. It was marvelous to be able to find and purchase this CD. Many Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Lanza's best","review":"Much like the Lanza On Broadway album Mario's great voice is off. These recordings have been remastered so it is ten times better than the original LP released in 1959. But it's Mario Lanza and his voice at its worst is greater than most at their best. Do yourself a favor, there are two Lanza Sings Christmas Carols albums the first was recorded in the early 50's these recordings show Mario at his best. The Lanza voice is glorious here. No one ever or will sing Christmas songs like this ....... His voice is truly God given."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BEAUTIFUL ALBUM FOR THE HOLIDAYS AND BEYOND!","review":"Mario Lanza's short life was full of wonderful music, this album truly radiates the majestic vocal qualities of this tenor, and if you feel like you need some spirit filled music in your home, his Sings Christmas Carols album is a true keeper. The First Noel is unbelievable, I never heard his rendition until this past Christmas and it was a revelation. Away In A Manger is a sad song to begin with , but the way he sings this, you know he loved the lord. A beautiful album is now back on c.d....I just played the album myself again today.....more then just a fine Christmas album, its a great holy spirit filled album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you","review":"I have looked all over for this music in a CD format.

I've gone through two new units in 2002 and 2003. They were susceptible to minor voltage surges, which destroyed the powered sub woofer power supplies. Just by flicking your surge protector power strip on and off, the amp in the sub woofer would react negatively. It actually ruins them.

I was amazed. The OUTburst opening system works so flawlessly! It always surprises all my friends when they go to open it. The locking device works pretty well too (it's no AUTO-LAWKS, but it will get the job done for sure...). The blade material is AUS-8, meaning it holds its edge QUITE well. Mine came very sharp when I bought it in late 2007 and I have not needed to sharpen it yet. The handle feels good in your hand. At times the clip can feel a tad awkward but it is not too bad. It also comes with a lock to keep it from slipping open when you don't want it too, which I find very nice when there are kids around who should not be touching it. Very satisfied with this knife, recommend to all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Third Greatest Hits!","review":"Agreed...there could've been more on this cd...but listening to it(and looking at the list of tracks), it's still a great cd by now 66 year old Ronnie Milsap!

This also helped to get, on cd, rare tracks, like Button Off My Shirt, which sounds mean, but oh well, can't blame him, and Prisoner Of The Highway. L.A. To The Moon and Quicksand remain exclusive. L.A. went country #45(why 45?!); Quicksand, like It's Already Taken(not on here)before it, was never released. Both deserved much better!

But for the past two years I cannot seem to get through book one. It is awful and boring. As soon as there is a character that holds my interest they end up in the woods and not spoken of again. I see why the writers don't want to continue it. The book sucks and doesn't make any sense. And ever page they keep introducing a new character with no depth or any real purpose. This might sound strange but the book is just too wordy for no reason and it won't get to the point or the purpose.

Although the Morrises have a great story line, and create some interesting characters, there is far too much navel gazing and drawn out painful introspection going on, and the authors seem to be going to great lengths to stretch the plot into 150,000 words. As a result, they turn an interesting story into a tedious read.Each scene is filled with tormented angst and tortured self analysis, with such wordiness that it appears that the Morrises were trained in a Baptist seminary, where pastors are turned into preachers and taught how to say in 10,000 words what could be said in 100 or less. The authors fall into the common Christian fiction writers' trap of equating hand-wringing introspection with character development. Let the characters develop themselves by their actions, and skip the hundreds of pages of psychoanalysis."},{"rating":"2","title":"My teenage daughter loved this mug!","review":"Nice quality mug, with bright, cheery colors and a cute, sturdy gift box.

There is not a flaw on this one. Sandi Patty is one of the all time great vocalists, but has a tendancy to be over produced. Not this time! These songs flow like buttah. She contributes a new song called \\"The Last Day,\\" and it sounds like it was genre written; as does the new Trocolli number, \\"I Remember.\\"Sandi and Kathy are great Contemporary Christian artist. This CD proves that they can be great artists in any category of music.Don't pass this one by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan.....tastic..........","review":"Wow, I love these guys', can't wait to hear more.

This is lush, atmospheric, melodic music that both soothes and inspires. To my ears it sounds a bit like Roxy Music around their \\"Avalon\\" and \\"Flesh and Blood\\" period, mixed with a little early Tears For Fears. There are some stunning songs on this album. Really, a flawless set of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Psychological Study of Winning and Losing","review":"More than a story about pool players (although the inside look at the green felt world is fascinating), this is a perceptive study of how we talk ourselves into losing because it's much easier than paying the price to win. Beautifully written with numerous memorable characters, far superior to the movie, this is one novel you'll never forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Movie was better","review":"One of those few books that one can say the movie was much more livelier. In the book we never know whether Fast Eddie pays Bert the money that he wins in the final game and of course Sarah does not go with Bert and Eddie to Lexington. On the whole it was a lifeless novel. It seems the reputation of Tevis is based more on the success and acting of Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason , Piper Lori as well as the direction of Robert Rossen than anything that he wrote. I was not impressed by his writing. I loved the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Printing - Poorly Written","review":"There was very little useful information content and the printing was primitive. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought this book in Japan","review":"The structure of this book is great. You could literally read this book in a month and have a solid grasp of the various grammatical structures of Japanese. If you can't yet read hiragana or kanji, this book has romaji (as well as kanji) so you can get up and running quickly. I can read hiragana -- but slowly. So it slows my learning.One thing I will say is that this book has English and Japanese. The author explains the new grammar in each chapter with an English introduction. This is nice but personally I feel that all language learning should be done in the new language. Perhaps there's no way around this in book form, otherwise you may as well studyMinna no Nihongo, Book 1 (Bk. 1) (Japanese Edition)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I've been looking for","review":"I started learning Japanese with audio lessons, read a few beginner books, and was looking all over the place for the next step; this book is it. I actually skimmed through it at the bookstore and thought about buying it, decided not to, and ended up buying it online a few months later.Not only is it a good review of the basics I've already learned, but it's a consistent building of new vocabulary along with excellent examples and various forms of speech (polite, neutral, etc). I finally feel like I'm moving forward in my progress again as opposed to reading the same things over and over.My only CON is that there is no dictionary in the back of the book. I think it would be really convenient to be able to look up the new romaji words I'm learning and which chapters they're used in, but instead I have to hunt for them.Anyway, thank you for this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids love it!!","review":"We bought this CD after Jim Rule performed at my kids elementary school.

I don't have kids, but he brings out the kid in me. I have often given his music as gifts to children, and both the kids and their parents love it. So many people speak Spanish today; it's wonderful to have a few bilingual songs just for fun. \\"If I Make a Misteak\\" allows for the imperfection in each of us. \\"The Gingerbread Girl\\" gives a modern-day twist to a classic tale.

Lately I have been considering expanding my weekend backyard hobby into competing at contests just to see how I stack up. This book made me even more determined to enter.

If you are looking for information on how to run your smoker, set up your fire, and some of the basics of competition then you won't find a better book. However, if you are looking for a book will well-written recipes for the average backyard griller, look at Steven Raichlen's BBQ USA. Chef Kirk doesn't give you all of the basic recipes you may be looking for. In fact, his goal is to give you some basics and have you experiment. He does provide background on his techniques along with some of his older recipes. But you can tell he didn't give enough away so you could go out and beat him! Overall, it is an entertaining read and a pretty good reference. But there are other books with better recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST HAVE","review":"I have had this book for a long time now. EVERYTHING I have made useing this book has been awesome. We are really picky about our BBQ. Not only does the author go into recipes, but the theory of BBQ, Smoking, and grilling. It covers Fish, beef, pork, lamb, poultry, veggies, and countless sauces, rubs, dips, and mops. IF YOU OWN A SMOKER OR A GRILL YOU SHOULD GET THIS BOOK.

Only recently I knew that it's the same as Langenscheid's Pocket Dictionary. No worry about it, you get an excellent dictionary of this category for a little price. It's organized in a romaji order from A to Z but the japanese characters come first. And if you want to find by a kanji, the complete 1945 characters' list comes just after Introduction. Compare to Langengenscheid's this one has a smaller text, that's why I put 4 stars, but if you want a smaller size of the dictionary itself you can certainly correct me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealized Potential","review":"I read Quicksand, not Passing, and I don't know whether I will read Passing. You will understand why I may not read it after you have read my review of Quicksand.The premise of Quicksand was what attracted me to the book: what it feels like to be a biracial woman living in the early twentieth century. However, the author was unable to carry out her theme. 95% of the book is the author telling us how the heroine feels without much explanation of why she feels that way. Further, there's little dialogue so that the reader could draw her own conclusions about how or why the heroine feels a certain way. For that reason it is difficult to relate to the heroine. The author also places the heroine in set stereotypical scenes (stereotypical for the early twentieth century). This gives the book a contrived feeling and makes it even more difficult to relate to the heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is most probably government disinformation","review":"Sander Hicks' _The Big Wedding_ is filled with glimpses into the world of spooks and their fringe colloborators and is spiced with details that are probably both new and true. Yet, inserted in this book are some very few factual claims and viewpoints that makes it hard to believe the book is written in good faith. The author present sources as reliable when they say the main foreign power involved with the hijackings and demolitions on September 11. 2001 was _Pakistan_ (and not Israel), when they say the WTC demolitions were a _downgraded_ attack (from the original nuclear, and that US authorities \\"downgraded\\" it), and finally he refers to the Truth Movement's refusal to accept that a 757 hit the Pentagon as \\"our weakest link\\".

I like this particular model because 1) The bezel is a very shiny silver(which to me is more elegant than the other formulas) and 2) It doesn't have all the mini dials in the middle, just a very masculine black face.

Guiding each man's actions and outlook are the teachings of Machiavelli and Nietzsche, which makes for an \\"interesting\\" coupling.

But after about 6 months it totally falls apart and the place where the ipod connects moves and it is very hard for it to stand up...and also GREATLY effects the sound. AFTER 6 MONTHS IT IS TOTALLY WORTHLESS EVEN AFTER GOOD CARE.

I don't know how to go about fixing it since the case is so hard to take apart. I suggest using the sleeve for the ipod that comes with the speakers so that it is firmly in place and can't wiggle.

Convenient - stores your IPOD securely while en route to wherever and so easy to throw in a beach bag. We use it now at home out by the jacuzzi and on the patio so we can easily change songs without using the main receiver in the house. The sound is very good for such a small unit - obviously your not going to get great bass from such small speakers but for what it is - this is a great device for a great price. Very happy with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"really nifty","review":"i find these speakers very easy to travel with; they fit in a briefcase [not too heavy] or luggage. the extreme portability and good sound, make them an ideal way to share podcast audio/music with a larger audience. i also really like how slick they look with the black ipod. the remote, and how it fits neatly inside the speakers is also a really cool touch. it's quite a nice visual presentation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Refurbished Arrived Broken","review":"Bought this refurbished for $60 and it arrived broken.

But Jazz... give me a break! Tom Jones tried to switch to the new style, sorry but it did not work. I was afraid that Engelbert would do the same and he did it. He sings songs that were done much better by other people (Just a Two of Us, With You I'm Born Again and others)The new album sounds like a cheap production with midi electronic instruments. Forget violins they don't exist anymore. How sad. Engelbert doesn't sound like Engelbert anymore. The arranger and composer Bebu Silvetti was his best choice to perform classics and new songs. To bad he is no longer around.And for his true fans try the album and you decide. I am going back to listen to his old albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"My mom doesn't like him anymore...","review":"I got this CD for my mom and after listening to it she asked me to take it back to the store, because she said there is no way it could be her favorite singer Engelbert.

I am more convinced than ever before that this man is in a class by himself. Yea, Sinatra, Bennet, Damone, Black, have set the vocal stage for many years, but this Man is by Far the best singer to grace this planet in the last hundred years. He can sing Celine songs,Gospel songs,Christmas songs and God knows, he is to Love songs, what Mercedes-Benz is to Cars.Buy the album, better yet buy all of his works like I have done and then boast of having the finest collection of songs ever sung.Ed GibbonsLittle Silver, New Jersey"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lukewarm","review":"I liked certain parts of this book very much.I was bored by others. I was expecting sharp, insightful, refreshing wisdom and got a lot of characterizations I had heard before. Overall, it was a decent book...just not what I had hoped for (that's my problem, not the author's).However, the pearls of wisdom Mr. Taylor shared were precious indeed. Here are a few excepts:\\"Today, gurus and hucksters fill our airwaves hawking CD's, seminars, and autographed pictures of Jesus claiming that they will bring immediate personal peace in five easy steps and three easy payments.

However, the author were not able to illustrate many subjects in a coherent way. In the end, you don't get much by reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A HORRIBLE BOOK!!","review":"Don't waste your money on this book. The author makes it obvious through the examples provided that his knowledge of C# language structure is poor and the examples provided are 100 miles of bad road. Right off the bat in the early chapters of the book I tried to follow the examples in the book, but by instruction provided they don't work. You find yourself working around the mistakes in the book to get the examples to work. This book is a better reference for Schemas and Service Protocols than anything. Stay away if you are looking to learn about Web Services. I'd recommend a book by Wrox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent coverage of Web Services (not just .NET)","review":"I found this book extremely useful in learning not just the .NET Web Services stack, but also web services fundamentals.

The number of errors just kills me... Why people don't compile their code and THEN paste it into their book is beyond me... Chapter two has an example where you create a Console Application, then you're asked to rename the Service1 file, but the Console Application wizard creates a Console1 file (the Web Service wizard creates a Service1 file). These errors are just inexcusable and the errors and issues go on forever... The errata should be as large as the book itself. Even larger if they included an apology for all the mistakes. I'd be totally ashamed to have my name on this book. If you're curious, buy a used copy for $5 and see for yourself. Even at that price, you'll probably feel ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the trouble","review":"This book does contain quite a bit of valuable information, but it is not worth extracting it. The book is quite poorly written and has no comprehensible flow. The material is arranged in subject areas according to chapter, but that is about all you get. Furthermore, the vast number of errors make the hassle of reading this book even worse. Reading this book is like having gravel in your granola. It it likely better to starve, while you look for something, anything, else.This one is a major disappointment.

I don't understand the logic and structure the author presents his ideas. One who read the book will tend to question the author's own understanding of the web services and .NET. If you read his very first example in book (P. 14), you will have to agree with me that he is not C# savvy. It seems to me that the author probably only concerns to get it published and he disregards the quality of the book. You can find plenty of spelling errors also (for example, P41. 'defer' should be 'refer'). I have to disuade whoever wants to buy this book. Bad book, poor writting skills and poor coding skills. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I typically like the MS Press books when it comes to exploring new technologies. Not so with this book.

This album has become one of the best gifts I've ever received from my girlfriend. It's not such an album with only one single hit. There's no reason for stopping your cd player and skip songs.

That's when I pick this cookbook up. Most of the recipes I've tried are easy, and while the results won't wow your gourmet friends (canned beans, frozen vegetables), they're tasty, and make good use of the ingredients.

I am not a vegetarian, but don't eat much meat. I like simple recipes, easy to find ingredients, a good balance of nutrition, and most of all, delicious recipes. Oh, and I really like it when just one dish fulfills all these needs and you don't need side dishes (keeping it simple).Jeanne Lemlin cookbooks all meet my criteria.

But it's still an okay watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda Crappy","review":"Looked interesting enough, but was I sorry I bought this instead of renting it. The special effects were horrible. The monster was more funny than anything. When the bone eater's horse would appear in a puff of smoke and the old western type music would start playing, it was more like a comedy. Bruce Boxleitner was ok. I saw Gil Gerard was in this and the actress that used to be on Hill Street Blues, I believe. I originally didn't recognize either one of them until I played the movie again.

How the final two tracks, one an ode to gettin' benjamins and the other an uplifting ode to black culture, ended up on the same album is a mystery.Despite the inconsistency, I rate this 4 stars because it's Dres, the finest flowing lyricist ever, an MC who puts thought and heart into what he's saying.

Unless there's an extremely slimline water bottle out there that I've never come across. The limited amount of meshing and lack of elasticity offers no expandability of the space, meaning that none of my bottles fit. And I tried just about everything, including the teeny 8-oz Dasani bottles.Keep all this in mind before purchasing, folks! The good things? The bag sure looks pretty and has plenty of padding."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXTREMELY CHALLENGING","review":"This is a good game that takes a very long time. the replay value is very poor (because it is sooooo HARD) but all other aspects are good. you must go through a variety of worlds rescung pao pao park from pinki, an evil minded baby. this game is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun game with slight camera prooblems","review":"Super Magnetic Neo is a great game, with great graphics, great gameplay and cool sound.

Wilkerson that I was afraid to invest for years because I thought an economic collapse was surely coming at any time. My challenge to David Wilkerson is to come clean with this stuff and either update it or admit that he missed it. All Christians make mistakes (it's OK to be wrong - just another thing that is covered by the blood of Jesus). This review is not a personal attack on this brother. I have tremendous respect for him and the work he did with Nicky Cruz, gangs and Teen Challenge. Until this book is updated or clarified, I can't recommend it. (P.S.

But, recently, I took it out again and was amazed to find how much of it has either come true or is about to come true. Anyone who doubts the truth of his words should read Chapter 1.

Once it is in place, you honestly DO NOT need the straps, which is exactly how a good fit should behave. I have dents in my shoulder bones caused by ill-fitting garments that use straps to hold 90% of the weight; those indentations won't go away, but they won't get worse, now that I own a dozen of these.Downside? The straps rest too high on the shoulders to wear a boatneck or scoop of any kind - a small downside, don't you think?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable underwire","review":"The underwire does separate, and support. There is gonna be some movement. I don't think a woman is ever gonna get away from that without physically affected her breast in the negative. I do have to practice at hooking it on from the back, but other than that minor detail, I am satisfied with its performance. [Would love it if it had a zipper in the front! just saying] Shoulder straps are comfortable, and material is breathable. I jog in FL, and I don't really think about how sweaty my bra gets while I'm wearing this.

This bra does the job nicely. I wore it on a 1/2 hour bike ride the day I got it (without washing it first) and noticed that the fabric was pretty stiff. However, after only the first wash, it feels much better and is much more comfortable. The back is akward though, so that does get some getting used to. I usually end up putting it on backwards (without my arm through the holes), clasping the three claps, turning it to the right side and pulling it up/putting my arms through to get it on. Because of the weird design, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5....just a tad combersome to put on, but otherwise a great bra for a larger chest.

It is SOO difficult to find a racer back style that truly emliminates bounce, but this one does. That being said, it is a pain in the neck to get on and off. I actually have to get my husband to help me by fastening it once it's on, b/c I practically dislocated my shoulder trying to wrench my arm into a position that would let me do the hooks. Now I just leave it hooked all the time, never undo it, and wriggle my way into it as best I can.

Once I squeezed my shoulders through, smashing my breasts with the underwire in the process, I nearly dislocated my shoulders trying to hook the clasps! I had to be satisfied with two hooks because I never did get the third. Of course it provided great support on my four-mile run. Removing it when both the bra and my body were sweaty was nearly impossible; both difficult and painful. For smaller breasts or more flexible women this might be a good choice; I am a reasonably fit 34DD. Even if you had help to put it on and take it off, you are in for a chore.

This item did not do that. I have to wear another sports bra over top of it to get that holding down effect. The second thing I want in a sports bra is boob seperation, I'll give it a great on this task. The underwire is pretty comfortable and seperates nicely. Lastly, I get underwire because i don't want my boobs to touch my stomach (is this TMI?). The underwire on this bra does an ok job of this, not great. It's better with the sports bra over top of it.Lastly, before I dig too hard on this bra, I think I either ordered a size too big (i ordered my actual bra size) or lost a little weight before it got to me (NOT LIKELY). I should have ordered a smaller size and that may have been more supportive and restrictive.

I bought it for everyday use as I hate regular straps sliding off my shoulder. It is a good bra for keeping everything it its place without bouncing. I agree that it seems to run a bit small in the cup size, but I figured that was part of the design to keep everything snug. It is also a bit of a pain to get on and off, but since I usually only do that once or twice a day, no big deal. Very comfortable to wear all day long - the underwires do not press against my ribs like others have after many hours. It is also very comfortable for bicycling long distances.

Being a 36 DD, it is hard to find the perfect sports bra that can carry the weight of my DD's and provide movement control.

I don't believe that I could have put it on alone.Also, the bottom front edge will roll up if you have a belly at all (like i do)..These two minor flaws could be corrected so easily by leaving off the front bottom edge (or making it more narrow) The edge ( right under the wires) does not seem to be a structurally important piece anyway.The lack of ease in getting it ON your body could be remedied by just adding a wide fastener right at the center back.

Trying to pull a fitted, not too stretchy bra with a ton of underwire around the shoulders and over the breasts then hook it behind the back is just too much trouble!

I also know from reading press that this is just supposed to be a fun, but not serious effort. Lest we not forget that all bands like to reference their heroes from time to time. ex: Beach Boys ripped off chuck Berry, Beatles ripped off Chuck Berry, Bob Dylan, among many others, George Harrison ripped off the Chiffons, Dukes of Stratoshear ripped off the Beatles and the Beach Boys.

Of course, it was about $150 less than this one, but I think the money was well spent, since the kids use it more often and together.It took my husband a few hours to put it together and attach all of the stickers, too.

Maybe it has to do with the age of the film (the animation is about 15 years old), but the videotape version is superior in terms of quality picture.

DO NOT buy this DVD. Wings of Honneamise is an awesome movie. A truly excellent film in its own right, and top notch anime. Also, the extras are far better than your normal anime DVD. There are plenty of reviews for this title which will tell you about the story and its triumphs. Unfortunately, everyone who has written a review with more than one star has done you a diservice: This DVD is poor quality. Primarily, any time there is any quick action on screen, bars will appear over the picture. Second, the picture is not sharp at all, akin to a well used VHS. If you must own this movie, go for the VHS. Manga has cheated everyone who purchased this disk by doing a poor transfer. Before buying this disk, I did not even know you could botch a DVD this badly.

While it does have excellent special effects, there is definitely something missing in the plot. The story line is contiguous, and there are a couple of parts in the movie that have some humor. The downfall of the movie, in my opinion, is that there is somewhat of a heavy religious undertone. I believe there was only one good action scene in the film in which an assassin chases the main character through the city. Other than that, the movie was, without a doubt, made for the Animae fans that enjoy more artistic movies than action movies. So, for those fans looking for an action movie or a film that they can stay attached to, don't stop here.

The plot is mundane, quite ordinary, not out of the realm of possibilities but all the same engrossing. The comedy takes a back stage but is not completely nonexistant as there are quite a few moments that will make you chuckle. Where this anime truly shines is the exquisite character development and design. The characters seem truly real to the viewer. It takes you in so that you actually care what happens to them.

It is set in a kind of \\"what if\\" universe in a post-WW2 era, but its message about the corruption of power and the futility of war transcends its fantasy world and can be applied to anywhere in the world today.The characters are well developped, the story engrossing, the jokes hilarious, and the facial expressions priceless. It's interesting to see Shiro (the main character) develop from a depressed, non assertive slacker into a national hero, and realize it came about from a leap of faith based on the naive and moral ideals of a young religious woman.The animation itself is superb, and I would consider the lauch scene near the end as perhaps the most amazing minute of animation I have seen.

As subjects, Merwin takes nature, aging and friendships. He peppers these with haunting feelings of hollowness, biblical allusions, and the occasional phrase that I cannot reconcile to the poems containing it.

The book describes at a high level how to begin, manage, and execute projects, such as modifying applications or creating interfaces to applications outside of JDE.It then describes in detail how to work with the software, make changes, optimize an AS/400, and other maintenance issues. Finally, the book discusses what you need to know if you intend to upgrade your system to oneworld.A number of things in the book were particularly helpful to me.

I found the manuscript rife with errors in the minor details of eleventh century military affairs. Admittedly the overall timeline of the First Crusade is rigidly adhered to and the personalities of the historic figures encountered follow accepted ideas, but the passages describing training, arming and fighting fail to impress on either an historical or dramatic level. I have rarely read a less colourful novel. The rich, varied and exciting land and city scapes of the era and area are glossed over with little or no description. It feels rather like reading an old print of a silent picture fading into obscurity. The main character is unredemptive in almost every way imaginable and equally as colourless as the setting.

I grew up in Sweden but ended up fighting drugs and crime while providing housing in American public housing neighborhoods, still buttressed by that Pippi can-do/never-give-up spirit. I'm still lifting horses over my head and scaring the bad guys, all the while having the time of my life. Thank you Pippi and thank you Astrid Lindgren!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Special Wordbook","review":"I highly recommend this unusual resource. Kohl compiled these short essays to help his college students build necessary vocabulary in particular study areas, and each chapter deals with a different discipline. His theory was that ordinary dictionary definitions don't give enough \\"meat\\" to allow someone unfamiliar with a technical term to really learn to use it. So he not only defines the words, he gives them a context, and sets the whole into a deeper context of a field of study. Thus, the literature chapter introduces \\"deconstructionism,\\" \\"incunabula\\" and \\"magic realism,\\" as well as \\"hyperbole,\\" \\"irony,\\" \\"simile\\" and so forth. The arts, the sciences, the social sciences, logic and religion are among the areas he covers. Really useful for a college-level student, or anyone learning about a new discipline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy book for learning or review","review":"My senior English teacher recommended this book to us as a good reference in preparation for college. I bought it then, read it then, learned the basics about a lot of terms I wasn't intimately familiar with. Over the years, I'd reference it from time to time, until I loaned it out at some point. Recently bought a new copy for my wife and I to have as a continued reference. So, worth buying a second time. Obviously, much of what is here is now available on the internet in much greater detail; however, the book does an excellent job of condensing the topics to easily digested morsels. Reading the corresponding article in Wikipedia will probably net you more information, but it might not be the concise summary that is sometimes all you need.

Bell utilises discourse analysis to demonstrate how different discourses have contributed to the concept of incest, how these have shaped the criminalisation of incest and how incest is problematised. This is an excellent piece of work where Foucauldian deconstructive techniques are juxtaposed with contemporary feminist thought, raising new dilemmas and challenges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this boring and poorly written book","review":"It's difficult to say what the worst feature of this book is.

I would give it zero stars if that was an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please try again, Mr. Leonard.","review":"Just because this novel is mediocre shouldn't discourage Elmore Leonard from settings such as Cuba in 1898. I'm a big fan of his tried and true stuff, yet I was chomping at the bit to read this new breed of Leonard. At times the novel is great, but I agree with another reviewer who wondered if Leonard had to meet a deadline: the tail end of the book is just awful. This Leonard work is best ignored.

What is he trying to prove with this book? Non of the classic Leonard is here...no rich character developement, no rich story line, no irreverent humor. This book is just boring, period. Please Elmore, Please, Please, Please do what you do best...and not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"After reading (and loving) Get Shorty, I was terribly disappointed by Cuba Libre. Initially intrigued by Virgil Webster, the U.S. Marine who survives the explosion of the USS Maine, I was soon forced to watch his freefall into banality, where he was joined by the other dull, lifeless characters who infect this book. Nobody seems interesting enough to care about, and my biggest regret is that Fidel Castro wasn't around to execute the whole lot of them. In addition, the plot is frail, predictable and offers little more originality than a lukewarm spaghetti western. The dialogue, one of Leonard's strongest suits, is uninspired and lacks any depth or humor. Somehow, I managed to finish it; I don't know whether to consider that a victory or some form of self-flagelation."},{"rating":"1","title":"a good, but misplaced western","review":"CUBA LIBRE was my first Elmore Leonard. I enjoyed his understated, action-packed prose. I could see he had researched the Spanish Peninsulares, usually absent from most histories and novels. But Leonard included not a single Cuban mambi or officer as a character. And the war was nothing more than a distant disturbance to his rather predictable plot. In the last chapter, Leonard has a reporter \\"tell\\" the battles of Las Guasimas, El Caney and San Juan Hill to the disinterested antagonist. I am an avid reader of Robert Stone and Tim O'Brien who place their characters in a larger context without sacrificing character or plot. I must also admit that I have been researching and writing a novel about the \\"Spanish-Cuban-American War,\\" for the past ten years. \\"SANTIAGO RAG\\" will be published June 22, the anniversary of the American landing at Daiquiri. Look for it on Amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointingly bland rendition without the Leonard \\"feel\\"","review":"Mr Leonard has never had to rely on historic events to set up a wonderful mix of characters and incredible circumstances for his stories. I feel that this work was more an effort of his staffers than of himself. This book was as flat as those \\"James Bond 007's\\" which Ian Flemming did not write. My wait for a new EL continues"},{"rating":"2","title":"A historically correct, very entertaining story.","review":"Elmore Leonard has totally changed the subject matter for this story from what he usually writes about(contemporary crime), to international crime commited by countries and individuals brilliantly! This story takes place during the time of the Spanish American War in Cuba. The characters are so vividly drawn that you can easily picture in your mind each participant. The story mixes history and fiction beautifully. And what Leonard does is to once again show the weakness and strength of human resolve in the face of temptation(i.e.money). This is just one pleasurable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I felt that there were too many plot threads that received scant attention. Just the story of the Maine and the war would have been enough. Tyler's story of being a cowboy would have been enough. We had to go through yet another dreary telling of all the cold blooded killing and torture that occured to boot. That stuff gets real old."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disapointment!","review":"Elmore Leonard must have been to busy writing screenplays to write this novel - he must have hired a ghost writer. Not up to Leonard's standards established over years of writing terrific thrillers.The characters rate a 1. The plot rates a 1. And the prose rates a 1. That's how I came up with an overall 3.If he decides to write a sequel to this one, I'll pass!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Genre writing at its very best","review":"Genre writers don't get any better than Elmore Leonard, noted for his gritty crime novels, many of which have been made into movies. This one cries out for the young Robert Redford and Katharine Ross (remember Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid?)and the big screen. Ben Tyler is the noble cowboy with a bankrobbing past and Amelia Brown is the beautiful woman who is no better than she should be, in this story set against the bombing of the USS Maine and the opening days of the Spanish-American War in Cuba in 1898. Villains you love to hate, appealing lovers, and the stereotypical Elmore Leonard con man who winds up with the loot. Engrossing, fast-moving, action-packed, and a lot of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was disgustingly bad","review":"I picked this up in a used bookstore (thank god i didnt pay full price) and planned to read it on vacation. After 100 pages, I threw it in the garbage. This dialouge is unrealistic; the characters talk like illiterate third graders. Worse than that it the bland character structure. It was just an annoying piece of dribble. Although i liked the movie get shorty and Jackie brown, I won't subject myself to his writing again.Leonard could do less damage if he was drunk behind the wheel of an automobile instead of behind a typewriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elmore Leonard fun with a western twist","review":"Elmore Leonard is one of those authors that I almost can't go wrong with. I haven't read more than half a dozen of his books but they've all been pretty good. This one is too. Basically a western transplanted to Cuba. The main character is a cowpoke who just got out of jail for robbing banks (he was just trying to get the money he was owed though) who gets involved with a scheme to ship horses from America to Cuba and sell them for a handsome profit.Things go awry though when he falls for a gal and then ends up in prison and war breaks out. And $40,000 on a train too.I liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not up to Leonard's other books","review":"In Cuba Libre, Leonard tries too hard to fill his canvas with a host of characters.

There really is no payoff, just a dragging of baggage to a conclusion. Unsatisfying and dull.Pass on this one whether you're an Elmore fan or not.EKW"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly predictable!!","review":"This was my first Leonard novel, and it will probably be my last. The whole book read like a bad movie. More emphasis was placed on the characters physical appearance than on development of the story. It was as if he was picturing the actor who was to play the character on screen. I predict this is made into a TV movie within the next couple of years and will be just as bad as \\"The Last Don.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Historically apropos, characters delightful, plot consistent","review":"The Spanish-American war occurred in 1898 and Elmore Leonard creates an American Western slung back to that time to commemorate the event. He does this masterfully with good characters who mix it up in the same quirky manner as his crime novel counterparts. At some point in all of Leonard's books a Dodge City street-gunfight type conflict is simulated and unforeseen twists- of-fate befall the good and bad. Cuba Libre is no different and delivers in true Leonard fashion. A good quick read which like all historical novels teaches you something about the period you didn't know, yet doesn't sacrifice the fictional dream in doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"History!

His work is just soooo unbelievably boring. I gave up on him after \\"Pronto,\\" but decided to give him one more chance with \\"Cuba Libre.\\" Take it from me, this is not worth your time or money. It is drab as the rest of his writing, his plot and characters are, as usual, trite in the most extreme sense, and he does nothing to break the generic cliches of crime/western fiction. Bottom line: Elmore Leonard is the epitome of overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy is a vastly over-rated writer","review":"I'm sorry, but I just couldn't get through to the utter end of this book. I sloughed through about 80% of it ... getting less & less interested in their lives, adventures & especially in their loves. All you have to do is compare the narrative style of old-timer \\"adventure\\" writers like Hemingway, Conrad and yes, even Fitzgerald, to see that Leonard is second rate. His \\"love scenes\\" are especially pathetic -- with the cardboard cut-out characters touching their lips without generating any reader response at all. Read \\"Empire by Default\\" instead if you want an exciting yarn (true) about the Spanish American War. And read Hemingway, Remarque or Crane if you want a terrific & compelling war novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"With a book like this, who needs Nytol?","review":"This is a book that not even a triple shot espresso could save. Well written but so utterly uninteresting that it redefines boredom. The only thing original about the story is its setting (Havana before and during the Spanish American War). This is the kind of book that the big publishing houses put out relying on the author's name recognition to sell copies. It's a lot like The Phantom Menace in that no one had the guts to tell George Lucas the script was horrible and look what happened there (I'm going for the record with not helpful votes with that comment). It's not that the book is terrible, it's just nothing, not good, not bad, just a bunch of paper with ink on it, sadly the kind of thing publishers are willing to take a chance on these days in their collective pursuit of maximum sales regardless of literary merit (or lack thereof).

As with all Minnesota Klezmer Band efforts, the musicianship is nothing short of world class. Joe Vass' compositions again reward with engaging hooks and soulful turns. If you enjoy 'show tunes' several of the tracks have that feel to them, with strong narrative elements. Songs like Book of Ruth and The World to Come pull at your heart and mind together in a manner that makes most popular music seem goofy by comparison. Overall, the fusing of Jewish traditional, jazz variants and the blues creates a flavor that is the trademark of this band.

There is some useful information in it but it was written, IMO, as a theory as to what was going to happen in the final few years of the 20th century and Mr. Gross got it wrong. We saw the biggest rise and fall in the history of the market, not the 6 percent that Mr. Gross predicted. Rather than focusing so narrowly on what he believed was going to happen in a specific time period I was hoping for a general book and am disappointed because this book is dated."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"obviously i'm in the minority here, but i can't say that i learned anything from this book. he's a great bond fund manager, but imho he just doesn't convey any useful info in this book. his prose is fine, but i didn't learn a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short on content, includes stuff that doesn't work","review":"This is a short book on codes with some devices to be used for study. I thought it would be good for my 10 year old nephew. There is a set of code keys with lights and wire to allow morse signaling from room to room; these items could not work as assembled, battery requirements were listed as 2 AAA, the unit needs 4 AA, and it needed to be rewired since the interconnecting wire dropped too much voltage to signal the other key. I also needed to replace lamps (one was bad) with 3 volt lamps. There is obviously NO quality control even at the design stage. The text is too thin to be of any use. Overall, very dissapointing. If you bought this item, email me for instructions on making it usable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a brief overlook","review":"This book gives you just a brief overlook in the complex situation on the Balkan in the years 1941-1944. Sides participating in this conflict are just basically mentioned lacking more detailed description, especially of the various auxiliaries forces (chetniks are represented us unifying movement, for example, although there was several fraction inside this movement, some of the parties involved are not mentioned at all). Operation that Germans conducted against guerillas are just briefly mentioned without any detailed explanations, on the tactical levels non what so ever. I was hoping to find something more about Jagdkommando units, but even though author did inform us of the existence of such units, there is nothing about organizations or operations that such units conducted. So it may be a good book if you just begin to research the subject, but if you want to form a full picture you will need further reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Scenery","review":"While the story was a little slow it was nice to see the wonders of the Amazon rain forest and to be reminded of what it holds for our future.

True, this is historical fiction. The names have been replaced but it's easy enough to research the actual participants. This is a story of mismanagement, greed and inadequate supervision that takes place mostly during the Vietnam War. The really sad part is that the funding that was intended for American troops on the front lines were siphoned away by \\"Saigon Queens\\" and contractors who were only after a profit fr themselves. Greed and corruption are occuring even today in our current Middle eastern conflicts at the expense of our Soldiers and Marines. We need someone with backbone in the State Department and DoD to cut these leeches off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiery, passionate soul crooner who should have been much bigger than he was","review":"With a deep voice recalling Teddy Pendergrass and a similarly romantic style, Gene Rice (born in 1950) might have been almost as big had he been around in the 70s or 80s, but the hip-hop dominated 90s just didn't seem to care about deep, bellowing soul belters anymore. This album is full of great soul ballads and a few slightly more uptempo tracks; best recommended is the sizzling ballad \\"I Can't Wait\\", which has all the passion of a great 70s soul ballad, but also has a nicely understated melody that is good for the 90s."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a good product while I used it","review":"My new car didn't have the cassette player so I really don't use it anymore.

I rely on Global Underground to not release CRAP and this is nothing short of CRAP. I have bought every Global Underground CD and DVD they sell and this is by far NOT of the calibur I am used to receiving. Extremely disappointed - especially coming from Sasha who's Involver is one of the all time greatest mixes I have ever heard. What happened? I think we need a public apology from the presidents of Global Underground. PLEASE do NOT buy this album so they get the message. I feel totally burned this time for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop listening to it...","review":"I've seen Sasha at least 30 times and I rarely felt that the mix albums reflected the live experience. I thought Involver was OK but only had about 3 really good tracks and it didn't have the sense of flow that his live sets have. Fundacion is the opposite - virtually every track is awesome and it has a sense of a consistent whole whilst also pushing the limits of the technology that is around today. The James Holden and Andre Kraml tracks are particular standouts. This CD will remind you of why Sasha's still consistently voted as the world's best DJ."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album does not disappoint. Give it a chance.","review":"Granted, much opinion on this album lies in personal opinion and taste. However, this album really does tend to grow on you after a couple of listens.I'll keep this review short and sum this album up with this:If your favorite Sasha album is Airdrawndagger:You will probably really enjoy this album. It has a very similar mood - It is very lush and flowing and there are great progressive beats throughout.If your favorite Sasha album is Involver:This may not be your cup of tea. Involver was more breaks, more vocal, not as leniant in the direction of progressive, and most definitely not lush. Not to say if you liked Involver you will not like Fundacion, because I would still definitely recommend it to you - give it a fair chance.

As often the case by the third movie, this series has lost pretty much all its steam. Foley is no longer that funny, (in fact, at times, he is uncharacteristicly angry), major players like John Ashton, Ronny Cox, and Paul Reiser are gone, and that cool feel to Foley's presence is all but gone.This time, Axel's boss in Detriot bites the bullet meaning no silly excuse for leaving town or crazy schemes to cover up the fact that he's gone. Hell, he doesn't even use some clever idea to get into the park for free like he did before, he just whines about ticket prices and comes back to pay. Terrible. This character just isn't the same as he once was.There are a few fun moments here and there but Beverly Hills Cop III. is definetly the very least of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Collection of Cameo Performances ever!!!","review":"There are so many great cameo performances in this film that it's great fun to see. I'm a real big Sherman Brothers buff (the Sherman Brothers wrote \\"It's A Small World\\" and all the songs for \\"Mary Poppins\\") and Eddie Murphy loves their films (especially Chitty Chitty Bang Bang-- it's his fave) so he had them write a \\"Small World\\" like song for this film and Robert Sherman even makes a cameo in the bar scene. It's incredible!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad!","review":"I didn't see Beverly Hills Cop or Beverly Hills Cop II but I saw Beverly Hills Cop III on a cable movie channel and I didn't think it was that bad I actually kind of liked it, yeah it's not Academy award material but it was fun to watch and I liked Eddie Murphy and Judge Reinhold and the action in the movie was good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Lethal Weapon 4 look like a great sequel","review":"I heard they might make a part 4, what''s it gonna be called ? \\"Return to Wolly World\\" ? lol. This is a very mildly entertaining 3rd sequel that brings Foley to a fun park called Wolly World to face some new villains. The results is an often very [bad] film with a script that should of stayed in the garbage. If you have any interest at all in it just rent it don't buy it. Buy the first 2, this one is so bad it pretty near ruined Murphy's career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie isn't great - but the park shots are now classics.","review":"Well, in my opinion this movie is the reason the Beverly Hills Cop series stopped at three (rather than even thinking of going further). The movie itself is pretty poor, especially if you are expecting to see another Eddie Murphy film where you're just on-the-floor from laughing so hard -- this movie really missed that mark, I think.The only reason I own this movie, quite honestly, is because I live within a few miles of the amusement park that it was filmed in and I remember being there when they were working up the sets (Paramont's Great America (or PGA) in Santa Clara, CA)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't have been made","review":"The original Beverly Hills Cop is a classic. The 2nd one was just as good. Both had a perfect blend of action, comedy, and suspense. The fact that they waited to make this 3rd installment so many years later (during Eddie's current streak of terrible movies) should have told everyone making this movie right off the bat that it was a bad idea. John Landis (who usually makes pretty good flicks) took over the directing for this one and let's just say it's not something he should be proud to have on his resume. In a nutshell, this movie is just campy... knee slapper jokes, lame plot, etc. The spirit and integrity of the first two movies is completely lost in this 3rd one. It's a shame too how you go from making two great movies to a third that's not just below par, but stinks to the high heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beverly Hills Cop III","review":"The first two films of this trilogy are great. If you have never seen them, I recommend that you go to your local rental store and rent them. As for this one, it's horrible. This is the worst one to me. I hated the theme park story, or was it just the theme park music that was annoying? Anyway, avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beverly Hills Cop III","review":"Beverly Hills Cop III~ Eddie Murphy is not a terrible movie. Then again if you compare this sequel to the two first movies then one must say that it is a disappointment. Eddie Murphy is not nearly as funny as in the first two movies and the script is half lame as if they had run out of ideas. The plot is paper thin, and a total hoot compared to the two previous movies. Man, I was really looking forward to watching this movie after having seen the two other movies.

Murphy was in a carrer slump and I guess he made this film to help out his carrer but it didn't help just sunk it deeper. The film is full of mistakes such as the loss of Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckhiemer a weak script and a lack of action. John Landos who worked with Murphy before and made good films fails here. The film needed a good action director like Renny Harlin,Dwight H. Little or even Karthyn Bigelow who were all at the top of their game back in 94. Skip this one even if you're a die hard Murphy fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie confirms that the part 3s and 4s always suck!","review":"Part 1 and part 2 were great.

I could totaly relate to the lead actor playing the son and the family as well because I was about the lead son's age when my father suddenly died. So I loved how there was a show that can totally show what I went through. The only difference I find not real was the fact that the father of the show is so rich, he doesn't even charge his patients for his practice. I find that a little unrealistic because majority of widows out there are not millionares.

None of it has anything to do with Colorado. The Pilot was shot in Calgary, I guess, but everyone knew that humans don't belong there so they were forced to find a new location for the show's sets, atmosphere and surroundings.

The story is compelling, and the acting very good. The challenges faced by all three family members as they deal with grief and try to integrate into this community, feel right.

I started watching this show when it was halfway through the 2nd season on ITV and just had to buy season 1. Then when I went back to college, I couldnt watch it anymore.

What I got, however, was a disappointment. The case was broken, all of the dvd's fall out when I open it and half of the episodes either don't play or skip (I miss 3/4 of the episodes). Very disappointing. Save your money. I will not be ordering from here again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...","review":"Wow. What can I say. This is the worst, most predictable, badly acted show I've ever seen. I think it epitomizes the lazy thought so prevelant in America today. What is wrong with these people who like this crap? What redeeming qualities does this show have? I personally would rather sit down with a good book than have to go through this. The list of predictable, gag-me-with-a-spoon, sappy, and corny subjects that this parodic brain-rotter manages to ring off in a sigle episode is incredible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting","review":"I cannot even begin to explain how much I love Everwood. Everwood is real and while watching it, I often find myself pulled in and routing for Ephram and Amy and all of the other characters.

I just watched the latest episode tonight, in fact, and I loved it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good as I remembered!","review":"Very enjoyable! I had forgotten how much enjoyable this series was!

Such an amazing series for a family to watch together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought it after listening to 5 seconds of Act Appalled","review":"This is probably one of my favorite cds of all time. I'm usually listening to metal and hardcore, but I do enjoy most styles of music and this cd especially caught my ear's attention. I love the progressive rock feel and the delay effects on the guitar. The bass line is easily heard and the drumming is great. Nothing is turned up too loud. Last but not least, Anthony Green's amazing voice rounds everything off with. I'm glad he left Saosin and formed this band. It was probably the best decision for him considering how amazing this band is. My personal favorite songs are We're All Theives and The Great Golden Baby. There is a hidden track after Meet Me In Montauk, which I have been listening to quite a bit. It's been called House Of Leaves, although I'm not quite sure if that is the actual title. If you like melodic rock/emo, get this now. Circa Survive will amaze you."},{"rating":"2","title":"give it a good listen...","review":"i definitely understand why people don't like this band: they're not really emo, not really hardcore, not really prog-rock. instead, they fused together a different kind of sound which is really layered and atmospheric but with a lot of energy and complexity.i have to admit, it took me a while for this album to grow on me. but now i walk around repeating lyrics and humming guitar strums. take your time with this album, 1 track at a time and you might be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"omg","review":"OMG! This album is soooo good. I don't usually like music that is poppy, but I couldn't help it. I learned about CS from listening to Saosin,(also a great band) and I just fell in love. You have to buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Totally not for me. It may be becasue every track sounds alike, and that they sound like every other band out there, but this is definitely an album you can skip over and not miss anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really cool......but then...","review":"The cool cover drew me in. I then downloaded the tune ACT APPALLED and was floored at how cool this band was. The music was hard, cool, and unique. I was really exited because this was the first band that really rocked with a female singer. I was set to buy, however I was curious about the band so I sought more info. Upon reading (and re-reading in disbelief) that the lead vocalist was in fact a dude, my interest deflated like a balloon over open flame. He REALLY sounds like a chick. Damn shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You Anthony Green","review":"This is such a great cd. I think is better than Saosin, partly because it is so diverse. On the Saosin Cd, I didn't know if it was the next song or not. This is much better.Thanks Anthony Green."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Let's just say that I'm glad that the almighty Dredg are bringing these guys along with them on their upcoming tour.

Can't wait to see you guys in June!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiohead it ain't. but close","review":"I love this band. They give me a radiohead vibe to them. I enjoy their writing and along with the vocals and music in the cd. One of the best cd's to come out this year.."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd but aint no saosin","review":"this Cd is definatley a great cd. I dont think they are gonna be the next big thing cuz they have more of an aquired taste and i dont see mainstream fans going for it. I can see saosin fans chekcing this out and some may be disapointed. People this is not saosin. Dont expect the same vocals. I am a huge saosin fan and was expecting more energetic singing like saosin and from all the reviews about them saying they incorporated metal with them. But people its a different band totally. Im gonna miss the old saosin cuz the new singer is good but doesnt do the band justice like Green did. But ya, def check this cd out"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars & Then Some...","review":"Anthony Green, Ex-Singer: Saosin, has outdone himself vocally and lyrically.

I've heard lots about them and about how good Anthonys' voice is. So i decided to just go out and buy the album and i was not dissapointed 1 bit. His vocals are amazing and the music is just so beautifly played out. Everytime i listen to this album i get goosebumps and chills down my spine. Ive been listening to this cd at work non stop. A couple have been saying it doesnt live up to his Saosin days but this is a different type of band so you realy cant compare the two bands. Yes Saosin was an amazing band also but i dont think he should have made the same band twice. This cd is a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLY AMAZING","review":"When i first heard this cd i noticed something very different about it. THIS CD IS ALMOST HYPNOTIC. This cd from beginning to end is put together absolutely perfect and the ambience and atmosphere the guitars make for the music is perfectly fit for the songs. Not to mention, the vocals are top-notch (I wouldnt expect anything less from Green.) A GREAT BUY! Pick this cd up now if you want to hear something fresh that the music scene has needed for quite a while now.A MUST BUY FOR ANY MARS VOLTA FANS."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad at all","review":"I'm pretty satisfied with the music included on the CD. I got it for the first track (\\"Brass Roots\\"), which I couldn't find on any other album. \\"Brass Roots\\" is no less than an all out intensely fun number. The final track, \\"Rhapsody for Now,\\" a melange of popular melodies, was new to me, and I expect it should have broad appeal.All in all, it's a worthwhile listen, albeit short at less than 30 minutes in length. Unless you have dollar bills for comfort between your mattress and sheets, avoid the ~$75 new (out of print) CD. Used copies can be had much more cheaply, and have the exact same music! The copy I got was in excellent condition, and looked new.Severinsen fans: Get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BE VERY CAREFUL","review":"Length:: 0:32 MinsI had a bad experience with this terrible product, which I believe is probably a health hazard. These tiles shed a dark gray powder whenever they are touched. It comes off on one's skin and clothing and is worse than sand from the beach. This is the second shipment I've received after I returned the first one for the same reason. I was told that this was a normal function of a flame retardant spray that snows off for the duration of the product. I was able to return it for a refund, (including shipping because I expressed so much dissatisfaction). I have to say that in my experience Parts Express is a pretty good vendor who is interested in your satisfaction. But if you are going to be satisfied with this product, you will need to use it in a way where you won't be exposed to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"Put this up against a wall to muffle sound but not effective. Material is not dense, more like packing styrofoam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pictures - but shaky","review":"I've owned Sony Hi8 cameras before and finally decided to jump to MiniDV with this Panasonic GS200.While this Panasonic really delivers great picture quality and colour, my real gripe is the stability of the image when hand-held ... it's awful compared to a Sony (yes, I did have image stability turned on!) It really needs to be used with a tripod.Other features of the camera are impressive although it has too many things crammed into menu's. Some things are difficult to find - especially when adding titles. I really miss the thumb-wheel navigation that a Sony has.Also impressed with the digital stills, although when compared with a digital stills camera, the images are fuzzy around sharp edges.Overall, it serves my purposes as I need good picture quality and colour. The 3CCD's are excellent and battery life is reasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic GS200","review":"First off......why are all concerned about low light capabilities....most cameras are lowsy without some sort of external bulb. I had a GL2 which i recently sold because i no longer need to documentaries, and that camera needed an external light. Also the image stabilization is a joke. Like recent reviews. If you want perfection on screen then use a tripod and remote. Usually using the zoom won't keep you steady anyway. The GL2 had a powerful zoom but was shaky when held by hand. Gl2 is an awesome Prosumer camera. But thats what its for, a semi professional who is using it for non home use. The Panasonic GS200 is a superb below 1000 bucks small compact camera that is comparable in 3CCD video clarity as the GL2. I give the GS200 3 thumbs up. Those extra little features are for movie makers people, not Joe Schmo who is videoing his daughters sweet 16 and making a momento for future reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent one volume work.","review":"This reprint of a restricted 1944 War Department Publicationis a companion to the Handbook on German Military Forces,but necessarily smaller as much less was known about the forcesof the Empire at that time. It is an admirable work nonetheless,containing everything of possible use to an Army officer facingthe enemy: organization, tactics, weapons and equipment, uniformsand insignia, extensively illustrated and with a glossary ofmilitary terms and map signs. An essential resource for WWIIbuffs, writers and readers of military history, collectors, and modellers."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good enough","review":"I am not satisfied with my k2s. The wheels disintegrated on me when skating on hot pavement. Two went out on the same skate!The other thing is, I really don't like the cushy boot. I want my skates to be firm against my legs. My rollerblades had a ratchet system which could tighten the boots well. The K2s don't and thus the feel is very sloppy and loose around my ankles. I will never buy K2s again."},{"rating":"2","title":"very funny, I especially liked the Morrisey tribute","review":"If you've seen Dana Gould before you'll love this CD, all new material.

Absolutely one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some magic performances here","review":"Torvill and Dean shine in \\"You Don't Send Me Flowers,\\" Paul Wylie is great performing to Miss Saigon, and Underhill and Martini have a great routine too, to Unchained Melody. There are some older skaters show here, Robin Cousins, John Curry, Dorothy Hamill and Peggy Fleming, but there is no Michelle Kwan here or Oksana Baiul. If you have a love for some of the older skaters who aren't skating anymore, this video is fine for only a couple of skaters shown in this video are actually performing now days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some good performances here","review":"This video doesn't have Michelle Kwan in it. It does have pairs team Ekaterina Gordeeva & her late husband in a mediocre program \\"Meditations\\", pairs Carruthers in boring \\"America the Beautiful\\" pairs I. Rodina & hubby A. Zaitsev in a nice program, and Underhill & Martini in sexy \\"Unchained Melody\\" program. For dance, wonderful Torvill & Dean \\"You Don't Send Me Roses,\\" and Klimova & Ponomarenko nice program. They also have Scott Hamilton (boring), Peggy Fleming, Robin Cousins(catchy), Dorothy Hamill, Janet Lynn, Toller Cranston, John Curry, Kristi Yamaguchi (ugh, Pretty Woman routine), Paul Wylie \\"Why God, Why,\\"and Brian Boitano, if anyone's interested. Overall, I liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best performance compilations in existence","review":"The performances on this video are all classics. Best of all are Torvill and Dean's I Won't Send Roses, Paul Wylie's Why God and Underhill and Martini's Unchained Melody. It would be worth twice the price just to have those three excellent performances. But there are plenty of other worthy ones, Kitty and Peter Carrethers, Kristi Yamaguchi, Gordeeva and the late Sergei Grinkov and the never to be forgotten one of Brian Boitano skating on that beautiful Alaskan lake.It is truly a shame that this was never released on DVD. I would rebuy it if it were. But if you have not seen it and have a VHS player don't let the technological limitations of the medium keep you from seeing some of the most beautiful, captivating, moving performances on ice ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"satisfied","review":"I personally am not much into the older footage of figure skating, because I came into the love of skating around 1992. I remember Kristi Yamaguchi winning the Olympic medal and since then I've been hooked. This tape is ok for me up until the very last 3-4 performances. The joy of viewing Paul Wylie, the sexiness of Underhill and Martini, and the pure joy of watching Brian Boitano skating as beautifully and as purely as the snow capped mountains around him made this purchase worthwhile. Kristi Yamuguchi is always fun to watch also."},{"rating":"2","title":"contrology","review":"Most useful for someone familiar with pilates already. Interesting to see how pilates has evolved from contrology to present day pilates. I found the book to be an informative addition to my pilates library."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time, buy a more instructional book","review":"This book was written in the early 1900's and represents a plea for Americans to reconsider their lifestyle and begin adopting healthier habits. While many of the tenents are somewhat applicable to modern life, the entire book is little more than a rambling, redundant series of complaints against society. I was waiting for the solutions to come, instructions about returning to a healthy lifestyle or actual pilates exercises, but that cannot be found in this book. His writing is more draining than inspiring. I would recommend finding a book with actual pilates exercise instruction and theory rather than bitter, unreasonable rants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Beginner","review":"This book is overpriced and of poor quality. The paper and printing are well below current standards even though it was published in 2000. I really wasted my money on this. I did find his ranting about society in general somewhat interesting. Seems people complained about the same things in 1934 that they do now: Society is in a mess and the media is mainly at fault for this. What is the cure for all these ills? The Pilates Method.If you are looking to get started with Pilates excercises don't buy this book. You can buy two or three of the others for the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought!","review":"I've been doing Pilates sessions now for a year and bought this because it is written by Joseph H. Pilates who developed the system. I've enjoyed the other one or two books on Pilates around at the moment but thought this might give a new insight. I just could not get into this book and, strange to say, found it not to be at all relevant for someone like myself who enjoys Pilates as a form of exercise. It is not an easy read and this is not helped by the surprisingly poor quality of the book as a whole - poor b&w reproduction. I can see that this might give some useful background for Pilates teachers but don't believe it adds anything for the 'layperson'. Have I missed the plot or does anyone else out there share this view?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. P","review":"Joseph Pilates was a genius. it is great that he is starting to get the recognition he deserves.

The figure ends up capturing that quality particularly well.First and foremost, this figure is really wide and tall. He looks like an enemy that only the biggest Marvel heroes could face. The detail in his skin is most amazing. He feels like some sort of lizard freak monster thing. I know, terribly description but the sculpt is just fantastic.The articulation is the usual Toy Biz Marvel Legend fare for big guys. Which means single jointed elbows. My only gripe here is the that we only need one hand that can turn into a fist. I do enjoy a more open hand.Only reason why this doesn't get 5 stars is that this character isn't my favorite but it's one of the best Marvel Legends ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Mandie Books!","review":"The Mandie books are the best books I've ever read! Mandie and the Hidden Past is one of my favortie ones! I like the way in this book that Mandie is curios about what is in the crack. She is determined to find out and eventually succeeds. I also like it that there is Bible verses in this book. Mandie, Celia, Joe, Jonathan, and others in this book are a great inspiration to me to think before I act, just like Mandie is learning to do. I strongly recamend this book to anyone who likes to read about adveture, History, and anything else! God has truly gifted Lois Gladys Leppard with the gift of writing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than last one, BUT...","review":"But there wasn't much excitement until near the end of the book. And as for Mandie, if she is going to be going to college next year, don't you think she should GROW UP! Everytime anyone says NO, she gets all upset and is even MORE determined to do what they don't want her to do. I have been disappointed with the last book and this one was only slightly better, but hardly a mystery. I don't know why the last two books haven't been that good. But I do hope they start to get better. I really wish Lois Gladys Leppard would have continued writing more books on the Lily adventures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mandie book is not all that Dandy","review":"Oh Lois, Lois, Lois. What have you done? This book was downright awful...The Mandie books are supposed to be about Mandie's life and adventures. The only thing I can say about this book is that there is no true mystery, no imagination, and no creativity. Most Mandie books have captured my senses and made me want to turn page after page, in pursuit of the solution to the mystery. This book just does not do that. There is nothing interesting to read about.Another thing to note: Mandie is growing up, but her attitude doesn't show it. She still acts like a 10 year old that always pouts and is obscene. Lois Gladys Leppard needs to show that Mandie has grown up, because it sure doesn't seem like it.My only hope is that the upcoming books will be more satisfactory.I suggest that you only read this book for the sake of keeping up with the series- not for suspense, mystery, or ingenuity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oven Ware","review":"Thsi product is the perfect size for storing or freezing left over food.

The low price should have been a tipoff. Low budget howler about what were supposed to be Che's final days. What accurate history there was in the film was distorted, without context and, incredibly, the characters portrayed (other than Che Guevara)were either fictional or not sufficiently identified. The CIA operative Felix Rodriguez (a Cuban) who aided the Bolivians in Che's capture, was played as an Anglo by John Ireland!! One of the most egregious historical errors in the film is that Che's entire force is shown to be wiped out in the Yuro Ravine when, in fact, four made it out, into Chile and thereafter to Cuba.

I can't make myself watch more than 3 episodes. The female lead is grating & anxiety ridden.

First of all it is completely ridiculous, but not in any kind of humorous or witty way, just really stupid. The characters are incredibly boring, one of the main characters basically acts like a poorly portrayed child, the others aren't too bad, just not that interesting.The plot of the show itself could do a lot.. but it doesn't. Instead of unraveling a mystery behind the objects, it just shrugs it off and basically says who knows, who cares. And just about every famous person they can think of in history they just say it belonged to them, not adding this to overall the plot or anything. And the \\"villain\\" kind of has no real back story, just some guy that used to work there randomly screwing with them.The show is about a couple people that seem to have no clue how to do their job nearly getting themselves killed every episode trying to place random objects in a vat of goo and store it in a warehouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilarious - really?","review":"Maybe I've got a different Warehouse 13, but the names all match, so I doubt it.

Enjoyable for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasing story about fantasy type stuff.","review":"This DVD is different, with good story lines, for a Sci-Fi buff, but not quite good enough to excuse the lame acting, and garbled storyline that tends to confuse the issue with irrelevancies. The lead guy is annoying. Nothing else can describe him, he is childish, petty minded and annoying. The lead girl is better, but not much. The quality of script leaves a lot to be desired - some of the lines make the actors seem very poor, but they can't be as bad as they appear in some scenes - nobody would employ them if they were, so the script is pretty lame at times. If you are a young teenager, this show might appeal, but an old guy like me will not be buying any other seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Story Lines","review":"I purchased this show not knowing much about it and really got to like it. The family also enjoyed it. The characters are fun and the hidden love between the two main players is always good to give the story a push out of the doldrums as series are inclined to do. We all like a little romance! The warehouse has what seems like 1000's of gadgets so the stories could go on for ever.

I am NOT a handy person by any stretch of the imagination.This product perfectly suited my needs. It is a close enough color match to my cabinets to be relatively unnoticeable. It was easy to install. My advice: make sure your surface is clean and dry, measure twice/cut once. cut a little larger than you need, line up the straight edges along your cabinet edge first, peel the backing, use the edge of a credit card to smooth out the air bubbles, and then use a utility knife to trim the excess.

It is a bit tricky to put on because once it sticks it is difficult to reposition. Also, if you don't get it on smoothly, the bubbles and wrinkles will show through on the other side of the glass. That wasn't a huge concern for my sister but it is something to keep in mind as it does seem like it would be very hard to apply and not have any bubbles or wrinkles. The garage door windows were about four feet wide but only about 17\\" high, so were applied it horizontally (the roll was vertical). If you are placing it on a window vertically (with roll horizontal), it might be a bit easier to get it on smoothly. Hope this makes sense.

It's cheesy, it's cheap, and the inept story begs for forgiveness. But for some crazy reason I keep viewing it. Even with Bela's unrelenting ramblings about who knows what(?), I still believe there is a definate message of understanding for the viewer. Only Ed himself could tell you why that stock footage of a buffalo herd were edited into the film, unless you could have the answere. Personally, I think he was trying to show that the extinction of a species was close at hand. In 1953 that was a certaincy for the bison, and the bigotry associated with it towards humans. Times have certainly changed. Some of it to the worse. But the message in that so-called awfull flick, is alive to-day as it has been, well over forty years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Egads!","review":"Well for those of you who are tired of quality films with rich storylines, try this on for size. Glen or Glenda is an autobiographical documentory based on, starring, and directed by none other than Edward Wood Jr. His hot, real-life girlfriend is along for the ride as well playing the innocent fiance who's man enjoys dressing like a woman. Bela Lugosi is in the film too, but he only occasionally speaks to the audience from a chair in his library.In this film you can learn all types of words like 'transsexual', 'homosexual', 'bisexual', and 'hermaphodite'. Listen to doctors and psychiatrists of the day explain such strange tendacies as straight men dressing as women and the mysterious world of sex change operations. There is a loosely knit plot here somewhere, but it gets lost in all the medical terms and strange character interludes.For those who enjoy drugs while watching a film may well understand this movie more than a sober person.

I did it because someone important on my Santa Claus list asked for it. I think after sitting through it together, we are BOTH sorry now -- though the Ed Wood fan will never admit it.

Bela Lugosi's scenes, in which he sits in a dark room and utters cryptic phrases in a creepy Hungarian accent, form a counterpoint to the cross-dressing story that is funny beyond belief.Like many demented films, this one is made in earnest. Viewing it in earnest will be very very painful. But if you're in the mood for slow-paced but comically incompetent cinema, or if you are stoned, this might be the film for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Ed Wood,this box set is for you.","review":"These three film were in the top 100's,worst film of all time.I personaly did not know who Ed Wood was,Until I saw Tim Burton's movie version.Ever since, I wanted to know more about Ed Wood.I just recently purchase the box set and,let me tell you \\"It was great\\".In some cases you get to see some of the mistakes in these films.All kidding aside these movies are classic.I highly recommend these films.His lust for angora,It's not even the half of it.Ed wood rules!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever Made","review":"In my opinion, this is the worst movie ever made. Plan 9 From Outer Space is like Lawrence Of Arabia compared to Glen or Glenda. I gave it 2 stars because Bela Lugosi's parts are funny. Starts with Bela in a laboratory making some ridiculous Ed Wood speech containing classic quotes as \\"MAN IS WRONG BECAUSE HE DOES RIGHT. RIGHT BECAUSE HE DOES WRONG! PULL DA STRINGS!\\" Then the film is all over the place with stock footage, Wood dressed in women clothes, etc. Some whiney voice saying \\"If the creator wanted us to fly, he'd given us wings.\\" I don't get this movie. I think it might be Ed Wood trying to describe his subconscious on film? I dunno. If you can get through all 70 minutes of this you can get through anything. And those stupid newspaper headlines. There is nothing like this movie. Worth watching once."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dullest movie ever made.","review":"I am a fan of 'bad' movies like the one's Wood produced, but this movie is just painful to watch. Clocking in at a little over an hour it feel's like three. Bela Lagosi is just perposturous and Wood, in the title role, is no better. This was supposed to be his outing himself movie but it is just plain stupid. When Bela looks down on a crowded street and say's, with a stright face, \\"People, always going somewhere\\" you would be wise to just turn the film off. Woods first, and worst film Glen/Glenda is for the hardcore Ed Wood fans. Other's avoid this like the plauge......."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw it, and then saw it again and again...","review":"This was a very good movie, from start to finish, dealing with a lot of intense subjects that a lot of people don't like to talk about. Colin Ferrel shows he's got a big set of balls when he plays the part of a bi sexual male, even though he didn't really do anything when it was his turn to act on his character. He still played the part well, without seeming to give his friend the cold shoulder just because he was different. While the movie does have the momentary drug scene, (this was supposed to be the sixties), and the interaction between the multitude of charaters isn't something you'd find on everyone's list of must see t.v., the movie is really good, the acting really great, and the time well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colin Grows Up","review":"Give Colin Farrell kudos for a rich and wonderful performance as Bobby. When he moves away from big glitzy productions such as SWAT into independent films, he really shines. He is the locus of this satisfying film about love. This film makes no distinctions between hetero and homosexual love. Love just is, regardless of the sexes involved. And now that Sissy Spacek has grown up into independent film, she is really shining. I did not want this film to end. I wanted to know what happened after Robin Penn leaves. The music is equally intrinsic to this film. Thanks to the late Laura Nyro. All in all a gorgeous production hitting all the right notes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional Ride","review":"One thing that makes me consider a movie to be good is the extent to which it makes me feel. This movie ranks among some of my favorite movies because of the range and depth of feelings it was able to produce. If only I could maintain a feeling of love and acceptance of everyone and everything like Colin Farrell's character seemed to portray in my everyday life."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL, ARTISTIC and BEAUTIFUL FILM in great condition!","review":"A BEAUTIFUL, TASTEFUL, and POETIC LOVE STORY!This DVD arrived on time and in great conditon. This movie, \\"moved and touched\\" me deeply. I enoyed every second of it. What a fantastic work of art! This story is about LIFE and Love, as sweet and harsh as it can both be. This should have an academy nomination if not an award. Thank you for making this film. 10 Stars! APPLAUSE! APPLAUSE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this movie","review":"I really wanted to like this movie. I had read the book,and the book was amazing!! The movie changed a lot of the main story line, and it became a mish-mash of ridiculous scenes. If you did not read the book, you might enjoy this, for those of us who did, stay away from this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"What an overwhelming movie!!! Great story, excellent actors, especially Sissy Spacek and Colin Farrell are brilliant and perform a magnificient piece of acting. The movie itself deserves a 5 stars, but there are no extras, no deleted scenes, no interviews, no nothing on it. Therefore I gave it only 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the story NO justice","review":"I saw this movie twice. The first time I didn't like it at all. Then I read the book (which is EXCELLENT) so I decided to give the movie another try. Collin Farrell captured Bobby's character very well, but without reading the book you wouldn't know this. The movie could have been done so much better, it gave absolutely no insight to these characters. Each one, Jonathan, Bobby, Clare and Alice are so complex as are their relationships with one another. The movie doesn't show this at all. Alice, one of my favorite characters in the book comes off totally different in the movie. It's so hard to establish these things in a movie, but this was a very poor attempt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed, Often Beautiful, Poignant Film","review":"Michael Mayer has always gotten great performances from actors on stage and he shows himself adept at repeating this success on film. This is a beautiful film with great moments of humour and knowing tenderness (early scenes with Sissy Spacek, her son, and his best friend listening to Laura Nyro are truly spectacular and almost the admission alone). This movie's heart is always alert even when the some of the charaterizations become a little more fuzzy, particularly Colin Farrell's innocent boy-man. He seems strangely so much more naive as a man than he did as a teenage boy, becoming almost sweetly autistic at times, that he seems more someone's memories of a person than an actual person. Still, it is a wonderful film to sink into and a lovely bunch of people with which to spend a couple of hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can't Go Home","review":"I bought this because it starred Colin Farrell. Unfortunately, his talents were not well used. The interesting thing is that they found someone to play his character as a teenager who looks very much like him. This is supposed to take place in New York in the 70's and 80's but it lacked a real sense of place. However, there are some fine actors in the film and, in the end, I found it interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!","review":"This movie contains several taboo situations, which having been raised in the South, was refreshing to see! I've had several of my friends watch it, as some of the issues and confussions seen in the movie really relate to life situations of a lot of people. The ending hits a little suddenly, which is the result of the one star off, should only be a half off... Overall, a wonderful movie from my perspective, others of my friends did not enjoy it as much, but I guess it hit me on a more personal level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Dated, Disappointing Melodrama","review":"Yet another movie where the gay man ends up sexless and alone, finds a KS spot, and dies of AIDS.The novel was good, but in a distinctly 1990's sort of way. Now this material seems outdated, mundane, and depressing.Other than that, Colin Farrell is surprisingly good (for a change) but the script is so flowery that one never once believes these are real people in real situations. These are just literary characters, moving down a well-trodden path towards a predictible conclusion.\\"More atmosphere than plot and more character-driven than story, A Home at the End of the World never manages to engage viewers. It keeps the audience at arm's length throughout, never letting us get inside the mind of two of the characters, and the motivations of the third are so paper-thin and apparent that the tremendous amount of time devoted to backstory is unwarranted.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"hit the delete","review":"I was suckered into watching this horrible film because on the DVD cover Roger Ebert described it as \\"one of the best films of the year.\\" I could not disagree more; after watching it I was still searching for \\"a plot at the end of the film.\\" What plot there is I found entirely unbelievable. Bobby Powell grew up smoking pot, which he introduces to his high school friend Jonathan, and to Jonathan's mother Alice. He also shared sex with Jonathan and an erotic flirtation with Alice. When Jonathan and Bobby meet years later as adults, Bobby fathers a child with Clare, Jonathan's live-in friend with purple hair. Bobby claims, \\"I just want everyone to be happy.\\" The \\"family\\" of four moves to Woodstock where they open a cafe. But did we not learn from that generation, if not from our HIV generation, that so-called free love, sex and drugs are very expensive? Only in a Hollywood movie could such a bizarre picture be portrayed as idyllic."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG Colin is too much a hottie to portray him gay","review":"This movie had potential but come on don't make Colin Farrell gay. I liked the senstive side but the kissing and fondling as an adult was a bit much. If you are a huge Colin Farrel fan don't watch this one. The movie would have been better if the friend was gay and Colin wasn't and the ending what a rip off, the girl leaves with the kid and doesn't come back. This wasn't one of the better Farrell moives."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"surprisingly. charming. I wanted to see this movie since long time ago. I like the way gay theme is considered."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my fave films","review":"hard to find and especially at such an amzing price. i watch this over and over and still enojoy it. greta film"},{"rating":"2","title":"Youth, friendship and a Lover's pact","review":"Director Michael Mayer and screen writer Michael Cunningham combined their formidable talents to create an emotional masterpiece which is seldom found in the world of film. This is the tearful story of Young Bobby Morrow (supurbly played by Andrew Chalmer) who is untimely separated from his older brother, but discovers that he is gifted with supreme insight. With it, he establishes a loving and emotional foundation with both his lifetime,companion (Harris Allan) and their triadic lover Sissy Spacek. From his early boyhood days when Love could be found in a kiss or shared at arm length, to the countryside estate which allows him to fulfill his fanciful dreams, the touching story is supremely crafted to illicit the most heart wrenching emotions and delightfully delivers hope and love as a divided. If the viewer possesses a heart, this film will touch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even though the press has only been about one thing ...","review":"The movie was good, but, alas, there was no Colin nudity at all. Instead, we had to be contented to watch his really great performance as a really well-developed character.Robin Wright Penn was excellent, stealing some scenes, but Sissy Spacek owns every single scene she's in. I mean, really. Her scenes MAKE the movie. She's hilarious.The movie starts incredibly well, and its momentum builds until it just slows down to a crawl. Because Cunningham wrote the screenplay based upon his book, I'm not sure why it felt like that to me, like we missed part of the story or part of the book was left out."},{"rating":"1","title":"The design rubs off as soon as you lace up your shoes","review":"I love cute shoelaces, but these are cheap and even the red background is printed on the laces and rubs off on my shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A versatile effective brush worth every penny","review":"This is simply the best brush I have used on both long-haired cats and dogs in the past 15 years. The pins are individually polished to eliminate rough surfaces and the results show in how comfortable the animals are when groomed. The unusual T-shape is easier on the wrists than a conventional pin brush and the workmanship (German) is first-rate. Whenever I see a professionally groomed dog at the dog park that still has mats I find that the owner is not brushing the dog between groomings. Why? Because \\"he doesn't like it.\\" Chances are that owner is using a Chinese made brush purchased without much thought from the local big box store.When those owners have taken my advice and purchased one of these professional brushes from Cherrybrook they have reported excellent results.A great product I use almost every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Essential Fats Waller","review":"This 3 CD boxed set contains 70 selections, played and sung by Thomas \\"Fats\\" Waller, backed up by some of the finest jazz muscians of the 1930's. Originally recorded from December 1936, to April 1938, Fats and his jazz bands, keep your fingers snapping and toes tapping with his signature renditions of songs written by such American icons as Irving Berlin, Guy Lombardo, James McHugh, and Johnny Mercer, as well as his own compositions, written and arranged with the help of his long-time partner, Andy Razaf. His keyboard stylings are unique as are the comments he injects into the lyrics. His instrumental version of \\"The Love Bug Will Get You (If You Don't Watch Out) will have you dancing in no time flat. He makes a jazz masterpiece out of Berlin's \\"Marie\\". For those of you who think Fats Waller is famous only for his Ain't Misbehavin' musical, this CD will show that he was truly a musical genius of the first order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended for the family reference shelf.","review":"From hay fever to headaches and cold sores, this covers the common and often recurrent symptoms which affect individuals and provide safe, easily-applied natural remedies proven to have a positive effect.

I'm so hungry for what I can do with my little guy that I'm buying and reading and viewing everything I can get my hands on. I really liked Aimee Ketchum's DVD. It had SO much more information in it and she is extremely qualified and seems like a nice mommy who really cares about children. Very kind.

It is based on A Course in Miracles. Throughout the years i must have give away around 50 of them. I have also decided to translate it to Czech, my native language. The book was the bestseller even in Communist Russia. It has just a few basic lessons that entertain a possibility that all our problems stem from conflicting thinking. We can train our mind to reverse it. For example a lesson: I am never upset for the reason I think, can help you to relax and look at thinks differently. The world is the mirror of our mind and we can change our thoughts and see the world in a different light. We cannot change the world, but we can change our mind about the world by deciding to change the thoughts that are causing us pain. We are always in charge and all power is within.

Of course, the implementation of those wise maxims is extremely difficult - but the book makes it seem so easy that you might actually try and even succeed.The book essentially is divided into two parts - and can be thought of as a \\"mini Course In Miracles\\" - which is where the author got his inspiration. The first section talks about the preparation and ingredients for a personal transformation to letting go of fear and embracing love. The second section is 12 daily lessons, many based on ACIM lessons, that emphasize the personal transformation from fear based to love based existence.

The only thing we really introduced in change (after much trial and error) was Prozyme.So I tried Prozyme. Prozyme solved my dog's digestive problems. No more inconsistency. She has been on it for over 1 1/2 years adn since she has been using Prozyme with her food, she has had only 2 episodes of loose stool (diarhhrea) in the past 18 months. Before that it was 2-4 times a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for what I needed.","review":"The price is why I gave it 4 stars it to me is quite expensive. being on fixed income it is hard to spend more than I can afford but the product work at the time only did need such a big bottle would have been nice to get it in smaller product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prozyme","review":"I ordered Prozyme for my Greyhound because I read on various veterinary websites that this product would help with gas as well as prevent my dog from eating her stool.

It had great reviews and was much more reasonable. Well, its not very reasonable if you can't use it. I ended up having to purchase more Enzyme Miracle and trashing this, which also put me in a bind because I had to wait for the second order without anything.I used the Enzyme Miracle for about six months now and never had an issue with my dogs getting sick even while switching them to a raw diet.Enzyme Miracle is expensive, but apparently worth every penny because when I switched to this product, my dog immediately started vomiting up every meal. I scrapped the small amount of the EM I had left out last night and no vomit.Apparently, he does not like the taste, or everything the Prozyme is lacking compared to the EM is exactly what he needed.I wouldn't purchase this if you are looking for a replacement product. Its apparently not a comparable quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow","review":"Product arrived after due date - I had to go out and buy another bottle from somewhere else because I couldn't wait.

I was relieved to find that it's EXCELLENT! Bruce explores his musical roots on this CD and really gets down to business in doing so. (_A Night On the Town_ is the beginning of this extraordinary journey.) I've seen this guy in concert, and he makes his work even better when he's performing it live with his incerdibly talented road band. Buy this CD--you'll be happy you did. --Rachael Williams Hisaw"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great start to Hornsby's solo career.","review":"This album comes after his time with the Range. The album contains the Jazz-like music that Hornsby embraces in his solo career. It is more varied and features other talent that work with him on the songs such as Bonnie Rait, Jerry Garcia, Branford Marsalis, and others. Some great songs on the album include, \\"Harbor Lights\\" and \\"The Tide Will Rise.\\" My personal favorite is \\"Fields of Gray,\\" which demonstrates Hornsby's sheer musical talent. I would recommend this album to pretty much anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the 20 best albums I own","review":"This is the only Bruce Hornsby project I was ever driven to buy, and it is magnificent. The opening song is probably my favorite from his whole repertoire, and the whole album just grooves along like a silk freight train. Awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small Leather Portfolio","review":"The book was just as advertised and a miniature version of the full size one I purchased last year.

A bright side can be found to almost any situation. Age actually provides some advantages - wisdom, a relaxed detachment, freedom from pressures to achieve, the realization we still have gifts to offer others. This moviewas sheer enjoyable entertainment for me but after it was over I realized what a positive impact it had on my thinking.In addition knowing Richard Bull was playing opposite his real wife of 51 years, Barbara Collentine made the film ever so special. It is easy to see why this is his most treasured role of his long and productive acting career. She sparkled in the role as only a woman truly in love can do. Gerry Fortin"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Touching Movie","review":"I wish this movie had an attachment to tell what it was about. I took a chance and bought it, and I\`m very glad I did. This movie was just beautiful and makes us remember that, no matter what age we get to be, we still are that same person we were when at a younger age.My viewpoint will never be the same after watching this movie. Excellent characters and a more than exceptional role performed by Richard Bull!I give this movie 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Continent...Not The Resort","review":"Like most of Cayce's books on one subject, this one is also pieced together from his readings. That makes it somewhat hard to read, since it is basically dictation taken down during his trances. But it is definitely worth reading. Some of this information may sound incredulous, but with Cayce's abilities, it is hard to discount any of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating reading material","review":"Cayce's predictions are hard to believe, but what if his claims are true. He tells of light beings visiting the earth before humans were around and getting trapped in flesh boddies. He takes the reader to the building of the pyrimids and much,much more. This is a very interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"His son tries hard to make a compelling case for Atlantis","review":"There is no new material in here about Atlantic other than what has been lying around for a few thousand years and folktales among new agers. So it's dad who proves the history in his readings of those imprinted in one way or another by their lives in Atlantis. No archeology, no stuff to look at or touch or hear about for the first time. The three islands went down over millennia, and nothing of the civilization has surfaced that he knows of although he trie to work backward from the people and folkways and religions of those scattered around in the Americas and down Egypt way. The epileptic prose is hard to engage with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second hand information","review":"This was not actually written by Cayce, but summarizes some of his thoughts on the subject.

Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing handbook for high school, college and beyond!","review":"I am extremely happy with this book. It's a great resource for anyone currently in high school, college or university. It can also be a great reference handbook for teachers and instructors. It explains many important concepts with great detail, yet in a very concise manner. I am an International Baccalaureate student, and I found this For Dummies book really useful. The Kindle version has great formatting and such too.I would like it better if the book was organized in a better manner. Not that it was hard to follow or anything, but I think that the chapters could be arranged in a much better order overall. Or maybe I am just biased towards the IB syllabus structure.The book was really good anyway, and I recommend it to anyone wanting to learn some Chemistry, no matter what age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy do it yourselfer!","review":"I needed this book for my nursing entrance exam, it was for sure worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chemistry For Dummies","review":"It is such a detailed book.

It does a very good job of explaining how chemistry is used in a variety of consumer and industrial situations. This is an interesting book in this sense, and very complete.However, if you're taking a chemistry class, this is not such a good book. The explanations of chemical topics are a little fluffy, and certainly not what anybody would consider complete. While well-written and lively, it's just not \\"chemical\\" enough to give the serious student any real help when studying.My conclusion: If you're looking for a fun book about chemistry, buy this one. If you're a student who needs help, go elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turns Intolerable Torture Into Fascinating Frustration","review":"I think schools everywhere should quit being snobs, get out of the expensive textbook racket, wise up and start using \\"for Dummies\\" as material for classroom instruction. I'm being 100% serious. I think there is a lot more to be learned from a good \\"just the basics\\" series like these than in so many badly-written, boring instructional books published for in-class use.Someone can read this book in a few nights and come away knowing more for her twenty bucks than another person who spent a grand on a 100-level Chem class. All the good stuff is here and it's really all 99.9% of the American public ever needs (or wants) to know.I recommend this book. It's good.

Unlike the \\"Physics for Dummies\\" or the \\"Biology for Dummies\\" books, J Wiley chose to use the picture of a Black kid to illustrate their chemistry text.

I think the price is so inexpensive, compared with other books, because it is so small. It is approximately 5 inches by 6 inches in size. This is not a huge problem (no pun intended), but with a small book, you can't fit in as much information / content. Over all, I am happy that i purchased this book.

These days, I volunteer at Parks, most of which, due to budget cuts, are really hurting in the weed department. So, some I now know. Some I have no idea. You learn as you go along. I want this book along with me, to be that first critical step in ID. The rest of the info is all on the Internet anyways. I do wish there were more species.

One day something tragic happens and it changes their lives forever.I highly recommend this book to girls of all ages (it's a love story so guys might not like it!) It teaches a great lesson about different races; that no matter what color a person may be, everyone is equally capable of doing and accomplishing the same things. Love stories are something i personaly love, and now this is one of my favorites, and it might be yours someday too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you come softly","review":"If you come softly is one of the most amazing books I've ever read.

It's very romantic and it takes you back to your memories of your first love if you ever had one. It was really descriptive of how Ellie and Jeremiah felt about each other. It was cool how each chapter was going back and forth through the characters opinion. It made it easier to understand how one was feeling about the other when something important in the book was happening. It sort of reminded me of my past relationships and I connected to this book a lot because I know how it feels to be judged by people you don't even know because of your race or having relationships with someone of another nationality. the only thing I felt different about was the ending. I felt like there was no point in having the book end that way.

The story is a modern day Romeo and Juliet. The main characters are fifteen year old Miah, a black boy and Ellie, a white girl. They are both new in a Manhattan prep school. They immediatly click and eventually fall in love. Society has a real problem with this issue, even more so than their own families. They receive strange stares and harsh glances while holding hands and kissing in public. They decide to stay together through all the negative feedback and lean on each other through many problems they face in their own lives. The characters develop emotionally with each new experience they have as a bi-racial couple. Just like Romeo and Juliet however, things don't end up well for the young couple."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Come Softy","review":"I read this Book a few years ago, being a keen reader from an early age, this was the first of many books to contain different 'social circle' issues. contrary to Amazons age recommendation, this book is suitable for anyone, not just for 9 - 12 year olds. I was older than 12 when i originally read this book, the thought occured to me whist reading other reviews that this book may even be a little too deep for 9 years olds to delve into. This is an excellent eye opener for those wishin to seek a different view point, it also opens the mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I loved this book! What a magnificent ending! Although I found the characters slightly confusing I would encourage anyone to read this book. Pick up this book not only to read it, but to behold it's emotion. Yeah, it may lay out a tale of an ordinary teenage love, but you'll be turning pages until the bitter end. The bond and trust that grows between Miah and Ellie make you feel like it's really you within the book. I would especially recommend this book to any teenage girl, it will take you to a beautiful place away from this crazy world. No, I can't say this is the bestest book in the whole wide world but it's surely an excellent story to expose yourself to."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've ever read so far!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book If You Come Softly was terrific. When I started reading it I couldnt put it down because it was good. I like the way the book began and ended. At first I didnt understand how Jermiah died and I had to go back and reread but I still loved the book just as I did when I read it the first time. I would recommend this book to anyone who is in a relationship where they just dont know what to do. The message I received from this book was to never listen to \\"people\\" that only has control over their mouths and always follow and trust your heart. I hope someone enjoys this book just like I did!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was it worth it?","review":"I am going to be a senior in high school this fall and in the midst of my summer reading list, I decided to pick out a book for pleasure. If You Come Softly caught my eye, mainly because I like books I can relate to and I had been in an interracial relationship my freshman year. However, I was very disappointed. As you read this book, try to find the climax. was it when they kissed? Said I love you? I dont believe their ever was a true climax. And what about towards the end? What I feel that the the author intened to be the climax was like, 2 pages. I quick up and down. Maybe my reading level was that above what the book was intended for, but I think Ms. Woodson needs to work a little harder, it was a good attempt though, but not enough to keep me reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love?","review":"Ellie. Miah. Love. No one cares about any of those words. All they care about is that Ellie is white, Miah is black.

I realize the the message that this book is trying to convey, but come on! This has got to be one of the most anti-climactic, pointless, boring, pieces of literature out there. I had to read it for my young adult literature class as a means of being able to recommend good books to young adults and I for one will not recommend this book to anyone. I am more than sure that there are countless numbers of books out there that deal with the same topic and I would venture to say that the majority of them would do a much better job at conveying the message than this book does. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"\\"If you come softly\\" is one of those books that I just can't get into, one of those reason why is because this book lacks originality.

But all in all this book just barely passes with a D."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Book","review":"I had to read this book for a project in Language Arts. My teacher suggested this book because my topic was integration. When I started the book, I didn't really love the details. Each chapter seemed to be a repeat of what happened in the chapter before. Then I got to the ending. I thought the book was bad enough, but Jacqueline Woodson had to REALLY ruin it. She ended it with killing Jeremiah for NO REASON. Thats the worst way to end a book-by killing the main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite Book","review":"This book is definatly a must read. It's treading in dangerous water for some people, because they don't believe in interracial dating. But I do believe in it, and I do realize that this book is probably ne of the best books I've ever read in my whole life span, which is 15 years. It explains to people from both sides of the relationship, the black side and the white side, and you get to know the characters. When I first got the book, I knew what was going to happen in the end. NO one had told me, but I realized it as I got deeper into the story. This book is well written, and it should be a required read for high school students."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was exceptional!","review":"I really did enjoy reading this book. I felt Jacqueline Woodson was descriptive with everything she wrote, it was if I was in Ellie or Miah's shoes. It was such a sensitive topic and she explored it at two teenage perspectives without even being negative. She deserves 'props' for that. The end wasn't exactly typical. I don't mean to hint but we'll just say it was tragic. This book for the most part was great, Jacqueline has some potential and I'm glad it didn't go unoticed, she deserves every one of her awards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too \\"perfect\\" for me!","review":"I read this book as a part of my school's \\"social justice\\" unit and we got to pick our books. Our group picked \\"If you come softly,\\" and now I wish we hadn't. This book was not exciting and I didn't want to read the assigned pages. We know that people don't like to see a white person and a black person together. The whole book just seems cliche, like how Ellie and Jeremiah meet by \\"bumping\\" into each other. And then how they \\"can't stop thinking about each other.\\" It bugs me how perfect their relationship is, even with the racial tension. I now know that I don't like love stories, especially this one. Try something more exciting, like Dan Brown or Cornelia Funke."},{"rating":"2","title":"the first book that ever made me cry","review":"I read this in 8th grade, I'm 24 years old now and it's still my favorite book.

For a student of Divine Liturgy this is a must read. The text of the Byzantine liturgy itself is not included in the book and the introduction provided by R M French helps in this direction. The book is outlined in six chapters explaining the meaning of every part of the liturgy. After reading this book the participation in the liturgy will no more be the same.Cabasilas was a layman who lived in the 13th century. He never attained high ecclesiastical office. Though he wrote a number of books including homilies and lives of saints, his fame rests on his 'Commentary on the Divine Liturgy'."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for every Orthodox Christian!!","review":"I have read this phenomenal work three times and still get something new with each read. What amazes me, as a former Roman Catholic, is the fact that this 14th century commentary is still relevant to the Liturgy to which all Orthodox Christians are familiar. This would not be so for a 14th century commentary of any western liturgy, since they have changed so radically since then. The debth and profundity of this reading are astounding. Any Orthodox Christian who is serious about his faith and wants a fuller appreciation of the the rich liturgical tradition which is the hallmark of the Orthodox Church should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"past it","review":"As an original ELP fan, I really wanted to like this album.

Honky Tonk Train Blues 8. Take a Pebble 9. Lucky Man 10. Fanfare etc./Blue Rondo 11. 21st Century Schizoid Man/AmericaSadly, Keith E and Greg L announce their failing powers all too clearly. Greg Lake employs the usual tricks - like avoiding sustained high notes - or sustained low notes, come to that - and sounds..well, fat, and Keith E substitutes speed in his 'improvisations' for creativity and accuracy. Only Carl P comes out of it with credibility intact (I have seen him live recently, and can testify to his continuing dynamism). The sound quality is OK, but nothing special. Overall, this recording adds nothing good to the originals, neither does the 'live' dimension.

In all too many cases I find myself saying, \\"Noooo! It don't work that way,\\" but Cobb has both his tactical and technical ducks in a row.The only jarring part is that a part of this universe is an effective and forceful UN.

However, I think Cobb makes an exception with Amanda Garrett et. al. I often read further into a series and wish the author had just killed the hero(ine) as opposed to miring them into mindless drivel. This time his third offering was my favorite. Some readers may disaggree because Cobb does sink to new depths I find entertaining. For example, in this one his use of movie quotes in the dialog may not be universally appealing. For me these examples were embarressing, laugh out loud, moments that kept me turning pages wanting more. I may send this one to a friend with an equally bizarre sense of humor and bravada, knowing that Cobb's 3rd adventure may be the first one to read, creating a curiosity about the 'prequels'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Filmed DVD of New Zealand","review":"Wow..New Zealand is such a beautiful place..I have bought a few DVD's depicting a number of countries.

I contacted Perfumania by email same day to ask if they would give me a partial refund or have another 1.7 oz bottle sent; I never heard back from them. Is it that hard to click \\"reply\\" or to dial 10 numbers on a phone to please a customer?

I liked the scent in the store, but had no idea it would be so strong when I sprayed it on myself. I do not use a lot of perfume at once but even spraying it once on my neck was too much for this perfume. It is a sharp floral/fruity smell and pretty concentrated stuff. I see the full bottle on my dresser and hate to see $50+ down the drain so I've attempted to wear it about ten times, but every time I've tried to wear it I get a headache. I've also had people tell me it was really strong (this is with one spray). Also, the spritzer doesn't really spritz, but rather launches the perfume in one focused region. Overall, not happy with this perfume. Get Burberry, Escada, or Vera Wang Princess instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from Perfumania","review":"Product did not reach the final destination. After corelating with Amazon.com, found out that Perfumania sent to wrong address and product was returned to them. I did not recieve a full refund.

It's gotta be one of the least masculine fragrances out there. It's way too citrus-y and much too strong. It reminds me of that el-cheapo \\"$2 a gallon\\" aftershave that little kids buy their dads for Father's Day. It is about as off-putting as a scent can be.

Actually it is one of the longest lasting perfumes I ever used (I previously used Chanel-Chance, Armani-Gio, Davidoff-Cool Water, Sarah Jessica Parker-Lovely etc.) The bottle is beautiful, but be careful not to drop it. Even if the glass part is very sturdy, the plastic part on top breaks open. It is still functioning perfectly, so it is all that matters!

Music has been with human-kind since the beginning of time, so I'm not surprised.This is a good book that will take you a while to read.

They were showing signs of fatigue on their previous album (Winterheart's Guild) but it at least kept pace w/ the first 2 albums. If you're a total SA fanboy, you'll be fine with this album, but if you're an older power metal fan who's tired of hearing bands just re-make the same album every year, this is definitely not the one for you; i'd recommend trying Dragonforce instead (no, they're not all that original either, but they play with 100% more balls and conviction than what you'll hear on Reckoning Night)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice tractor","review":"I bought this tractor to go with the potato digger I bought my nephew.

The only reason I kept reading was in hopes that this fellow might be inspired by place and become a decent human being. The reason I didn't like this book isn't because the fellow never did see the error of his ways, it is because the nice details about the nature and inhabitants of Nova Scotia got lost in the silly details about a 19-year old's hormones and wonders of pot.

I was reading the reviews published here to decided whether or not to read it. I was amazed at the number of errors in the review by Rudy Avila. For example, Callas never married Onassis...that's a biggie. And, who on earth wouldn't know that Jackie Kennedy is usually spelled with an \\"ie\\" and not a \\"y\\"? Of course, if he really knew his stuff, he would know that Mrs. Kennedy never referred to herself as \\"Jackie\\", preferring the more formal \\"Jacqueline\\". If he got his information from this book, then this book is extremely inaccurate and misleading. If he is just making stuff up, he should not be writing reviews. Now that I have gotten myself all worked up over this, I suppose that I will have to read it and write an ACCURATE review when I am done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Poor job indeed. It's not just that one wouldn't find anything new in this biography (it's hard to expect anything really new about Callas after all that has been written) but it's not even the story told from a new angle... This book is like a patchwork of things cut and pasted from different sources and lacks consistency in style etc as if Ms Edwards couldn't decide whether she wanted to write just a \\"documentary\\" or something more \\"personal\\". Anyway, it is a waste of time to read this, if you want a Callas biography get Galatopoulos and Jellinek ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subpar","review":"Edwards' bio of Callas borders too much on the tabloidish side, hardly on her career. Certain sections reads like she was pulling an alnighter in writing it, and the last two pages had serious editing problems.

I have a VW shop manual with electrical diagrams and was able to make all the under dash connections to the fuse/relay panel using open slots.

I'm shure it can be adapted for some newer vehicles, but if you have a \\"coil pack\\" instead of a distributor, don't bother.

You do need to be technically proficient to install, and it is a lot of work. The actual installation instructions are very good, but the applications (wire information for power, VSS, and Tach for each model) only go up to like 1993. The help number was only open certian hours, so I went online and found lots of help (I searched Scion cruise control). There are plenty of Blogs on the subject- some are excellent.

If the author would like to vent, I'd recommend a journal or a book about her life. Not what is advertised as a \\"Manual.\\" Venting releases negative energy, and I found that negative energy affecting me more and more as I read - to the point where I finally had to put the book down and vent myself. I also found her experiences with energy to be quite different from mine. If you are looking for a book filled with opinions, this is the one for you.

What do Imagineers do that's different? Do they have special techniques for brainstorming, or for choosing colors, or stage lighting? The answers are not here.

No restraints, no restrictions, everything goes.That would have been fine with me. But this movie has Ipkiss/The Mask committing crimes (bank robbery, assault, breaking out of jail). It also has a lot of smoking. And sadly, the only one who changes is Stanley. He learns to be less inhibited. By donning The Mask, he realizes his nice guy persona is just a mask he wears because he thinks he won't be accepted for who he really is.The Mask would have been a MUCH better movie if they had left the criminal activity out and explored the Mask part a lot more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mask - Blu","review":"I love the movie, for me, this is Jim Carrey's best movie, no doubt.

It is a parody of so many other films that it has very little deep meaning but it is only an entertaining action film. It is a parody of old cartoons, of gangster films, of maffia films, of bank robbery films, of Batman or Spiderman films, of whatever. But the concoction that is delivered to us is absolutely delicious. Then the deeper meaning that a mask can only help us to reveal our deeper being by lifting the artificial mask society sets on us is rather shallow and in no way studied in any depth. But that is not the interest of the film which is, as I have already said, nothing but a funny entertainment.

I am at the part where the cops are investigating Stanley's apartment after he stole all that money and his pajamas were torn. The girl said that his tie is like a Rorschach inkblot test (not to be confused with the Watchmen character). My 3 favorite masks are as follows. 3: Joker Bank Robber, 2: Rorschach, 1: The Mask.

The Satanists were simply Nature-worshipping pagans, while the Catholics, the Inquisition etc., were cruel hypocrites who literally demonized the pagan gods and tortured and executed the pagans.

I liked it. I found it very interesting and it correlated with my own personal philosophies on the nature of the subconscious and the spiritual. A lot of it was not unlike some of C.G. Jung's work as well.I do agree with some critics that the author clearly admired Cayce and may therefore be heavily biased in relating the phenomena of ESP. However, I did not find the book to be a purely Cayce hero-worship story and it was certainly worth reading despite the subjectively high praise given to Cayce.

I pledged to not cut corners in making my staff feel valued in my own establishment. That seemed impossible once I looked at my bottom line. This book reminded me that cutting labor costs could lead to costlier recruiting expenses once my staff flees looking for other work. A simple improvement, such as outsourcing payroll to an online service, is convenient and saves money. I also learned that making my restaurant a safe and enjoyable environment is an act of employee retention. Encouraging my staff, or playing their favorite music in the kitchen, goes a long way in reducing turnover. Even the worst bosses start off with the best intentions. They eventually become so focused on the bottom line that they do not notice their staff's morale. This book shows you how to keep both in sight."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good but as others said a 'Die Hard copy '","review":"I am a huge Thomas Ian Griffith fan so I guess I am biased.

I'm not into the polyester fattening diets of the Bee Gees, but with a man with so many cool dance moves, you would hope he would've pumped out more DANCE tracks. Travelling Without Moving was a tough act to beat, and writing this article in such a critical tone is killing me -- but Synkronized is an unsure collection of hidden messages (black cap day) and heartless instrumentals.

The loss of their old bassist really hurts them on this album. In past albums, especially the second, the bass was MELODIOUS. Here it is deeply reptitive. Every other bar is repeated! NO MELODY. This hurts when you have no lead guitar! The vocals aren't sufficient to carry the whole melody of the tune. So you get basically some nice textures that you can dance to but nothing to soothe the musical ear. Just listen to the bass play 4 quarter notes down the scale EVERY OTHER BAR in the Planet Home. I think i learned to do that my first day on recorder. All the other tunes are the same, they just grab a lick and repeat it. Then listen to the bass on manifest destiny from the second album.

I was hesitating on giving it 1 star, but that would be unfair because it does achieve some sort of music flavour, but following on from Travelling, Jamiroquai had totally lost their creativity with this one. Strings have totally taken over where horns and synths used to rule, and make this album depressingly flat. Rather than being in any way cutting edge, the obvious characteristic from the 1st 3 albums, it turns into a really bad version of Earth, Wind & Fire. It simply doesn't compare to earlier work, even Travelling, but especially Emergency and Space Cowboy.

Kicking Stuart Zender ( the bassist) out of the band has taken the 90% of the magic. Jamiroquai is about sounding predictable, it is a formula we enjoy because it reminds us of the good old funk, but this one is sinking. Get Stuart again, Jay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kickin' it for us one more time","review":"While not the traditional Jamiroquai sound we all know and love, this CD is daring in its fusion of traditional funk and dance grooves with more modern hip hop styles.

Jamiroquai has unfortunately crossed over from jazzy/funk to cheesey disco. The string section sounded good on Traveling Without Moving but Synkronized is chock full of cheesey disco strings and uninspired bass lines. The new bass player does not even compare. The one thing they did right this time was cut the album time down instead of overindulging like they did on their previous albums. If you like the single Canned Heat then you will probably like the rest of this album. Personally, I think Canned Heat is an overproduced piece of disco-cheese. Forget this album and buy Travelling Without Moving for the funkier stuff. If you like it less dancy and more jazzy go back to their first two albums. Otherwise, go get yourself some Funkadelic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Same Sound Sounds Even Better","review":"Jamiroquai returns with the same distinctive sound wrapped in a tighter package. The disc shows more range from the band with a greater commercial sensibility, and the results are outstanding. From top to bottom, every song is great. THIS IS A FANTASTIC ALBUM. It will inevitably be remembered for decades to come. The record company is pushing \\"Canned Heat\\" and \\"Black Capricorn Day\\" as the top songs, but I think \\"Supersonic\\" with its powerful dance rhythm and \\"King For a Day\\" with its haunting melody are better. In any event, everyone will find plenty of favorites in this album of ten top quality, wide ranging and ultimately awesome songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"regrettable!","review":"I'ts a great pity that Jamiroquai have changed their style like this.

Jamiroquai seems to get no respect from American radio, but I can't understand why. This album contains several potential singles in addition to the awesome Canned Heat, and is much more listenable from end to end than even Travelling Without Moving. I still wish there was a breakthrough hit on here that would turn Americans on to this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't tap your feet to this, you've got some issues.","review":"I'm really glad that I listened to this CD at Borders, because it is a treat for the ears. The sound that this band possesses is so unique, and stands out in a crowd of bad modern music. Jay Kay's voice is great for the style of music, and the band itself has got some real talent. Although some of the tunes do go on a bit too long, \\"Black Capricorn Days\\" more than makes up for them. I think I want to buy more of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Sleep on The J! This is one of my favorite LPs.","review":"I've been a Jamiroquai fan for 4 years. I loved Return of the Space Cowboy because it revived and updated the awesome funk/dance rhythms of the 70's. I then got the first joint, Emergency on Planet Earth, and really enjoyed the mellow vibe and conscious lyrics. I also really liked Travelling Without Moving, which seemed to lean more towards the 90's. Synkronized is another one of their outstanding LP's.With tightly arranged grooves and awesome bass lines and hooks, Jamiroquai is continuing to realize their potential as one of the baddest bands of the era. \\"Planet Home,\\" \\"Falling,\\" \\"Butterfly,\\" and \\"Soul Education\\" will get plenty of play this summer.I must have played ROTSC hundreds of times when it came out. Synkronized has got me open.Don't Sleep on The J. Buy this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mix of styles frroml the previous albums","review":"This album is certainly a very good piece of work à la Jamiroquai, but seems to lack the great jazzy feeling that \\"Emergency on Planet Earth\\" and \\"Space Cowboy\\" had. \\"Synkronized\\" is definetly better than \\"Travelling Without Moving\\". A very good buy for people who appreciate funky R&B with a touch of jazz with soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"A step away","review":"A bad Jamiroquai album is much better than anything else coming out today...However, this record is a step back from the previous releases.

Black Capricorn Day is a bullet in the head to all the \\"old\\" Jamiro fans...I expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"generic retro disco music","review":"It's really a shame that the funky originality of Jamiroquai's first two records has gotten more than stale on the third and latest effort. The first track, Canned Heat, is certainly danceable (the MTV crowd will love it, no doubt) but one might as well go out and buy some old Donna Summer or Bee Gees if in the mood for generic disco. Jay Kay's songwriting should have gotten more creative over time, not less so, as appears to be the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD!","review":"Good job on the latest album!

This video is absolutely fantastic! It gives an excellent view into the art and shows many great quality video clips of the bullfight and behind the scenes involving what really happens at a bullfight. The video is in Spanish with subtitles and really gives the kids a workout listening and the musical score is outstanding. THIS IS GREAT FOR A SPANISH CLASS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Educational!","review":"I bought this DVD to show clips of it to my students in Spanish class.

Definitely worth the money. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good documentary","review":"Since I was going to show this to my sixth graders, I was concerned when I received it and one of the descriptive words on the front of the DVD was 'Erotic!' Turns out, they must have been using 'erotic' in a symbolic sort of way. A documentary about the life of the bullfighter, David Fandila; the movie is very tastefully done and was a perfect complement to the novel study we'd completed on the book \\"Shadow of a Bull.\\" Living in Spain, we are surrounded by bullfighting; now we understand it a little more."},{"rating":"2","title":"OLE!!!","review":"What a great film ...

Most people can't see past the gore and they center themselves on the death of the bull. Get to know the men who do it rather than just condemning the activity. Learn first, then judge.

This has to be the worst book I've ever read. I kept thinking that, and I couldn't put it down, it was so bad, but in a compelling way, kind of like a train wreck. The characters were totally flat and unrealistic (never mind Diana Mayo's sudden, total transformation from insufferable boy-girl to snivelling \\"woman\\"), with the possible exception of Raoul. The writing was not great, and lacked vivid imagery and dialog (but somehow it kept going, I'm still not sure how). And the racism! The totally unabashed orientalism! That in itself was fascinating. Such a book could not be written today (thank god... oh, hell, maybe it almost could, now), and so it was interesting for the historical perspective. I was a little surprised to see that it had been re-issued - I found a 1921 edition here at my parent's house and looked online just to see what I could find.So bad it's good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best love story I have ever read","review":"I can see why so many novels are inspired by this one, it has elements that is considered risky and deeply provoking which is what I think makes a great novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"bleh","review":"I don't know what's more horrifying: this book, or the reviews talking about how \\"romantic\\" it is to read about a woman who's kidnapped and raped until she falls in love with her rapist."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit unbelievable","review":"To be honest, I had difficulty getting through this one. The characterization of Diana changes drastically, too drastically. She begins as a strong, adventurous character and then turns into a grovelling, wimpering, whining creature as soon as she is abducted. I don't believe that such a drastic change can realistically happen in one night. However, this is an interesting look at the female reading material of the period and gives some interesting insight into attitudes toward women and attitudes of women of themselves (if I remember correctly, the author is female)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great-Grandmother of ALL Bodice-Rippers","review":"Read this when I was a girl, some 45 years ago, at my mother's encouragement. Certainly it doesn't fly in today's climate of political correctness and sexual abuse. The idea that one could respond to such treatment as our heroine does is contrary to what we now know to be true. But it's still a hell of a good yarn."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sheik","review":"The Sheik is a very romantic book. The sex in it is hinted at, rather than explicit. The basic story is of a kidnapped girl, who falls in love with her kidnapper. Even as I was enjoying the story, my mind was rebelling against her falling for him. The book was written quite a few years ago & I found the hints of sex much more exciting than the in-your-face sex of modern books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have Mercy, Ahmed...Or Not.....","review":"What can I say? I'm a committed feminist, and I've adored and occasionally reread this hotly spiced ridiculous tale for many years. It's a banquet of outrageous events and incredibly un-PC emotions all somehow mixed up with blossoming oases, racism, lust, adoration, great horses, sophisticated cuisine (in the desert!) and piercing through it here and there (as another poster mentioned) one of the most accurate descriptions of post traumatic stress disorder I've ever read. Ahmed is a powerful aristocrat and a rapist; he also has a discriminating taste in fine wine.Diane is an arrogant, independent vixen who throws off any attempt to restrain her--except she falls in love with her rapist. At the end of the day, Ethel Maud Hull convinces us they're made for each other. Go figure! And let yourself enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Like Luke and Laura","review":"This is the ultimate male fantasy romance novel. I literally threw it across the room when I finished it and annotated it with phrases such as \\"AAAHHH\\" and \\"I think I'm going to puke\\" and \\"you've got to be kidding me\\".

I would imagine that some of these reviews are employees or friends of Aloha Island Coffee? After shipping I paid $27.45 for a bag of beans that are okay, but nowhere near phenomenal as the review rave. Milestone brand found in most supermarkets retails $10 a pound and easily rivals the flavor of this brand. I will accept the fact that my disapproval may be due to my specific low acidic taste requirements. I do not like strong coffee with a bitter overtone, albeit this medium roast is on the strong side.In favor of Aloha Island Coffee, they did not hesitate to refund my money, keeping true to their claim of 100% satisfaction guaranteed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Coffee","review":"My husband and I agree; this is the best coffee we have ever had!Delicate and lovely flavor, low acidity, and no aftertaste.

While by no means an heir to the Soul greats of the 1960s and '70s, Bruce Saunders comes across as a far more mature and sophisticated singer than most of his New Jack Swing contemporaries. The romantic ballads and mid-tempo jams are surprisingly enjoyable (especially for someone like myself who DOES NOT like most post-1988 R&B!) but the uptempo dance tracks are faceless. When I listen to this CD, I can't help but wonder if poor promotion and mundane material doomed Bruce Saunders' career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the casual reader","review":"The subtitle is a very good indication of the flavor of the book. It includes the Latin name of the species Felis silvestris catus. What follows is more of a highly scientific analysis of cats than a guide to understanding your pet. The generally pratical information is scant and overwhelmed by massive digressions in evolutionary and historical explainations. I got to page 100 and couldn't bear to read any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Cat's Meow","review":"I love cats (which is why I bought this book), but the author, unfortunately, seems to have only a passing interest in felines. I sensed little admiration for cats in his writing and, indeed, he seemed to reduce them to mere clinical biological specimens. Some of what he claimed about cats I know personally (from being a cat owner) to be untrue, such as his assertion that \\"Following people around is admittedly unsual even among pet cats\\" (p. 79). What? Every cat I've had has followed me around; they follow me to bed, follow me from room to room when I clean the house, follow me to the bathroom or kitchen in the middle of the night; one stray used to follow me on a long walk to my mailbox and back (which in large part finally led me to adopt this cat). I'm not sorry that I read this book; I learned much. But the author didn't make learning about cats nearly as entertaining an experience as it could have been had he shown more enthusiasm about the subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect book, perfect price","review":"This is not a fluffy book about fluffy....it's a fascinating book about cats - substantive, highly informative information that isn't commonly known, written in an engaging, story-like way, but incorporating a great deal of scientific information. For example....are domestic cats close relatives of lions? Are cats different from other domesticated animals (including not only dogs but camels, sheep, etc.) Read the book to find out and to more thoroughly explore your feline's psyche than you ever thought possible. I picked this up at the vet's and couldn't put it down, so I had to order it. Oh, and from this seller the price was great, delivery reasonable, and the (new) book was really new. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop science at its worst","review":"This book contains nothing new. It rehashes much of the author's other works and contains a lot of padding. It appears to have been a quick write to capitalise on the author's other successes. It failed to answer all my questions about cat evolution and behavour. I also had the impression that the author had little experience of cats and probably didn't even like them that much."},{"rating":"2","title":"The whys and wherefores of kitties!","review":"Stephen Budiansky has taken all the latest scientific and psychological research done on cats to date and simmered it down into this compact little volume for the lay reader. It explores everything from the origin of the purr to the origin of the black-cat mythos, from why cats meow to why they can be stand-offish or even bite the hand that feeds them. I now understand why my cats will head-butt me to offer affection (there are scent-marking organs in the forehead--who knew?), as well as why and how each of my cats ended up with their very different temperaments. From biology to sociology, mythology to psychology, this slim book covers it all.While Budiansky's work is always informative and very complete, it's only occasionally entertaining which, I suspect, is more a result of my expectations as a reader on this subject than any of the author's fault. Would I recommend it? Most certainly, especially to those of you who are cat owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smokin Tunes Fron The Dude","review":"Devin's 1998 debut is filled with such an entertainment value ranging from the beats to the lyrical content. The beats on most of the songs are awesome. Generally, they are laid back Texas deep G-Funk with a nice bass to them. He can flow tight and his delivery is funny and clever. The way he dsescribes his sexcapades, his obsession with dank, and even him boo boo'n will get you crackin' up throughout the album! Devin also has some deeper tracks about life and making choices in songs like \\"Alright,\\" and \\"Do What You Wanna Do,\\" and how people can be so scrutinizing and critical in \\"Write And Wrong.\\" The guitar riffs on \\"One Day At A Time\\" \\"Alright\\" \\"Write And Wrong\\" and half of the other tracks are hella funky, so the album will also get you into a relaxed mood. Anyone into Old School Dirty South rap, West Coast rap, or G-Funk will have instant satisfaction with The Dude, but anyone into good, keep-it-real, witty rap, will dig this underground classic as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Panoramic View Lost in DVD vs. PBS Presentation","review":"I am very disappointed with the quality of this DVD vs. the PBS presentation. Panoramic views were virtually lost as all four sides of the film are truncated destroying the panoramic effect of depth and distance. Secondly, the music was so loud at times I could barely hear the narration. I did not have that problem either while viewing on public television.

It does however, provide the reader with a theoretical framework of international relations. The three images of analysis provide for a generalization of the system in which war is promulgated. This book and a bevy of later works argue what level of analysis is best at explicating the cause of war. Don't read this book as a means to finding a simplistic answer to the cause of war, rather read it with the hope of gaining a better understanding of the causes of war.For those interested in international relations, Keohane and Nye's works are very worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as spectacular as made to sound","review":"This book is a good caustic review of the methodology of world affairs. The book is a very simple and repetitive read. Though the ideas are absolutely brilliant analyses and very effective, all the major ideas of the book could have been shortened to within a page and still been just as effective.

Don't get me wrong, it's fun and playful, but we were looking for something more... relaxing/soothing; something that could be played while the little one slept.

I am a big Bob fan and was anxious to pass it on to my newborn. This CD is what I assume will be played in the third ring of hell in my Dantes inferno. It is literally a muzak version of Bob Marleys most mainstream songs played on a xylophone. If that sounds pleasant to you, this CD is for you. I was looking for something with singing.

It's really good, because it does what is meant to do: put your babies (and sometimes yourself) to sleep. But if you know the songs, you get frustrated when you listen to the same song, repeated 3 times, instead of making them simple, so they could add even more songs. Let me explain myself: when you listen Buffalo Soldier, when you think that the song will be over, it begins again, and again, and again.Overall, the TOOL cd is the best, and I got 4 of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"A special kind of Hell","review":"I am a music therapist and percussionist, and was given this CD as a baby shower gift as the person knew I really like Bob Marley. I'm afraid to say I think this CD is just awful. The mallet instruments are not actually in tune with each other, and most of the songs are very hard to recognize. Most of all though, I think it is better to simply play Bob Marley to your baby! I don't understand the need for special baby versions of existing music, and look at them as just another unnecessary product.

Shadowy instead of really dark. And the gore factor was more so surgical than gratuitous.It leads a merry chase that seems to promise a clear solution at the end, but still keeps one mystified.Its somewhat Lovecraftian in that it merges possibility and reality and throws it together just enough to make one wonder.... would that be possible....St. Germain would be proud."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most apathetic movies I've seen in years.","review":"Although apparently a minority opinion, I found this film exceedingly boring and disappointing.

Some good aesthetics but that (IMHO) isn't enough to carry a movie. It is vague enough that you can read pretty much whatever you want into it, but you'll have to invest a lot of your own energies to do this b/c the film doesn't give you much of substance to work with. Recently saw \\"Pulse\\" also, written and directed (I believe) by the same person. I found it very similar in tone, slow, vague, pieces not connecting, with some bad acting thrown in for good measure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is a thriller that isn't fun still categorized a thriller?","review":"This Japanese independent film, I believe, is the only independent film of the summer that I truly disliked. The movie revolves around a serial killer with the power to control minds to do his killing. I might have liked it if it weren't so long and repetitive, (one killing after another with almost no further plot development- not a good thing when dealing with repetition), and maybe had some three dimensional characters. Unfortunately, the gratuitous violence, which I can rarely, but this time, honestly say, is gratuitous, doesn't make up for the movie's lack of energy, rhythm, or characters, not to mention the far-fetched plot that would have required an ounce of creativity to pull off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I got this movie because of all the good reviews it received, and it's suppose to be an Asian horror film, or so it's categorized under. After watching it I was thoroughly disappointed. The movie didn't make much sense at all. There were random dead monkeys around, and the ending was even more confusing. I've seen my share of weird Asian horror films, but this was just lame. There was no resolve or much less a real plot to think over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle and Enigmatic Glimpses","review":"These nine stories feature various gentle, usually innocent main characters who are faced with dilemmas or knowledge that even they do not often understand. The stories are well-written. They are touchingly understated. Their gentleness amplifies the almost-hidden pain of the characteres. Somehow, the veneer of innocence in the stories makes the hints of ugliness even more shocking. These stories are enigmatic glimpses into the real world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasic!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is one of his best since \\"Voices Of The Heart\\". I urge you to buy this CD.

I thought I'd give the XL round brush a try and I regret doing so. I had read the review in which the reviewer presented the challenges associated with the slippery grip and I thought it wouldn't be such a big deal. Wow, was I wrong. Not only is the grip slippery but the diameter of the handle is very small making it very difficult to hold on to the brush without exerting a lot of force with my hand. It is literally painful to dry my shoulder length, relatively thin hair. And my hair ends up full of static.I have never written a review on a product before - I have never felt compelled to - but this was such a poorly designed product that is now not returnable, and I felt it important to let others know what they're getting into before they make the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding!!!","review":"I have curly frizzy hair.

I recently went to get my highlights done and when my hairdresser was blow drying my hair i noticed the brush she was using and how fast she was able to dry my hair. I asked her if i could buy the brush but she told me that i could order it through Amazon. The brushes are a bit pricey but completely worth it! I was able to dry my hair in 30mins and my hair was full of shine and completely frizz free.....love love love the brush. I bought the Xlarge brush since i have long curly hair and it was perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delivery awesome--item was delivered exactly as ordered. A five star from that perspective.","review":"Ordering item and delivery was exceptional. However I was VERY disappointed with the brush. I have several of the Bio ionic brushes and loved them!! The newer versions are missing the rubber grip on the handle and the new \\"super smooth\\" handle makes it almost impossible to hold firmly. I had to resort to wrapping the handle with grip tape. Unfortunately due to the change I would not order this product again until they put the rubber grip back on the handle. Very unfortunate as it was an awesome brush and worth every penny:( It is now a complete waste of money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special, nasty problems","review":"Although I have had better luck with other Behringer audio products this one was a let down for me. Neither of the dials on the unit I received spun smoothly. In fact they both jammed so hard at certain points in their rotation that it was hard to even move them without significant force, making the product completely useless. You won't find the nice endless rotary controllers or motorized faders from some of Behringer's other controllers here either, and there really is nothing outstanding about this unit I can mention other than its layout is a nice match for NI Traktor DJ.For the record, I'm returning mine for a refund.

Slightly lightweight and cheap feel, but then it is cheap. However, forget it if you want to use it beyond Windows XP 32 bit.

Well, as you may have been psyched and done all of your research, you've probably found out how a Behringer BCD2000 or BCD3000 is supposed to perform using Traktor DJ Studio. If you've seen it in action on a PC, you'll find that it's not the same for Mac. You CAN'T configure the USB inputs for Traktor, so if you need to tweak some controls, you aren't able to. Scratching was a big letdown too. You can't scratch without bringing the track to a stop either - you're better off spinning back the record with your mouse for a more authentic vinyl sound. Also, you can't do an instant play from the cue point... you need to cue pause first and then play it again. I'm considering other USB controller options at this point, because this simply doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This is EXACTLY what I was looking for! Although it comes with Traktor 3 LE, you can also use it with Traktor 3 Pro as well as Torq and Virtual DJ.

Check out the Traktor site for more information on how to do that.On a PC you have some more advanced options for the sound driver than on a Mac. I use this on both systems with Traktor 3 Pro and have not had any issues. If you are thinking of getting this, do it.

Most tablet users will find the expresskeys on an intuos tablet work well enough, but back when I purchased an axiotron modbook (tablet-converted macbook) I had no keys of any kind. I used the middle wheels for brush size & canvas zoom (or opacity, rotate, etc), and the five buttons were perfect for panning, color sampling, and the standard modifier keys. Since then I sold the modbook and I'm looking for a good use for the shuttle on my main pc... I don't work at home that often but if I do I'm sure I'll put it to purpose again. Maybe if I do some animation.The shortcut software is a little clunky and it took me a few tries to figure out why it was loading the wrong profile for photoshop. It had multiple profiles (for different photoshop versions) in there, but once I made them all the same I was fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent HUI Jog/Shuttle Wheel","review":"This is an excellent bit of kit.

The numerical value of the inner knob increases as you move left or right... wierd... If you were using it to control an actuator, it would only be able to travel in one direction... volume would only get louder, no matter which way you turned the knob.The outer knob is a jog style knob, but its numerical axis value is an interger from -7 to +7, only 15 steps, and the value sticks to the maximum value reached per jog.... it doesn't return to zero like the mechanical action would suggest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless film. The values expressed demonstrate ...","review":"how little man has changed over the course of history to today. The class struggles and prejudices that existed oh so many years ago are still just as prevalent and destructive today as they are portrayed in this film. This film also demonstrates how much harm unwise leaders can visit upon citizens when the citizenry is less than thoughtful and introspective with regard to the policies set forth by the governing body. Yet through it all the power of love is more than ignorance can conquer. Perhaps the most telling aspect of the film is that we (mankind) have learned next to nothing from our collective history. The same stupidity still has a far too prevalent presence in our society.Historically accurate or not (who cares) the film is thought provoking, action packed and dramatic.

Unfortunately the characterization almost destroys the film. Jason Scott Lee's character is completely oblivious to the class warfare happening around him; he's so focused on his love interest, he makes the most ridiculous decision about who should rule the island after winning the birdman contest (sorry about spoilers, did anyone think he wouldn't win?). His girlfriend is also next to useless. On the other hand, Esai Morales' character was the real hero though he is the antagonist to Lee's character. At least Morales' character cares about his people's suffering and fights for them.

Sony sucks for not releasing it when it was finished. Each album by Sophie has 2 or 3 tracks I don't care much about, hence no 5 stars for this one, but the other 9-10 are well-crafted pieces of music. I hope Sophie will come to Europe soon to promote this; I saw her on her \\"Whaler\\" tour in 1995 in Amsterdam, and she has so much energy! My favorite songs on \\"Timbre\\" are \\"No Connection\\" and \\"The Darkest Childe\\". I recommend this album for anyone that loves great alternative pop music, and fine lyrics.

Although nicely produced and engineered, it seems what once was her independence from the rest of the current pop female offerings has pushed her full spectrum to the point she too has become one of the Jewel/Tori/Melissa soundalikes.

The song tunes are catchy and emotional; the instrumentations are perfect (I'm so glad that Sophie got to keep the banjo in \\"Lose Your Way\\"!), and the lyrics are very creative (especially in \\"The Darkest Childe,\\" easily unlike any song I have ever heard)! I enjoy this album so much (especially for \\"Strange Thing,\\" \\"No Connection,\\" and \\"Mmm My Best Friend\\") that I have been forcing non-Sophie fans to listen to it, and much to my satisfaction, they are running right out to buy it! :) So great job, Sophie... your hard work has paid off, and I hope you'll be gracing us with your wonderful music for many years to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timbre Resonates","review":"This is a great CD, sexy, smooth. Give the songs a few listens before believing any of the lukewarm reviews. It's a murmuring, wailing, very focused album. That she wrote everything and performed everything and produced it herself makes a huge difference--it's very intimate, and in fact, the only jarring sound on the whole CD is the deliberately unattractive male howl on \\"The Darkest Childe.\\" If I could delete that repetitive strain from the song, I might be able to endure the song.

The authors approach was unclear and not laid out thoughtfully. I had just gotten through the \\"Flash in 24 hours\\" and I was expecting the Dreameaver book to be just as good. Unfortunately ive realized that its not the series, but the author which makes a book great. Im currently half way through and Im now on-line searching for another Dreamweaver book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teach Yourself MX? Definitely Not With This Book","review":"I bought this book and was sorely disappointed. I am a fairly proficient computer person; this book was not easy-to-follow. Contrary to a previous review, there were no \\"step-by-step\\" instructions at all. It basically said \\"do this\\", threw up a screenshot, and it didnt say exactly how to do it. I got to Chapter 6 and I am realizing that I am going to need another Dreamweaver MX tutorial book. I'm not happy about this at all.On a related note, I have bought SAMS Teach Yourself books and have never been disappointed. This was a first. ...I plan to avoid future titles from this author based on this book. This is just my honest opinion. Good luck..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Newbies","review":"If you have never used Dreamwaever before or had minimal exposure, this book will frustrate the heck out of you. I found myself constantly thinking that I had 'missed a page' somewhere because the book was not making sense. I'm only on Day 4 and am already looking for a new book. This book is not written well and is hard to follow. So for a newbie such as myself I do not need the frustration of trying to figure out the program and the book that's suppose to make the program easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased so far","review":"I have found using this book to be a frustrating experience. The author's approach, while friendly, is frequently unclear. I can't help but feel that this book was edited by already-proficient computer users, not by those who are new to computers. Illustrations scattered throughout the book often serve to further obscure, rather than clarify, the author's meaning. I had little trouble with another book in the Sams series - Teach Yourself CorelDraw 8 - so I am surprised that this one seems so hard to use.I know that the author has also written the book for DreamweaverMX 2004. One hopes that she has gotten some of the \\"bugs\\" worked out of her most recent tutorial!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction to Dreamweaver MX","review":"If you're looking for a book to get you started with Dreamweaver MX then buy this book.I found the book worth the money. It's a quick, easy, enjoyable, and productive book. It's broken into small segments that can be easily read during the typical TV commercial breaks.I found it quicker and easier to use than trying to go through the built-in Dreamweaver MX tutorial. Even though our Coldfusion MX server isn't ready, there is code and lessons learned that can even be used for Coldfusion 5 projects.After successfully finishing this book, then venture out and tackle the more complex, harder to comprehend, technical offerings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Esperaba mas...","review":"Luego de leer La Nada Cotidiana y Te Di La Vida Entera, esperaba mucho mas de este libro de cuentos cortos. En lugar de publicarlos debio dejarlas para su uso personal, como una especie de dialogo interno. Solo ella sabe lo que quiso decir en muchas partes del libro, y honestamente no habia llegado a la mitad cuando ya estaba aburrida del mismo. La narrativa captura la atencion del lector en las primeras paginas, y despues se pierde el hilo, sin contar que los personajes estan pobremente definidos.

I've never seen such a tacky looking book. There are no pictures and that is pretty unusual for a travel book, even though it is a reference-type book.

I felt I knew far too much about the characters. This did not allow me to be able to place myself in the story. If it is voyerism you are looking for, well this is a great book. However, if you want to be titilated and aroused, to be able to allow yourself to become a part of the action, this is not the book for you. A certain amount of anonymity I feel is necessary if the reader is able to imagine it is indeed themselves in the particular situation. It did concern me that the opening line of the book was \\"Sandra and Brian are a middle aged couple.\\" I almost put the book down. But I battled on and learned some lessons. I wouldn't say this is a book that shouldn't be purchased, but please bear in mind that you may be disappointed if you are seeking something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little less talk and a lot more action...","review":"When I read an erotic novel I am not reading for a totally intense or thought provoking rush, I am reading it because it is a nice thoughtless dirty book. I had to keep skipping pages to get to the juicy parts of this novel. It was very irritating, not to mention the juicy parts were not so juicy (bizzare maybe) If I had wanted to keep skipping pages for lame smutt I would have bought a cheepy paperback romance novel for $5.99 I do however recomend the Anne Rice Sleeping Beauty trilogy as well as Behind Closed doors."},{"rating":"1","title":"excellent book","review":"i read this book with my boyfriend and we loved it i dont usually like reading but just the first page got my attention!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mini Spring Clamps","review":"I ordered the same clamps maybe 3 or 4 years ago. They were nice. They were coated with the yellow vinyl instead of the black. Their spring was very sturdy and the metal was heavy and sturdy. These one here are a much cheaper version and for what you pay they should be of higher quality. They are made of light weight metal and a cheap light spring. They don't have near the clamping power as the older ones. Had I known they would be so cheap and inferior I would not have bought them. They are okay for clamping potato chip bags and cereal bags after they are opened but they are not sufficient for anything that requires a good clamping power like the old ones did. These are A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! Where can I buy the little mini yellow clamps that are heavy and really strong? I wish I knew because I still need some really strong mini clamps! I need these really small clamps but much stronger."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little slow","review":"I read all this book but it was an easy one to put down because it was slow and the plot was thin and the dialog repetitious!

It wasn't the most horrible book I have ever read but it wasn't the best either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dullsville.................","review":"O.k. Was I the only one who didn't think this book was great. The book dragged! The first 100 pages were just a struggle to get through. Then the last 200 were a struggle. A book needs to hold the attention of the reader and let me tell you that this did not. Every little distraction that came my way was a welcome repreive.

There has been a coloured movie of this story with new actors, which I also bought here but we like the original. It is a story of a part of Truman Capote's life when he was a young boy. The story tells of the closeness and understanding between him and his aunt that he lived with. She makes fruitcakes for many people at Christmas as she has to save up her pennies all year to buy the ingredients that are needed to make the cakes.

The sound is so bad that it is almost unwatchable. A movie with the caliber of acting that this one offers should be as much a classic as It's a Wonderful Life, and be treated as such, not sold as a cheap copy.

All action footage is REAL NAVY COMBAT FILM, in both black and white and in Technicolor. Real Navy airplanes, with no computer imagery here. Extremely well scripted and edited.

I use it regularly for PowerPoint presentations in office settings and as a big screen TV in our home theatre.For PowerPoint it does a tremendous job, providing clean, crisp images. For home theatre the room can't be too bright in order to see all of the detail, but that's a small concession to make for a projector that offers ease of use, very good quality, affordable replacement bulb price, and enough power to get the job done - all for under $1000.

This is probably the best portrayal of a teenager in film prior to River Phoenix's brilliant performance in RUNNING ON EMPTY. (With which this film shares a certain similarity of subject matter.)In a way, he carries the whole film.Hope Lange and Don Murray are not given much to do as MacNaughton's parents, and their acting is somewhat cliched. Robert Wagner as a psychiatrist who may or may not be in sympathy with the boy, is somewhat better.There is a fine score by Jonathan Tunick, and the Vermont and Massachusetts locations are gorgeous."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISJOINTED","review":"This film is hard to follow.

We are fans of both actors and thought it would be a good movie. We were both disappointed. Now, I do believe in Love-at-first-sight. But they did not appear to be those type of people in this movie and they were not really convincing that that is what actually occurred.

The acting is fantastic and the emotions seem very real. The story line is well-considered, but it is definitely not the typical love story.

Gere and Lane are fine actors and very likable, but I never felt any chemistry between them. I found watching the two of them fumbling around on the bed for an uncomfortable amount of time nauseating (Gere is 60). The characters are under developed and this makes for a boring first half and the \\"OH MY GOD\\" manipulative ending will make most viewers cry, but it made me laugh at its desperate attempt to save this mediocre film. All they needed to do is have Lane hang herself as the credits rolled to put the icing on the cake! On the plus side Scott Glen has an all too brief role as a grieving husband which is the film's best scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nights in Rodanthe","review":"I love Diane Lane and Richard Gere is always a wonderful actor.

Thus, the one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadful","review":"Eat your popcorn quick so you'll have a bowl to puke in if you can't look away from movie disasters. The screen play must have been generated by cliche software. The actors look old and embarrassed, except for Richard Gere, who leads with his usual self-satisfied countenance.

No real depth to characters.2. Over the top acting/behavior during scenes when a person would not normally behave that way in real life.3. Zero chemistry between Gere and Lane and I mean zero.4. The first time the characters kissed it was so bad we started laughing. The general sentiment was, \\"Now? They've chosen this moment of all moments to make out?\\"5. Watching Gere and Lane kiss, especially in the driveway scene, was like watching two senior citizens grappling around in the dark. Zero chemistry, zero passion, and actual fumbling. Yeach!Maybe they should cast Gere with someone he can't stand. At least in An Officer and a Gentleman he and Debra Winger were passionate even if it was only in their dislike for one another off screen. Lane has no sex appeal and her played out hairstyle and drab wardrobe in this film were awful.

These characters however had absolutely no chemistry together. It didn't feel real like \\"The Notebook\\" or \\"Walk to Remember\\". Even the parts that were supposed to be highly emotional weren't for me because I could not connect with the characters or storyline. It was boring right from the beginning, dull, lifeless, and I couldn't wait for it to be over. Which is sad because I thought this could be great being \\"The Notebook\\" is my favorite movie that I can watch over and over. This you seen it once you seen it enough. Strange thing is I like both actors I just didn't fit well together. Needless, to say there was \\"alot\\" of things off about this movie that could have been done much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicholas Sparks Strikes Again!","review":"Why does someone always have to die in a Nicholas Sparks story? Diane Lane and Richard Gere are wonderful actors, but this movie felt like the recipe for Message in a Bottle with a few changes. I haven't read the book, so maybe it's better...maybe.

Get 'Unfaithful' for a leagues better movie with Gere/Lane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I felt this was a rather boring, predictable story, and very slow to get started. The only reason I watched was because of the actors, who did a great job with the material they were given. The beach scenery in NC was beautiful.

First, we live in the greater Raleigh area and were happy to see familiar sites. Second, we spend a lot of time in the Outer Banks and it's so nice to see that part of the country so wonderfully captured in a movie.

It was the candlelight dinner that made me nauseous----what a terrible script!! One trite cliche after another. I wonder how these actors got through it? Maybe they were so glad to have starring roles at their age? Too bad. They are both attractive aging people and it would have been nice to see them in a script that honored that place in their lives.

It's too bad that one of the few recent cinematic attempts to explore mature adult-relationships, among still very attractive protagonists, lapses into the banal and predictable, with a cheap and too-easy emotional trick at the conclusion. Of note, however, is the fine and understated... though powerful performance of supporting player, Scott Glenn... a wonderful example of: acting without seeming to act... and still conveying volumes. Mr.Gere and Ms.Lane should have paid closer attention!I'm glad that I didn't see this in the theatre, and waited... instead, until its release on DVD, as its worth would not have been equal to the price of admission.This movie should have been much better,and is, sadly, an example of the \\"whole equaling less than the sum of its parts\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for US 505 owners","review":"This manual is primarily for European models.

I would like to believe that his misrepresentations are out of simple ignorance for the subject, but he seems to spin facts for political and ideological gain. In other works, he even expresses outright admiration for the brutality that was the crusades. His political agenda taints the scholarly value of his work.

Moreover, any reader would appreciate the fact that Islam is intolerant to a high degree, it is common wisdom so I wonder why we need to discuss this further, after all, it is the fastest growing religion, which makes this notion of intolerance all the more stronger.Spencer shows he understands the word 'jihad' so completely that you would feel there is nothing more you would want to know about Islam, after all Muslim writers only present a one-sided view, in Western 'scholarship' this is unheard of.

It's Mary Timony's most confident-sounding and grooviest album to date. I thought it couldn't get much better than her 1st Solo album, Mountains, but Ex Hex has surpassed even that great record! There's plenty of Timony's trademark, warpy splashes of tremolo in several songs, and of course, plenty of creepy, mysterious lyrics throughout. Every song is a delight to listen to, but the standout tracks are: 'On the Floor', 'Friend to J.C.', 'Silence', 'In the Grass', 'Hard Times are Hard!', '9X3', 'W.O.W' and especially the brilliant album closer 'Backwards/Forwards'.Devin Ocampo's drumming is superb as well, and propels each song with ferocity.

Although in the case of this book I have a fair idea of what the author was doing when she wrote it.Quick! Who was Leonardo having sex with when he painted the Mona Lisa. You mean -- it doesn't matter?Maybe Beethoven was having sex with the Empress of China when he wrote the Ode to Joy.

Please see the picture I uploaded in the Amazon gallery and the other pictures of this phenomenon from different users before purchasing this product.The design of this bench and the weld type, specifically where the legs meet the bench, does not seem to be intended for anything beyond light beginner weight use. I bought this bench used and I did not get a manual so I cannot attest to the weight limit warnings this product might have. However, I did not see any low weight limitations posted on the informational tags underneath the bench.I weigh around 190 lbs and bench reps of around 225 lbs.

However, when I lay down on the bench to grab a bar, the legs started wobbling. I weigh just under 160 lbs, and without any additional weight the legs began to buckle.

Strongly recommend avoiding this bench."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, but wobbly and only 300 lb","review":"Cheap, fixed bench for basic lifting.

The padding is good and the overall quality is good. The only downside I have seen from the bench so far is that it could use a wider base for doing exercises like dumbell flies... This could be considered a good thing, though: you have to use your core and bring the weights up evenly. This could also be due to that fact that the bench sits on thick carpeting.

I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very sturdy","review":"This weight bench looks great. The padding is reasonably thick and it feels comfortable on your back. After the first time I used the bench I noticed that the legs were bowing in slightly on one side. I disassembled it and reassembled it in the hope that this would correct the problem. After the second use I noted that one of the legs was bowed severely. The bench is unsafe and likely to collapse with further use. Unfortunately I'll need to retire this bench and purchase another, more sturdy model. This bench would probably be appropriate for use under 150 lbs. I used it to perform bench press exercises with two 100 lb dumbbells. This weight isn't excessive, but the bench doesn't seem designed well enough to accommodate this amount of weight.

Well, it is made in China, but what isn't these days, right?From what I could put together, it seems like an adequate bench for moderate weight lifting. I'm not sure what the weight limit is, but it's probably enough for the average home fitness user. Maybe I just received a lemon since so many other reviewers were happy with their purchase.

Not lined, so don't expect it to keep you warm but it will contribute to warmth by acting as a wind barrier via layering effect. It will be a while before I have the chance to try the rainproofness. Very happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TERRIFIC JACKET!!","review":"I LOVE this jacket so much I now own two of them. One I use for ski walking as it has a large, kangaroo pouch front pocket which is perfect to hold my iPod, keys and small wallet, gum and a few other things which I need to take with me plus it has side pockets which I can store my gloves in. Additionally it has a rain hood as we do get occasional showers here in Portland OR. I love the material as it doesn't cling when I sweat like nylon jackets do. The jacket is very easy to wash and it dries quickly. I bought the second jacket for everyday use and I love the ability to self fold it when I don't need to wear it as I can carry it or attach it to my pants belt instead of tying it around my waist. This is the PERFECT lightweight jacket to own and it comes at a PERFECT price. The company delivers it immediately. Folks, this the the only lightweight jacket you'll ever need. BUY THIS ONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice jacket","review":"The jacket is well made, and the material is a step above what you might expect in a unlined windbreaker. The seams are all nicely overlapped and there aren't a lot of loose threads hanging around. The zippers are solid, and of course the main zipper is under less stress in an anorak than a regular jacket. The color of the zippers and the frob that secures the hood drawstring are well-matched to the color of the jacket, however I bought an orange extra-large, and the sizing is correct but the color is more of an orange-caramel than what I would call orange.I didn't primarily buy it for use in the rain, and so far I haven't tried it as a rain jacket."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not water resistant after washing.","review":"I bought this jacket for a trip to Boston and needed a peice of raingear that could be bundeled up really small and fit into a purse.

The hood when laced covers your eyes so you can't see. And unless you get some other cheap windbreaker or rain pants you will be half soaked from the waist down (because the water will drip to your pants).About the only thing this jacket has going for it is that it stores well into a small little pouch.

The song selection isn't the greatest, not necessarily the Beatles tunes I would have selected to go on a lullaby album. \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" might be about sleep, but in my opinion this arrangement of it is too dissonant and weird sounding for little ears - not very soothing. Also, these arrangements seem to be slightly flat (maybe just in a bad key?) and just kind of creepy sounding. I don't like the instrumentation either. If you want to get a Beatles lullaby CD I would much more so recommend the \\"Rockabye Baby! More Lullaby Renditions of the Beatles\\" instead.

He can not, for some reason, generalize simple concepts. The author feels that he has the authority to make up his own adjectives.

The other reviewers were comparing this one to \\"City of Angels\\", perhaps in how it was done (bringing in musicians/producers for a more contemporary sound than what Jon is perhaps know for)....yet that album is much much better than this one.

The book is frankly downright silly; just about every liberal / politically correct idea in the world is addressed: Male voilence against women, homosexuality, bisexuality, tons of environmental issues, socialism, and on and on...I can understand making a social commentary, but this is one of the most cliche pieces of liberal dribble I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad","review":"The first book was interesting but the series failed to maintain a good science fiction line.

The theological thoughts are no longer delightful little subplots of a page or two, but drag on and on into endless garbage. The ending reads like a B-Movie from the 1950s with a crazed individual trying to destroy a world. At the stroke of midnight on New Year's -- well, I don't want to spoil the ending for you.

I won't waste time listing the ridiculous politics of this book. Politics in sci-fi is great if it is subtle and contributes to the story. Sawyer just used a decent sci-fi story to beat us crudely over the head with his opinions of men, Caucasians, and Americans.Rather than explore the interactions between two worlds, this novel contrasts a utopia with our flawed, failing world just to show us all how awful we are.

That said, the novel isn't for everyone. I found myself too bogged down by the quirky period dialogue and arcane nautical terms to derive much enjoyment out of this book. To boot, the plot seems pretty thin (although things thicken up a bit towards the end). I think it would be best to judge \\"Master and Commander\\" after reading several books in the series.

The events included describe Cochrane's activities when he commanded the Speedy from 1800-1801 (see \\"the Autobiography of a Seaman,\\" by Admiral Lord Cochrane, republished in 2000 by Lyons Press). O'Brien has replaced Cochrane with the fictional James Aubrey, giving him a similar personality. While O'Brien has given more color to the story, there is absolutely nothing significant that is original to the plot. I have to agree with a recent reviewer that the novel describes a lot of action without having a central plot. The second book in the series, \\"Post Captain,\\" seems to be a more original story, but many of O'Brien's novels seem to have taken significant amounts of material from earlier writers (without acknowledging that fact)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just couldn't keep reading","review":"I've never read a book where the author tried so hard to keep all the dialog and terms true to period.

I ordered this thinking I'd get the cover shown in the picture (Patrick O'Brian) written in red letters. Instead what was shipped was the new cover, which has the name in white letters.

He manages to turn out a new book each year.When I had completed reading all 18 books, I simply started with Master and Commander and read them again. When I was bed ridden due to my Cancer,I reread them a third time. Each reading enhances your appreciation of O'Brian and his magnificent use of language and detail of the times our heros lived in. I have read every author of books in this genre, no one comes close to O'Brian. Amazingly, his books have only become very popular in the past five years. His following has grown and his books will be read for decades to come.Mr. O'Brian, thank you for all the reading pleasure you have given me for the past 10 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nautics","review":"Enjoyed the instruction in old timey sailing ships.

I have read them all several times, and each time I find something I didn't notice. I have a tendancy to want action but realized that in between action and adventure themes there is also some excellent writing including romance, humor and history. I have had these books for several years and having read them all several times I still continue to pull them out and start over again. I love to read and these books are only a small part of the reading I do, but I would have to say that I have never been disapointed reading them again. To get the full effect all of the series should be read in order of their writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup of Tea","review":"I bought this book as part of a Guy's Book Club. Other Guy's in the book club had read this book and really liked it. Obviously, this whole series has a huge following and, of course, there's the Russell Crowe movie.For me, though, I couldn't get past all the dialect and authenticity. I couldn't get into the flow of the narrative and I only just barely followed the plot line. So after about 100 pages, I put it down. People who like this type of book will love it but if you're thinking of reading it because all your friends loved it and the movie was cool, you might be in for more than you bargained for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimately mesmerizing","review":"I had tried to read one of the Aubrey/Maturin books some years ago (because of my interest in the period and the lure of the Jane Austen claims) but couldn't get through it. I returned to Master and Commander and persevered, and have now gobbled up all 20 of the novels. I think they are wonderful (and far more complex than the Hornblower books, which I like, but which become rather rote psychologically)--but you do have to become accustomed to O'Brian's fluky rhythm and the almost berserk naval terminology. (I sometimes suspected that O'Brian was making up particularly convoluted naval terms and laughing at us.) You might ask, why persist? Because the novels create an imagined world, intensely interesting and vividly described. They also become completely gripping in terms of plot--O'Brian frequently leaves an important question dangling at the end of one novel, forcing you to get to the next as quickly as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opening chapter to what may be the best epic ever.","review":"The only reason I don't give this book four stars is that it takes about 100 pages to get into, quite a bit for a 400-odd page book, until you consider that it is really a ~6500 page epic divided into 20 chapters. This epic is life, neatly set out in black type, and anyone with a life today will appriciate how similar it is to life 200 years ago.

Few of the members of the bookclub were able to finish the book due to its over dependence on naval terms. My main objection to the book is that it never seemed to reach the potential it seemed to have. I was left hanging wanting to learn some useful insight into Jack or Stephen.

Having to read the other 16 or whatever books in the series would be like a punishment. Only reason I read this was that it was selected by our book club.

I got through about two chapters of this and threw it away. O'brian writes like an old woman. The story seems to be about tea parties and gossip, the time and setting seem incidental to the story.

I rarely cast aside a book before I finish it but when I reached page 280 and still hadn't come across a significant plot point it was time to run this ship aground.While it was interesting to read about life at sea in that age, an accomplished author would have found a way to do it and tell a story at the same time.

This is the first in the series.I listened to the unabridged audio version of this novel, and was VERY impressed. The narrator manages to capture Aubrey's good nature and Maturin's cheerful introspection quite well.This series is very detailed. I learned plenty about the life of British sailors and the relationships between the characters is charming and at times sad. In particular, I liked Aubrey. He has an almost cheerfully optimism that is quite infectious. Doctor Maturan is funny, but at times I wish he were more assertive.Overall, an excellent book. Well narrated. Five Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master and Commander","review":"Large type and easy to read. Very similar to the Hornblower series but with a different type of captain.

This is just the first book, but I am favorably impressed. I still really like the Hornblower series, but there are enough differences in the main characters that I am intrigued enough to continue with this string of novels.I am enjoying getting to know a lot more about the warships of the early 19th century and though I don't know much about sailing, my engineering mind tells me that the problems and solutions in the novels are realistic.I recommend this book to anyone interested in historical fiction from this period or for those interested in action and adventure in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"I tried to listen to this book as an audiobook and it just failed to hold my interest. I made it about halfway through, but there wasn't enough conflict or tension in the plot, and I didn't particularly like any of the characters. I suppose if you're into the history or the nautical terminology, then it does a good job in those respects. It just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Good Enough for Writers and Studied Readers","review":"I have devoured all O'Brian's works and am wandering the Amazon site aimlessly, hoping to one day discover a new release from the author. O'Brian's tales are a delight for the craftmanship: the way he has built the friendship between Aubrey and Maturin, the tales woven within tales, and the masterful intertwining of the consequences of events from one installment with the plot six books later. I compare O'Brian in scope and ability to Tolstoy. Comparisons to other authors of sea tales or stories from the Napoleanic Wars are irrelevant. This author deserves comparison for his superb writing.

However, I found Master and Commander to be far less accessible and enjoyable to read. First, I am up on all my nautical terms. Second, I have an advanced degree and am more than used to reading complicated subject matter. Though I appreciate the more gritty realistic edge to Master, I think it falls far short of Hornblower based purely and solely on writing alone.In Master and Commander the dialog is just plain weird, NOT in terms of the terminology, but in the constant shifting of topics of discussion between the characters. In a similar way scenes also shift without warning and it all adds up to a very confusing and less than satisfying read. If you really want a sea tale and to be taken away to live in the world of the Royal British Navy, go read Hornblower and/or see the DVDs for both Hornblower and Master and Commander!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is impossible to get enough of Patrick O'Brian","review":"O'Brian was a master storyteller.

I still haven't seen the movie. I hope that it's easier to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"First of Many","review":"One begins Master and Commander with some trepidation -- it being the first chapter of an intensely beloved twenty volume series. Fortunately, the opening scenes depicting the first meeting of O'Brians's long running protagonists are funny and engaging. It is only thereafter that the book becomes a challenging read.There is a little in the way of an overarching narrative; Master and Commander serves as more of an introduction to life on a Napoleonic brig, and to Aubrey and Maturin. But the book's real difficulty lies in its absolute immersion in its era. It makes no concession to a modern reader lacking knowledge of the period, the setting, or how to rig a frigate. This makes the book a sometimes tough read -- but is also why it is ultimately so rewarding.One close's Master and Commander with the sense of having spent time with very particular people in a very particular time, looking forward to doing so again in the next volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus, Mary and Patrick be with you: read these books!","review":"The shame of the world then, if you have never treated yourself to a Patrick O'Brian before.

When I picked up this book, I wondered why he had switched ghostwriters. After reading it, I wondered no longer. Approximately the first half of this disappointing, rather trashy book is simply an inferior recycling of the same autobiographical material in Once More from the Beginning. The remainder is a grab-bag of anecdotes, vignettes, smutty stories, all written in a breathlessly breezy, glib, gossipy, frivolous style that is long on tawdry titillation and short on class, taste, and substance--and sometimes believability as well. Anyone interested in Merrill's life and career should read Once More from the Beginning; it's no masterpiece but it's a lot better than this redundant, unnecessary dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out Of Africa","review":"This is an awesome soundtrack.

The more I read about this war, the more I shake my head. A war that was poorlu executed. poorly run and sometimes well fought.

Serious history scholars will want more but for the casual reader this book makes a great read.The author does a good job of outlining the convoluted reasons for how and why we got into the war. Along the way we are introduced to many colorful characters, ranging from the heroic to the hapless and corrupt. The war ends simply because each side is war weary, leaving the reasons for the war unresolved.I disagree with the author's ultimate conclusion that the war of 1812 \\"forged a nation\\".

The chapters jump back in forth in terms of time, which makes the book (and the War of 1812) difficult to follow. I feel that the author gets burdened down on details that are not needed, and in the end makes the book less readable. All I can say is that while parts of the book were interesting, most of the time I found my mind wandering and had to try really hard to stay focused. Unfortunately, because I didn't get much out of this book I will need to find another, better book about the War of 1812."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining and Interesting History","review":"I found this book to be very interesting and readable. The author writes in a conversational and easy to understand manner. Also, the chapters are easily digestible and discuss the key events in the war in a colorful way that brings them to life.One element that would have improved this book is more maps of the battles that occurred. Without maps, it was hard to figure out where the participants were fighting geographically and what tactics helped one side or the other win.I also felt a sense of detachment from the participants. The author does not spend a lot of time delving into the mindsets of the key commanders. It would have been interesting to learn of the thoughts and emotions each side was experiencing (including the President) to make the experience more real.Overall, though, this book is very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The novela is great.

Of the 4 times I've tried to use the index I was directed to a page that had nothing to do with what I was looking for. Each topic is devoted 2 pages, left and right of the open book form. The right page simply has definitions related to the topic. Left page has an illustration for the topic. But, I have yet to find clear explanation for any of the topic I wanted to learn. The cartoon illustrations are a bit too complicated and this confusion is compounded by the text saying things like \\"note the central role of such and such.....in the illustration\\" when the illustration is a bit too complex with too many arrows.

I still turn to it regularly, especially for the pattern designs in the back. This book provides a good overall reference and covers the basics that everyone should know, especially a beginner. I don't know if I would want to teach myself to knit from this book, although it does cover the very basics. I especially appreciate the breadth of the book and the pattern reference which is a good starter reference, rather than buying a second book. My first knitting book was the Leisure Arts \\"Learn to Knit\\" booklet and this book would make a good companion to that for a complete beginner. For the price I think it is one of the best overall references for a beginning or relatively inexperienced knitter. For a more advanced knitter, or one who is adventuresome, I recommend Montse Stanley's \\"Knitter's Handbook\\" although that does not have a stitch pattern guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"And Ever Amen","review":"Chilling yet beautiful, much of the appeal of the Cranes' music resides in its ritualistic nature. It is simple, ethereal and primal and not too far removed from the more minimal excursions of Death In June or Sol Invictus, albeit more conventionally \\"pretty\\" and with more emphasis on melody. Like those bands, the key here lies in rhythmic repetition and crescendo: the songs tend to start simply, becoming more layered and complex as they progress toward a blunt ending (ie, the music seeks to function subliminally as an analogy to life; a dangerous attempt in less capable hands: portentious can equal pretentious, with unintentionally comic results). And as with those bands, the music ranges from the (morosely) beautiful and resigned (\\"Far Away\\") to the intensely defiant (\\"Clear,\\" \\"Sun And Sky\\"). The heavily echoed voice is largely unintelligible but this in itself speaks volumes. Exhilarating and compelling: listen and get cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling...","review":"Alison Shaw's voice....what's the word? Ethereal....haunting....otherworldly. She whisps along in a voice that shouldn't work with the music, but does. Sometimes she sounds lost, but almost deliberately so. Other times she grooves along in a more dramatic fashion. And I don't think I was expected to like it as much as I do. But I do. Ten years behind the times, granted (the album was originally released in 1993), but I'm sure enjoying listening to it. For me, it's the vocals that make it, but the music varies from spooky to more driving beats, which is also intriguing. Plus, there are lots of strings - mostly guitar, granted. But some cello (yum), violins and so forth as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Addendum","review":"To prospective buyers it may be helpful to know that this is a British book: the selection of names is heavily influenced by this.

A different way to read a story in a comic book fashion and capture your attention throughout the entire book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a better book without the holocaust.","review":"this is a good book, regardless of the fact that Art Spiegelman is a jerk. The actual story of Maus is quite unoriginal, and tells us things about the Holocaust we hear in school and everywhere else the Holocaust is mentioned, but what puts it above other works is the fact that it's a comic book with mice and cats. The best parts of Maus are the parts where he's not telling the story of the Holocaust...where he tells the story of his impossible relationship with his father (who successfully tries to bring back half-eaten groceries) and also in Part II where he discusses the success of Part I and how it drives him insane. I will always remember the picture of him wearing a mouse mask, sitting at a drawing table on top of a heap of dead Jews (Mice)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animal caricatures misguided","review":"It's true that the Germans considered themselves, Jews, and Poles to be distinct races, almost different species. However, this book is told from the point of view of the Jews, not the Germans. Why would the Jews see Germans, French and Poles as three different species? Spiegelman ends up endorsing this super-nationalistic point of view despite himself.And making his wife a mouse - that's really a cop-out. It's hard to avoid the feeling that the mice are people, and non-mice are all some sort of monsters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judea Declares War on Germany....again.","review":"Here's another in a long line of products designed to focus exclusively on the Jewish experience of WWII. By either completely omitting the experiences of peoples from other nations, (except the Poles, who are presented in this book as pigs), this book is a fine example of the Jews exclusive claim to the title of World Champion of All Victims. As with the majority of Holocaust(tm)survivor stories, the majoriy of the situations referred to in this book have been shown to be inaccuracies, distortions, or just outright lies.There's no business like Shoah Business and this book is just one more Jewish product desigend to pull at your heartstrings while emptying your pockets."},{"rating":"1","title":"40% of the truth is not the full truth.","review":"This book is to shape Americans youngsters minds with use of half-truths.

While much of this author's current writing are complete garbage, this book tells the story of the Holocaust like none before it. The language, the illustrations, the expressiveness of the writing, are unmatched. This book can be read and enjoyed by children and adults alike. Everyone should own this quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED it as a family member","review":"This is very historcly acurate. For those who think not I suggest you watch -'Escape from Sobibor'. It's based on a real event and one jew who ecsaped got beatin to death by fellow polish who hated Jews. This book is a memoir of 1 person who did not live everybodies lives. The only people who got tormented since the begining of time were the Jews and Gypsies. They (Jews) were slaves of the Egyptions and tormented for all their exsitince, as with the Gypsies. Maybe you might want to think of the 'American Dogs' or 'French Frogs' if you want to critize, so grow up and get a history text book! If you'd like to read any of the Maus books, I highly suggest it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Simple Review of a Great book.","review":"I had to read both of the Maus book as a summer assignment for school so i wasn't expecting to enjoy them as much as i did. Basically the central theme of the book is the Holocaust but it goes beyond just the Holocaust, it takes you to the years before and then you can really understand the gradual decline of Europe into WWII and it's just not \\"another Holocaust novel.\\" The author shows the effect of the Holocaust on his parents, Anja and Vladek and it makes you physically sick to read the vivid details and see the pictures which are really simple drawings. The drawings give you and even better perspective on the roles certain groups of people played during this time and really leaves an open door for you to deciepher the meaning of the \\"animal metaphors.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A landmark work in many ways","review":"Schools are beginning to assign this work as serious literature worthy of serious study, which it is. The \\"comic book\\" approach is highly accessible, yet retains a great deal of subtlety and nuance in illustrating (literally and figuratively) the far-reach psychological impacts wrought by the holocaust.The book has also advanced the state of comic books from the status of children's pap toward a medium with power and artistic merit for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly wonderful","review":"A book for all ages. A gripping tale of human suffering and survival during Holocaust. A poignant story for all to remember and reflect. Basically this book is about the life stories of Art Spiegelman's parents before and during the Holocaust, with a little reserved for stories after the war tragedy. You will feel not only sympathy, but profound empathy after you have finished reading the book. A really wonderful, albeit a little sad ending book."},{"rating":"2","title":"an amazing","review":"i used Maus as a text for a university class and found it to be a great story which was easy to read. the characters are great, the story amazing and best of all the comic form was brilliant. A must read for anyone interested in the Holocaust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving, if a bit biast","review":"When I picked up this book I didn't expect to be so drawn in by the story, despite the simple art design. I have to admit the story is quite worthy of the prize it received but, like others have said, it is a bit biast in that it focuses mainly on the persecution of the Polish Jews when there were many, many others who died along with them, stuck in the same boat.Still, considering what Art's father went through, one can't blame him for having a sort of narrow vision of events; because he was, half the time, trying to use his brain to get out of situations. Even so, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good, dramatic read or who wants to know more about the Holocaust (from one man's point of view)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blind to his own racism","review":"I was predisposed to like this book. The Holocaust is a subject of consummate importance, which deserves to be revisited in every media, as a cautionary reminder. Unfortunately Spiegelman's pen reveals just how easy it is to slip into the kind of mindless, dehumanizing racism which led to the Nazi theories initially responsible for the hideous brutality they unleashed. Although the non-Jewish, non-Nazi characters in this book are portrayed (as recalled by the author's father) by their actions as good people who actually helped, or tried to help the poor \\"mice,\\" they are nevertheless depicted as pigs. What is the message? What kind of ingrained prejudice is at work here? Obviously the same prejudice which allows so many readers to laud this book and ignore the ugly irony that spoils it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A greatly intriguing story of life in the Holocaust.","review":"As soon as you open the somewhat childish-looking book, you will be unable to put it down! The story Artie conveys through his realistic comics is both exciting and real. The book \\"Maus,\\" by Art Spiegelman, tells two stories in one; the life of Vladek and Anja during the Holocaust, and Artie's trying relationship with his father. The trying relationship between Vladek and his second wife Mala is consistent throughout the novel, as is Artie's up and down relationship with his father. The details in every comic truly show how life was for the Polish Jews during the Holocaust. Spiegelman's metaphor is perfect: the Jews are mice and the Nazis are cats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maus","review":"excellent book. i already had it in softcover but the pages began coming out; very nice to have it in hardcover. excellent service; received the book in perfect condition in only a few days."},{"rating":"2","title":"a gentle giant of a book","review":"The powerful impact of this story sort of sneaks up on you in the cracks between the cartoon panels. This story both of his parents troubles in Nazi occupied Poland, and ultimately as Holocaust survivors, is blended with the story of his strife with his aging father. This is simple and powerful. Story telling stripped to the bare bones."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Doubt What 'Schweine\\" Means","review":"Perhaps Spiegelman's choice of pigs to represent Poles is innocent. However, there is not doubt what the Germans meant when they used the epithet \\"Schweine\\" (swine) for the subjugated Poles. To the extent that Spiegelman is copying the Germans' vocabulary, he is taking part in their mentality. If, however, the choice of pigs is meant to imply that the Poles were well-fed, then this is an utter travesty of history. Fact is that, while Poles were better off than the Jews, it was not by much. The Poles under German occupation had very little to eat compared with the French, Belgians, etc., under German occupation. And, by showing Poles killing Jews who returned for their property, he is distorting events by depicting something as normal that happened to perhaps several hundred Jews out of some 200,000 who likewise came to reclaim their property without incident. In any case, the anti-Polish slant is rather obvious."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stuff rocks !","review":"The author of this cool comic book depicts Poles as pigs, Germans as cats and Jews as huge, size of a pig, rats. In some situations rats, because of their size, were even able to pretend of being pigs. Spiegelman does not explain what huge rats were doing among pigs neither how nor why they landed there in such an enormous quantity. Most likely the depiction is to indicate the reason for that huge number. Pigs were quite dumb, not able to differentiate between themselves and masked huge rats even though they, pigs and rats, have totally different tails, cool stuff! Cats, as they normally do, were chasing rats, but in this crazy zoo cats were really nutty ones wearing swastikas and using guns. All at all it is quite entertaining comic book however none of the described animals, would make a good pet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Polish Propaganda","review":"While this a moving account of one families experience during the holocaust, the depiction of Poles as pigs in Spiegelman's \\"Maus\\" an unfair and highly insulting caricature. Poles suffered horribly under Nazi occupation. Few nations suffered worse. Six million Poles were murdered. Roughly half were Jewish and half Gentile. In fact exterminating Poles was also part of the Nazi master-plan. They were victims and to portray them as pigs is a grave injustice. While I read the reviews pointing out pigs have positive traits it is disingenuous to present the selection of the pig as representative of the Pole as anything but a slur. I suggest when reading this book you research the positive events in the 1000 history of Polish Jews. For starters, visit Yad Vashem in Jerusalem. Over 11,000 'Righteous Gentiles' are honored; almost 5,000 are Polish. These are non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small, simple and subtle: a very nice film about growing up","review":"A small and well-made film about a boy who stutters and stands back from life and what led him to engage.I liked this movie quite a bit. It's not groundbreaking or classic or amazing -- and the basic premise of a kid with speech problems who ends up on a debate team due to a crush on a deceitful girl is a bit implausible -- but it fits very nicely into the genre of \\"Sundance-style\\" quirky films about ordinary folk with issues finding their way. I did think that the omniscient voiceover was a bit out of place and unnecessary.Still, the film features some excellent performances, clever dialogue, engaging cinematography, and an enjoyable soundtrack.

It is bigger than the cheapo ones we had, but that's fine, because we can stick a LOT of clothes on it.No instructions in the box whatsoever, but it's so simple to put together that none are needed!

What is so great about the Amplified Bible? The prob here is that when it 'amplifies' a word or a phrase, one must make one's own choice on the particular word---whether or not one has a background in Greek. Then, some will go off on a wrong interpretation. It is still a very difficult read. It's an accurate translation, though, and formal equivalence.

Amplified words are in parenthesis to help with understanding the context of verses."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreliable","review":"Amplified Bible is an English translation that attempts to clarify the meanings of words in original Biblical languages (Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic). It uses multiple English word equivalents to amplify meanings that may otherwise have been concealed by the traditional translation method. It is very convenient to use. Unfortunately, the \\"amplification\\" is unreliable, often exaggerating or distorting the nuances of the words in original languages. The readers are misled to believe that he/she has uncovered \\"hidden treasure\\" not seen in standard English translations(KJV, NASB, NIV, etc.). In fact, most popular-level word study references suffer from this weakness. If you are serious about word study, but have no working knowledge of original Biblical languages, you should consult more reliable references such as Mounce's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old & New Testament Words, Hebrew-Greek Key Word Study Bible, Interlinear for the Rest of Us, and ESV English-Greek Reverse Interlinear."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMPLIFIED BIBLE - KINDLE VERSION","review":"Having been a caregiver most of my life (as well as worked for hospice), it was/is an honor to be able to provide care and comfort to the failing, of all ages.

In addition to providing 'domestic' care and companionship, I was/am often asked by the patients to read from the Bible. (I have many versions in my library to use or reference, and as I am knew to the kindle format - this is my newest acquisition.) Usually I would/will read the 23 Psalm or some other passage that provides hope and comfort, and this AMPLIFIED BIBLE is a nice version to use, and easy to read with a nice font size and is easy for the patient/person to apprehend while being read to.

Just because a word can have a particular semantic range doesn't mean one can pick and choose the meaning they want.

I have almost every version and translation of the Bible except the Amplified. I regret having waiting so long to use this version in my studies. This is not a \\"study\\" Bible, with copious footnotes of interpretation at the bottom of each page. Rather, there are in-text amplifications of meanings of the original words - and it is these amplifications which have given me new and profound insight into verses I know by heart. In addition, I find the legitimately extra amplification of words [in brackets] to be of immense help. In summation, one of the best Bibles for inspirational reading or serious study."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"This is not good quality as I expected, It looks more like false one-- I mean the print looks so uncomfortable to read.

It wound up being because my cycle is longer than normal (33 days). So finally on day 20, the dark line is there, and I know that we need to try 24-48 hours after that time. The instructions say, and I have since confirmed on about 20 websites, that the LH surge is not indicating ovulation itself, but rather, the surge is what causes ovulation to occur.LH surge>>start of fertile period>>24-48 hours>>ovulation>>12-hour egg life>>end of fertile period.Don't forget too that the sperm can live up there for a couple days, so best to get going within 12 hours of the first dark line you see on these strips. These ovi strips rock. It's so great that you can do 3 a day if you want without feeling wasteful since they're so inexpensive. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not original Wondfo strips","review":"These strips are not the original Wondfo strips. I had used the Wondfo strips before and conceived using them. I like those strips so much better. But these are not Wondfo but some cheap copy of it. I am hooked with Amazon, so I thought what the hell, may be different company but it might work like Wondfo. But I was so wrong. I wonder if these work at all. If you are blown away by the positive feedback please notice that all the positive feedback are old. Because they used to sell the original thing before but when they had enough positive feedback on them they just switched the product. I order them from ebay now. They cost almost same and they are much much better than these nameless things. I don't think you can find original Wondfo strips on amazon anymore. All things that say Wondfo are the cheap copies. I would not recommend them to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Accurate","review":"The strips are packed individually with a set of basic instructions printed on the outer packaging.

My only real complaint with these strips is that the dye on the color bands is very streaky/blotchy, and can make them hard to compare. It's almost like the color band doesn't fill in entirely in certain areas of the line. I don't think it will keep me from seeing a positive though.Oh and the directions say to test when your urine is at room temperature, which I thought was odd and I'm not sure why its necessary but I'm doing it anyway. I just let the cup sit for 15-20 mins then come back and test. Not a big deal for OPKs but it will probably be hard to wait that time when using the pregnancy tests!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very accurate and convenient","review":"I loved these.

However, several tests were missing. I searched my order & the seller profile, but I was unable to find contact information for the seller to request the missing tests be sent. So, I contacted an Amazon representative, who also said they do not have contact information for this seller. Not very good business practice & I don't suggest ordering from this company for that reason alone. As for the product itself, they are easy to use and the directions included were clear and informative. At the same time, the tests I received were pretty beat up inside their pouches, and the first test I did as a trial showed a FALSE POSITIVE on day 5 of my cycle! I have used the more expensive test strips in the past, and I am not very encouraged by this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, but poor performance","review":"These aren't great. They are really hard to tell if you are positive, my husband even took one that turned up very close to positive (not quite, but close).

I took them 2x a day, as directed and really just have no clue what's going on. I am really very disappointed with these strips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Pay More?","review":"These test strips are effective and a fraction of the price what you will pay at the drug store. The only difference (other than price) is that this strip is just a little teeny stick you have to dip in a cup instead of one that comes with a plastic shield so you can pee on it. Even if you prefer to pee on the stick directly (it doesn't really matter to me whether I'm peeing on a stick or in a cup), the huge savings makes these tests worth it. I had used an ovulation kit bought from the store before I bought these which resulted in an unsuccessful attempt. The first cycle I used these tests, I was successful and now have lots of leftovers! Even with the small number of tests I ended up using, it was still a better bargain than if I had bought one kit at the drugstore. I think it was probably a bit of luck and coincidence that I was successful on the first try using these, but it is still a good indicator that these tests do actually work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it the price indicates the quality IMO","review":"I bought these hoping for a quality OV test that I could use throughout the month however the first day I used them it indictaed I had an LG surge when I know I didnt because I had literally just finished my period and then as I got closer to my ovulation day the control line was barely there let alone the test line showing anything. I doubt I used them wrong, how hard is it to not drink anything for 2hrs then pee in a cup and dip a stick for three seconds. Would recommend something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEY DONT WORK!","review":"I purchased these last week and received a positive result every day! I decided to take them to see what a negative looks like since I KNEW I WAS ON CYCLE DAY 5. Well it was positive and it continues to be positive! Every other test that I bought after this test says negative. I am not scheduled to ovulate in another 13 days or so. I know I would not have so many positives back to back. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! GO TO EARLYPREGNANCYTEST WEBSITE. Most ppl use those and I haven't heard about any issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine","review":"I've used these for several cycles and have gotten the positive result each time. I use these until I think I have a positive result and then check it with a more expensive name brand one. Every time, it's been right on. Initially I wasn't totally sure that the result I was getting was positive. The line does not get darker than the control. Gets about the same color. Somtimes it's even slightly less dark, but definitely darker than on other days (a definite change). When I've compared with the name brand, it's always been a positive. Also, it says to test with room temp urine. I never do and it has worked fine. The only reason I didn't give these 5 stars is because I'm not completely confident with results and always check with the name brand. But these do save lots of money and allow me to test twice a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work","review":"These tests doesn't work at all. I used it to test for ovulation from day9 to day 21 after first day of period and there was never once any positive result, it's always a very faint line comparing to the control line. I thought my LH level was so low that it was below detection and turned back to guessing work. After 6 monthes of not being pregnant, I decided to test for ovulation again with these test trips and the First response brand that I got from costco. on day 16, while the costco strips showed a clear positive, these are still showing the very faint line which indicates negative. Don't waste you time and money on these total garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price and easy to use","review":"I bought the strips about a month ago, they shipped fairly fast.

My Aunt and Unlce who are avid birders and live in MA came to visit me when I was in VA and had never seen this device before.

So was my opinion of the original Godzilla, and Rodan, etc. Sadly, after ordering the DVD, I quickly realized that a child sees things through different eyes than does an adult. The cyclops scene was the only excitement worth noting (despite a terrible makeup job on the cyclops). The film is basicaly a big letdown. The sound and picture quality are very poor; a lot of static in the sound and a picture that sorely needs to be remastered and cleaned up. The film offers 3 language choices (English, Italian, and French) but there are no subtitle options or extras.

All ranges of Douglas' performance are exhibited with each range setting the mood of the scene. The film is not so much a sword/sandle epic as an opportunity for Douglas as the center of the work to strut stuff, exhibiting his skill at varying emotions; if you notice closely, the mood of the scene is not determined by lighting or background (both of which remain more or less static all through the film) but instead by Kirk's performance. One of his very best performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic story and well depicted film","review":"Family is studying mythology and decided to \\"dig up\\" this film to help comprehension and expand imagination. The subtitles were great - forced others to really pay attention and watch the film since it was in Italian. We watched this film more than once and it did not disappoint. Although this movie's story line was a truncated version of the original book, the Odyssey, it was done well.

The easy, step-by-step lesson format is delightful. The \\"meanings-at-a-glance\\" keywords are enormously helpful (your eye usually beelines *right* to the exact keyword you need to see).Other books give you long-winded essays souped up with every symbol in the known universe. And then they throw in the Archetype of the Kitchen Sink, too, just for good measure.Such writers mean well, but their books are too often vague and chatty - something like Tarot for Politicians. This book, on the other hand, gives you brilliant discussions that are focused, practical and down-to-earth.I'm no expert, by the way.

Joan Bunning gives GOOD and understandable meanings for each card, as well as \\"teaches\\" you how to do readings, and how to ask questions. She even has exercises, where you can practice your skills. She knows how to make tarot fun! Since I am still practicing doing readings, I use this book for referece A LOT! I am SO glad that I bought it. The only negative is that she does not review the meanings of cards being reversed. Also, she focuses on one deck, Rider-Waite, but you can use any deck with this book. It's a GREAT book and a MUST HAVE if you're a novice, and want to learn more about tarot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Overview","review":"This was not at all my first book on the subject, but I agree with other reviewers that the lesson chapters of the book explain Tarot basics in a concise, easy to understand way. The thing I love most in this book is the pages for individual cards. In additon to helpful keywords and question-oriented descriptions of the card illustrations, each has several suggested Reinforcing and Opposing cards listed. For me, considering the possible relationships that my current card might have with other cards gave me a huge leap of insight in how to view cards interact in a spread.

For many this is a life constantly teetering on the edge of survival. The descriptions of India are fascinating, as are the lives of the four main characters. This is not a novel filled with hope, but with much despair. I liked the main characters, but I was somewhat distanced from them because the author uses a lot of narrative explanation about their thoughts and feelings, rather than involving the reader with them directly. I would have liked to see more hope mingled with the tragedy, although this might be unrealistic. Nevertheless, an interesting and incredibly enlightening read."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Painful","review":"This book is very well written. Reading it was so difficult for me because of the story. The main characters were wonderful, each very endearing. But what it left me with is a heavy heart and a sense of hopelessness. It reminds me of Arundhati Roy's The God of Small Things, not because of both books taking place in India but because no one made it out unscathed. I felt that both books challenge the reader to live through the unimaginable.It took place during the rule of Indira Ghandi in an unnamed place in India. Political corruption was unimaginable. The strong preyed upon the weak, torture and maiming were common place. I finished it a week ago and am still upset by it.

Although both stories contain equal amounts of death, disfigurements and hopelessness, this one does a better job of painting the characters as real people, and allows the reader to better identify with the various people in the book -- which in turn makes all the crap they suffer through seem even worse.It's a story that covers various generations of people living in India up through the late 70's. It talks alot about forced sterilizations, all forms of corruption, and duty/tradition as it conflicts with modernization. If you're looking for a great big downer this would be a wonderful read to ruin your week.

The fine balance that they work so hard to maintained slowly but viciously frays away until there is nothing left but resigned misery and nostalgic memories.The ending shocked me with its morbid and dispair.

If I had it to do over again, and was warned about its ultra-depressing ending, I would have passed on it, absolutely no doubt.

I'm one of those who do a good job keeping the emotions in check, but even I was still depressed a week after finishing the book. However, if you still want to know what the book is about, here's my one-sentencer:The story peaks in 1975 with the State of Emergency declaration by the prime minister of India as individuals from different backgrounds, all bent on survival, realize that, sometimes, life is simply a struggle to find a place to lay your head at night, and justice is reserved for the highest, crookest bidder.If you decide to read the book, at least make sure you have ample supply of Kleenex, but this is one my highly-recommended reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relentlessly bleak","review":"A well-written, but relentlessly bleak account of life in India under the \\"emergency.\\" Mistry places his characters in situations that attract every possible misfortune that could possibly occur in many lifetimes. So much misery loses its impact and at the end I found myself asking \\"What, this character's mother is still alive? How did that happen?\\".On another note, some of the \\"emergency\\" measures taken at the time of the story can be a cautionary message on government excess that could face us today during the current security crisis in this country if we are not vigilant to protect our rights.Finally, I would like to read reviews from people who lived through these times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life is what we fill it with....","review":"This author wrote a compelling story on 4 main characters. I tend to like reading books that teach lessons or leave something behind providing hope. This did neither. The author was great at captivating the audience and I felt as if I was in the story. I read this in 4 days in my evenings, hoping, and hoping,... only to feel jilted by hope. If you want inspiration, do not read. If you want truth or a true story line, read. This story depicts realism, as well, sadly but true... makes you realize the fortunes in your own life (health, freedoms, and family) I recommend as a personal growth lesson, but not as a \\"pick-me-up\\" (better to stick with the Sound of Music for that!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The balance tilts, in Mistry's favor","review":"Yes, it does require a fine balance, between hope and despair, between good and evil, and between writing about scrounging beggars and peeping into the psyche of well to do businessmen. And Mistry has mastered this art of balance with amazing dexterity. His descriptions are so graphic that you could see the characters leaping out of the pages right in front of you. Quite a pity that people not familiar with the political history, language and lifestyles of the Indian subcontinent might find themselves at a loss to understand the finer points, but then, as one of the characters in the novel says, \\"Loss is part and parcel of that necessary calamity called life.\\" Brilliant piece of work. One word of caution though. People who get bouts of depression very easily are advised to stay away from the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly Beautiful","review":"A Fine Balance was an amazing read. Rohinton Mistry makes you feel as though you are actually in India during the Emergency, and he makes you truly consider the injustices that occurred to the everyday citizens in the name of \\"civil order.\\" While it is not the most upbeat book that I have ever read, I feel as though all readers will walk away a little more aware of other cultures. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving, and riddled with tired stereotypes","review":"This is the first novel I have read by Rohinton Mistry. What struck me about this novel was its incredible succession of pessimistic stereotypes used to talk about the state of Indian society, polity, etc.. I don't object to the use of stereotypes as a gimmick to sell(anything that sells is OK, I guess), but it is sad to see a needlessly maudlin and unreal depiction of India win critical acclaim as well. The narrative is long-winded but not rich - mere detail cannot capture the essence, Mr. Mistry. If you must read it, go ahead, but at the very least, take Mr. Mistry with a large pinch of salt."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Balance","review":"This was a great story. I took it as my main book on a two week vacation. I thought it would take me about that long to read it, because it is a large book. I got so involved with the characters, that I couldn't tear myself away. There are no incidental characters. I love the way the author weaves each person into the story so that when you meet them later they have evolved into an indispensable part. There was so much going on, that when I was asked what it was about, I had a hard time trying to retell it. There was just so much! If there was one thing I would change, it would be the ending. It caught me totally off guard and I am still trying to figure out WHY?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I found this book when an aquaintance told me it was better than the Kite Runner, which is one of my favorite novels from the past few years. So, hearing that evaluation, I had to read \\"A Fine Balance.\\" In my opinion, it was not better than the Kite Runner -- but an excellent tale in and of itself. In this story, we meet four characters whose lives become interconnected in India during the '70s. You learn about where each character came from and how they got where the are. There are many tragic moments, and thankfully there are some lighthearted ones too. I would recommend this novel to anyone who is interested in exploring other cultures and countries. My biggest criticism is the novel's length. There were sections that could have been edited to make it a more compact story, but you definitely learn a lot about each character in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupidity and filth","review":"I cannot find a single character to sympathize with. The author keeps using Indian words I have to look up. Why doesn't he say day care center if that's what he means?Dina is stupid and mistreats her employees. Her employees are stupid and don't demand lunch breaks or fair wages.The whole country is filthy and unjust. I despise everything about it. I quit reading 1/4 of the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Watching the Grass Grow","review":"I am not a professional book reviewer or critic. However, I am an avid reader, and this is the 3rd book in recent memory that I could not finish because it did not hold my interest - and moved slowly. The first two were: Cold Mountain and Infinite Jest.If you are like me, very busy with minimal time to read, this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable. Literally.","review":"This book is a piece of trash. I've never read about so much death and destruction. Someone dies, gets raped, or castrated on every other page. At times, instead of making me sympathetic to the plight of the severely unfortunate characters in the book, I found myself laughing, and waiting for the poor fools to fall into their next hilarious misfortune (again, always only a few pages away). India was (and still is) a fairly harsh place to live in for poor untouchables, but this book describes conditions which are so obviously untrue, only the most simple of readers would believe. Shame on you \\"Rohinton\\" for trying to mislead ignorant readers.Don't waste your money on this filth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"Sorry, couldn't get through this one....lost my interest in the first chapter and reading each paragraph was like trying to decipher the Russian language."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw it in the garbage","review":"I threw this book away before getting through the first 100 pages. I was dissapointed. There were too many sex scences, I guess it would be a good book if you do not mind that sort of thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable!","review":"Don't start this book unless you intend to finish it. Don't start this book without expecting to be haunted by it. As a South Asian who has travelled to the subcontinent many times, I can safely say that what Rohinton Mistry depicts is very very accurate. This book is probably the closest many Americans will come to actually visiting India. Every single character (and there are many) affects the reader and every single character is unforgettable. Other reviewers have gotten themselves caught up in the despair and the struggle faced by many of the characters on a daily/hourly basis. Looking beyond the horrible things that happen, however, its possible to the see the important message in the book: hope. Oprah should be thanked for bringing this book to everyone's attention. It certainly deserves all the praise its been getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written...","review":"...just don't read this if you're suffering from depression. I have been to India many times and am part Indian as well... I found many aspects of this book to be eerily accurate and some parts I had to laugh out loud... but I wish it would have been different at the end. I won't say more but I put the book down and didn't feel that great. A better suggestion for a foray into well-written and (imagine!) inspiring Indian work: LIFE OF PI by Yann Martel. That is a fantastic book and won some international awards. You get a great idea of India in that one and it has a more uplifting tone. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"In all respects, a terrific work.","review":"_A Fine Balance_ is one of the most cinematic novels I've come across, but in its current state (and this is a compliment), it would make poor fodder for a Hollywood adaptation. While too huge for the screen, the book fits its 700-odd pages wonderfully. Mistry has written a broad story, and has employed an amazing perceptive ability to draw very rich, very real characters. He's also quite instructive: the book teaches about Indian politics, ethnic rivalries, civil corruption, and human resiliance, but it does its work all within the context of the novel's story and people. _A Fine Balance_ was recommended to me, and I've been doing my best to pass the favor onto anyone who'll listen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Book","review":"What perhaps I enjoyed most was the \\"fleshing out\\", bringing to life for me, of all the stories, all the details of the lives I could see etched in the thousands and thousands of faces I saw when I travelled through India, but never got to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mistry Creates a Literary Feast","review":"A reader must show a commitment to get through this 713 page novel, but the experience will be very rewarding and pleasurable. A Fine Balance is a balance indeed, weighing hope against despair, strength against sorrow, pain against pleasure and love against loss. The reader is lucky, for Rohinton includes enough material, texture, detail and character development in A Fine Balance to fill several books. Despite its size, the book is hard to put down (I often caught myself sneaking a few pages while waiting for elevators) and very hard to forget. My mind often drifted back to the characters for days after I finished the book. While many of us are lucky enough not to have been brought up in the miserable conditions of mid seventies India, we can still appreciate and identify with many of the characters' struggles and trails in the context of our own lives."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],M={key:0},H={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const j=d(C,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-e45571bf"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/34.md","filePath":"library/34.md"}'),R={name:"library/34.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
