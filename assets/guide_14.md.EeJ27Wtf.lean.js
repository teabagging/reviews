But to use it as a reference book might not be a good idea. The topic organization is divided into basic usage section and advanced technique section, and kind of hard to locate for a certain issue.

These two authors were involved with the development of the language, one teaches at CMU. I'd rather learn the difficult parts of the language (timing, for example) from someone who knows whats going on at the lower levels and someone with teaching experience. I mention these facts because I think the difference shows in this text. The formatting, grammar, language is good but not polished.

Now, they've recently released what seems to be their BEST album yet! Here's my review of their third album, simly titled THREE:Well, the album starts of with the funky Hole In The Head, then followed by the utterly amazing Whatever Makes You Happy (sung entirely by Keisha). Caught In A Moment and Sometimes are amazingly stunning, and I think Heidi's voice is just breathtaking. Million Different Ways is my favorite track 'cos it just has this unique, funky upbeat tune. We Could Have It All sounds like a left-over from Angels With Dirty Faces but it's still great. I must say Situation's Heavy is the worst song, but it's still kinda good. Nasty Ghetto and Buster just blew my mind away when I first heard them.Well, what're you waiting for?

I thought that the casting was great, Laura (Hillary Wolfe) is completely natural and believable. I could relate to the adolescence of this film. I was disappointed when I finally viewed the ending, however; I expected a great finish to what started out to be an awesome movie. I still recommend it to all teens who struggle with family. Don't miss it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic and very funny!","review":"For a while I could relate to this girl's problems and things eventually got better, but I realized how real the movie is. I know exactly how she feels! It's very funny and hard to remember all the characters, which I guess was the objective! The plot is interesting, the acting is good, the script is solid and funny, and nothing lacks around character development. Don't miss \\"Big Girls Don't Cry...They Get Even!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by an insider, with the skills of a hack","review":"Sorry to be harsh, but this isn't a very good novel. It mostly suffers from two things 1. Clumsy characterization. The characters are barely sketched out and seem mostly there to dole out huge heaping lumps of amatuerish exposition. They do dumb things not out of human fraility but because the author needs to advance the plot. 2. The prose is purple and riddled with the most banal cliches like \\"wiry little man\\" and \\"lyric psalms\\" and describing sunshine on windows as the reflection of \\"orange energy\\". There are plenty of mawkish scenes, such as the scene of an IRA assasination being described as a place where children in their \\"Sunday best\\" cling to their parents who, boo-hoo, realize the Troubles, aye the Troubles are still with us.If you're looking for an \\"insider\\" view of the ATF, look elsewhere(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment For What Was Not Included","review":"Very incomplete.

It portrays Coolidge in the unfair, stereotypical light that people have done for decades. (thus it lacks any new thought) 2. The book, mechanically speaking, is also poor. It is difficult to read, dry, and gives the reader no incentive to continue reading. The only reason I gave Ferrell a second star is because he is smart enough to pick a good topic to write his book about."},{"rating":"2","title":"You would like this book if.........","review":"If you don't like hearing about other peoples lives or thier thoughts, then this isn't the book for you. The book talkes about a young girl who had a hard time growing up and tells her adventures of having to live with her grandmother she dosen't know very well with 3 other siblings and a very tight budget. I suggest that young adults, as in 7th+ grade read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a an extremely well written book.","review":"I first heard of this book in school when we did a extensive report on it.

It is better, but with a little ajustments, it could be GREAT!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Keeper","review":"Despite what others may say, I, a girl myself, can relate to this beautifully crafted book. Although, it is character driven, it basically mirrors real life. In life, we are focused on character rather than spontaneous events. Dicey is a young girl who battles growing up, keeping her family together, and buying time for her own sake. With cheating, her mother dieing, Voigt truly brings out a sympathetic tone for this distressed and striving teenager. In most ways and others, similar to the traumas of a teenage girl's life. You, as the reader, will probably be more attracted to the path of Dicey's actions rather life moving events. This is a must read, and take it from someone who has read and evaluated the book several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book, Good Book.","review":"I love this book! Dicey's Song is such a sad story, but its funny, too! I recommend this book for girls aged 7-100!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book2-Dicey's Song","review":"This was the first book I read in the Tillerman Cycle an when I finished I read the others right away.Dicey has finally found a home for herself and her brothers and sister.

Will Dicey be able to start a new life and let go of the control she has over her family's life ?I recommend this book to anyone who liked Pictures of Hollis Woods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dicey's Song","review":"The Tillerman children finally found their grandmother in Maryland.

But also concerns arise over their sick mother.Dicey realizes that she can let the parenting to go their grandmother. And that she can make new friends. She also finds this boat in the barn and starts to work and grow with the boat. But most of all she starts to go with her grandmother.If you are a person who likes adventure and suspense this is the book for you. Some parts in the book get a little long but just hang on their. And I give this book 4 out of 5.Regards,Kate Barlow"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it time to grow on you.","review":"I was introduced to Dicey as a minor character in \\"A Solitary Blue.\\" When I started \\"Dicey's Song\\" I was disappointed at first in how slowly the story moved--I wanted to know more about Dicey. I stuck with it though and was glad I did! I loved the book and have recommended it to many students. I've also started to read the rest of the series. If you haven't read Voigt's other title, \\"Izzy Willy Nilly\\" you MUST. Every teenager should read that book. We're using it as a book club selection this year at the junior high, just like Oprah's club!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking story fluid in beautiful prose.","review":"Cynthia Voight has created a thoughtful piece of literature, telling of Dicey, whose complexities far outweigh those of the average 13-year-old.

I learned to let go and grow up from this well-written story by Cynthia. I would introduce this book to people, I think they will like it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"memorable...just as good as the first one if not better","review":"Cynthia Voigt really out did herself this time. Dicey's Song is the second book in the Tillerman Cycle, and follows the same story from her first book, Homecoming. Although I think that it might be best to have read the first book before diving into Dicey's Song I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys watching a character grow emotionally and internally....What I liked most about the book is that Voigt really develops the plot into life like situations. She shows the ups and downs in life and isn't afraid to put the sheer truth out. As the novel progresses Dicey is faced with one of the most difficult situations yet. From this experience she learns that life is unpredictable and never gets any easier. The entire novel will touch your heart, it sure touched mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"family oriented book","review":"As a twelve year old girl I found that I could in no way relate to Dicey and her different conflicts. The plot was unimaginative and droning.I thought This book was boring. However, this would most likely be an ideal book for someone who is looking for a theme that is family orinted, because i found that in the even though there was no plot it had many different morals and family values written into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Hard to understand","review":"My class is reading this book and the assignment is to do a report. But, the book was so boring I couldn't understand it and it kept saying the same thing over and over. I can't keep reading that so, I lost interest. In the first 30 pages all it talks about is how she is doing while she's living with her grandmoter. I give it 1- star for not having a real plot and no real action that will make you want to know what happens next."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author goes on and on about stupid little things","review":"I really hated this book because it was so boring and I really didn't like Dicey. I thought that the author of this book went on and on about stupid little things that made the book really boring. If there was a sequel to Diceys song I think that Maybeth will get really good at the piano, and Diceys boat will look nice. If there is a sequel I would not like to read it because it will probably be as boring as Diceys song. I hope I never have to read any other books by Cynthia Voigt."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book had absolutley no point to it!","review":"When I read this book, I was totally bored at the pointlessness of it. The whole book was about this girl who just lives her life. Why would you want to read about this girl just going about her daily buisness? I don't know how anyone can enjoy it. I being a young adult,(the base for this book)thought it was also very unrelistic how they described Dicey."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book Ever","review":"I had to read this book durring the summer and I suffered all through it.

Then something happens to her mother, who is in a Boston hospital. Who ever said that growing up is easy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sequel to Homecoming","review":"The characters in this series are people who feel like misfits. They all manage to learn to accept and like themselves and find friends without having to sacrifice who they are. My favorite aspect of this series is that reading this book, A Solitary Blue, and Come a Stranger, the reader gets the impression that Voigt wrote them all simultaneously. All three contain different characters' experiences of some of the same events in varied degree of detail and fullness depending on the character's involvement in the events.I highly recommend this series for teens and young adults. The books do contain some meaty subject matter, but Voigt handles it sensitively."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Moving Read","review":"This is the kind of book that you aretempted to finsih in one afternoon. Dealing with Dicey trying to settle down in her new life, it shows how she has to deal with all of the problems her new chance is spawning. Her siblings, school life and Grandmother swing up and down, and Dicey tries to grasp onto what she has left into her swiftly tilting world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of plain","review":"This book was not the best I've ever read.

I will be ordering more of the TILLERMAN SERIES for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clan works together on problems","review":"I avoided this book for a long time because I had heard it was too upsetting for children. Yes, it is a sad book. And it might be too sad for some children. But there are lots and lots of children who would like to hear this story.Dicey and her three siblings have come to live with their grandmother. Their mother is in a mental hospital; their father skipped out before Dicey's youngest brother, Sammy, was born.There are lots of problems to overcome. Dicey's sister, Maybeth, isn't learning like she should in school. James, Dicey's brother, hides how smart he is in order to fit in. Sammy gets into fights. People talk about and tease the children about Gram. Dicey, like Gram, has learned to feign indifference. The whole Tillerman clan slowly works on all these problems, talking together, singing together, making new friends, working, building a boat.Now I'm anxious to see what my readers of realistic fiction at school think of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dicey's Song is wonderful!","review":"Dicey's Song is great because it deals with real life situations and problems. It is a story about the Tillerman children--Dicey, James, Maybeth, and Sammy. After spending an entire summer searching for a home(in Homecoming), they find their grandmother. Now that they are staying with her, they have to learn to accept and learn from new opportunities. This book is important to people because everyone feels like they don't know what's happening at some point in their life. The overall quality of this book is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was exciting and a great book to read","review":"Dicey's Song was a great book. It allowed you to see how a person needs to let go of some things to accept greater things. Dicey, again, was a strong willed child trying to be an adult. Her grandmother made her stop being so responsible as she had to in Homecoming. Her grandmother allowed her to be free and enjoy the rest of her childhood she had.

We also have the S500 and really like it. The price is excellent. It's easy to use. Only problems I have with it are that it takes a long time to save pictures with flash. So, you'll miss the next great shot. And, video is recorded as MPEG4. When I try to upload to my computer, it doesn't read it because it uses .avi. Granted, I have not used the CD-Rom that came with the camera. But, with the S500 I could just put the card in the card reader and upload my videos.

This is the second Digimax camera that I have owned. I am truly happy with my purchase. I definitely agree with some of the other reviews that it is necessary to have rechargeable batteries, but otherwise the camera works good, and also takes pretty good videos.One drawback that I have found with the camera is the lag time it takes to snap the pictures. Sometimes when taking pics of impatient kids, they move around before the flash, and then it distorts the pic. Other than that, I don't have any complaints, and I would definitely recommend this camera for purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"TAKE THE PERFECT PHOTOS","review":"This little Samsung Camera snaps the most precise and perfect hpotos, shows all detail, from vivid colors to the dust on a shelf.

Unacceptable ! I dislike this book because of its lack of seriousness when dealing with the nobility and power of the dragon especially having the main characters kill the dragon, and especially knock knock jokes! I dont like it when the knight kills the dragon but at least both the dragon and the knight tried their best, but have a boy beat a dragon of all things with knock knock jokes?

I briefly read this book about 10 years ago (when I was in college and reading A LOT), so I don't remember it particularly well. But I think that's the point. It struck me as being competent but ultimately quite mundane. If you're a hard-core Barthelme completionist, I might get it. Otherwise I wouldn't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"May be Goodman's best studio LP","review":"This LP was where Steve really began to put it all together in the studio.

It was Steve, a battered guitar, a microphone and a circle of 300 college kids. It was magic. Having seen Bob Dylan, The Boss, Lucy Kaplansky and a host of other singer-songerwriters over the past 30 years, that simple performance, in a dimly lit and little used hall on the campus, remains the most memorable concert I've attended. \\"The 20th Century is Almost Over\\" is Goodman at his finest; witty, musical and maniacal. \\"My Old Man\\" makes the tears flow.

PLEASE Jonny, I am happy for you in the fact that you're happily married, but you're music was much better off feelin' the blues, man! Don't make the same mistake on the next album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Believe It's Jonny Lang!!","review":"I've been a long time fan of Jonny Lang. Lie To Me, Wander This World, and Kid Jonny Lang & The big Band Smokin, were joys to listen to. He really could get down and nasty with the Blues. It seems that he has lost his way now. Long Time Coming is nothing like what I came to love and expect from such a great singer and guitar slinger as Jonny. What happened??"},{"rating":"1","title":"I HOPE U GOT IT OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM","review":"I dissaprove Jonny where are you in this album. You were on your way to a big success with your blues style, WHAT HAPPENED??? The first time I heard Jonny's music i was like whoa this guy is the next stevie ray vaughn, eric clapton, albert king, but whoa the blues style is gone. He was bettter at 13 than he is at 22 something is wrong. Anyone who has felt the power of the blues guitar knows you can run from it but u can't get away. you can't get away from it....blues is the true jonny and i hope to see him back real soon....dont mean to sound rude becuause he has more talent than anyone out there he is just using it the wrong way!!!!! Please just surprise me and when i buy your next album make it worth listening too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Jonny Lang has a real feel for the blues, and his blues vocals are among the best you're likely to hear anywhere. Sadly, he's left the blues behind on this release. If I wanted Pop, I'd have bought some Michael Jackson. I hear a little of the old Jonny on the first number \\"Give Me Up Again,\\" along with some good guitar riffs and I really like \\"Red Light\\" for some unknown reason. :) His cover of Stevie Wonder's \\"Livin In The City\\" shows once again how strong this young man's vocals can be.All in all, though, three songs do not an album make . . . the rest of the recording is eminently forgettable. I hope he comes home some day."},{"rating":"1","title":"McAlbum","review":"Disappointing. It's good to see artists branch out of their pigeonholes, but this is just flat-sounding and uninteresting music custom made for bad radio stations. Even as a plain rock 'n roll record it's poor and doesn't showcase Lang's strong voice or guitar skills. Lang's earlier records made me say \\"wow,\\" this one makes me say \\"blah.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not long enough","review":"The former blues prodigy has gone pop. Save your money, buy Michael Bolton garbage instead. What were his handlers thinking? Trying to broaden his appeal by departing from the blues is not a good career move. The music industry already is full of mindless drivel, who needs another Justin Timberlake?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I am a huge Jonny Lang fan and bought this CD sight unseen because his others are great. But this is the most disappointed I've been with buying a CD at full price, in a long time. His singing reminds me of a poor cross with Joe Cocker and James Taylor. And there are no signs of the Blues Master that Jonny has shown previously. He won't last long with this music, as anybody can sing it. Don't buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"San Jose - You Didn't See Anything","review":"\\"I saw this change coming from 7 miles away...\\" Oh, please. I doubt it.The release of \\"Wander This World\\" after the successful \\"Lie to Me\\" garnered very few complaints. There were some great rock and blues tracks - Still Raining, The Levee, Cherry Red Wine, as well as acoustic ballads - Breakin' Me, Walking Away.This new album is a severe departure to largely pop music. Don't tell Jonny's fans what to like. We know it when we hear it. 2 stars - at most."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my $10 back!","review":"I should have seen it coming on the last CD. He was trying to get away from the blues roots that made his 1st CD so good. This CD is absolutely nothing like the previous two. Jonny Lang has tried to hop on the mainstream bandwagon by releasing an album that desperately tries to catch onto the hype of boy bands. This is pop/r+b garbage from the beginning to the end. There is no heart or soul in this music. I hate to say it, but Mr Lang has \\"souled\\" or sold out. I can honestly say that this is the worst CD I've bought in years. I am puzzled as to why he poses with his guitar in every photo. This album has nothing to do with studio musicians or guitars. Some of the songs are totally electronic. I want my $10 back....I feel cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did Jonny go?","review":"This album is crap, almost threw it out the window on the way home! I don't know where Jonny is going with his music, but it is definately in the WRONG direction! Get back to playin the BLUES Jonny!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Long Time Coming, But Worth the Wait","review":"Jonny Lang's influences have always been more than the blues, and with this disc we can finally hear them. A little Rock-n-Roll, a little Stevie Wonder, & a little Prince to name a few. His voice and songwriting have now moved to the forefront-powerful, emotional, personal. For those that miss the blues prodigy, he's still there, he's just stretching his boundaries a bit. After all, Rock and R&B were fathered by the blues weren't they? I'd love for more people to hear this album, it's become a favorite of mine. I don't know if the long wait between albums was in part because of his record company wanting another \\"blues\\" album or not, but I'm always happy to hear that a musician has done the music they've wanted to do... and even though it's been a long time coming, it was well worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"where is the blues?","review":"where is the blues that made me like jonny? The album is O.K.thow , but i'm missin' something .It's a ... shame for such a great guitarplayer who almost forgot to play this instrument on his long time coming album .Just hope he'll do better next time (within about 5 years ????)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good effort","review":"Although it's not blues, you have to give this artist credit for trying something new. Jonny Lang does a good job with the pop/rock genre, however, his voice and guitar playing are much better suited for the blues genre or possibly R&B as evident by the bonus live track. His cover of Stevie Wonder's Living in the City was superb. I am one of the many fans disappointed that this was not a blues CD. I only hope that he'll return to his roots for his next release."},{"rating":"2","title":"A long time anticipated...finally here","review":"I have never anticipated something as much as I have anticipated this album. I have been checking Jonny's website for a year and a half hoping and praying for a release date. It's finally here and I couldn't be more pleasantly shocked with the work. Although he does defect from his traditional blues style, the integrity of his change is justified by his shear talent. Jonny lang could make a country song sound good (no offense to country fans). His new style is intriguing and the fact that his music writing skills are finally fully evident is awesome. I would recommend this album to anyone with any taste at all. Jonny is one of the most amazingly talented musicians to ever walk the face of the planet. If only most of the barage of trash thrown at us today displayed an ounce of the talent Jonny has, we would have nothing to complain about. It took a long time coming, but it was worth the wait. Now I just have to start looking forward to the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"We could have waited longer","review":"After being totally awed by Jonny's first 2 albums, Our expectations were quite higher for this one. Generally musicians raise the notch as they atain more experience. Perhaps it's just that it all sounds uninspired, or perhaps he has decided to completely change his style. The high points were the opening for track 11(Happiness & Misery) & the remake of (Livin' for the City)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impossibly good","review":"He was 22 when he made this, his 4th, album. It's no less impressive than those preceding it. If anything, it's more soulful, more funky, more varied, more expansive, and paints from a broader palette. I can't recommend this album highly enough. If you're not convinced, just download the first two tracks. They will do the selling. Bigger, more muscular than his prior work - at 22 he was ready for prime time. 22."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly? Horrifying.","review":"After hearing a handful of his older songs and loving them, I figured I'd finally go ahead and get one of his cds. This is so far from where he started, and his sound has just been degenerated into this cold, easy-listening stuff that is just so far from the blues that I wanted to vomit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better album to round out his shows","review":"Just saw the \\"kid\\" the other night and the tracks he played from Long Time Coming blew the house away. What is missing on the studio versions are the blistering (understatement) leads he incorporated. The title track and Give Me Up Again both earned well deserved standing ovations. I can't wait for a live album. Myself, I just mixed a CD incorporating the best of all three albums and Long Time Coming makes it an all around great listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"anyone who gives a low rating to this album because it isn't blues is missing the point, which is that with the exception of \\"red light,\\" the songwriting is mediocre at best. i don't mind lang venturing into rhythm and blues, but this isn't rhythm and blues...this is pure, silly pop, and he doesn't even redeem it with compelling guitar playing. the gutsy quality in lang's voice that shone forth on lie to me is also gone. he's not a singer, he's a shouter, and when he tries a more polished vocal style, it comes off an anemic. jonny be good, but this be bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crying the Blues for the old Jonny Lang.","review":"What a shame...I saw Jonny Lang for the first time five years ago when he played at one of the outdoor concerts at the Seattle water front, and fell in love with his music. Went to see him again last night at the Paramount and couldn't be more dissapointed in his new stuff. Not since Stevie Ray Vaughn has there been such a great blues guitar player with a voice to match. Not even a hint of the blues in his new CD. This one was put out with NO meat...only the bread and the cheese which makes it very empty. Red Light is really the only song worth listening to more than once. Hoping this was just an experiment, and that the Jonny Lang we all fell in love with returns next time with the MEAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Admire the talent, but still not for me","review":"Jonny Lang is an amazing talent. He's got great vocals, great tone and technique, and he's got soul. However, in spite of all that, the arrangements and the lyrics on \\"Long Time Coming\\" leave me flat and, frankly, bored. There are a lot of other people out there producing this same type of material and sound in just about every genre played on the radio these days. It's getting pretty homogenous out there and this album slips right into a state of mediocrity. So, for me, this effort simply doesn't work...which is too bad. I like Jonny Lang."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Jonny of the past - DONT waste your money","review":"Jonny Lang has taken a new direction on this CD, and it absolutely SUCKS. This is the worst excuse for a CD. I cannot believe they would actually release this. The only songs that are decent are Red Light, and maybe Goodbye Letter. The rest of the songs sound like they were written by a garage band, and are painful to listen to. I have a pretty broad range of tastes in music, but this CD just does not do anything for me. I think Jonny should seriously think about going back to his roots and stick to Blues. This is the beginning of the end if he continues to release CD's like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Was Expecting....","review":"I have to admit that I'm disappointed with the change of style on this CD. I was looking forward to another album that had great guitar solos and lyrics that had a hint of the blues. This CD doen't come anywhere near those things. It is very 'sappy' and 'pop-ish'. I don't recommend buying this CD if you're hoping that it will be like the pervious ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aagh","review":"What a terrible turn for this previously great blues guy. Such a great voice, great guitar skills, But what poorly written, over-produced songs on this CD. Not a shred of the blues, no matter where you listen. Not even a cross-over attempt. I'm not sure what he was attempting, except to write his own songs, to much regret by this previously rabid ran. I haven't seen a meltdown like this since Tower of Power. Schade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uuughhhh","review":"I've got all of Jonny Langs albums and was really looking forward to this one.I think it might be better as a coaster than as a CD from Jonny Lang. This was totally unexpected \\"pop\\" music... not what we have come to expect from this artist at all. It is over-produced, vocals are smoothed out and where is his guitar? I think he must have sat on it.In other words, don't bother even getting this album. If you want pop music, just turn on the radio to your favorite bubble gum station."},{"rating":"1","title":"dang jonny lang.","review":"he's got the best voice in the blues which is pretty amazing for a young, white guy. he can also throw down on guitar when he wants to. so i was hoping the new record would be along those lines -- raw, bluesy and passionate. forget about it. this album sounds more like michael bolton had a baby with r. kelly. it's very easy listening-ish but really, very hard for me to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no, no, no","review":"This album is not my cup of tea in the least bit. I was utterly dissapointed when I popped it (fresh from the case) into my stereo and heard the ...stuff coming out of it. If youre a hardcore fan or someone who enjoys modern-streamline pop, go ahead and spend the money; if you're like me (who enjoyed his early, renowned blues work), go out and pick up some Stevie Ray Vaughn and stay far, far away from this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long time fan disappointed","review":"This album was a supreme disappointment to this long time fan. I used a song from \\"Lie To Me\\" as my wedding song (When I Come to You). I was pleasantly surprised at the diversity of \\"Wander This World\\" which was more rock than blues. Consistent on all the albums was his style as a guitar player which only got better and better.\\"Long Time Coming\\" feels like record company manuvering gone awry. It doesn't have much blues save for a couple of songs, (both covers) - the title song and \\"Dying to Live\\" which was unfortunately \\"popped up\\" with synthetic drums courtesy of Eminem. I heard \\"Red Light\\", \\"Give Me Up Again\\" and \\"Get What You Give\\" in 2 JL concerts and loved them live, but the album versions feel artificial because the soulful guitar playing is noticably absent.I can understand a musician evolving, this is a step down, not nearly good R&B, but passable pop. The cover of \\"Living for the City\\" just sucks, plain and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"jonny slips away","review":"Lie to me and Wander this world are so much different and much much better, if you are a blues fan. I bought it for \\"Give me up again\\", which is in a very good version on the Clapton DVD \\"Crossroads Festival\\". The rest is more like a Prince style, Pitty, hardly any guitar, Jonny is slipping away from the blues."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible effort","review":"No problem at all with Jonny wanting to branch out into something new, but this entire album rates as awful. Jonny's voice is strong but the arrangements and the musicality are shockingly bad. It's like Picasso changed careers and became a tax consultant. What sycophants at A&M Records are telling Jonny that this passes for good music? A waste of $12.98--or any amount."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a blues cd","review":"Jonny Lang has definately sold out big time with this album. It's nothing like his earlier works, mainly because he doesn't play his guitar hardly at all, which was his signature thing. The album comes across as a John Mayer want-to-be, and a poor one at best. There are only two songs on the album that I would consider DECENT. And I am (was) a huge fan of his. Most of the songs are a bunch of worthless crap that sound the same - a desperate attempt to sneak into the mainstream. No elements of the blues on this album whatsoever. Has Jonny forgotten what made him famous to begin with? Don't waste your money on this - you could probably find someone who is willing to give you their copy for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jonny Lang, This Kid Can Sing.","review":"I first heard Jonny Lang on the radio. He was 16 at the time. I was so impressed with his voice that when I first saw his music in the store, I bought it.I have never been dissapointed in his music. This kid can sing.He has a good back up band and vocals. BUY THIS."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a shame!!!","review":"Oh this is a shame. I cant believe this is even the same guy that did Smokin and Lie to me. Im not sure if he wants more money or what but he is a sell out in my mind and I would strongly urge any of his fans who love the early stuff to not waist your time on this Pop style junk. If you want to hear the real good stuff go with his older stuff!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS ALBUM!","review":"I LOVE THE FACT THAT HE IS TAKING A RISK WITH THIS NEW MATERIAL AND THE BEST PART IS THAT ITS AWESOME! LOVE YA, JONNY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Jonny, you could do so much better!","review":"I tried to give this a chance, but all I could think of was \\"80's Hair Bands\\". I had flashbacks of Bon Jovi and other things I want to forget.Jonny is so talented, but he needs to get away from his Prince influence. Too many high notes.He has great lyrics, but the accompanyment needs to be destroyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep an Open Mind","review":"If your looking for Jonny as usual, this ain't it. But if you HAVE an open mind.... listen to this one at LEAST twice all the way through. Each time you hear it the album will grow on you. I compare it to some of the things Clapton has done (Pilgrim), going from one genre to another. When you realize just how difficult this is to do well, you will be amazed at how well this young man has pulled it off. Jonny is in his early 20's now and has fans that cover an extremely large age span. At 47 I rarely become so excited by the music of such a young artist. But if you can keep an open mind...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jonny has arrived...","review":"I am a blues fanatic. I appreciate the blues Jonny delved into in prior cds but he was never quite the delta blues man now was he? In this cd Jonny has found his stride in being the best Jonny lang he can be without being second best in the blues. I've always loved watching Jonny perform and he is a great gutarist but his vocals on this cd take on a new level. The songs are great. Everything is given equal time on this cd. Voice, guitar and writing. Jonny has arrived, watch out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"long time coming\\" should have been postponed","review":"The only thing blue-see about this CD is the mood I hadafter dropping $10. for it.Johnny, please send an apology and the $10 back for it.As soon as I put it in the player, a befuddled look appeared onmy face and I asked myself \\"what the He** was this crap\\" Johnny is trying to pass off as music. Johnny, maybe the backseat boys would like to reform and you can play lead!Really dissapointing after the previous releases.\\"Long time coming\\" maybe should have waited a bit and remixedthe tracks with a blues feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"He touches them all","review":"He hits every corner of your soul with his many octaves he gives so much of himself to his music"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Review Will Only Help the Fans","review":"I admit it. I LOVE music. And I am a Jonny Lang fan. This guy has music notes in his blood. He writes great lyrics and puts them to great music. Amazon does you a bit of a favor for letting you hear about 30 seconds of most songs, and you can get an idea of what you are getting from Jonny in that time, but I have all of his releases and I keep them all close at hand. They are all worth listening to over and over.And if you ever have a chance to see him live, FIGHT to get the tickets. Humble and self-effacing even between shredding the frets off the neck of his guitar..."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is a Genre?","review":"Ahhh...looking for a blues album? Nope, this ain't it. However, this is a fantastic album, with great guitar, insane vocals, and just really well written music. I've been a big fan of Jonny's for a long time and I've waited for this album for a long time, it was worth it. Great love songs like \\"Goodbye Letter\\" \\"Beautiful One\\" and \\"Red Light.\\" Forget about it! Jonny is one of the most soulful singers and musicians you'll see in concert, check him out if you get a chance. Oh yea, BUY THIS ALBUM, you won't be dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's been a Long Time Coming... but it was worth waiting!","review":"Awww it's so good to hear again Jonny's voice after five long years without a new record! Jonny's music evolved in such a good way. Just look what the blues music did for america: it was the roots of the musical tree: it produced Rock, Soul, R&B... And Jonny Lang is now doing the same, he's using his blues roots to reach new territories and this album sounds simply beautiful. I love the use of violins, which is something that I also like about BB King... The Song \\"Dying to Live\\" is... to die for !!! It sounds royal, like a Stevie Wonder ballad. No surprise that we find also a cover of Stevie Wonder: \\"Living for the city\\". This album is full of somptuous ballads, \\"Beautiful one\\", \\"Goodbye letter\\" to name a few, and I think that today this is the kind of sweetness that we just want to hear (look at Norah Jones...). But it's still filled with blues and funk, don't worry ! Just listen to \\"If We Try\\" to be sure ! It was worth waiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD sucks!","review":"Take all you know about Jonny Lang ~ the killer biting guitar licks, the strong vocals, the blues based CD's he's done in the past and throw it all away. Lang's attempt at performing sapping pop tunes will really go well with those who like the Patridge Family. What a MAJOR disappointment this CD is! I am really bummed I bought this CD and wish I had listened to it first as I would not take it if it were free. Jonny ~ go back to blues, you're a star there. This doesn't even rate! Some of the worst songs you'll ever hear, his vocals aren't up to par, and the music lends itself to an overproduced lack luster performance (and that's on the POSITIVE side!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Idol wanna be","review":"Jonny Lang sounds more like an American Idol wanna be than the great blues singer that he was. I gave the CD two stars because Red Light is a good song. As for the rest of it, Jonny owes me $15"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Time Coming . Jonny Lang","review":"This is buy far the worst CD I've bought. in a long time.His 1st CD was great. 2nd CD was ok. Johnny has went so far from his Blues roots with this CD.Why Cant artist figure out what works and leave the rest of this Crap alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jonny lost the blues","review":"I was a little disappointed with the album and do not like the new type of music he is playing (more soul influence than blues). His last two albums were great but I do not blindly follow his stuff and think it is great...especially when it is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lyrics are weak","review":"I don't mind the change in sound on this album. I think the music is pretty good but the lyrics are weak. Bring back Bruce McCabe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IT SUCKS","review":"If you liked Jonny Langs first 2 CDS dont assume you'll like this one.He leaves the Blues for a more produced and pop sound to try and reach a larger fan base. FOR MORE MONEY,MONEY ,MONEY.I dont like it, IT SUCKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's this imposter?","review":"Quick, someone call Jonny and tell him there's an imposter out there selling an album under his name! Lovers of Jonny Lang's past music will be disappointed in this recording. It ain't the blues! Jonny SOLD OUT for the money and I fell for it, don't you. This recording doesn't resemble past music by Lang. Maybe he hasn't suffered enough to feel the blues anymore, success has spoild his heart and passion. Maybe there's a spot for him with the Backstreet Boys, he no longer deserves to share the stage with BB King, Buddy Guy, Jimmy Vaughn, or even Dan Ackroyd. Come to think of it, this CD shouldn't be listed in the Blues catagory!"},{"rating":"1","title":"He should have stopped at the Red Light","review":"On an interview Lang said he almost did not record Red Light- he didn't think it really fit his style. Well- it's a good song, unlike the rest of this albumn unfortunately. In the interview he also said he was growing and exploring new directions and was happy. Well that's wonderful that he's happy but unfortunately his new direction really wastes his talents. Maybe he needs to get unhappy so he can play the blues he was meant to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Daniel Fett","review":"Jonny didn't sell out. He'd have sold out for the money if he made another record like the last one. He was brave and followed his heart and made an album of music he loves and wants to make. They guy doesn't consider himself a blues artist. Why should he continue to do something he doesn't want to do? For the money? Yep, that would be a sell out. Get a life and stop judging him. Open your mind and give the music a listen. Jonny can't please everyone with his musical style. The only one he should worry about is himself, and with this record he is being true to himself.If anyone is looking for another blues album, don't buy this one. If you're open to Jonny's talent as a whole, do buy it - you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jonny Lang \\"Long Time Coming\\"","review":"This is not the raw, powerful blues that it should be.It seems \\"Jonny\\" has gone the Pop Music route just like Robert Cray. \\"Smokin'\\" is a much better album."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Jonny, gave up on the Blues\\" -- he don't play here no more!","review":"Only one word can describe how I feel about Jonny Lang's latest effort -- DISAPPOINTED! He's cast his blues off the \\"Levee\\" and let them go! It would appear he has made a conscious decision to depart from his natural talent of singing and playing \\"The Blues\\"! The blues icons of decades past and his fans had such hope in Jonny's ability to continue the evolution of the genre, and I personally saw him as a potential replacement for the departed superstar Stevie Ray Vaughan. The future of modern electric blues, now rests with other guitarslinger's like, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Doyle Bramhall II, and Charlie Sexton, as Jonny has quit playing the blues!Maybe a discerning event will bring him back to his natural roots in the future, as Albert King say's and sings \\"The Blues Don't Change!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry","review":"I had heard that this new Jonny Lang release was different--not so much blues and more rock, innovative. I love that artists are willing to reach out and experiment. However, I just can't get into this one. It has no appeal whatsoever....but I'll give the next one a try still as I am definitely a fan of Jonny's original sound !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long Time Coming","review":"I am a big fan of Jonnys' and have followed his career from its inception. This effort is not a blues CD of any genre I can think of. This unfortunately is Joony trying to be something else. When I recall seeing him live and watching the young people in the audience connect with him in a way they might never had with a traditional blues artist, I was excited for both Jonny and his audience......as I could see that some would start the journey into \\"getting the blues\\". I am not excited by this CD, I suspect that he has become more of a \\"rock/pop\\" star than desiring to continue to be a blues influence. While I would give his 3 previous recordings a 4-5 star review, I can only cough 2 for you this time, Jonny. Get that Tele Thinline wound up, get rid of the drum tracks and Protools programming junk that pop \\"artists\\" use and get out on the road and play before someone else replaces you."},{"rating":"2","title":"New sound still outstanding","review":"I loved Jonny's previous album so I was a bit surprised when I heard the different sounds on this disc.

Excellent work, Mr. Lang!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm....","review":"I listened to this about 3 times. Then I put \\"Wander This World\\" back into my CD player in its place.Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I loved Jonny's first three albums and was really looking forward to this one. His blues guitar and singing were getting better and better and I thought this next album would be at least on a par with his others. But I didn't expect such a dramatic shift away from the Blues. I was very disappointed. This was overproduced and unimaginative. Go back to the Blues, Jonny. This type of music ain't your style. Leave it to the Manilows and Kenny G's of this world. Go back to the Blues, Jonny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What? No more Blues from JL?","review":"Don't know why he decided to quit playing the blues. Smokin' and Lie To Me are most definitely blues albums, even if you want to say that they're R&B 'influenced'. It took me a while to get used to 'Wander This World', but I have so I decided to buy this album. Am very disappointed in this undertaking. Think I'm going to send my copy over to the local lite rock and pop station. Consider this former fan alienated and disgruntled. DO NOT BUY IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BLUES, 'CUZ IT AIN'T HERE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Jonny","review":"very disappointing after waiting all this time, there's nothing here special & the blues you may have been expecting is sadly missing. Save your bucks buy another of your favorite blues artists, hope Jonny shows up next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"first one and still his best","review":"I bought this cd first out of Jonny Lang's collection. It is the most consistant complete album as far as that goes. Lie to me, and wander this world have his best songs on them but they also have some fillers. This one I can listen to without skipping any songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Time Coming","review":"I saw Jonny Lang in concert in August of 2000 and it was one of the best shows I have seen(Buddy Guy and Kenny Wayne Shepherd with BB KIng are two others). Jonny talked about having his new album out soon and I have been waiting patiently ever since. Three years later and it is finally in my hands.......... Was it worth the wait?Yes, definitely. Its nice that Jonny doesn't sound like every one else thats on the radio today.His own style is showing in the songs he has written for the cd.If you are looking for a straight up blues album this may not be the CD for you but if you enjoy good music that runs the gamut from blues to soul to rock then I would definitely recomend \\"Long Time Coming\\".Its a very solid album from one of the best guitar players out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jonny Lang Long Time Coming","review":"Long Time Coming, a short time going. Jonny Lang has left the building, and with him went the best 'new' blues man with the 'oldest' blues voice around. This was a BIG disappoinment for me, I have always loved 'the boy's' music, now he is just your tipical soft rocker with no style,.YUK!I miss the old Jonny, Jonny come back to the blues for dedicated blues fans like me, you lost me....Moonlover"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will someone please sing the Blues?","review":"Dont LIE TO ME Jonny you sold out for more money.I dont want to hear this crap!This formula stuff doesnt stick, you hear it a coupleof times and you dont want to play it any more.These pop song's are weak.Jonny you are very talented and I LOVE your live showswith all your passion and energy.PLEASE go back to the BLUES for us as well as for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great disappointment","review":"I do hope that Lang has had the sense to fire whoever it was that suggested he record this utter garbage. His first albums proved he was a fine guitarist and a great, passionate vocalist. This effort is a definite retrograde step. Beware Jonny, make another album like this and you will sink into oblivion.The fact that there are currently 53 used copies for sale on Amazon tells the whole story"},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy can sing!","review":"Long Time Coming is a stylistic change for Jonny as he has moved away from the blues. Instead he favors rock, pop, and soul on this album. His voice isn't as raspy as in his previous work, but his vocals are still excellent. The songwriting is very good and the album flows nicely. My only complaint is that Long Time Coming doesn't showcase Jonny's guitar skills. There are only a few solos on the album and his guitar tone isn't as dirty as it was on Smokin', Lie To Me, or Wander This World. Overall, good album by Jonny but I would reccomend getting Lie to Me and Wander this World before this one. Another artist to check out is Howard Lee Edwards. I recently discovered him and I really like his music. He has a new album coming out soon and there are a couple of songs off it on his website www.HowardLeeEdwards.com. Check it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so wonderful.","review":"Typically the more I listen to an album, the more I find to like about it. Well, this is the exact opposite. The first time I listened, I thought it sounded okay, but I quickly grew to dislike much of the album. Lang is just trying to hard. One of the fun things about Johnny Lang back when he was a 14 year old guitar prodigy is that he could care less about hit singles or charts. This entire album seems to be an attempt to score a commercial hit. And while songs like \\"Red Light\\" may score him some radio play, it just isn't what he does best. So if you want a Lang album, just go listen to Lie to Me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jonny, what have you done to yourself?","review":"This disc is a huge disappointment! What happened to the young blues guitar slinger I really liked? He has completely changed his style and I was hoping we finally had a new blues musician that would grow and grow into a blues great! This in not blues at all. I suspect his producers at A&M thought they saw someone to make money from, but this is eclectic garbage although his voice is still great. Go back to what you do best Jonny - blues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Disappointment","review":"I LOVE Jonny Lang. Couldn't wait to listen to this album. It was a complete disappointment.

With the exception of his Stevie Wonder cover, I could have been listening to Justin Timberlake, the Carter Boys and a whole host of Teeny Bopper favorites.

Maybe the title should have read \\"Gone Commercial\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I was a big fan of Jonny Lang - someone under 65 who sang the blues, and jammed at that! - until this album. Like a few recent reviewers have written, Whoa, Jonny should have waited another five years and cut an album that was true to sound that got him a record deal in the first place.Very disappointing effort. Hopefully, this is just a mistaken detour, and not a dead-end to Lang's otherwise promising talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jonny oh Jonny","review":"What happened. From one of the best new blues albums, \\"Smokin\\" to this???? Did I fall asleep for about forty years? Did Edgar actually give you his blessings to kill his song? The man who gave the midwest its \\"blues man\\", has now just sucker punched us with this release. I'm listening to Beautiful One right now and just want to cry, because this is just a joke. If there was a zero star rating you would get it for this pathetic release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long time coming, short time listening","review":"In this year of 2003, the year Congress has declared \\"the year of the blues\\", Jonny Lang (one of recent years' torchbearers of the blues) has done a lousy job of honoring his musical roots with this album. I love his first two albums, but this one is a huge disappointment--hardly any blues influences at all. In the credits he thanks Hanson. For what? influencing his music? It sounds like they have. Most of the songs here are just pop fluff, and his guitar playing, which was so remarkable on his first album, takes a big backseat.I just hope that Kenny Wayne Shepherd doesn't jump on the pop sell-out bandwagon with HIS next album (if it ever comes out)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jonny where is all the blues songs you used to play","review":"This is one of the worst cds i have ever heard by jonny lang. Where are all the back up singers? Where are all the blues songs he used to wright? THIS CD SUCKS!!!!! THAT WAS THE BIGGIST WAST OF MONEY IF YOU ARE SMART LIKE MANY OF US THAT HATE THIS CD YOU WILL NOT WAST YOUR MONEY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album From A Talented Artist.","review":"This is a brilliant work. I have discovered Jonny Lang several years ago when I first heard Lie to me. Since then I am always glad when there is a new release from this guy. I have always hoped he would go a bit more mainstream as I am not a particular fan of blues. So this new work is a wonderful surprise as it is the best ROCK!! album to be released in a long time (which explains the disappointment of those who awaited another blues record). Every song (if you forget about the bonus live track, that was really not necessary here) is great on this record, Jonny's voice as stunning as usually. I think he has finally found his direction. Good job Jonny!! Go on like this.PS: A bit more publicity in Europe would be good. Since Lie to me I haven't seen him around here."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"Jonny Lang's early recordings were amazing for the maturity shown by such a young musician. His newest cd continues to surprise but takes a different direction. The sounds on this recording are much more diverse and show me that Jonny Lang continues to develop. He may dissapoint some fans of his previous music, and I'm not crazy about everything on this cd, but it's a sign of a true artist when they leave you curious about what they may do next. I see many years of good things ahead for Jonny and anyone listening. Perdictability is boring..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walking a red light.......","review":"This is a rock and roll album. This is a fabulous rock and roll album. It's a wonderful walk through the red light....I love Jonny's voice...it sounds like he is stuggling at times to get the words out but it is just his throaty-ness and his wave. Every song has redeeming qualities whether it is sweet and soft or wild and rockin'.... I am so impressed, I can hardly stand myself......Jonny, I am going to keep you around......I have a feeling you know what you're doing........"},{"rating":"2","title":"Making A Genre-Crossing Transition","review":"It has been a long time waiting for the original young man with a guitar to return to the music scene. He has shed his original blues skin, and created a genre-blending CD. With guitar in hand and the roughened vocals of a man who has lived life, Jonny Lang delivers a wonderful album filled with sing-along tunes about heartbreak and hard times.Jonny Lang fits perfectly into the molds created by the Michael McDonald and Justin Timberlake-types. His album has the pop-rock tracks that will surely hit heavy rotation on Top 40 radios, but he also features songs with the old soul/R&B feel of early Al Green and Stevie Wonder. With his strong vocals and co-writing skills, Jonny Lang puts his heart into every song and it shows by making the simplest lyrics sound profound. A Long Time Coming is not a blues album, but it is still worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Music Lovers","review":"OK Yes its not all blues. So what? It's still a great CD.He plays great guitar, Rhythm & Blues, Funk, Ballads and sings great!If you enjoy Jonny Lang's vocals & guitar playing you will love this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT BLUES!!","review":"I got this cd to hear Jonny Lang's good blues sound he usually has. I was very disapointed. His guitar was played more in the back ground. And except for \\"Long Time Coming\\" the whole cd was pop. And Jonny lang could never compare to SRV. SRV is the greatest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too \\"Justified\\"","review":"Look, if I wanted to listen to Justin Timberlake I would've bought HIS album, and trust me, that won't happen! I can't tell you how excited I was to hear Jonny's new album. I rushed to buy it, only to hear the \\"nails-down-the-chalkboard\\" sound of really insipid, poppy, fluff. \\"Long Time Coming\\" has a total lack of substance, force, and the staying power that his first album had.I'm thinking someone should get rid of the guys who produced the crap out of these songs and let Jonny go back to doing what he does best, playing the kind of music that possesses you to make the same faces Jonny does when he's playing the guitar, and you're just listening! I only hope his next album has more of the no-fluff style that we've been enjoying with past albums, or at least less-fluff than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"the Cat Has Chops but this ain't it","review":"I was digging Johnny Lang's vibe when he first came out&then I could tell the Record Company's started messing up his Groove because His 2nd Album was Suffering from someone trying so hard to Cross Him over.this Set is more in that direction.Johnny Can groove on a Guitar but this doesn't seem like Him all the way.\\"Living for the City\\" take was cool.but this Album feels like someone else was pulling the strings in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the blues?????","review":"What the heck is this?I know what it's not,it's not the blues.I had a hard time getting through this cd and after two listens I can honestly say it stinks.If he was gonna completely change this style of music than he should warn his fans.Cd's are too expensive to waste on this kind of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"This CD was a sad disappointment, I bought it and the first time through I hated it but thought perhaps it would grow on me, no such luck I can't stand it at all now. What's not plain boring is often just annoying, the song Red Light that was released as a single is an embarrasing piece of generic pop crap. I love and still listen to his early stuff, especially Lie to Me, and sincerely hope he returns to his earlier sound. I'll give whatever he does next a listen, but if its more of the same I'll be hesitant to call myself a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a voice!","review":"This boy is so talented, not only is his voice amazing, yet he plays the guitar beautifully! Love this cd!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"keep waiting","review":"I've certainly been waiting for a new Jonny Lang album. I love his hard blues guitar style. Sadly, it is nowhere to be found on this album. Instead, a sappy collection of pop love songs, featuring Lang's voice rather than his guitar. Does he think people bought his albums for his voice?Not recommended for blues lovers. However, if you like soft R&B Pop, this one's for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP WHERE'S THE PASSION","review":"THE WORST ALBUM I BOUGHT IN YEARS - I WONT WASTE MY MONEY ON HIS MUSIC AGAIN UNLESS MY TASTES CHANGE TO BE BORING AND LIFELESS.

See you next time around.Jean lewis"},{"rating":"1","title":"Justin Timberlake could have done better","review":"This album is simply terrible. I cannot express my disappointment. 4 long years have passed and this is what we get. The problem is clearly that Jonny has decided to write the entire record himself, and as one can see, he is just simply a terrible song writer. Jonny, I will continue to listen to your previous albums and respect you to the fullest due to the fact that those records were fabulous, and i shall pretend like this CD never ever came out.P.S : Please PLEASE, let other people write the songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"where has the guitar genius gone?","review":"if you are looking for that amazing kid who played the guitar blues you've come to the wrong place - Jonny was never a great singer but he had the music working with him - 'school girl' my favorite is an excellant example - I know you have to grow but he should stick closer to what he is great at - this cd (even after listening to it several times): too much singing not enough guitar music"},{"rating":"1","title":"Raw talent gone stale!!","review":"Where did Jonny's great talent go?? Where's it hiding?? Come back. The songs on this are boring love ballads and not what i was expecting. I am only 14, and if you can imagine a 14 year old hating this cd, how do you think older people feel about it?After listening to half the cd, I almost cried. I was so upset and disappointed that my favorite singer had let me down. Don't waist valuble bucks on this cd, wait for the next one. I'm sure after Jonny sees all the bad reviews, he'll learn his lesson and go back to the blues.WE'RE WAITING JONNY!! CAN'T WAIT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, weak, weak","review":"I'm a huge Jonny Lang fan, but this one doesn't make the grade. After five years without a release, you'd think Jonny would have put together a dozen better songs than are on this disc. Maybe getting married and finding Jesus damaged his creative impulse, who knows. But these are just unmemorable bland songs that Jonny tries to pep up with some manufactured \\"soulful\\" singing. I listened to it three times in an evening and afterwards I couldn't name one song or hum one melody. Just boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh NO","review":"Jonny JONNY JONNY where are the blues at brother?I was so looking forward to another great CD but instead I get your'e Justin Timberlake imitation.

Please put your'e effort into the blues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jonny, stick with what you can do!!!","review":"Jonny Lang has incredible talent, however this last CD, shows absolutely none whatsoever. It sounds like a hybrid between the Backstreet Boys and John Mare. Please Jonny, before you release something that is a \\"Long Time Coming\\" think of the fans you are going to lose with this crap. I respect your old talent, but it will take a lot more change for me to become a fan again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant! The greatest white voice since Elvis!","review":"I can't think of a white person who ever sang with so much soul in their voice. Elvis is the only one who comes close. Jonny Lang is one of the all-time great vocalists, period. I loved his blues material too, but he's too big of a talent to be confined to one genre. Besides, there was only one SRV and emulating him is not going to sell records and reach the audience Jonny is capable of reaching. If this album gets the airplay it deserves, Jonny is about to become a megastar. Then people will see how sad and talentless all the Justin Timberlakes are. The R&B numbers on this record are incredible, especially Dying to Live. Jonny Lang is the greatest young musician of this era. I hope for the sake of popular music this record gets the audience it deserves. Forget Clay and Ruben. HERE IS THE TRUE AMERICAN IDOL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Blues, Not Blues, Not At All Blues","review":"Don't buy this CD if you want to hear Jonny Lang play the blues.This is pop, pure and simple. Yet he continues to be marketed in the blues genre. It's a pleasant enough recording, but given Jonny's \\"stature\\" I expected so much more after 5 years without a release. It is a disgrace to the blues, though, to have these types of recordings thrown into the category."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"As others, I waited and waited for this CD to come out. I have every CD Jonny's ever made - even the ones where he's just featured such as when he plays \\"Midnight Train\\" with Buddy Guy on his CD. Needless to say, this CD disappoints. Other than the first song and maybe one other I have found myself jumping from track to track looking for a song that doesn't sound like 'N Sync or Prince. Jonny - come back to the blues!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am very disappointed by this CD. While I know it's important for artists to grow and not stagnate with the exact same material, this change is too far out. This is not Jonny Lang, it sounds like some heartsick child. There are only 2 songs that I can tolerate \\"Give me up again\\" being the only one with that \\"Jonny blues\\" sound. Leave the pop sound alone Jonny, go back to the blues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's my Boy?","review":"I think that Jonny Lang has tried something new here, and I think all artist should enjoy that time in their life when they GO FOR IT, but let's be real here. When you know what works, stick with it! I think there is alot of SOUL lacking here. I'll stick with the other 3 Cd's I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the blues","review":"Jonny is trying to be something between Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart and a blues phenomenon. Stick to the blues boy. Your voice and guitar are made for that. Although your voice is great there is too much of this type of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total disappoinment","review":"I am a big fan J.Lang and this album was a total disappointment.What made his previous albums so good was the raw edged music and vocals.

LIGHT POP!","review":"Poor Johnny must have gotten sick of the blues. There is no sign of the great blues he played on his first 3 outings. This is instead a collection of light pop music where he sings in a falsetto voice often. If you like elevators you will like this. If you like Johnny Lang's masterful Blues, you will be GREATLY disapointed, and will most likely use this disc as a coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"He is being him","review":"I am a blues man from waaaaaay back. I love all the old timers and I was hesitant on Johnny. I was hipped to him in the Blues Bros 2000 movie like many people. I listened to his early stuff and wondered how could he be so young and be doing this stuff. He can't be a blues man. He's a little kid from Fargo. But, I let the material speak to me on it's merits. It is great stuff in the top 25 of my collection. The new stuff, I believe is Johnny playing what he has found to be inside him. He's an adult now and it's OK if he's not a bluesman. Remember, he was playing mostly blues standards. This stuff he's writing. No, it's not the blues, but it's a GREAT musician with the sould of a bluesman playing HIS music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new direction, but not to my taste","review":"Ordered this new album long in advance of the release, this on the assumption that it would be a further step in the blues-rock direction established through his first two major releases. I understand from some J. Lang interviews that the material here is more of his own original work, which I respect and admire in terms of artistic growth and courage, but just don't care for musically nearly as much as I did his earlier work. Saw Lang on his tour this summer and it was a stunning performance. Hope he does not lose too much of that audience with this new sound, or that he finds others who like it as much as I liked the old sound. Whatever, make a point of listening to the song samples before you buy, because if you're a big fan of the earlier work, this new album is definitely not more of the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"As a long time Jonny Lang fan I was disapointed with this cd.

He has gone from blues guitar phenom to R&B to a mishmash of style. I have no problem with change but the quality just isn't on this one. I bought it early without benefit of any reviews. I tried listening to it for several weeks but it never grabbed me at all- no soul or grit.

I loved Jonny's first two album, saw him in concert and think he's a great BLUES talent. Unfortunately, this is NOT a BLUES CD. It sounds like Jonny's been listening to too much 70's rock and roll. There's nothing new here -- and worst of all there's NO BLUES. Now, excuse me while I quickly put on some blues to wash away the stuff I just listened to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Jonny I know","review":"If you enjoy Lang's previous music, don't buy this release - ignorance is bliss.

Along the way, Townsend relates in vivid detail the beauty of the places and the people he encounters, and the politics and the events of the 1950s world, as he sees them from behind the wheel of his trusty friend.

It lacked the energy and drive of previous works, almost formulaic.It hurts to write this, as Mr. Dubrow will never be able to make another album to make up for this one. He had a stellar career if you judge it by the quality of his work, regardless of how QR did or did not do in the charts.Rehab sounds like it was recorded by Musicians in need of rehab. of course, this was done after Mr. Cavazos and Sarzos left the band...so it's hard to figure out what part of the normal formula went wrong.Sorry folks, but this QR fan was sadly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to Them????","review":"I saw they came out with a new CD, and thought it would be as good as their last couple, alive and well and guilty pleasures.

The story is about a man, Sir Max Busby, who wants to see evolutionary theory take over the world and he knows that this is a matter of propaganda more than facts.

The facts about art, Vermeer (if true) and the Nazi art thefts are interesting and thought provoking. I'd rather learn about these things in this format than reading a dry text book. The downfall of this book is how manipulated I felt as a reader. I found myself reading a passage and thinking it was totally unnecessary. Then two pages later Claire (the main character) saves the day with something that was never talked about in the set up scene. Claire was also one of the least intellegent detectives I've ever encountered. If I walked into a ransacked appartment I'd call the police first thing! But hey thats me.

I protect this tape like the special item it is. If you like the dark side, you'll like this book very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"A guy's book","review":"This book is about power and masochism. All the female characters are witches. The main character (Rojack)is a pathetic, manic-depressive sociopath who thinks the moon is talking to him. He murders his wife, rapes the maid and falls for a whore: the only woman he has sympathy for. The only female character he doesn't molest is the teenage step-daughter. Mailer is sometimes verbose in a juvenile attempt at poetry. The conclusion is predictable. Recommend only as a case study in bad American literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures the essence of male anxiety and drives","review":"Mailer's most riveting novel, closely followed by Tough Guys Don't Dance, American Dream hits the target again and again of the male drive to sex, power and adventure. Mailer's real ouvre is the post-war world of urban abandonment and existential adventure. This novel reeks of what the 20th C was all about, and has never been bettered by any author. Oddly, for such a masculine writer, Mailer's understanding is all about intuition and dark intimations. He is a magus not a rocket scientist. I read this book when I was going through my own puny version of the life of Stephen Rojack and could not believe how splendid it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Da' Bomb by Mailer","review":"Proust? James? Joyce? They're great writers but why would I want to read about lives so similar to my own? I can't lounge around in posh hotel lobbies posturing and reeking of decadent snobbery while I woo impressionable young women if I'm wasting my time reading about it! I know people who loudly renounce authors whom they have never read. I know people who feel instant self gratification upon knowing that there might be someone in the room who hasn't read DeLillo's Underworld. But I have never known anyone of any intelligence who doesn't get a kick out of Mailer. He's Jackie Collins with brass balls. An American Dream is a darkly entertaining, well-written, escapist saga. The characters are interesting and active, and the ideas are sometimes brutish, but so is life. Sure, mentioning Mailer might draw snickers from the tweed-and-elbow-patch crowd, but the porn-loving high-school senior in all of us should be allowed to have a good read once in a while!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"I couldn't believe this is the author of \\"The Naked and the Dead\\", \\"Harlot's Ghost\\", and \\"The Executioner's Song\\"! I think for this book Mailer tried a little too hard to be \\"cool\\", \\"stylistic\\", whatever, and ended up looking like an unconvincing show-off. Not worth the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mailer Bomb","review":"I know people who reread Proust every year. I know people whose favorite book is Finnegan's Wake. But I have never known anyone of any intelligence who has made it through a novel by Norman Mailer. This book is a good example of why that is. Although the prose is serviceable, it is pointlessly obfuscating. The characters are leaden and the ideas, such as they are, are puerile. Mailer is perfect for readers of very little brain who want to think they are intellectuals. His books are pornographic soap operas for high school sophomores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book about sayings of Jesus without Jesus","review":"As far as I can tell, Easwaran only mentions Jesus in this whole book once. You would think Meister Eckhart is the more important spiritual figure than Jesus Christ, although the book purports to be about the Beatitudes from Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. The book is well-written, but I find this kind of spiritual co-opting to be very misleading. I can't help but wonder if the ulterior purpose of an author such as this is not to diminish Jesus' stature by effectively turning him into just another mystic. I have no problem with spiritual books having nothing to do with religion. But I find it misleading to market the book as if it is a book about Christianity, right down to the picture of Mary adoring the baby Jesus on the book's cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairy Stories","review":"Wendell Berry writes well, and tells a good story. His characters are developed and fully believable. He has, however, a rose-colored view of the past. He ignores events that do not fit into that view. In short, he is very readable, if one suspends all knowledge of history. The book begins in 1888 and ends about one hundred years later. Reading Berry, one would think that Kentucky was never involved in the Civil War/War Between the States, or sent anyone to Cuba in the Spanish/American War, nor a single person to the Great War/WWI. When he finally recognizes the effects of WWII on one of the members of the community, his descriptions seem to better fit the first of those two world wars then the second.In short, it's great nostalgia, but lacks verisimilitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"moved to tears","review":"I have not yet read this book, but have read many of the stories in it. One of its sources in particular, The Wild Birds (now sadly out of print), is one of the most moving books I have read in years. No story has ever moved me more than The Boundary, an absolutely beautiful reflection on memory, loss, community, belonging, family and life. It is a true gem from start to finish, and worth the price of this book alone. It speaks eloquently and beautifully of all the values that Berry holds dear. I grew up in a small city in England, and have no sense of rural Kentucky life, but the values which Berry sets forth are universally deep and meaningful. His portrait of life in the small community of Port William is vivid and rich with life and humanity. It speaks to the heart of anyone who feels the connectedness of our human condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Counter-culture at its best!","review":"Saying that Berry is something like Faulkner feels like damning with faint praise, and that is not my intent. The comparison is inevitable, given that both men write stories about Southern characters, and that both authors ponder philosophy along with plot. But Berry is better than Faulkner, and better at all kinds of levels. He's a skillful writer; these stories are pleasurable to read. Plus, Berry has an idea of how the world has been, could be, and ought to be - but the doctrine is delivered painlessly and persuasively in these irresistable tales from Port William.

I fell in lovwe with him. i was so surprised by the ending ( I didn't like that part, i cried) I could type all day about this novel so let me quit. It is one of my all time favorite reads.

I love to write and after reading their books, I just really want to meet these authors. They have become one of my favorite authors. They are truly great creative writers who inspire me to write. I didn't think any other book that they wrote was going to be better than the diary of a street diva, but after reading Dirty Money, I was wrong, I fell in love with their style of writing. And as for Shawna, dirty money is the foundation of the number of deaths in this book so if Lance doesn't kill her with a\\"silent drug\\" then she'll die some other way. This book was full of suspense and suprises. I recommend it to many~ Big UPS!!2 the authors.

It puts a refreshing view on poems you may have already read.Also, it's quite a bit cheaper than the Norton Anthology but still has all the poetry. There aren't any footnotes, but that can be a good or bad thing. It leaves you free to your own interprtations and feelings, but there's no guidance to poets' intents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase Kindle edition","review":"There is no table of contents, index, index of first lines, or index of poets in the Kindle edition. In addition, the book is not indexed so you cannot search for a poet or poem by name. The print book is 1130+ pages long. It is unconscionable for Amazon to sell this item on Kindle. (I had carefully checked the \\"look inside\\" feature of the print book and it includes all the above features.) This borders on fraud. I had to spend fifteen minutes on the phone getting a refund--and the customer service tech assured me that there is NO way to be sure in advance that a book is indexed or has a table of contents. ( I am rating it one star because Amazon won't allow me to give it no stars.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A detailed look at one of our greatest contemporary poets","review":"While Leonard Cohen's music, writing, and intreaguing life are enough to satisfy any romantic, this book manages to give a clear and accurate depiction of Cohen's motivations, influences, and understanding of life. From his innovative novels to his influencial and engrossing music and poetry, Cohen's life is portrayed as a constant exploration into the soul and the true meaning of love, sacrifice, and isolation. However, it is impossible to convey the passion and emotion that Cohen transmits in albums such as \\"Death of a Lady's Man\\" and \\"Songs of Love and Hate.\\" In only this aspect does \\"Various Positions: A Life of Leanord Cohen\\" fall short of possible expectations. But perhaps Cohen's emotion is something that prose writing simply cannot capture. Leonard Cohen's life is certainly something worth reading about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful talent!","review":"Another great album from Hawksley Workman!

It can sync at 1/60 and 1/125 and stop action. I was unable to use it in ttl mode with auto zoom, but I didn't get a book with it and will continue to play with it to see if I can get that part to work.

I haven't had any problems with it and have used it to shred carrots and cabbage, make hummus and nutella (oh, yeah, it was awesome), and \\"grind\\" meat. Now, it worked wonderfully for these things, but, really, don't go putting liquid in this food processor. Use your head: this is a food processor not a liquid processor (a.k.a. a blender).This processor is quite sturdy and has a wonderfully heavy base, so it doesn't \\"dance\\" on the counter top. It also looks quite nice, especially for the price. Its motor seems to be powerful enough too, given how well it worked for the (very thick, dense) nutella."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"Got this as a birthday gift from mom..can we hear a \\"yea mom\\"?

They still will not guarantee a new motor/base to replace my defective 5-month old processor. Ridiculous. I will never buy another Cuisinart product. I urge you to avoid Cuisinart.

Having it for 2 weeks I tried a recipe from the Cuisinart instruction booklet, during processing the machine blew up, thick smoke coming from the motor. Via the suborganization from Amazon I contacted Cuisinart and told them the experience, they were not helpful at all. It came down to ....send us the machine....at my own expence (both ways).

I guess it is due to safty."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great little machine","review":"I just bought a cuisnart DLC-2011, Prep 11 cup food processor and I love how easy it was to operate and clean. It's perfect for slicing vegetables, even if I'm only cutting one or two vegetables at a time and I especially like the dough attachment for making bread. It is a little heavy to move with its tight grips on the bottom, but the grips hold the machine steady. It's sleak enough to keep on the counter if you have room. I'd probably not buy a processor smaller than 11 cups even for small jobs. The size and power of the machine makes it possible to prepare an entire dessert completely with processing.After reading the other reviews I must say that I'm upset that I paid $165 for the processor when most paid $134 or less. And... I had the exact same problem with packaging. The pusher tube was shrink wrapped so tightly inside the feed tube that I had to send the entire machine back just to get one that was properly wrapped."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought this for my mother and she loves it","review":"Like:easy to use and cleannothing has broken yetrelatively quietsaves alot of timeBetter dinnersDislikesnone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and easy to clean","review":"Cuisinart has made its plastic container thicker, so it is easier to handle and the parts are quick to load.

I then turned the Pusher Assy upside down and placed it in the styrofoam piece cut out. (perfect fit) I placed a used roll of electrical tape on top of the small pusher (about the same diameter)for protection and then placed a putty knife on top of the tape to create a solid surface.

We tried WD-40, cooking oil, soaking it in hot soapy water, blow-drying it, and prying it with a flathead screwdriver.

They insisted that customers should pay as far as it is not under warranty \\"regardless if it broke down at the first time or on the first day\\".

I had since gone into Costco to compare the models. The packaging and accessories for Costco are more in that they include Cuisinart's blade holder. If you are considering getting a food processor and do not know how you will store everything, the holder is sold here on Amazon separately.My purchased-items are the Cuisinart 11-Cup Food Processor with a brushed stainless finish and the Cuisinart Blade holder that work for this size together. I am not disappointed. I chose the full-size one because of the ability to scale up. I am making delicious meals, and I find more flavors and textures since starting to use the food processor. The brushed stainless is pretty. This is my first food processor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Processor","review":"At first I thought I should have ordered a smaller food processor, but as I began using it I knew I had chosen the right size even though there are only two of us at home. The only difficulty I had was learning how to snap the bottom and top parts correctly into place. At first I thought I had a defective product, but with patience and some practice I was able to master the technique. It is very powerful and I do like the pulse method of chopping up foods to the size I want. It is great for salads, which is the most frequent use we make of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Machine","review":"We played the CD on a laptop computer the first couple of times we used this machine. It does a lot of things you would never think about and watching the video gives you a fast track to using.Our immediate concern was that using this processor would actually add to the time it took to prepare food for just the two of us. But keeping it on the counter, and knowing how easy it is to clean up - we have changed our way of preparing foods to take full advantage.The unit is sturdy, and QUIET (relative). Well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"problems with attachments and optional parts","review":"Cuisinart DLC-2011 Prep 11 Plus Food Processor, WhiteCuisinart DLC-2011 food processor, 11 cup.In the instruction manual and DVD Cuisinart lists crucial attachment parts such as a whisk attachment. However, they discontinue these important parts while still selling the main product that has very few attachment parts.

Apparantly, Amazon has shipped dozens that have the same problem. The manufacturer used too much and too sticky shrink wrapping all over the mechanisms, resulting in the small pusher mechanism being fused together. The manufacturer obviously lacks quality control and Amazon lacks ingtegity. We're left with having to repackage everything, mail it back and wait for our refund to be processed before we can purchase a reputable machine from a reputable seller. Both Cuisinart and Amazon get one star for this disappointing transaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this machine","review":"I bought this for my mother for Mother's Day, It worked fine for 7 months. Today, she turned it on and nothing happened. This machine is not used on a daily basis, and used mainly to chop nuts. I called Cuisinart, I was told it was still under warranty, but I need to send it back, my own expense, and enclose a $10 check for shipping and handling so they could send it back to me. For the price I could have gone to Wal Mart and bought a $20 machine, which probably would have lasted longer and would not be as upsetting, compared to $149. My advice choose another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE this processor!","review":"I bought this processor from a big department store. I hate it so much that I am reviewing here. It is flimsy. It also does not work--in prepping a dinner recently, the mayonnaise I was making did not fully emulsify--there was raw egg at the bottom after lengthy processing with a slow stream of oil. I then moved on to a compound butter--the garlic and shallots in the butter never really pureed and, again, at the bottom of the processor, were ingredients (lime juice, chunks of room temp butter etc.) that never incorporated into the mixture. This is an AWFUL machine--and I am a long-time Cuisinart devotee. Taking it back to the department store and praying to find something better. This one is crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Get the Stupid Container off of the Unit!!!!!","review":"I HATE this food processor!

I have to beat it and stand on my head and do acrobatics and pray that the stupid thing will come off without spilling my food. Other than that it works fine.

This second food processor was for use on a boat, and I bought it primarily to multitask, incuding making bread. Storing a stand mixer was not practical. I am EXTREMELY disappointed in the Prep Plus. Although it is supposed to have more capacity than the old processor, it seems to be underpowered for the size. I have yet to be able to make bread without the machine stalling, or coming close to it, even following the instructions in the booklet that came with it. And it's not inexperience--I have made LOTS of bread in the old processor. The 11-cup Prep Plus seems to be able to perform other tasks reasonably well, which shouldn't really be a challenge for a decent food processor that cost as much as this one did. Handling dough is the acid test.Steer clear of this made-in-China model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its great for the price","review":"I got this as a replacement for one that I brutally abused, and it went up in a puff of smoke. I picked Cuisinart because I've had good luck with their products. I picked this model based on the reviews. I've only used it a couple of times, using the blade. It worked quietly and worked well. The base is heavy, which is a good sign. I've washed the parts (other than the base) in the dishwasher, top rack, as described in the instruction booklet, they came out fine. The equipment is sharp, so some caution needs to be exercised. I want to use the disc's for shredding and slicing. I'll update this if there's anything to note.I read in a review here some place that plastic freezer containers can be used to store the blades and discs. I tried using them and found it a good idea. The blades are easy to put in the container and take out, the discs as well. It saves a couple bucks and might avoid a scrape or two with the disc holders.All in all, I'm happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific little thing","review":"I got the 9 cup size which doesn't take up alot of room.

I haven't used this Cuisinart for dough, but will probably try it out. While I am very pleased with the durability of the heavy-duty motor, the base is quite heavy.

Not only is it filled with erotic imagery and some really hot sex scenes, it's a great look into the psyche of Robin, who is training to become a slave, and what kind of person would really want to do this. Antoniou really keeps the story tight, and keeps the erotic tension throughout the entire novel. I was thrilled to read the added short (well, not so short!) story that gives us even more about Robin and puts her into a great three-way with two really hot, fun, lesbians. The story is wonderful, and worth the price to pick up the new edition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me dying for more...","review":"Having recently started wondering through the world of erotica, I started a search for a good book to introduce me to BDSM.

I enjoyed the tale of one woman's quest to truly become a slave. I certainly appreciated the fact that there is no prince charming to take her to his harem, etc. type nonsense in this story. Once again Chris Parker is in top form as he personally takes the challenge to train her in 2 weeks and from then on as her sponsor/mentor. Not only is she trained she is bought in the marketplace by the most unlikely duo. But I don't want to give away too much but Laura manages to put humor, wickedness and sex together in a delightful manner.

He also finds many disadvantages to being flat.This book is a great book for opening discussion with your child-What are the advantages of being you? What do you wish you could change? How can you change? and so on.This is also a great book for letting your child make his own flat stanley and send it off to friends for an adventure. Many schools are doing this now.

I mean, it is not every day you read a book about a boy who turns flat. One day, Stanley wakes up to discover that his bulletin board fell on him that night. When Stanley's brother and parents lift the bulletin board off of Stanley, he is flat. Stanley is then taken to the doctor, but there was really nothing wrong with him. His parents decide to mail Stanley to California to be with his uncle. Stanley was used as a kite, and got stuck in a tree. Stanley was also used to help catch thieves at a nearby museum. After a while, people started to dislike Stanley because he was flat. To find out what happens to Stanley, you should definitely read this book. There are a few other adventures with Stanley to check out as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the real thing","review":"This book is entitled \\"Flat Stanley\\" by Jeff Brown.

This review is for the 2006 book, which is \\"Based upon the original Flat Stanley by Jeff Brown, text copyright 1964\\". If you look at the other reviews for this book, you will notice that almost all of them were written before 2006, when the book itself was written. Obviously Amazon has included the reviews written for \\"Flat Stanley\\" by Jeff Brown that was copyrighted in 1964, probably because Amazon thinks these are the same books. They are not. This title was included on my 8 yr old's \\"Book Quest\\" list. When my girl discussed the book with others, the 2006 version turned out to be \\"missing parts\\".

And to be fair, it's got a fair amount of that.However, BEFORE you idly sit through this one (esp with kids), beware that it's got some of the most lascivious sex scenes involving a minor that has ever been displayed in a public venue.I'm no prude and definitely appreciate the appropriate use or eroticism in a flick, but this one definitely caught me off guard when Lindsey sits in a rowboat, removes her panties and invites her virginal teen boyfriend to play OB/GYN.I'd say skip this one and save yourself the annoyance of verboten titillation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pathetic attempt at engendering an emotional response that fails miserably","review":"Georgia Rule is the story of a granddaughter sent to live with her grandmother because she acts out. The girl, Lindsay Lohan, is an aspiring Lolita who lies so convincingly that you begin to wonder if every word out of her mouth is an untruth. Her mother is an alcoholic too busy drinking and buying Louis Vuitton to take care of her daughter. The grandmother is a lonely, miserable person who tries to absolve herself of the wrongs done to her family with arbitrary rules and lackluster conversation. So let me tell you how I really feel: I've never seen a more halfhearted effort to be deep. No really. This is the story of three generations of flawed women. None of their flaws are resolved. There is no point. I can't believe I just wasted the last hour and 45 minutes of my life like this. I'll do you a favor and advise you not to do the same. Save some time. RentGlitter.

That's a well-considered statement, and I make it unequivocally. And I'm 64 years old (not a fogey!) and a tremendous movie fan.It must be that the writers, directors, and actors either didn't agree on the story line, or they changed their minds too many times to go back and make it one thing or another. It's supposed to be a comedy? There aren't even that many funny lines. A soap opera? Just possibly, but very drippy. A commentary on mother-daughter relationships? on sexual abuse? on religion and faith? It's a total loss. It doesn't even pay out the title.The only possible explanation -- not justification -- of it might have been to provide a vehicle for Lindsay Lohan to act herself.I actually bought this movie!

Sexual child abuse is brought to light a third of the way into the movie and it went down hill from there! I am not sure what the \\"R\\" rating was for...there unless it was the story line. A little profanity and no nudity but definitely NOT a family movie. After the confession, I spent the rest of the movie trying to figure out if it was true or not.

So, I loved her in this movie along with Felicity Huffman and Jane Fonda who were excellent in their own right. This was so much better than I expected. It's definitely a drama but also has some humor. Yes, it deals with the very serious subject of sexual abuse with a minor but it handles it well and honestly. Was this the greatest movie ever? No. But it certainly was good to very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"I keep being surprised","review":"I keep being surprised by Lindsey Lohan - my natural instincts are, because she is a high-profile and somewhat 'scandalous' public figure to write her off as just being famous for being famous and no more - but she is, however, an excellent actress and never better than in this film.Add that to the fact that Jane Fonda is always good and Felicity Huffman a consummate professional then it is not surprising that they make what could be a rather squalid plot into a very watchable film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you from someone who's been there!","review":"I've spent more than 20 years dealing with similar issues explored in the film! What this film brings to light is the importance of validation to people who have suffered from horrendous crimes. Plus the amazing courage and strength that comes from overcoming and moving forward. It brings to light important issues many people may be unaware of -- how events can have a life-altering, destructive impact long into our future even while we battle to overcome the effects. The film also reveals the power and truth of positive interaction amongst people ... and that there are many types of healthy love and all sorts of positive relationships. While many may find parts of the film disbelieving, this film is very similar to my own truth. I am thankful to the group of people who brought forward the themes in this film, with a relieving touch of humour and compassion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Acting, Weak Script","review":"I have never before seen a movie like this. Everything else is good except the script. Because of this, you can not really get fully into the movie. Moments that someone thought might be daring, naughty, or funny are just embarrassing. One moment is when . . . you know what? I can not say ANY of them. They are all obscene. I have a feeling the film's writers wanted these bold scenes to be cathartic and freeing. Granted, it is a fine line to cross. One movie that presented difficult situations excellently is Black Snake Moan. I recomment that instead of Georgia Rules.In Georgia Rules, Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman are fantastic. Lindsay Lohan did the best she could with the lines given her. She did not ruin the movie; the script did it for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappoints.","review":"I found it disappointing. it is very difficult to use - the narrative flow wanders and is unfocused. Generally, the book seems to be structured into alternating sections of about 5 pages of rambling background, followed by about 5 pages of palpation instructions. After a while we learned to just skip over the rambling background completely. The palpation instructions are deliberately designed to make multiple \\"tours\\" of a each body area, but providing just a little bit more information on each tour. The result is a tedious repetitive series of exercises, which is frustrating and irritating rather than supportive and enriching. Additionally, we found there were frequently instructions to locate and isolate structures that aren't readily isolated on most people - terres major and minor, and many others.The accompanying DVD is very good. But it doesn't correct or compensate for the shortcomings of the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trail Guide to the Body: How to Locate Muscles, Bones...","review":"Finally, a palpatory anatomy book that speaks TO you instead of talking AT you!

It covers the real-life observations necessary to become a good artist. During and after I read the book, I could tell that my drawing skill level was improving because I was more aware of what I was doing not only instinctually, but technically as well. Barbara Bradley intelligently addresses the problem that many beginning artists face in that they tend to spend more time focusing on learning anatomy and pay little attention to how figures are drawn with clothing, which is actually more realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parents--some illustrations may be inappropriate","review":"Just a word to parents--if you are buying this for a young person, you might want to be aware that there are some sexually provocative images and at least a few nude drawings in this book.

I can't say enough good things about this series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed like a moldy oldie","review":"I made it through only about 60 pages of this novel before setting it aside in the charity pile. The plot just seemed so dated- Quiller racing against time to keep yet another U.S.-Soviet summit from being derailed. In 1985 this probably seemed like a big deal, but it just doesn't resonate now. Also the first-person narration is strangely detached and antiseptic."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 9th Directive","review":"Rarely did I start a book and couldn't finish it, this is the one! The plot of the story line is totally obsolete in today's political environment for a spy story, and it's also the first time I did not like the main character in a book-Quiller. From the beginning of the book he already showed his big ego towards his boss, because he had small feet. What a joke! And he himself made some miscalculation too, not a likable man to me. It hard to continue a book if you don't like a main character in a book. More important, had I had found out it was written in 1966, I would not have picked it up.Like the other viewer said, it'll go to the charity pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would have assigned it","review":"I ordered this because it was required reading for a class.

Out of all the books I had to order for this class (and that list was unnecessarily long) I used this book the most, and I feel I got my money's worth out of it. I will keep this book for future reference, whereas the others will likely be sold back to a book store or donated. If I were teaching a class on Native American Art I would assign this book. I can't say that about many books I'm assigned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book!","review":"Seattle Mariners by Paul Joseph is a rip-off! I'm very disappointed in the fact that the information inclosed, in this book, is dated. I'd thought I'd be getting a current book of the Mariners 2001 season.

It CLEARLY states on the package that the paper is compatible with epson, canon, HP, lexmark--perhaps they think that the consumer cannot tell the difference between good true color and garbage!

He kept blathering on about a \\"compatibility issue\\". I kept explaining that the packaaging states \\"compatible with ALL inkjet printers\\".I told him this is not a \\"compatibility issue\\" but rather a CREDIBILITY issue. They are knowingly marketing garbage, saying it can do something that it can't. ... like Snake Oil. I asked if he would send me a package of \\"Kodak Picture Paper\\" to make up for my wasted money.

It is about half the thickness of the other quality inkjet photo papers. This is more like a glossy presentation paper then what a glossy photo paper is supposed to be. Nice bright white with the kodak logo all over the back. The glossiness is more akin to a satin paper rather then other glossy papers.

If you are like I am you probably don't want to read a crap-ton of reviews!These prints are perfect for printing drafts on, or maybe even small 4x6 photos. I WOULD NOT recommend printing these for high-quality, post on the mantle types of photos. But if you are a photography student like me, these are great for printing to check crop, and color balance within the photo.Downsides to this paper:Images seem a little washed outIt's like printing on the wrong side of matte paper (Designers, you know what I mean), but you still get the semi-gloss affect.Hope this helps!

I got this from our Navy Exchange store, I dont have any other option coz it was the only 8.5x11 size left on the shelf. I was surprised how thin it is, Ive used it with my HP all in one printer, I was sad of the outcome, it doesnt look glossy at all but just plain matte. When I started glossing/glazing the pictures for my crafts, I could see it starting to disintegrate, the material was really flimsy. So I decided I would just use it for my other project since I dont want it to go to waste, but when I printed the whole page, black backgound and white fonts, I was horrified with the results!!!! The words came out blurred and most of it you cant barely read it at all! So I tried printing it again using my hp 4x6 photo paper and the results were brilliant.

Evra the snake boy goes along to show the strength of Darren's friendship with Evra, and their relationship is definitely tested.What is discovered in the Tunnels of Blood only adds to the suspense that consistently builds in this series. EVERYTHING presented in these first books of the Cirque series will be relevant in later books.

The small size is a big plus on storage. The whole unit seems to be well made with sturdy parts. The only reason I hold back the fifth star is because you can't use this unit for liquids.

The first time it burned out, I exchanged it through the 18-mo warranty, which was a bit cumbersome with being put on hold for 20 minutes, and then the FedEX returns (I work during the day, so it was difficult to schedule a pickup) and swap. However, when I received the new one, I had only used it twice before it burned out again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous!

I used it more than the larger Cuisanart processor, for garlic, shakes, chopping nuts. And it's so easy to put away.One night, I chopped some garlic, wonder of wonders. It worked fine. I left the base out because I need chopped walnuts in the morning. The next morning, kaput. About 14 hours previously, it had worked fine. The base didn't get wet, and I ensured many times that that the bowl was on properly, as well as the lid. Still, nothing.What the heck?I bought the 4-cup Mini-Prep for my son for Christmas.

It seemed burning. I put this back in Amazon's box and returned the next day.If you intend to use this as a grinder, this is not for you.

So I was very disappointed to discover upon using it that it doesn't have an \\"ON\\" button which would allow you to mix a dressing for several minutes (you can really only pulse this) AND even with intermittent pulsing, the motor smelled like it was burning up after less than a minute of pressing it.In other words, it's all but useless in its ability to do anything other than a 5 sec chop (which it did fine, but I need a processor that is more versatile & can be used for multiple culinary creations). Unfortunately we had to go to the hassle of returning it & now looking for a machine that doesn't smell like the motor is going to blow up by doing what one would think a food processor could easily do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after a few months","review":"I am really disappointed with Cuisinart.

If you put too much in, it'll puree what's at the bottom and leave whole what's on top. Not good.If you regularly need to process small quantities, like about 1/2 cup, this works. But I don't find that it's worth the clean up instead of just using a knife. I rarely get mine out.

I've been using my standard size processor for everything and was finding it a bit oversized for many of my uses.I LOVE this mini prep. It's powerful, the container is a great size, and it makes great spreads. Sure, it doesn't chop everything evenly, but in 30 years, I've yet to find a machine that does, large or small. You pulse, and move things around a bit. It's just a fact of cooking life.We'll see if this machine goes the distance as far as years.

It starts to overheat after a few rounds of 10 second blending intervals. It is useless for making mayo with because the holes in the lid to pour things through while blending are incredibly small (And yes, I am only using one of the holes so air can get in, blocking the air flow isn't the issue). It takes almost 5 minutes to get 1/2 of olive oil through the hole because of its size and the fact that you have to take breaks to allow the motor to cool.I regret deciding to save money and by this inexpensive food processor. Once I have some spare cash, I am upgrading.Any suggestions?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay.","review":"I had this product for about a year and used it on occasion.

Anyway, the size of this is perfect for us. We rarely cook for more than the two of us (except the summer, when my step daughter stays with us, when we cook for three), and so the need for a larger processor really isnt there. Anyway, I was actually surprised by just how efficient this little processor really is. It definitely works as well for us at home as my Hobart works for me at work. It doesnt see daily use, so I imagine it will last us for years to come. Also, it is pretty silent as far as these things go. The design is simple, and as inferred earlier, it doesnt take up any space at all. I'm very happy with it. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Otherwise,Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite thing!","review":"I've owned this for at least 8 years and it still works amazing. Recently, I made all my infant's baby food in it.

By far my favorite small appliance in the kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This is the perfect little food processor. I read tons of reviews, and I wanted something that was durable, efficient, and inexpensive. Its perfect for chopping vegetables, and I am pretty sure I even threw in some pecans.

Because of other reviewers, I was warned not to sit on the chop button or I would have puree quickly. So I just pulse when I am chopping and it works great. I like the smaller size because it is easy to get out of the cupboard and quickly set it up. It does a much better job than my old Black and Decker mini chopper, which I loved also because of the convenience. The blades are much better on the Cuisinart. I'd buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I bought this machine in order to make my baby's food and it worked fine for that task.

It's just not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"only one drawback","review":"Great product except that I wish it could be used for smaller amounts of stuff. For example, if I chop up a little garlic, it seems like it all jumps to the outer edges before it gets chopped enough so I add a red pepper to the garlic just so it will work better. I still have to use a spatula to scrape the sides about 3 or 4 times which is not very energy efficient (turning a motor off and on several times is not energy efficient). I don't have any other brands to compare it to, but everything seems to work well. I mostly use it to puree veggies, cooked and raw. I think if you wanted more of a diced product, it would be more of a challenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too light duty","review":"Gears are made of cheap plastic and will strip if anything too hard like patatos or hard cheese is ground!

Still, my husband thought this purchase was unnecessary, since we already have the Cuisinart DLC-1 Mini-Prep, a slightly smaller version of this model. But I have found that the little bit of extra room in this Mini Prep Plus really makes a difference. This is still a pretty small processor. But for big jobs, it is easier to just separate the job into a few small batches and use the Mini Prep Plus a few times over than to lug out the bigger processors to use just once.

All I used it for was chopping vegetables like carrots, onions, and bell peppers. I couldn't believe it. When I called Cuisinart customer service the best they could do to help me was try to sell me another one for half price.

I wanted a small food processor primarily to chop up an onion and some garlic cloves, and with the Cuisinart, I pretty much ended up doing almost all of the chopping before I put the food in the processor, otherwise large sections wouldn't get cut.After reading the reviews here about how the Kitchenaid has the reverse sprial action which pulls down the food, I thought I'd try that one, and it's true!! The Kitchenaid KFC3100 is a superior product! Now I can just cut the onion into quarters and throw in whole garlic cloves and it cuts them all up perfectly. If your not sure which of the two products to buy, get the Kitchenaid KFC3100!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I have owned an old 10 cup Cuisinart for almost 30 years. While it still runs perfectly, it's a hassle to move to the counter, so I rarely use it. I also had a mini Cuisinart that I thought would make hummus, but it was too small for almost all useful jobs.If you are undecided between the three and four cup models, I would strongly advise getting the four cup model over the three cup one, as it's still quite small and lightweight, yet it gives you ample room to make a batch of hummus, or even enough pie crust and filling for a smaller tart.Happily, they redesigned the blade assembly so it's one piece. This makes it far safer to clean. The mini-prep model has a blade that you remove from the stem--a dicey process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed.","review":"I use this about twice a month to grind homecooked dog food. I don't think I'm too rough on it - I chop the meat into small chunks and never overfill it. I frequently encounter two problems:1) It smells like hot electrical components. I never keep it continuously running - I pulse on/off until the food is sufficiently chopped. Nonetheless, it smells like I've overworked it. It hasn't stopped working yet, but it sure smells like it will give out any day now!2) Somehow, food gets up under the blade insert (I think this occurs when it shakes in the beginning like an unbalanced washing machine), and it is nearly impossible to clean it out of the long cylindrical piece of plastic. It seems like a bad design. I soak in hot soapy water and vinegar, but I can still see that there is a coating of dried food in there.When this one breaks, I'll shop for a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for indian cooking","review":"I purchased it to grind my urad dal for idlies and for small amounts of chutneys. it didnot grind urad dal into a fine paste. also if u add some dals as seasoning for chuyneys, its a failure. so its ok for chutneys witoiut dals. finally my purpose is not fulfilled completelyonions are not chopped equally. blender is a better option"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!

Just toss the ingredients in it and pulse, the dough comes together quickly.

I simply dump one can of tuna, seasoning & mayonnaise into the DLC, process it and then add the veggies to the DLC.It is also great for turkey salad, guacamole and salsa.Cleanup is quick and easy as everything is dishwasher safe except the base.The dishwashable parts are designed in such a way that they will get cleaned (this is not always the case).I have a Magimix full size processor but I would never use it to make a small batch of tuna.

It is extremely easy to clean-up, however because of its small capacity, you have to be careful not to overfill it with anything slightly liquid or it will leak out the top. I wish the lid would seal better, but this seems to be a problem with any food processor. It is also plenty powerful, but you have to be careful not to over do it. I make a lot of homemade salsa, and I had to learn quickly just to \\"blip\\" it a few times otherwise I would end up with salsa soup.Overall, you can't beat it for the price.

I was pulsing as is recommended, when I felt the processor getting very warm. I shut it off and let it completely cool. When I tried to process again, the motor was dead.

My mom took it back and I went and purchased a cheap no-name brand food processor- still works today!

The majority of the songs on this CD are saccharine and undistinguished (and undistinguishable from each other.) A good buy to get the six tunes mentioned if you don't already have them. Otherwise, not that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Americans in Bear Country","review":"I would probably never read an abstract discussion of the Russian economy, but this first-person story held my attention all the way through.

Which one appears to be her mother and the other her grandmother.She describes both Mrs.Gibsons.She loves both Mrs. Gibsons and in the story she describes the two womens different personalities.She describes her grandmother as a color skin of choclate and her mother color skin like vanilla. It's a great book because it descripitive.It contrasts a lot about both Mrs.Gibsons.Although the two women look nothing alike and have contrasting expressions, they both love Toyomi and her father.I think if people read this book they will like it as much as I liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a pain!","review":"It's not the product that's bad but the hassel of putting it on the phone!

My guess is that they do not want to influence us during critical junctures coming up involving challenges posed to our souls by the earth changes. They probably are also aware that our own lack of self-understanding will result in misinterpretations about much of what they are doing, and the way they are going about it.Our lack of self-understanding is also expressed in the author's questions to the aliens. Just as one must know enough about a subject to be able to ask the right questions, we must also have enough self-understanding to be able to ask questions concerning the nature of reality, time, and space--and much of this book deals with the incredible alternate reality that these creatures are so adept at manipulating, which is ultimately what makes this book so mind expanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much self promotion","review":"This book may have been more enjoyable if it were not for all the self promotion the author does for her other books. It seems about almost every 5th page she gives one of her other books a plug. Sometimes its done when there isn't even anything related to what she's currently talking about. Otherwise there are some really good interviews that have really interesting experiences to share - but then the author also likes to put her own comments (pages of them) inserted into the interviews and basically puts her own spin on things. Both of these tendencies are very distracting - not too mention the self promotion is just plain IRRITATING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow Factor","review":"This book is much more than abduction stories.

Other than that their has been little intriguing development in the lives of other characers. Unless your still entertained by Sarah and her daughter's apparent lack of ability to truly committ to one man. Parenthood's strong point has always been multiple interesting storylines that beg for a resolution and are drawn out over many episodes. In this season the continual building of intrigue and story lines has weakened and become predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who hates Sarah Braverrman","review":"I really appreciate this Parenthood. It is entertainment that that satisfies without leaving me feeling soiled by filth, sex, vindictiveness or violence.It makes me feel understood. Each epsisode is like a bowl full of empathy.But Sarah Bravermans lack of boundaries is hard to stomach. Her character does not seem to grow. From the first to the fourth season she fumbles her way from oneinappropriate relatoinship to another. Her daughter is not far behind her.Off course there are people like this in real life too. So I do appreciate the realism of presenting it. It does keep the family from seeming perfect.For that reason I do appreciate how she adds to the realism of the show.I have enjoyed EVERY episode of this show.

It celebrates the often dismissed virtue of hanging in there and working things out. So much to love about all the characters. We can all see ourselves somewhere in the story. I have been disappointed by the absence of any kind of presence of spirituality primarily because I feel that most people consciously draw on some level of spiritual strength during crisis' in their lives.

I had heard that this book was easy to read and understand for people seeking the truth about Christ but I was certainly mislead. This book was totally confusing and hard to understand. It is not written for a seeker or a skeptic, in my opinion. It appears to be written for the well-versed theologian. I felt more confused after reading it. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I feel the man's heart was in the right place and I enjoyed the parts about how the Bible manuscripts have been preserved and accurate even though they are so old. I was really disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"quick read, and very good","review":"for as short as it is it was very good. short enough to loan to skeptics and have them actually read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Put me off going to church.","review":"In my late twenties I started to attend a non-denominational church because I was going through some issues in my life and for a time it seemed to help. Then some well-meaning members of the church lent me this book and it threw me completely off course. It was not a book that helped to cement my growing faith instead it basically destroyed it and I did not return to that church for a year. I found the arguments to be extremely weak and not likely to convince anyone who wasn't already strong in their faith. This is not going to help anyone who has questions about Christianity unless you are easily swayed. The only reason why this book has such a favorable following that I can see is that in the process of researching this book the author allegedly went from a non-believer to a believer and Christians see it as confirmation that they are right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book to share with a skeptic","review":"I bought this book and I am almost done.

Get this book and use it in evangelism and in church projects. Buy it to have on hand to give to prospective members."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Evidence Presented","review":"The book was bad. Practically every chapter relied on the Gospels being more or less reliable accounts, and then went off defending Jesus's divinity from there. As I've said plenty of times, if non-believers accepted that the Bible was true, we'd already be Christians. But we don't, so citing scripture as proof is nearly pointless. It would be like trying to prove Mormonism by quoting the Book of Mormon, or Buddhism by quoting the Buddhavacana. McDowell only spent one chapter trying to make a case for the Gospels being reliable, and didn't really succeed. And without that base, the rest of his book just falls flat. This book won't convince anybody who's given serious thought to the question of Christianity.I've written a more detailed review, longer than what's appropriate for Amazon, on my website. Since it appears that Amazon won't let you put links in your reviews, I've pasted the url into a comment for this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exercise in logical fallacies.","review":"The book is an easy read and not unpleasant providing you don't really think about what it's saying.But as soon as you DO start thinking about it you discover that the entire book is built around repetitions and combinations of two serious logical fallacies.1. The false dichotomy.Jesus was either a good person and therefore everything he said must be true, or he lied about some things and was therefore some sort of insane devil incapable of doing good works.2. Circular logic. Uses quotes from the bible to prove the truth of what's said in the bible. Essentially saying the bible must be historical truth because the bible says it is and we know the bible doesn't tell lies.The logical fallacies are obvious when stated so bluntly and the prose wraps it up neatly to disguise them.But truthfully those two logical fallacies cover the entire content of this book. Once the reader has realized that then there is no new content which can be gleaned from further reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reality is Important","review":"But reality is missing here. Josh's arguments are all based on the assumption that the gospels are 100% true and accurate. Unfortunately, if you are investigating something, you don't get to pick the outcome first. He conveniently ignores the idea that anything could be embellished or made up. This book is a simplistic argument for believers that aren't particularly knowledgeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than a carpenter's apprentice","review":"A truly worthless book is hard to come by, and this one may just fit the bill. Woefully circular and question begging, this would-be attempt at apologetics is a waste of time and money. Since it's pretty much preaching to the choir, it does not engage skeptics and liberal bible scholars. Strewn with pathetic anecdotes and lame arguments, it cannot even begin to challenge the mind of an average person that has access to Encarta encyclopedia, much less those who have read the Jesus Seminar and Earl Doherty's The Jesus Puzzle. If you're looking for a reasonably good Jesus apologetic, try N.T. Wright's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Book for Reinforcing Your Atheism","review":"All I have to say about Christianity is this: it's as fake as pro-wrestling. The best way to get people to adhere to a made-up religion is to say, \\"Believe in our lord and you shall live in paradise. Reject him, and you will spend eternity in an unquenchable fire.\\" I'm sorry if the above statement doesn't pertain to Josh McDowell's book. The book can be summed up as a very simple-minded argument that will reinforce atheists' view that Christians are narrow-minded schmucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"I first began to doubt Christianity after reading this book","review":"The book is weak. There are holes in everything MacDowell says. What can I say. I was disappointed and my faith was harmed by this book. I personally don't think any apologetics succeed. The only way to believe is to simply believe, even if you know Christianity is wrong and the bible contradicts itself. Just bury that, suppress it and call it the sinful flesh, and believe. That is a much more effective way to have biblical faith than entering the arenas of reason or rationalism as in all such cases, Christianity fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable","review":"Beginner's apology...this book was terrible and I laughed out loud numerous times. Josh McDowell should probably take a logic course or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book for Believer and Non-Believer","review":"The author was origininally a skeptic of Christianity so he presents a succent yet cogent logic behind Christian beliefs that will appeal to the non-believer and believer alike.Tim"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Buy","review":"Book is great for skeptics and those unsure about who Jesus is. Will buy in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new","review":"This book is generally a restatement of a work called \\"Tryal of the Witnesses of the Resurrection\\" written in the 18th century, and suitably refuted by great philosopher David Hume. Why this old argument about testimony of miracles has resurfaced in the 20th century is beyond me, expect maybe because modern Christians are feeling increasing pressure from \\"science\\" to \\"prove\\" their religion.It's okay to be Christian; just don't put any pretensions of rationality behind your faith. Even if you do, there are better proofs of God's existence (I recommend the Cosmological Argument). If you're interested, read this book, but then take a Philosophy of Religion course to see how easily the book's claims can be refuted."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is none so blind as (s)he who will not see...","review":"This book has gained great popularity among evangelists, and for good reason. It provides an arsenal of arguments for those wishing to share Jesus with skeptics. The fact that it is a labor of love really comes through with passion. I recommend this book to EVERYONE, regardless of your beliefs. However, I have not found this book alone to be sufficient...I also strongly recommend \\"Demon Haunted World\\" by Dr. Carl Sagan, to anyone who truly wants to be effective in spreading the word of God. If you find talking with skeptics to be like talking to a block of cement, this book will really prepare you for witnessing to them. It has done wonders for me. Its' insights are priceless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good enough for the choir","review":"If you doubt, this book may not help. As you read it, you probably will see thru MacDowell's arguments and long for more effective proof of Jesus. Consider the prophecy's for example. Read any of them in their original context and it's fairly clear that they were not prophecying the Messiah. Besides, how do we know that the fulfillments happened, just because it says so in the gospels? His Naive defense of the historical reliability of the New Testament is enough to make you a hindu or an atheist. Anything but a Christian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes too naive a view of the Bible.","review":"One need not choose between lord, liar, or lunatic. McDowell fails to consider the most plausible hypothesis of all - that the biblical account of the resurrection is a legend. My recommendation: read a good book on biblical criticism - you will see that everything is not nearly as cut and dried as McDowell would have you believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent source of reference to the \\" seeker \\"","review":"As a follower of Jesus, I was introduced to this book by a fellow Christian who said that he uses it as an evangelistic tool. After reading it, I can say that I wholeheartedly agree with its use for this purpose. This book was not written to those whose minds are closed, but to those who are truly seeking to find out who Jesus of Nazareth really was. More than a Carpenter is a condensed version of this author's two other more in-depth works, Evidence that Demands a Verdict and A Ready Defense. I am currently reading the latter and give it the same high marks. I plan to always keep a few copies of this highly affordable tool in my suitcase to give to fellow seekers I encounter as I travel. I cannot imagine $4 better spent !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful book","review":"This is a great book for those people who are curious, or those people who are doubting the integrity of their faith.Many people I think have gone through universities or colleges taking religion courses, looking for answers, but the atheist professors all present a very superficial, popularized slog of misconceptions about Christianity and the Bible, giving people the reasons to reject Christianity off-hand but never really looking at Christianity fairly.Josh McDowell had at one time a slew of criticisms of Christianity also, and it was the challenge posed to him to really dig in and critique Christianity thoroughly if he wanted to reject it definitively. What came out of that effort was a changed man, and this book, a small glimpse into what changed him from doubter to believer.Great stuff.Gordon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase!","review":"The Life Of Jesus / More than a CarpenterPurchased the Japanese version of this book and my unsaved Okinawan mother is reading it.

That said, this book fulfills its purpose quite nicely. It offers a reasonable, concise explanation of why Christ might actually have been the person Christians say he was. Of course the book leaves room to question his conclusions, but I don't think McDowell intended this book to be one-stop shopping-- it's size alone is enough to tell a reader that. I didn't read the book expecting that all my questions would be answered and my childhood faith restored. If anything, reading this book helped me to articulate some of the questions that I have and even suggested some new ones.

I keep it at my bedside at night and read it a little at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous Introduction to Apologetics","review":"I reread this book everytime I feel my faith slipping and it has never failed to boost my faith considerably.Drawing from a variety of sources, including his personal experiences, archaeological findings, literary and historical criticism, and the theology of C.S. Lewis, Josh McDowell makes an excellent case that Jesus is more than a carpenter.One of the most delightful and suprising inclusions in this book is the manner in which McDowell blends common sense and circumstantial evidence with historical reliability. He certainly does not prove that Jesus is the Son of God, but any open-minded atheist or agnostic will certainly finish reading this book with a much different perspective on Christianity.All but the most stubborn reader will appreciate that it is just as hard to question Jesus as it is to refute Him."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOLLOW-UP REVIEW","review":"I recently wrote a brief review and have received a number of negative e-mail responses as a result. A complete rebuttal of the arguments in the book is not possible within the limited space provided. In response I would like to recommend two books for anyone with an open mind. They provide a rational analysis of the so called \\"evidence.\\" The first is \\"The Case Against Christianity\\" by Michael Martin. He evaluates the historicity of Jesus and also discusses illogic Christian dogma like salvation. The second book is \\"The Unauthorized Version\\" by Robin Lane Fox (both are available from amazon.com). The latter book covers the entire Bible as well as discussing recent archaeological \\"discoveries.\\"As Jesus said, \\"You will know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless tripe","review":"While I am an atheist, I try to be fair to pro-religious argumentation. Toward this end I will assert for the record that there are some very good defenders of Christianity out there.

This is completely mindless tripe, nothing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"more than a carpenter","review":"This is the greatest book that I have ever read.

Will recommend to all who wish to find proof of the resurrection or even to show them that Christ can change their life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Think there is NO PROOF of Jesus Christ... this is for you","review":"Any scholars who Stand Against Jesus Christ ... if your education level has deceived you about the proof of Jesus Christ, if you are restless in mind and soul on seeking answers...Here is Proof, Not just from Josh McDowell, but he quotes many many other scholars/professors that have come up with the same Evidence!May the PROOF saturate your mind and soul for the SEEKING to continue to the relationship you have never known!Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book using the simplest logic","review":"Using basic human logic McDowell is able to paint a very compelling portrait of the truth of Christianity. I would certainly recommend this book to anyone. It has certainly strengthened my faith. And as MCDowell points out, the gospels have FAR greater evidence for their accuracy than any other piece of historical literature.For the people who are criticizing this book, it is obvious that they either haven't really read it, or they just don't like Christianity and won't let themselves believe even if they come across logical arguements for it.I noticed people criticizing the \\"Liar, Lunatic, or Lord\\" portion of the book saying that McDowell falsely gives only 3 alternatives for a result. THERE CAN ONLY BE THESE THREE! If Jesus claimed to be the son of God, then either he was lying about it, he was nuts (meaning he only thought he was the son of God), or he was telling the truth! Tell me now folks.... what other \\"alternative\\" can there be?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's an example of the faults of McDowell's logic.","review":"I read this book, and I am appalled that anybody would be decieved enough to believe this crap as an exercise of logic. If you would like a demonstration of how badly his arguments work, I'll be happy to show you one. One argument of his that I had a lot of trouble with was his \\"trilemma\\" of Jesus, in which he deduces that since Jesus was not a liar or a lunatic, he must be the Lord. He seems to refuse to believe that there could be more then three options. This argument is about as valid as coming across a mouse, and deciding it must be one of the following three animals: a fish, a cat, or a mouse. Reducing the fish and cat out of the possible categories does not make a mouse a dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the best that modern apologetics can do?","review":"This book has often been recommended to me - admittedly ususally by teenagers and very naive persons - as the 'magic bullet' that will suddenly convince me of the need to become a Born-Again Christian. Unfortunately, the book suffers from the same problem that plagues the equally-highly recommended tomes of C.S. Lewis, namely, it argues logic as far as it can go (not very far,) then takes an enormus leap of faith and expects that you will accept said leap as more logic, or just not notice. This may indeed work on children and the very naive, and on those who were predisposed by childhood training to accept Christianity as favorable, but not on me. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review","review":"I have not yet read the book. It came to me quickly and in great shape. Looking foward to reading it. I am told it is a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"An example of false logic","review":"This book is based on faulty reasoning (not to mention one individual's personal opinion). To say that, because someone is not A (liar), nor B (lunatic), makes him automatically C (Lord) is ludicrous, and insulting to one's intelligence. Whoever said there are only three options, anyway? His ideas are not based on logical reasoning and fact, as he would like his readers to believe, but on religious beliefs. Beliefs cannot be proven - they are taken on faith. Maybe Mr. McDowell should take an introductory logic course before making such bold claims, and presenting them as though they are fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"excrementally horrid evangelical cheerleading","review":"I read the book with an open mind, but found McDowell's argument to be absolutely childish. Supposedly, he began as an atheist and became a Christian after doing a little research and being confronted with overwhelming \\"evidence\\" that Jesus was the \\"Son of God.\\" Truly, I think he must have had a head injury of some sort, because the excrement he presents is not evidence. It's the biggest piece of rubbish I have ever read.

I would call that false advertising, which last time I heard was illegal but it doesn't really matter now because Vince McMahon(who has the common sense to put guys like Flair in main events on Raw and in other great matches on PPV's) owns WCW. Who did WCW always go to when the young guys they tried to give the proverbial \\"push\\" to falied to capitalize on it? I believe the answer is the Nature Boy himself.

At least not as far as good scary horror moments go.However, if you're looking for lots of nudity, this is definitely worth a look.

All the directors involved more or less seemed to be phoning n their work, and even Saxon, the only other credible actor in the cast (the rest seemed like they were in a high-school play), pretty much sleepwalked his lines.

I guess because it was called the \\"Only Bag\\" I expected it to more of an every day bag, but it's a bit too large for every day use. It's more of an overnight bag, which is fine by me.

Some songs do cave in a bit underneath their advanced pop ambitions and do not leave much of a memory when compared to the groups most infectious efforts, but throughout this lengthy release remains a compositional integrity that will do nothing to deter fans from praising the gospel of this uniquely strong voice in rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best album to come out of Australia","review":"Though I am an Aussie, and listen to a lot of Australian bands, I must confess that most of the music is bland and derivative. Even within their native country, Augie March are relatively obscure. They don't deserve to be. Strange Bird, and its predecessor, Sunset Studies, are two of the most brilliant, original, diverse and intelligent records you're likely to hear.This album covers everything from blues, folk and jazz to rock and punk. Glenn Richards' lyrics are outstanding, seemingly steeped in the traditions of Australian poets like Henry Lawson and Banjo Patterson. Even when you don't quite know what they mean, they possess that rare poetic quality. Each song is delicately arranged and surprisingly complex. This album really shows up how restricted and narrow minded the English indie rock scene is - bands like Muse, Radiohead and Elbow would kill for a record like this.This album is a must - even if just for the artwork."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on mind-control around!

Right now it is stuck with a cork on it and the battery is so dead I cannot get the cork off. I had to use a knife to cut the cork off to even put it on the charger. I should have returned it right away, since it has done this from the start. Maybe I got a 'lemon', I don't know, but I am not a happy camper at this point.

The Oster has the advantage over the Rabbit, in that it can be dismantled & cleaned. I got an extra month of use out of it that way. However, after taking it apart & cleaning, I was never able to get the outer shell to properly snap back into place & had a big open gap on the side from then on. When it clogged up again, this time with small cork debris, almost a powder, I decided I'd had enough & tossed it. While the concept is great & initial enjoyment substantial, the fact that none of the units currently on the market can easily be opened for cleaning is a major draw back.

I was also surprised at how tightly I needed to hold the wine bottle - so much so that I often feel I am going to crack the bottleneck. The corkscrew often shreds corks, and this isn't because of our storage, as we store all our wines sideways to keep the corks moist.

The corkscrew pierces the whole length of the cork leaving a big hole end to end of the cork."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best opener ever!","review":"I received this as a Christmas present and used it during the holidays to open about 5 different bottles.

Our wine bottles had synthetic corks and it did the job quickly and easier. Thank you Oster and Amazon. Shirley Dillon"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"This is a campy, cheesy excuse of an item that doesn't work. It usually ruins the cork, so you can't restop your bottle. No serious wine drinker would use this contraption. Don't waste your money, and your respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks cool but not efficient","review":"What a cool looking opener. The problem is that once you get the cork screw into the wine bottle, you have to manually pull the cork out. I thought that the device pulled the cork out for you. I couldn't pull the cork out, had to resort to the manual opener in the drawer. I am sending it back. I wish it were totally automated."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked one time","review":"After contacting manufacture sent me a new one and had same problem. Not enough power to work.. Consumer Report recommended as the best electric wine opener after there vigorous testing the wine gave it rave reviews. Not the first time C.R. gave a excellent review on pure junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sign of Armaggedon?","review":"No insult intended to this particular brand . . . but my household received about three electric wine openers this Christmas, and I have to take it as a sign of the apocolypse. It's a fr@!#in' cork, people! Any adult human uninpaired by carpal tunnel, syndactaly or random thumb amputation should be able to unscrew it from the bottle. For the sake of the future of the human race, listen to the voice of reason, and resign yourself to manual removal."},{"rating":"1","title":"how lazy can you be?","review":"My husband bought this item for me without my permission. One of the simple pleasures I look forward to in life is opening a bottle of wine with an old fashioned corkscrew. Well, not anymore. My husband loves to buy anything with a plug even if it is not necessary and this product is a perfect example of that. This is sort of like if you need to read a book should you buy a laptop and download the book and read it piece by piece, plugging in the computer as you go or should you you just go ahead and READ THE BOOK BY ITSELF? The answer is simple, my friend. Do not graduate to this type of party. Just stick to the old fashioned corkscrew it is not that hard depending upon how many bottles of wine you plan to drink every night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and Easy to Use!","review":"This is the best wine opener! I purchased 2 and I plan on buying more as gifts in the future. You can't beat it for the money. I compared this to some of the more expensive ones and I was concerned that it may not be that good. After reading the positive reviews, I decided to purchase this one and I'm so glad that I did. As silly as it sounds, I was a little confused by the written instructions that came with the opener. When you use it, remove the foil from the bottle, position the opener on top of the bottle with one hand and hold the bottle firmly with your other hand, then press the button in the downward position, keep holding the button until the unit stops, once it stops running, lift the opener and eject the cork by pressing the button in the upward position. It's really easy, it just takes a little practice the first time. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this opener to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oster 4207 Electric Wine Opener doesn't work","review":"My husband and I have both tried the Oster 4207 Electric Wine Opener and it doesn't work. No matter how hard you press down or how soft, it doesn't open the bottle. We end up getting a hand cork screw opener. We have put it at the back of the cabinet and that's where it will probably sit until we get rid of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad - learning needed","review":"So far so good. It is not easy to get a cork out of a bottle so this thing does seem to struggle a bit. You soon find that you need to keep one hand on the bottle and the bottom of the opener and the other on the switch. The only way to control it. Otherwise it tries to pull the plastic case apart. Once we got this down it works fine. Can be unsttleing at first as it grinds away and suddenly the cork is out. Was at a low price so good for what we paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"works for weak hands","review":"Got this for an elderly relative who can't operate a Rabbit or conventional opener. It works like magic, press the down arrow to remove the cork from the bottle, and the up arrow to get the cork back off the corkscrew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wine Opener","review":"This is my second purchase of this. It does a great job of opening corked bottles. Nice design by making the cutter behind and part of the stand. It is sleek looking and the red ball on top gives it a bit of attention.One thing though is it is not robust. I bought my second one after my first one died on me. It was just over a year old. Upon taking it apart I found the culprit to be the motor. But for a small price to pay it is worth buying a new one.Now if they can beef up that motor I would definitely give it 5 stars, but only 4 due to the motor used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I have purchased several of these for gifts, since I absolutely love mine.

I tired to open it with a traditional corkscrew, you know the ones with the \\"wings\\" that are supposed to help you get the cork out when you press down on them? Well, it broke. The corkscrew just broke right off. It was time for me to invest in an automatic one anyways. After some looking, I found this product by Oster. I know my mom has had an Oster food processor for at least 26 years and I do trust the brand. I bought it and 2 days later, thanks to Prime it was on my doorstep.I plugged it in for about 20 minutes to charge and I couldn't contain my excitement any longer. I got that stubborn bottle back out and tried my luck once more. I put the bottle opener on the lip of the bottle and pressed the button.... with ease this opener took that stubborn cork right out of that bottle! I would recommend this to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"It only brings up the cork half way. I am not happy with it.

I like its ease of handling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun tool!","review":"This is a fun tool! The wine opener works most of the time but has trouble with the plastic corks. It is great for anyone who has difficulty opening wine with any of the more traditional cork screws, or someone who may have arthritis or tendonitis in their hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best wine opener","review":"This is unquestionably the easiest and most reliable wine opener I've found. All mechanical devices, including the rabbit, take longer, are more trouble and have a greater chance of destroying a problem cork."},{"rating":"1","title":"Synthetic Cork","review":"The opener worked on normal cork on a bottle of good beer. The cork was already half way out of the bottle, so I think it made it a lot easier, but when I used it on a synthetic cork on a bottle of wine all the way in the neck of the bottle, it woudln't go in straight. After I got the synthetic cork out, I found it pushed to the side. The cork wasn't even on the screw. It had pushed the screw aside and ripped one of the wires out. The screw is not very sturdy or secure. I'm going to go back to a traditonal man-powered win opener. Good ole' steel is better than whaterever connects the screw to the motor in this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work!!","review":"Do not buy: Worked about 6 times and that is it.

And, I have been through two of them that broke in fairly short time. Sadly, another chapter in the \\"all show and little go\\" novella. I had bought an extra thinking it was a great, moderately priced gift for another food and wine lover--but the first one ceased functioning so quickly that I had to use the backup \\"gift\\" extra just for my own use. In rather quick time it stopped working and actually broke a chunk out of the glass neck of a bottle of wine making it risky to even drink it. Ever mindful of not wanting to waste wine, I carefully decanted what was left through cheesecloth into another bottle, but the experience was ruined worrying about little glass shards. Beautiful, yes-on a caliber of looking as if it should be in the Museum of Modern Art. Reliable? ABSOLUTELY NOT. Keep a backup to really work for you if I get it. A huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor Burnt Out in 45 days","review":"I was drawn to all the reviews, however buyer beware.

The screw pierces the cork cleanly and centered. Also, the design is attractive enough, that we don't mind leaving it out and plugged in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good With Older French or Italian Wines","review":"We loved this wine opener for the first few months, using it primarily on California wine 3-4 years old, but found that when we opened bottles of wine with more fragile cork types (French or Italian wines more than 5 years old), it would break the cork in half, causing part of the broken cork up into the device which made it inoperable. With some work, I was able to get the broken pieces out most of the time, but recently had one so badly jammed up in the device I had to take it apart. Unfortunately it wouldn't go back together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I received this as a gift and have since given it to a couple of friends. We are all very happy with it. I am 74 years old, with arthritis and a taste for a good wine. All other corkscrews, even the vaunted rabbits, were hard for me to use. This is so easy, even my hurting hands can deal with it. Works great on regular corks and composite corks; a bit less well with some of the plasticated stoppers. HIghly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oster Electric Wine Opener","review":"This is a horrible product. Received the item, charged it and it didn't work correctly.

By a manual product such as a rabbit, show some effort and move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchase this item now","review":"Over the years, I have spent literally hundreds of dollars on devices designed to make the task of opening wine bottles simple. Two years ago, after my third Rabbit opener died, I decided to try the Oster. It has opened hundreds of bottles of wine in the two years I have owned it flawlessly and with ease. It is simply one of the most effective consumer products I have ever come across. I have since purchased multiple openers for gifts...all recipients report the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe We're Just Inept?","review":"This gizmo simply didn't work for us, and we didn't give up on it easily.It almost never did anything more than halfway extract corks before it would first jam up... and then the motor would stop working. The only time it successfully extracted a soft cork, the cork immediately jammed up inside the gizmo when we tried to eject it... and the motor stopped working.We returned to the Amazon reviews for either empathy or advice, and found both:1. Keep the gizmo and the neck of the bottle perfectly aligned in a straight line.2. Hold the gizmo in one hand and the bottle in the other.3. Extract the cork without twisting or tilting either bottle or gizmo.Didn't work. Even if the gizmo actually managed to extract a cork, inevitably the cork would get jammed up inside the gizmo's neck, and have to be twisted out with a pair of needle nose pliers.Sigh... YMMV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Great until it Broke","review":"Thought this baby was the best thing since sliced bread but it didn't even last a full 30 days and for $20.00 it's not even worth the effort to pack it up to return it.

Had to re-do the corkscrew, 3-4 more times and then had to physically pull the cork out of the bottle by hand when it raised enough. Same problem with the one given as a gift.

I paid $20 for it and it's well worth the money. The first one lasted for years and opened many, many bottles of wine. It's easy to use, although you may have to figure it out or have someone explain it to you the first time or two, but then it's a piece of cake.

It has failed on 6 synthetic and 1 real cork.I guess you just can't beat the \\"Waiter's \\" cork screw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"This product is good, but MAKE SURE its fully charged each time you use it!!The last time my fiance used it, it ran out of juice before getting the cork out.So he tugged and pulled and when he finally got it out, the bottle openersmashed him in the mouth and broke his tooth. We haven't touched it since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Note quite worth it.","review":"It's not a bad purchase, but for an electric opener, isn't faster than the rabbit. If you like options, okay, but if you need to get to your wine quickly...invest in the rabbit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oster Review","review":"We first ordered this product last January. It operated quite well until a couple of months ago, July as I recall, when it failed completely. That, I think, is a very poor track record, 6 or 7 months! Being rather handy with tools, I tried to locate the wiring problem and tracked it down to the circuit board. I could go no further with my quest.Having a wife with minimal hand strength we decided to replace it. I hoped I could find a source for just the bad unit, not the charger or base, but failed.The only reason we reordered was my wife's desire for independence. Except for that, I think this is a poor product given its life expectancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for a while then self-destructed","review":"We had one of these for a while, and it worked. Then one day, the internal mechanism that drives the corkscrewdisintegrated, and, while the motor still worked, the corkscrew no longer did. So it was permanently dead. I giveit two star because it worked for a while and take the rest away because of cheap internal construction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing better than this guy...","review":"What can be faster and reliable to open a good bottle of wine than this guy. This is simply perfect for the cost and the function.Great product and if you get one, be ready to surprise some friends about how easy it is..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works for 1 minute only :(","review":"Yes, it's not a joke. It works only for 1 minute. When I unpacked it, I try to use it. It worked. Then I try to charge it and put it on stand. And nothin happened. I think a red light should appear. But there is no light and tool still is not working for now.I'm completely unsatisfied with the quality of this product and will not recommend it to everyone. Also I'm not from US and I can't return this defect tool back.I don't know how to attach photoes, so just a link to photo proof [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk wine bottle opener","review":"I received it as a Christmas gift and have had it for about 6 weeks and opened exactly 2 out of 20+ bottles correctly. Most of the time it stops before the screw gets all the way into the cork. sometimes it breaks the cork. I have had to revert to the hand type openers most of the time. I keep it in the charger so that cannot be the problem.Oster FPSTBW8207-S Electric Wine Bottle Opener, SilverWhat a hassle. It is now back in the box under the bar sink until I can figure out how to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Advertised!","review":"I bought this item after reading a glowing review in Wine Spectator magazine. I love it. It is low cost, works great, and is very easy to operate, particularly for folks who are challenged by a regular corkscrew. Just hold it vertically on the top of the bottle, hold the bottle steady, push the button and 5-10 seconds later the cork is out of the bottle. Push the other button and 5 seconds later the cork is off the opener. Put it back in the charging stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electric wine bottle opener!","review":"This is an awesome product.I would recommend it to everyone.It takes seconds to open a bottle of wine and no more pinching your fingers!Love it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Wine Bottle Opener","review":"A friend had one and said it was the best one she had used in their group of friends. We got one and loved it. It's so easy to use and holds a charge for several weeks so you don't have to keep the charger on the counter. We even ordered three for Christmas gifts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Update after using for a while...","review":"I love this! It just sits on the counter, ready to go, and is the easiest corkscrew I have ever used. Comes with a great foil cutter, and cork pulling couldn't be easier. Press a button and it's out, press again and the cork is released. You have to have a good grip on the bottle when pulling the cork, but definitely does not need any great strength to handle. I would recommend this item to anyone!This thing worked great for about a year. Then it started getting the cork stuck on it, especially the plastic corks. I had a heck of a time getting the stuck cork out of the gadget. After this happened several times, I stopped using it and went back to a manual corkscrew. Too bad, it was nice while it lasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, just a suggestion","review":"Good product, just a suggestion for improvement. Since it is important to hold the unit perfectly verticle to enable cork removal, and without cork breakage, I would suggest that the light on top indicating charging incoporate a bubble level with crosshairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy!!","review":"I mistakenly believed the other reviews that this was a good product for the cost. It barely is capable of opening a bottle of wine, it does not have enough power even after charging it for days. I used it twice before throwing it away. It's a total piece of junk!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Limited Cork Puller","review":"This battery-operated cork puller is a whiz for fast, effortless cork pulling, but only with natural corks. Multiple attempts with plastic \\"corks\\" didn't work. The screw would not penetrate the dense, platic material."},{"rating":"2","title":"95% of the time - great!","review":"I didn't have high expectations for this opener - didn't think it would replace my Rabbit - but it did!For about 95% of the bottles opened, it does a great job. Fast & easy.A very small percentage of the time, you will find a little cork residue, but it's been very rare for me.The only real problem I've encountered has been with older, crumbling corks. The torque from this opener shreds them as the screw mechanism is fast & powerful. (Because of this it does a great job on synthetic corks.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oster elec. wine opener GREAT","review":"Great - very very reasonable - works easily - read the instructions - no gimmicks. Foil cutter w/storage slot is sharp and quick, easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"The product was delivered quickly and was well packaged, to be fair. I plugged it in for charging and, after a full day, it still couldn't completely remove a cork from a wine bottle (it made about three revolutions before dying). I plugged it in again for another day and still had no luck with trying to open the wine bottle. I contacted Amazon and they immediately issued a refund and sent me a label for returning the item. I purchased the opener, in part, based on the brand name. Based on the disappointing experience with this particular opener, I wasn't inclined to get a replacement and opted for the refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Not Worth the Money","review":"I thought this product looked super cool AND I drink a lot of wine so it seemed perfect. However, there are several issues. First, the product only works on actual \\"cork\\", not plastic \\"corks\\" which are actually more common these days. Second, even if you have a real cork, it takes several tries to get the cork out of the bottle. Certainly not as quick and easy as advertised. A waste of $25."},{"rating":"1","title":"cork screw stinks","review":"This does not work. The screw goes through the cork and into the bottle and does not pull the cork out of the bottle. I have had several people try it and they have had the same result. Stick to a good manual rabbit cork screw opener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Last","review":"I was so excited about this product in the beginning. After two weeks it suddenly stopped working. Don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short-lived love affair","review":"Loved it for the first two months, used it frequently. Even in its dormant state it was a great conversation starter. Then it stopped working; it would screw all the way down into the cork and then halt. I let the battery drain, charged it fully and tried again. Same problem. I tossed it because for $20 I was not willing to navigate customer service, package the item, stand in line at USPS and ship it back. So I cut my losses. Total waste of money unless you're looking for a not particularly attractive countertop sculpture."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap feel, not strong enough, won't hold charge","review":"Took a chance on this and I am not pleased. This looks okay from a distance, but up close, it has a cheap, plastic, light feel. After the first full charge, it removed a couple of corks okay. Then, even when fully charged, it did not have the power to pull a cork even halfway out. I would stay away from this product. It failed after the return window so now I'm stuck with it. Buying a new lever-action corkscrew now and will be done with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is a review of my SECOND Oster Electric Wine Bottle Opener. I ordered it when the first one died after about 6 months. After leaving this one charging overnight, I attampted to use it. It never seemed as if had enough charge. The motor sounds very labored and slow. It never occurred to me that the item would be lousy, and I threw out the box and packaging as soon as I connected it. That was a mistake. Otherwise I would have returned it. So, I have ordered a more durable (albeit more expensive) model from another company and it works fine. If you absolutely MUST buy this one, at least save the box because you will definitely end up returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Best wine opener ever.

It works great. I only had a problem. Try opening a bottle of Portuguese wine called Mateus. The cork of this bottle is smaller than normal. At the time of uncork, the cork was trapped in the bottom of the Wine Bottle Opener. LOL! I had to carve the cork with scissors and activate the reverse of the Wine Bottle Opener to pull the cork. So be careful when opening bottles with corks smaller than normal.Here a picture of the bottle: [...]. Note that the bottle neck is thinner than normal ... thats why the cork is smaller than normal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"This thing is worthless!! Whoever wrote the reviews, that I based my purchase on, are clearly mistaken about the product. It will not stay charged no matter how long, days, weeks, on the charger!

Now even my wife can open a bottle! It worths every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"I bought this when the price dipped to 8.50 and it was worth every cent. It makes it so easy to open a bottle... too easy. Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wine bottle automatic cork puller","review":"The wine opener worked right out of the box. The modern design is suitable to have exposed in a kitchen or wine bar, where it is immediately available. The cork pulls uniformly out of the bottle and the opener then ejects the cork from its cavity easily. The small hands of my wife can easily handle the cork pull process and its the first puller that we've had where I can say that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another throw away","review":"This product worked fine for about 12 to 18 months----now it no longer holds charge and we must add it to the landfills. I think it is designed to croak in a short time frame so you can replace it (since it is inexpensive) Not what you call environmentally friendly. Would not buy another one because of its short life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electric wine bottle opener","review":"This is the most efficient wine bottle opener yet. Easy to use and quick. Love it.

Likewise, I am so glad that I purchased this item for my sister and myself. Thanks Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out....","review":"We got this opener about a month ago. It worked great. It is intuitive and easy to use. And it looks great.But, tonight I tried to open a bottle and the cork broke off 1/2 way in the opener. No amount of 'unscrewing' and prying the broken cork would get it out. So, the next step was to 'disassemble' the unit. That worked. But, I found the unit impossible to put together again. Ultimately, the motor would retract but not extract the cork screw. grrrrrIt would have been great if there was a little door next to the cork screw that could be unit to assist in removing broken corks.I guess this explains why restaurants don't use 'gadgets' like this.Now the unit is in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 4 months of use","review":"This worked great at first, but after 4 months it's stopped working. Now it just chews up the cork, splits it in half, and won't extract. Turns out the cork screw is loose inside the unit, but after taking it apart, we realized it's not possible to fix. I would not recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"wine bottle opener","review":"this is the easiest, best way to open wine bottles...ever!!

It's a great gift!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest invention since the light bulb","review":"This is the greatest invention of all time. We indulge in a nice glass of wine almost daily and are totally in love with our electric corkscrew. If the house were burning down this is what we would dash back in through the flames to save."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ready for prime time","review":"I purchased this from another source before it was offered on Amazon. While the concept is good, the execution leaves much to be desired. The first problem is that the opener is not powerful enough to reliably remove plastic corks, which are becoming more and more prevalent. Problem two is that the battery/charger combination is obviously old technology with the attendant long charge times and short charge life. Third is that this appliance takes up and inordinant amount of counter real estate given its limited purpose.Try the Screwpull S1115-31 Pocket Corkscrew manual tool. It works as advertised on all corks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Occasional opener","review":"I have only used this unit a couple of times and on both occasions it only pulled the cork out half way even trying twice; I had to go back to my mechanical one to get it the rest of the way out. I volunteer at wine tasting events on occasion and thougth it might be a show-off tool but I think not in this case. The metal cutter works great and will be in my pocket for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO Great!!","review":"Oh, how I love this product!!! I received it as a gift, so I didn't really have any expectations when I opened it to try it out...but OMG!!! If you open wine often (as I do) there's no way you can't find the Oster to be AMAZING!!! It really does open bottles-just hit the \\"up\\" arrow and it takes the corks right out....in like, 30 seconds, no less! Then, hit the down arrow to make it give the cork right back to you-even quicker! With NO damage-you can place it right back to stopper the open bottle.To be honest, I can't believe this only costs $20-it is amazing and I love love LOVE it-and you will too!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift Idea!","review":"I have bought several of these to give as gifts. I bought one for my self and use it regularly. It's easy to use and beats a regular corkscrew any day of the week. I had mine for about a year and it looks and works just as good as the day I bought it. Buying some more this Christmas to give as gifts again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great but leaves cork residue in wine","review":"We love the wine opener but it always leaves cork residue in the wine bottle. It is because the cork screw goes completely through the cork and then pieces of the cork fall into the wine. It needs a re-design so that the cork screw stops just short of the end of the cork.Looking for a new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome wine opener","review":"This is a fantastic product at this price! I work for a winery and have seen them all. My staff fights over the one I bought. This is the best opener for multi-bottle openings, and looks great on a counter (looks kinda like a large electric toothbrush). It will open at least 30 bottles on one charge, and is extremely easy to use. Then it sits on the charger waiting for the next party. I highly recommend this product - a great gift for your wine loving friends and family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable","review":"Worked great for 2 weeks.

Sleek looking for those that may want to leave it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken after two years of light use","review":"I bought this as a less-expensive, more high-tech alternative to pricey rabbit-style corkscrews. Unfortunately, the product takes longer to fully extract and release each cork than I would have thought, especially compared to a rabbit. It worked fine for the first two years, though, opening just two to four bottles a month. A couple of weeks ago, without warning, it started making a heavy ratcheting sound -- even though I was exerting no more pressure than normal and was pulling a conventional cork (not one of those fool plastic things). This evening, the ratcheting led to a full-blown \\"crack!\\" -- and that was all she wrote. Would appreciate any suggestions on a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couple months and not pleased","review":"Ugh. Loved it at first and then now, it is doesn't work. It won't complete the process to get the cork out. Had to get a hand corker to replace what I thought would be a great product. Oh well. Maybe someone will make a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at first...","review":"Received this as a christmas present.

It's only $12, but it's not worth that.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have read the fine print","review":"This might work as advertised on \\"cork\\" corks. They do tell you that it may not work on \\"plastic\\" corks.It doesn't at all. Today most bottles of wine $10-$15 seem to have the non-cork cork. So unless you drink 1st tier wine it is useless. If you can afford 1st tier, let the butler open the bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw away after a dozen uses","review":"We had the same result. After a month and less than a dozen openings we heard a load crack and the plastic base of the corkscrew snapped with no repair. They should use metal! Divide that by the cost results in a dollar per open before a throwaway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This was my second Oster wine opener and my third electric one in less then a year,The first one lasted three month and this one stopped working on the second bottle.

It does take up some counter space, but I only plug it in and charge it once in awhile. Does not need to remain on charge, so you can keep the charger in a drawer. Great gift to give too!!!

Apparently there is no way to replace the teflon-coated corkscrew. Oster provides no instructions or any means to replace this part. On manual wine openers, this part is replaceable. On the Oster it is not. I guess the only option is to toss it away, eat the cost and return to your manual cork puller. It was great while it lasted, which isn't long if you drink wine every night as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Very convenient, easy to use, clean looking, plug it in- charge- and use.

As far as ease and speed of use, I think the Oster is a big improvement over waiter and twist corkscrews but not any better overall than a good rabbit-style manual opener.

I was extremely impressed with the first rate acting of James Black, Jennifer Lee, and Angelle Brooks. These actors WERE the characters and were very convincing in their roles. I mostly enjoyed the snappy lines and the soundtrack wasn't too bad either. This is definitely an adult film with mature themes, but it gives you something to think about - mainly the consequences of one's actions. I thoroughly enjoyed Cappuccino and must add the fact that Eric Jerome Dickey wrote this film makes it even more impressive. Last but not least - remember the name Craig Ross, Jr. - He directed the movie and did a fantastic job. Hey Everybody! Believe the hype and rent or buy this movie ASAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have used a little something","review":"I bought this one for a course. It is the only translation at this time of King Rother in English. I have not compared the translation with the original Middle High German but it has been translated into rhyming couplets which must be its original form. One hundred and seven pages of rhyming couplets gets a bit wearisome at times and I think some footnotes, a glossary or an essay or two on the text would have filled out this volume nicely. If you are looking at this review at all, you are probably not someone looking casually for Medieval texts to read for fun. It is a little known piece of work, that draws in a bit of the Dietrichs epics and tries to invent a great pedigree for Charlemagne. It is not called an epic but a 'bridal quest' story. Some parts remind me of the Iliad which is the ultimate 'woman-stealing' story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I bought this machine (in white) a week ago, and I have used it every day since then. I just love it. The machine works so effortless, quick, and elegant. It's such a joy to use it. The blade is super sharp and chops and blends everything very nicely. The two discs that come with it are heavy duty quality and work great. I love the extra large feeding tube. I haven't used the dough blade, so I can't say anything about that. Besides making food preparation fun, the machine also looks very nice and doesn't take up a lot of counter space. All the parts clean up quickly under warm running water. I am so pleased with this machine. I went to the store with the firm resolution to buy the Kitchenaid food processor, but I changed my mind when I compared it to the Cuisinart. I think this machine will serve me well in the years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gigantic Disappointment","review":"Thought for years, I was missing something by not having a Cuisinart! What a laugh. In the few months I have had this unit, two pusher assemblies have cracked and broken. I did read the manual from cover to cover and watched the video prior to using. This is an obvious design defect. Guess I was lucky, in that first replacement was made without a hassle or having to return anything.

Sadly, I discarded the old unit (the Lexan bowl had cracked) before fully testing the new unit. The first item I prepared was a small brioche dough. The unit leaked badly under the blade, and that part of the bowl was extremely difficult to clean. The next item I tried to prepare was a cold soup. I filled it to just under the marked fill line and water gushed out of the top when the liquid started to spin. I have just spoken with Cuisinart customer service. Both of these problems are normal with the unit. The maximum liquid that one can process is two cups! My small brioche dough was also too large. and it is normal for some dough to leak out under the blade. Needless to say, my old Cuisinart processor did not have either of these problems. This unit is fine for grating or slicing vegetables, or cheese, but not much else. Such a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why I didn't order this model","review":"After reading the review about customer service problems (and from other ratings sources), I decided to go with the Kitchenaid Professional 11 c. food processor.

Go back to the good old days when shows could be clever, when good writing kept an audience rivited with humor or mystery or romance and they didn't need graphic displays of sex or violence to do it. These three episodes of Maverick were so funny I could not stop laughing even after rewatching them several times.

And it was cute too! A week after I got this stroller, we were at the beach on the vacation that I purchased this stroller for, when the front wheel fell off. I checked to make sure I had put it on correctly and I had. This happens all the time and so I never use the stroller. I was very disappointed, I should have followed up and had them replace it but I hate sending things back and had already thrown away all my information and packaging. Bummed."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"Love this stroller. The handles make it so much more comfortable to push. My girls; 2 and 5, fight over who gets to sit in the pink stroller. No underneath storage which was a bummer. But is great as an everdayday light weight stoller or as a back up. We bought it for our 5 year old when she got tired of walking around the amusement parks. Husband not to keen on the color or to be seen pushing a pink stroller, but oh well thats what happens when you have all girls. Definetly would recommend it, both of my strollers are by Jeep and I love them both."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this stroller","review":"I previously purchased one of the cheaper umbrella strollers before I purchased the jeep stroller. What a difference!! The Jeep stroller is a much smoother ride and much easier to push!!! (Especially over not so smooth surfaces) Almost as if it has a set of shocks on it. I love this stroller and would recommend it to anyone. It is worth paying the extra money for this one rather than the cheaper umbrella strollers. The stroller was very easy to put together it took about 15 mins. I have had this stroller for about a year now and still is in excellent shape!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stroller","review":"My daughter wouldn't get out of the stroller the night we put it together. She loved it. My husband and I thought it didn't seem wide enough, even though my 20 month old is rather tall and thin she just fits in it, but it didnt' bother her. I love how the shade is removable and my husband loves all the removable pockets. He puts her water and diapers in it when he takes her on walks.The stroller is strong and durable and the price was just what I was looking for. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! though a bit narrow...","review":"I just assembled the stroller today, which was very easy.

It is very light and has just enough pockets to hold a few diapers and wipes along with a few toys on the other side. The cup holder on top is a nice addition too. It is very easy to manage and fits perfectly in my wife's trunk, taking up very little space. My only real complaint is the canopy. It is undersized and flimsy. The only way it blocks the sun is if it is directly overhead at noon. Otherwise, the canopy is pretty much useless because the sun is always in our little girls' eyes. All in all, I'd recommend this due to enough features and easy of use to overcome the canopy issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Folks listen up! It's an umbrella stroller. It's $30. It's great. I honestly don't know what some people are expecting. This stroller will not cure world hunger or world peace, nor will it get our troops out of Iraq any faster.

Love the padded handles, (I wish there was a bag or basket for better storage-my only complaint)It even reclines, I absolutley love it. It folds very easily, fits in my trunk easily (I have an E-class Mercedes, hardly any trunk space)And it's not even too pink, if you take the sun shade down it's just on the trim.Definitley worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hazardous Front Wheels","review":"The stroller is light weight and pretty to look at.

If you are looking for one just to run around with instead of the bulky big strollers then this is a good choice.

She wants to sit in it to watch tv, take walks or to put her dolls in it. The light weight makes it easy to take and use in more places for me. This helps with my back problems since I am more likely to have a stoller with me now. It is easy to open, shut and lock. I do wish that it had a place to hang or store a smaller baby bag though. I also like that the ride is smooth for Victoria and she has the option to reclined or sit upright. The large padded hand grips help to have more control and comfort with the stroller also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent series","review":"My daughter has enjoyed all of the books in this series since she was about a year old.

It sounds trite to my ears, though, so I prefer to leave it. The author's got a tin ear when it comes to rhythm, nothing seems to scan right.The really bad part about these books is that they're cheaply made. I've had them fall apart on me while other books that we've had longer and that we read more often are in great shape.You can't have a poor-quality board book, it just doesn't work. I can't in good conscience recommend these books until that little problem is fixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book in a great series","review":"Bought this book for my 3 year old daughter after she LOVED the Van Gogh book in this series.

It was very informative, and I couldn't put the book down. The author spoke through a pilot's perspective and let the reader feel every moment of the disaster. The details and aviation terms were explained fully by the author to let you understand them. The book explained why air safety is not at its upmost.

It is a definite 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book by a courageous pilot","review":"The book is filled with accurate information about how the politics at the FAA is once again responsible for unnecessary deaths of innocent, trusting passengers and crew. That is an old, recurring story about that worthless bureaucracy known as the FAA.The one negative review above was obviously written by an ALPA pilot, who hates Fredrick because his book also criticizes ALPA for putting its self-interest political agendas before safety, as it has always done.I am grateful that Stephen Fredrick had the courage to put his concern for safety of the passengers, above the politically correct loyalty, which unions like ALPA demand from their members."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pilot At \\"Authors\\" Airline Speaks Out - Don't Buy This Book","review":"As a pilot at the airlne when Mr. Fredrick used to work, and someone that knew three of the crewmembers in the crash of 4184, I find it revolting that he used this disaster to make a name for himself. He even tried to be a \\"star\\" at the NTSB hearings on the crash at Indianopolis.Also, I happened to see a multi-page letter that Mr. Fredrick wrote to the pilots union following the crash. He couldn't even write coherent paragraphs, let alone a book. This book has to be ghost-written.Also, if Mr. Fredrick was so wary of the ATR aircraft, why did he continue to fly the airplane at American Eagle even after the 4184 crash.Don't waste you time with this book.

They are medium quality (to me) towels and they do the job. They are larger than the old Target towels we wore out.

You can stop on every page and the words will paint pictures in your mind. I was thrilled to find this book available again, and in hardcover. My 1940 edition is getting pretty fragile.

He uses different language combinations and different quotations of other authors. So, his model is obvious, but he's a bad epigone. This book has no plot, no plan and misses the basic art of writing: it reproduces feelings, instead of arousing them.One should read a comment by another Nobel Prize winner, Naguib Mahfouz, in 'Adrift on the Nile', where he punches Beckett KO: life could be absurd, but not the royalties.I consider the work of Samuel Beckett as grossly overrated. A good play is 'Waiting for Godot', which is in fact an evocation of people who didn't understand the words of Nietzsche's Zarathustra 'God is dead'.

The tops of cans can be easily contaminated - from mice in your home to contamination caused in transit from something spilling onto the lid.

After about a month it started doing the same thing. I heard somewhere that it does not work on a certain brand of cans. I do use a lot of this brand but if it will not work on all my cans I need something different. I just contacted Tupperware directly and they told me they could not do anything for me because it was over 1 year since I purchased it. I don't feel they have very good customer service.

Big Mistake: The flat taste of these particular flatbreads do not compare with the Seedlander, so the first bite told me I made a mistake in ordering them. But Amazon has been so generous in dealing with other issues, I decided to eat humble pie (crackers) and just quietly finish them up with soups or smothered in Almond Butter. Once and awhile treating myself to a bite of the seedlander bite size crackers product which we also ordered and were available at time of purchase. 5 STARS for AMAZON maybe a one star for the Seeded Spelt.

Additionally, they were shipped and arrived expired. If you are shopping for a super-healthy cracker, this may be it.

Young children are mainly looking at the pictures and this book didn't have good pictures that really illustrated what the book was trying to say. I would recommend with book for first graders maybe, but not kids younger then that.

I would say the size is pretty true to fit. The 8.5 were pretty big for my 2/12 year old. She isn't wearing them much since they are a little too big in size, and they go high up in the leg so it's hard for her to walk.

Of course it has a crumb tray below. Of course you can select the brownness you prefer. Of course you can cancel the toasting operation whenever you choose. Isn't that the essence of a good toaster?

I love the concept; the heating elements moves to adjust themselves to the bagel, toast, pizza, whathaveyou... the catch is the thing is dumb as a post. Put in a bagel or bread and you never know how it is going to come out of the toaster. Setting it on 3 may yield tan or black toast... so if you set it to one, you get warm bread... hit it again on one and the bread turns dark brown.This really stinks for me, because I was pretty excited to get it home. My other toaster was with me for 15 years. I pulled it out of the trash and toasted my bagel with it this morning, that is how much this one stinks.P.S. It does do an outstanding job of warming cold pizza to near original quality!!

One or the other would burn out after a few months. I had bought extended service and on the 3rd replacement I was upgraded to the CPT35. It had heating wires and was more reliable. I also have the buzzing problem others mention. What happens is that the wire clip on one side overheats and fatigues. I re-crimped it several times then finally replaced it.

It worked great for us; loved the big slot for bagels, etc. Then the other day, about 5 months after we bought it, the cancel button/pop-up mechanism burned out with a big blue spark while the toaster was on. Now it turns on but won't turn off, unless you push the lever up. I, too, am disgusted by the terms of the \\"warranty,\\" which require that the customer pay the freight both ways for replacement. That adds up to about half of the $30.00 we paid for the toaster.

We were able to look at pictures of the fetus/baby and she knew immediately what it was, but I was able to talk about how it grows, how it has little fingernails, how it will look when it's born. There are two side-by-side stories, one more factual and one from an older sister's POV, and some of the pictures are of the mom and older sister together, so we were able to talk about feelings that older sisters might have ('Do you think Mary looks excited? Are you excited?' etc).

Surely this is not an action cheapie, and as such deserves better treatment than Artisan is putting out.If you don't care about format, ignore my review. If you do care, I suggest that you be careful buying any Artisan DVDs, as they are releasing loads of P & S titles these days.Would someone in authority please advise Artisan to raise their price point and release these films in a double-sided disc offering both formats, a la Warner Brothers?"},{"rating":"2","title":"John Hurt's finest","review":"John Hurt is the star here, a polished professional hit man without emotions . . . until things start to come apart. Saddled with a smartass punk assistant, Hurt is assigned to hit a stool pidgeon who turns out to be amateur philosopher, facing death with equanamity. As the job goes from bad to worse, turning into a kind of road trip from hell, Hurt resigns himself to a sort of passivity, accepting situations that madden him, relinquishing control of himself in a state of detachment that is troubling to see. You almost want him to kill all these people and regain his deportment, rather than accept one insult after another to his dignity as a professional.Hurt is perfect in the role, and the supporting cast make up an excellent ensemble, of sorts. The hero is doomed of course, but the journey to the end is well worth the trip. Outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five-star movie gets One-star DVD treatment","review":"Stephen Frears' near-brilliant comedy/drama is one of the most under-rated films of all time.

I was left to scramble to find and sharpen another knife to get the job done while guests were waiting and the bird was getting cold. Very exasperating and embarrassing.

I used this knife for the first time last evening and half way through carving a large stand up rib roast the blades stopped working and the motor kept running.Upon inspection, I found that a plastic gear connected to a steel worm gear had stripped. I can't believe some idiot designer would combine a critical steel gear with a plastic one; the unit was doomed from the start. Cuisinart, which made a name for itself by producing quality products certainly has fallen into shoddy manufacturing.I would recommend this item only to those who want to cut pudding, anything harder is bound to destroy this flimsily constructed product.

It did bog down under large cuts of meat - holiday ham - but a proper carving knife works much better.My main complaint though is the same one other reviewers have noted: a poorly designed switch.

I wrote Cuisinart who responded that they received my letter but offered no compensation, advice or replacement. In addition, the \\"ergonomic\\" handle is only ergonomic to people with hands as large as a football player's.

The little safety button stopped doing its job about a year ago and the whole tirgger part of the switch eventually fell out of the unit, along with some little plastic pieces that appear to have made up some kind of catch that held the trigger in place. Since it looks like the pieces are broken broken off of the plastic housing, it doen's look like it's fixable.In terms of how it worked, this design deserves 5 stars. In terms of its durability . . . well let's just say that it isn't in the same league as my mother-in-law's Montgomery Ward branded knife that is older than my wife (40+ just don't tell her I said that) and works like it's brand new."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I am disappointed in the limited performance of this product, particularly given the great reputation of this manufacturer of other quality appliances.

The Cuisinart makes 3 times the noise of the Hamilton and the handle becomes very hot to the touch after 3 - 4 minutes of use. It does not cut any better than the Hamilton Beach model 74250. I called Cuisnart about this product and they themselves acknowledged that the product is very noisy and that the motor gets very hot. Save yourself some money and buy the Hamilton Beach knife. There are coupons availble at Bed Bath and Beyond for $5 which brings the cost down to $14.99. For that price, if it fails, you can throw it away and buy a new one.

I just thought it was a quirk, so I ignored it, and continued to use it. As time went on, it became more difficult, and some times would work and others would not.Today however, I was going to slice homemade bread, and the trigger just popped completely off, and was not able to get it back on, so it went in the trash.Will NOT get another Cuisinart knife!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worked nice until","review":"I maybe used this knife 10 times and kept it stored in the box it came in.

We used it less than ten times before it failed to turn on. It was outside the warranty period so an engineering friend said he take it it apart (the housing is plastic) to see just what the problem was. Since I was going to throw it out, I didn't mind that he had to actually break the housing to get into the mechanics and I was curious to see what was inside. The inner workings are so cheap and poorly engineered that I am not surprised it failed. I paid over $50 for the knife at Costco so definitely feel Cuisinart is ripping the customer off. I guess quality control is almost non-existent these days and it is all about the enormous mark up.

After about two years of very light service, the trigger started failing to start the knife action. I tried everything to correct the electrical problem.

This is because the author does not go off on a tangent explaining a word like Lemony Snicket does. My child didn't care about looking up the words, but as an adult wanting to enlarge my vocabulary, I looked them up. They were adjectives.Another warning to parents listening to this book, you have to pay attention. This is not a book to skim. This is a book with lots of wonderful detail that you need to pay attention to. Thus if a child is having trouble following a character, it is because they are not reading the story closely. The author doesn't repeat and that makes this book excellent. It is a book you think about later. It would be a good movie.We eagerly await a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure, unimaginable BOREDOM!","review":"This book has about one or two mildly interesting parts, but it reminds me too much on Jumanji.

Earl Shorris has the courage and insight to expose the salesman in us all. I find his line on page 268--\\"To do this (selling) successfully the saleman has to follow the disciplines of his calling: Primarily, he cannot make judgements\\"--a key point in his book. Although I think it is too harsh to call a salesman a \\"serpent\\", I agree with the author that if all we do is just to sell without regard to how we truly feel about what it is that we are selling, we will be living a lonely and meaningless life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"Written just before the Web was spun, this book is an apologia for a life in sales, arguing that our politics and culture is manipulated by salesmen for short term profit.

Unless I've missed something, there are only two routes to getting what you want -- taking or asking. Taking implies force (the stick). Asking implies sales (the carrot). Shorris would have us to believe that we should march evolution backwards and start using the stick again. Shorris obviously feels guilt by his salesmanship and has a need to atone for past behavior. Rather than write a book, he should seek out a psychologist.

Some of the tracks are twee (Tears on My Pillow), some are 100% pure pop magic (Hand on My Heart) whilst some are embedded in the gay psyche forever as Mardi Gras and dance floor classics (Better the Devil You Know).All in all a great retrospective for those who have followed her career for ages and a great recap for those new fans who found Light Years and Fever. Shame about PWLs [...] marketing tactics and the [...] cover. This CD is available in a 1992 original version without the remixes in Australia. Unless you want the remixes buy that version.

As a person who is allergic to most perfumes, etc., this one has been one that I can not only enjoy, but also wear without suffering. In the past two years, first a granddaughter, and then one of my daughters has called me with the question, \\"What is the name of that wonderful rose perfume you always wore? I remember it still and it always made me feel like so relaxed and as if I were in a garden.\\" I was happy to locate it and send it to each of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very artificial smell- disappointing","review":"I thought the reviews for this product sounded good and it was inexpensive.

At first it smells like roses, then like cat pee. Yuck. I've tried it several times to make sure that it was not just a weird fluke, and it really does remind me of cat pee. It is like one of the low notes in the perfume smells like ammonia. I also don't think it is just that the fragrance does not mix with my body chemistry, because it does the same thing on clothes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wife's Favorite Scent","review":"If you like roses, this is the scent for you. It is not overpowering, but lasts all day. She puts it on, a couple of spritzes in the morning and I still can smell it on her skin that night.

My mother told me that she wore the \\"original\\" Perfumers Workshop Tea Rose.After receiving this product I can only surmise that either this is not the \\"original\\", is a different Perfumers Workshop, or they have changed their formula.This smells very artificial, almost plastic-y. When you spray it on your arm, the scent is completely gone in an hour or so (probably good in this case).Fortunately it was not an expensive product, so it wasn't a great loss.

SMELLS CHEAP","review":"It certainly smells like roses but its overpowering and far too strong. Higher quality perfumes tend to be more subtle and this was more like a room spray with spicy undertones. I read some of the other negative reviews and they claim this EDT smells different than the perfume, so perhaps this is why there are so many positive reviews. It doesn't smell as bad as other cheap perfumes because the smell of alcohol is faint, but its not a pleasant smell and the lack of the alcohol scent was its only strong point, even the bottle looks cheap. I ended up giving mine away to a thrift store. I have found other perfumes under $20 that smell like higher quality perfumes but this wasn't one of them. Don't make the same mistake as me and buy it based on reviews. Smell this before you buy it to make sure you like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful wordless book","review":"My daughter loves to read this book before bedtime.

And while you listen to Valerie Sim partaking of her experiences with clarity and a great inventiveness, you receive insights as to how develop your own tentative methods. V.

Will you be totally overwhelmed by a wealth of breathtaking unreleased music? Probably not. It all depends on how much you've heard already. If you're not familiar with some of Hendrix's more obscure, or later work, this set is a godsend and if you have 50 dollars to spend I'd waste no time picking it up. If you're a total Hendrix nerd with bootlegs out the ears then I wouldn't be so sure but then again you're obligated to buy everything with his name on it right? Basically, good job Experience Hendrix and keep up the good work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Me a Break","review":"This box set is a mixed bag of live material, much of it re-released, and unreleased studio material. The studio material, while providing some insight into Hendrix' creative process, is primarily composed of unfinished demos of works-in-progress, and does not hold a candle to the finished studio works. All in all, this is among the least impressive material ever released in Hendrix' name. It still blows away most new music."},{"rating":"1","title":"purple fraud","review":"what a shame, w/ the promo & great looking cover, i was expecting some more from the master.

I could not believe my ears when I heard these versions of the songs I've loved for years. Jimi was an artist, every note that comes off the guitar is poetry. Best song on the album Disc 2, Track 7, Bold as Love!!!!! I listen to it at least twice everyday. No words, just music...If I haven't convinced you, read the other reviews..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Find me a better Boxset for the price, I dare you.","review":"Some of songs on this boxset are the best versions you'll ever find. Put all 4 discs in a CD changer, let em play, and get your mind blown. Some instrumental only songs are absolutely mesmerizing. My personal favorite is Cherokee Mist, a song that shows the true mastery of Jimi's guitar playing. He is one with his guitar, allowing the soulful, powerfully moving music in his head to come through beautifully to those blessed enough to hear him play.With that said, I would recommend this to someone just getting into Hendrix, or even someone who had never listened to him before (shame on you). I purchased a best of Hendrix when I first started listening to him, but this boxset really had me hooked. I bought every single studio release by Hendrix shortly after, and later added any rarity i could find. You'd do the same if you heard the incredible range and intensity displayed on this boxset.Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"a tonne of music","review":"I am writing this review based on the VINYL box set, not the CD box set. . . although i think they have exactly the same songs, the presentation is different.I bought it on vinyl about three years ago and was blown away with how good the presentation was, with a nice felt cover/ purple colour, and a booklet inside with lovely large scale images of the man and more information on the recordings.My favourite track is the unedited 3rd Stone with Chas Chandler and Jimi laughing a lot in the intro....its nothing new though, it was on previous recordings and I am sure there are many tracks in this box set that have been issued before....but there are also some that I have never heard........personally if i wanted to lsiten to Jimi I would put on electric ladyland album pretty much everytime.......but this box set for me was a total bonus and something that i will cherish forever after."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hendrix is AWESOME!!!! 10 stars!!!","review":"The music of the Jimi Hendrix Experience sounds as fresh today as it did in the sixties. The guitar mastery of Jimi is unparalleled. I loved all the remakes on these CDs especially Sgt Pepper. The sound quality of the cds is precise and clear. And from what I have read, this box set is only the tip of the iceberg because the Hendrix family have tons more of unreleased tunes. I never tire of listening to the Experience and hopefully never will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"There's really nothing I can say about this release except that it's 4 discs worth of Jimi! What else is there to say? No one was a better live performer (half the songs are live performances) and no one else in history that I can think of squeezed out so many classic and breathtakingly original tunes in such a small span of time (3 and a half years). It's all here, live performances, alternate studio takes (hey joe is great!) and of course the never heard before songs which are worth the price by themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimi boxed","review":"Fabulous four disc set.

This box set, sanctioned byt the Hendrix estate, is amazing. New takes (never before released) and previus cuts come through with amazing clarity and style. Even today more than 30 years after his passing his music proves that he still lives in the hearts of all music fans.

You would think since the tests are engineered by Microsoft you could at least depend on them providing sufficient study material, especially for the price the set goes for. This is not the case. There are enough holes in the information provided for you to drive a semi through and never get near the sides.

Ironically alot of the material on the test is not even grazed in these books. The Networking essentials doesn't even cover 30% of the material that you are actually tested on.

From what I did read, the information provided seems relatively well organized and informative. There is a caveat.If you're thinking about buying this training kit because it contains an evaluation copy of NT (like I did) I would STRONGLY suggest that you make sure your system can run NT Server.

First I failed after studying these books and then I passed using a few others. Mind you these books do in fact cover almost everything, which would be great if you could take the books with you for the tests. Unfortunately, the amount of useless (non test related) information is so large you windup remembering all the needless information.

What makes this movie a classic is the first hour where Otto, fed up with his life, finds his way into becoming a RepoMan. The dialogue of the \\"Repo Code\\" and the soundtrack (\\"doo-bee do wa wa say what yeah?\\") put this film into a class by itself.

There is an intertwined plot about seeking alien life forms. The punk rock soundtrack is excellent and perfect for this movie. While the actors are talented and likable, an A grade cast and a better conclusion could have easily propelled this film into movie greatness."},{"rating":"2","title":"...NO CHRISTIANS EITHER!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie is funny, intelligent and BENT! This combination is what makes it a true classic. It's not for everyone, women don't seem to like it, but it's a unique little masterpiece. Read the other reviews for a plot summary. For those who said this is Emilio Estevez's best movie, I agree. It's also the biggest step away from conventional roles he ever took. Harry Dean Stanton steals the show though. He's the reason (along with the sight gags and other humorous weirdness, including the one liners) to see this movie, both once and repeatedly. Remember: A Repo Man's got all night, every night... P.S. 'Maximum Overdrive' sucked-I think Stephen King even apologized for it--"},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Video Didn't Work, Can't Find Another Way to Complain","review":"So instead, I'm forced to write a negative review.

The film, although quirky and periodically engrossing, is badly made and cobbled together with acting styles ranging from frenetic (the indistinguishable punk figures) to somnambulistic (Estevez). Most of the figures in 'Repo Man' are grating, none are memorable. A little of this watchable mess does- granted- go a long way, especially for eighties fringe culture enthusiasts.The DvD release's picture quality is acceptible, the sound quality is awful, muddy.

I wish I had known this before my purchase.Wait until they issue a version with both the theater and TV versions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"Missed the mark badly. Deleted scenes would have been great. Problem is, a track called \\"The Missing Scenes\\" takes the strangeness out of the movie and reproduces it in an interview with the inventor of the neutron bomb and chops the deleted scenes up, mixes them up and misses a few for good measure. The transfer and audio is not sufficiently good enough to warrant buying this edition over some other edition. Buy the cheapest one available, skip this one. Focus Features-don't treat us like freaks! Some of us just want plain, run of the mill deleted scenes without the crap you like to splatter all over. There are fans who aren't rabid cultish fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD is NOT the mellonfarmer version","review":"Despite the excellent quality of this DVD (typically excellent Anchor Bay production values), this version of the film is sadly the edited one: the scene where Bud cons Otto into signing the Malibu over to him is missing as is the bit where Duke says 'have a nice day...night...day'. I haven't watched my old taped from the TV version for some time, but I have the feeling Miller's lines are trimmed a tad also.However, the film remains unmissable in this widescreen version and the sound is particularly excellent (Iggy Pop's 'Repo Man' theme has never sounded more exciting). But for those of you used to the far funnier use of 'melonfarmer'...this truncated version might not please the purist, hence my four star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"An 80's Classic","review":"I fell in love with this movie at about 2:00 in the morning, when I first saw it on HBO in 1986.I started about 10 minuets in and it took me 2 weeks to find out the name.Following nothing but it's own internal logic it was one of the funniest things I had ever and managed to capture my view of the 80's in a nutshell."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE classic cult film","review":"Finally! It's out on DVD - the cult film to end all cult films. Certainly the greatest film ever to star Emilio Estevez. It's a real tour de force, the story being a complex tale - part alien conspiracy (x-files eat your heart out), part road movie, part pure science fiction, and part screwball comedy. Basically a car containing an alien entity has been stolen, and all and sundry are after it, including some repo men, who are after the car as there's a $25000 bounty on it. Harry Dean Stanton is his usual brilliant self, but in truth, the whole supporting cast are brilliant. Special mention must go to director Alex Cox - he has never been able to match this modern masterpiece, and never will. He can be thanked for the little touches - the punk, dying in the store, blaming society, the store itself containing all manner of items marked food, drink etc..pure genius. Buy this film - it is the greatest B film of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete copy!","review":"The copy of this book that I bought, and am now returning, was incomplete: it ended at the bottom of page 288 in the middle of a sentence.

I am sure they were (and are still) missing the fine points, but I am also sure that they are gaining a foundation in a variety of scientific topics. Things that we can *build upon* later. (For example, my husband was amazed at how much they picked up about the solar system.)And after watching this show, we go outside and 'dissect' some flowers. Or, for my now 5 year-old, we do something like grow beans in a glass cup so that we can reinforce what they have seen previously on the show. (We'll do this again when my son is older.)Four Stars.

The pause and serve didn't work which caused coffee to pour out onto the base and over the side. Because the timer and clock function is on the bottom, the liquid caused a short of the electrical systems. It started with just the clock going crazy, but ultimately, all the electronic functions gave out. No one can fix these machines besides Cuisinart, so we just decided to buy another.

Then on the fourth day, after the coffee had been brewed and had been sitting for about an hour and a half - kablooey! The thermal line exploded and coffee drained out the bottom all over the counter top.Fortunately I didn't have to deal with Cuisinart, I just returned to the store where I had purchased it and I got a refund.

Anyway, we kept it and used it daily. It has quit working now and we are looking for another brand--don't want to go through the hassle of sending it back to Cuisinart. We were very disappointed with this maker--had very high expectations because of the brand name.On the other hand, we did like the idea of the carafe. It kept the coffee hot for 2-3 hours. Wish it had been 10 cups though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"The coffee only stays hot in the carafe for approximately 1 1/2 hours. My previous thermal coffee maker (Black & Decker) was much better. That coffee would remain hot for at least 4 hours! Also, not happy with the \\"Auto\\" timer remaining on. There should be an indicator light letting you know that the Auto timer is active; otherwise, it's too easy to forget to turn it off.

It seemed like a great deal, and I trusted the Cuisinart brand. My mother was happy to receive the gift but a week or two later hesitantly told me that it was a terrible coffee maker - coffee was lukewarm the moment it was made, splattered out the top, and the whole thing, being white, was stained after just a few uses.

When I called Cuisinart to inquire into repairing this product, they told me I would have to mail the blender base (motor is heavy!) and then, only after receipt they would estimate the cost of fixing the machine. When I asked for the average cost of repair, the answer was at least [money]. In other words, for the cost of buying a new Osterizer, I could pay for another plastic clutch to be installed.

The plastic bottom of the container holds the blade in place, and sits on the rubber rotor on the top of the chrome base. However, both the bottom of the blade and the top of the base (where the motor is) have teeth which must mesh when you insert the top on the baase of the machine. It takes a few tries to make this work every time you replace the top on the base. What a pain.I make banana shakes, and this machine leaves chunks of banana! It takes several tries, and even then does not always complete the job.When I try to chop things llike nuts or bread crumbs, they tend to collect in the narrow bottom around the blade and get gummy instead of chopping. I never had this problem with my old Waring.Plastic parts have a cheap feel. Next time - and I'm sure there will have to a next time with this machine - I'll get a good American made Waring.

It eventually cracks from the heat/friction produced. I bought the Oster Beehive blender to replace it, and it has a metal piece beneath it and I have had it for a few years now with no problem.

If I fiddled with it, the sound would come in and out. After only about 4-5 months of light use.Using a decent wire and construction shouldn't be difficult or expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very uncomfortable","review":"I can't wear these for longer than 30 minutes without eperiencing extreme discomfort on my ears.

EQ'ing Itunes helped, but it's still far from perfect. This set doesn't reproduce high frequencies very well.If you just want to use it for Skype, it's great. If you also want to listen to music, I suggest you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks easily, finicky connection","review":"I got this, figuring I don't need a fancy USB headset or anything. However, the quality is poor. You don't notice it right away, but then you often find that the USB connector doesn't always register with your computer (I've tried on two computers, PowerBook and Macbook). And a few months ago part of the plastic broke, but it was still usable. Today it really snapped and is completely worthless. I'm going to get me a Sennheiser instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, Not So Great Price...","review":"I bought the Logitech USB Headset 250 about a couple of months ago, and I am fully satisfied with it's performance.

Would be really appreciated if it was like about 10 bucks cheaper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Headset and mic","review":"I bought these for use with Skype and have recommended this headset to many friends and relatives who I call and talk to all over the year. Also, since I plan to do a weekly podcast, I wanted something other than my computers built-in mic. This does the trick, and very well on all fronts. My only minor complaint is that, when not used for a day or more, the left ear phone goes dead. Unplugging and replugging in the USB port solves the problem. USB is NOT ready for PrimeTime!Bill"},{"rating":"1","title":"Voice is clear, but for some reason the earpiece broke","review":"It ran pretty well until the earpiece broke. The customer service said that warranty does not cover it, blah..blah..The bad thing about it is that it's too bulky, and if anyone is looking for something portable, stay away. But for desktop use, I think the audio quality is pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catastrophic purchase, really unhappy!","review":"I bought two headsets: one for my computer at work (Vista), one for home (XP). The microphone doesn't work on either. I guess that if I had slightly more advanced computer knowledge I could find a fix, but this should be plug and play, and it's anything but.In addition, the headset actually damaged (to be precise, destroyed) the USB port on one computer. It's as if it \\"ate\\" the pins of the USB port, making it unuseable.This was the most expensive type of headset in the store. What a terrible purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Logitech Stereo USB Headset 250","review":"Comfy, easy to use but poor voice quality.

Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old product renamed and price increased.","review":"This headset is identical to the old, A-0356A.Notice the 0356 in the product number.I have the original A-0356A, it's a great product that lasted about 2 years before the ear piece broke off and I had to re-solder the wires together.Outstanding product.Overpriced because it has been on the market for at least 4 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can get it cheaper","review":"You can get the same or better quality on other headsets cheaper than this one.

I know USB can be flaky at times, but this head-set only worked about a third of the time I plugged them in, and half of that time they degraded into static. This morning while fragging in Call of Duty 2, I attempted to adjust the head-set, and the left ear phone fell off.

Configured easily by Vista, XP, win2K, lin SuSE. Sound is clear. I compared it with the newer version 350 and did not see any difference in sound. 350 has a thicker over the head bow (may be stronger?). Yet, my 250 is used by no children and it cost me about 60% of what I paid for 350. Also, I found that the microphone is on the right on 250 and on the left in 350 - (if it comes in right and left versions - I do not know, mine happened to be this way). 250 has the USB plug narrow, easily usable in tight proximity with other USB plugs, 350 has it \\"fatter\\" than usual...Considered the price, I chose this product over newer 350, for it works same to me. I did not rate durability anyhow, for I have the headset not for long enough to judge that. I am happy with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reliability and build, lasted three days","review":"The headset was easy to setup on my mac. I was able to plug it in and it started working. Everything went fine until day 3 when it just stopped working all together. I thought it might have been a driver problem and tried another computer. It was the headset which had less than 8 hours on it.I opened up the headset and could not believe the poor build quality. The wires are barely soldered on the board. The wire were very poor quality and very thin, which is likely leading to some of the problems with the headset. The factory had smeared some gunk all over the circuit board. It should have never left the factory in this condition.I will not buy this headset again, especially seeing as it only worked 3 days. I have noticed other reviews stating the same problems with this headset.It is not worth sending back because of the poor build quality and reliability.Do yourself a favor and read some of the one star reviews. I could have saved myself some trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does What it Needs To","review":"This headset is a great bargain for the price. I use Skype as my primary phone service, and this headset is fairly comfortable, good sound quality, hooks up with a convenient USB connection (rather than, like many, requiring a microphone jack), and works! I did have a previous one that only lasted about a year before dying, which is why I gave this only 3 stars for durability. Still, at the price, a year isn't bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Logitech 980356-0403 Stereo USB Headset 250","review":"I think basically I got what I paid for - a cheap quality usb headset with fairly lousy sound quality.

Whenever I eat chips/oily food...the oil from ears would seep to the muffs.

I did not like this product. This is an USB headphone. Most of the laptop has two USB ports and if you are using one mouse and one webcam then there is not place to put this USB headphone. Now whenever I want to chat then I have to take out my mouse. Second, even the voice quality is not worth $27.

They dropped the ball on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst reliability","review":"I bought six of these (not from Amazon) and three months later, we are down to two of them working. The cord is very thin, and if you plug it into a computer sitting on the floor, it in is inevitable that the wheel of your desk chair will touch the cord and when that happens, you're sunk. The cord is flimsy and not strong at all. The slightest tug and the plastic sheath of the cord will break and one of more of the wires inside withh break or short. We had the same failure mode on all four that have failed so far. Because the wires are so small and are enamel coated stranded, they cannot be repaired by mere mortals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work well with Intel Macs","review":"I would avoid buying this headset if you are planning to use it on an Intel Mac.

But, when it come sto talking the microphone is horrible.The mic does not pickup your voice....to the other person it sounds as if you're talking to them from 60 feet away.To add to this the boom of the microphone is too short.Now if you speak directly to the mic you hear a lot of disturbance because of the air from your mouth.Bottom line...if you need headphones, buy something like Philips or Sony, if you need a headset don't buy this one..buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweat and More Sweat","review":"If you like your ears and your earphones to be wet then i suggest you buy it otherwise, stay away the sound i think is wonderful, but it DOES NOT HAVE A MUTE BUTTON OR VOLUME CONTROL.

The manual and interface were both easy to read and use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meets the Test So Far","review":"We bought this digital recorder for our meetings, rather than recording them on cassettes.

Very easy to use and you can edit on the go, the batteries long me almost the entire conference (I came with replacements that I just change the last day the final hours, just in case).

USB transfer of files from device is very fast, and the unit can be configured to be seen as a usb microphone, or USB storage device, depending on whether you want to record directly to your hard drive, or record to the flash device, and then copy the files over.

Teresa Medeiros is a master storyteller!! the scenes leap off the pages, the characters are so well developed that I felt like spanking the brat Lottie, sister to the herione Laura, this for me was the only downfall in the book, Lottie was a 10 year old hellion who tried to murder not once but twice the hero Sterling, the Duke of Devonbrooke and almost succeeded. I didn't like Laura defending such bad behavior while constantly putting down the hero Sterling, who to me was the victim through out the book!!!!Other then those complaints the story was very well written and a pretty good read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fluff 'n Stuff","review":"For a quick read, an escape from reality into a world of fluff, it was a fun romance. Now, the stuff. Lottie, the heroine's young sister, was a bit of a sociopath plotting and following through on a few schemes to injure or end the hero's life. This did not make her character enduring or cute just diabolical, beyond spoil brat. There was one comment from the heroine that struck me as arrogant (and ignorant) was her logic to marry. For if she did not and worked as a governess, she may be accosted by her employer because she was pretty. Other than that, there was enough fluff to overlook the stuff. Medeiros is quite a wit, so for that, I adore her writings. They make me laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good, Recommended Reading","review":"This is the first book I have read from this author.

I did enjoy the amnesia plot. I thought it well done and rather believable. The motives of the two protagonists were entirely understandable and delivered with Teresa Medeiros' delicious prose. It got to be a bit over the top after the marriage and the yourng sister's, Lottie, efforts at murder were not at all cute or funny. She should have been locked up.

So I have to admit that I haven't been able to force myself to read this book all the way through, despite trying several times. I found the heroine very selfish and manipulative, rather than innocent and cute, as I'm sure she's meant to be. She takes advantage of an injured man, telling lie after lie, binding him to her and trying to shape his personality to her own desires, not once thinking of him as an individual with his own life or loved ones to return to. And then when things go awry and he demands that she become either his mistress or his wife, she has the gall to say that HE tricked HER and that he is not giving her a choice. Ironic, hmm?

A Kiss to Remember did bring a few new twists to the story but failed to keep me hooked. I felt that the general storyline was too predictable in the sense that everything will always end up with 'happily ever after'. While Laura kept me enterained with her efforts to make Nicholas (Sterling) into the man of her dreams, and Nicholas/Sterling with his temperment, the other characters were an uninteresting group. After all said and done, i would have to say that 'A Kiss to Remember' was a good read but one should not expect too much from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ACDelco 213-1622 Mass Airflow Sensor","review":"This was the second sensor I ordered.

I called the company and was told the perfume ingredient on the list of ingredients was indeed chemical (man made, not essential oils as the others listed). \\"Plant derived surfactants\\" is what companies put on their labels when using sodium laurel sulfate or sodium laureth sulfates (the two that you should avoid).

I'm told they made it into the 'health section' of stores because they are biodegradeable. However, they contain toxic synthetic fragrances -- note they are simply listed as 'fragrance' on the label. Synthetic fragrances are known to disrupt hormones (promoting obesity, thyroid disorders, sperm damage, and birth defects), induce or worsen respiratory problems, cause immune system supression cancer and kidney disease, and damage the brain and nervous system.Many companies add a natural ingredient (in this case lemon verbena or lavender - if these are indeed the real thing - to pretend their product is natural. This is unethical.For general cleaning I recommend vinegar. For dish soap - I suggest you look at other brands.If you desire more information on fragrances and their toxic effects, Sandra Redemske of Redemske Design has put together some remarkable information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scent is overpowering","review":"Very disappointed in this soap.

You can't wash it off either.Besides that, after washing a few cups during the day, I noticed my hands were now chapped and burning. The detergents in this soap opened the cuticle of my skin on my hands so horribly that they felt like someone had taken sandpaper to them.Absolutely horrible stuff.

The consistency appears to be the same, but it just doesn't clean. In fact, this is my main complaint with most all of the Mrs. Meyers products I've used. They smell nice but don't do much beyond that. I feel like I'm using a product that was devised for a reniassance home - lots of perfume to cover the bad smells, but no cleaning power.

Even when it did install properly on a third machine, it failed to import all of the songs I selected, and to transfer all the songs I wanted to the Napster portable player. The company promises to fix these problems by the service's launch date, a week from Wednesday. Other limitations will persist, however. While Napster is a pretty good music store, it's a lousy jukebox. It can't rip CDs to music files, and it has only rudimentary jukebox capabilities. It can't download music to any portable player but its own. It doesn't work with the iPod and, if you have other players, you have to launch Windows Media Player, a separate program, to transfer Napster downloads to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU PEOPLE THINKING?!?!?!?!","review":"GET A SONY NET MD WALKMEN!!!!!!!!!!

Very limited range.The software really sucks. For $300 and with 20GB of space they should have made it so you can load software and edit the data more easily. Software hangs very easily and if anything happens while you're loading it, guess what; you get to start all, over!It takes forever and a day to load too and you have to be careful because the little green bars that are supposed to be showing your songs being loaded are not always accurate.

The software kept crashing my system and was difficult to use. The interface is nowhere near as intuitive as the iPod. Yes it does have a radio. Yippie.

(which you may actually get after using your thumb on those tiny little buttons.) I returned mine and bought a 40GB iPod. With iTunes for Windows, the iPod is by far the best mp3 player out there.

I was amazed at how much trouble I had considering this is a name brand cup. I suspected the problem could be me, so I handed it off to a male to see if he would have equal trouble as well - and he did.The cap on top of the lid takes so long to coax into place that the only way I've deemed this cup usable is to just leave it closed all the time. Other than that the cup seems to be fine. The markings (c, oz, and ml) are clear and readable. It is also easy to clean (if using protein powder it is probably best to rinse it out right away), though I cannot say how it fares in a dishwasher.

However, I noticed that just after a few uses, it began struggling, to the point that I was adding one fruit at a time or one or two ice cubes at a time, not to bog down the motor which seemed to be in CHF.

We exchanged it again, but it also died within a year. We just celebrated our third anniversary, and have gone through three SmartPower Duets in that time. I know, it sounds like we abuse the blender, ask it to blend rocks, beat it with a baseball bat, but the truth is we only use it for fruit, ice, and juice.

We are very happy with it so far - it is a million times better than our last blender.UPDATE: The blender only lasted a year before we had the same problem as many others - the blade seized up and tore the bottom to shreds.

I use the food processor more than the blender (which is a tad quieter) and I literally have to leave the room if I am going to run it for more than 30 seconds or so. It is so loud it makes my ears ring if I stand beside it while it runs. I don't think I have a defective unit, however I haven't contacted Cusinart to complain so I don't know for sure.

The blender is so loud it scares our pets into hiding. A small jetliner taking off in our kitchen is about the best way to describe it. And for the money, it really doesn't perform above and beyond the most average of blenders/processors. Blending isn't click and go, I find I have to constantly adjust the speed and check the contents a few times and go again before achieving the results I want. Also, while blending or processing, it gives off a slight smell of burning metal -- even after two years of use. As soon as we can garage sale this thing, I'll be buying something else.

I had to return the first one I bought from Costco because at one point the bottom was screwed on so tight, there was no way it was coming off. This made it impossible to disassemble and clean properly. This happened after a few weeks so it maybe it was defective. I haven't had that issue with this one and like I said I've had it for 8 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken after 1 year","review":"I liked this product at first--made a smoothie pretty quickly and minimal problems chopping up frozen food. The noise level varied quite a lot from the beginning. Sometimes it was very loud and other times quiet. The plastic part of the blade broke about 9 months in, but it was easily replaced ordering a new one. However, after about 1 year the motor has dropped and no longer mates with the blade housing and the blender is no longer usable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great ... Except for Smoothies","review":"I agree with many of the other reviews - Our blender worked beautifully until we began using it to make smoothies. We replaced the gear drive once and it broke again. I think that the plastic just is not strong enough to withstand the strain of making smoothies with frozen fruit over time. We have replaced it with an old fashioned blender with metal parts that I found at an outlet store and it has worked wonderfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!","review":"In the effort to save space we settled for this dual blender/processor. It was great for about 1 usage and then the food processor wouldn't work. It first whined so loud my dog went and hid upstairs in the closet until I was finished. The next time I tried to use it, the blade wouldn't fit into the processor container. When it finally fit, it wouldn't actually turn the blade. Everything was positioned correctly, but it still to this day won't turn.Don't buy this. Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Promise, Low delivery","review":"I bought this as I liked all the bells and whistles. I used it lightly for only one season. The it went caput. No one would fix it as it was not worth fixing. Now I have all the \\"bells and whistles\\" occupying my kitchen space. Typical \\"made in China\\" cheap junk. Save your money and go elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, broke after 8 months of daily use","review":"I agree with other one star reviews. I thought this a great blender to register for because of the dual food processing and blending. I don't believe that the motor is strong enough to be a food processor. I called Cuisinart and it's out of warrenty, so they'd like me to mail it in, so they can tell me how much they'll charge me to fix it...screw that, for my time and money, I'll just go purchase a new product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, until the drive gear shatters","review":"As other reviewers, we loved this blender until it broke. It was quiet, powerful, simple to use, and looked great. The food processor was the perfect size, and very useful.The only complaint in using it was the base unit on the blender jar was hard to get off at times. Also, the plastice silver coating was wearing off.After 1.5 years of moderate use (mainly smoothies), the plastic gear connecting the motor to the blender shattered. Luckily we bought ours at a retailer that we could return it to.If Cuisinart ever fixes this defect issue, we would definitely buy it again. Until then an expensive Osterizer is working well for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Blender I've ever used","review":"This is my first time I've ever taken the time to write a review - but I can't say enough bad things about this blender.It is loud! 4 doors closed, and it still manages to wake the baby up as the sound permeates every inch of the house and to my inner soul.It smells! After every blend you get the smell of burnt rubber but it's just the heavy duty motor.It spills! Every time I try to pour a smoothy I manage to get a large part of it to spill down the edge. Never had this problem with the el cheapo blenders.Difficult to attach! If you don't get the food processor blade to seat just right, when you try to put it onto the motor things just latch up. I end up having to pull out all of the food - wiggle the shaft loose, and then start over again.Only good thing I can say about this thing is that it looks nice on the counter top. Just don't try to use it. I often resort back to the Braun food processor I bought for $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this blender","review":"My wife and I have a blended shake everyday with ice, protein, fruit, water, and yogurt. We've had this blender for about six months and from the very begining we wanted to throw it against the wall for one very simple reason - it doesn't do it's job. It takes a very long time to \\"crush\\" ice. The reason I say \\"crush\\" is becuase it doesn't really crush it unless you let it run for over 5 mins. That's too long for a blender. It also leaks from the bottom. I've tried everything to stop it from leaking. Cleaning it is a pain as well. This product sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give zero stars for this product.","review":"I was tired of all the appliances cluttering up the counter so I got rid of my heavy duty vitamix and cuisinart food processor and replaced it with this because of the cuisinart name. MISTAKE. As a blender it does blend okay and does crush ice but the food processor unit broke immediately and I am not replacing it. I miss my vitamix because it was more sturdy and did a better job with heavy blending jobs. I see now that Oster has a blender/food processor combo and I may see if that works better.The point is: If cuisinart is going to offer a product that is a combo..duet, then both fuctions should work equally well. I would not recommend this product. I purchased this item not on Amazon and before I read the reviews. I will not do that again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and Easy to Use","review":"This is an easy to use and simple product. Often food processors are too complicated to get that much use. This one is straight forward. It is also powerful. Crushing ice is no problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run, don't walk, away from this product!","review":"I thought I was killing two birds with one stone when I placed this combo on my wedding registry. I can honestly say, it's the only thing I absolutely hate that I asked for. It is loud, ineffective, and the processor never really worked. Did I say loud? I'm not kidding when I tell you that my ears HURT when I use it! I wish I had never given up my old Kitchenaid blender. I finally threw away the processor parts and ordered the Kitchenaid KFP750. I will also toss the blender when I buy a new one. I won't even donate it. I wouldn't do that to any charitable organization!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best...","review":"I used the food processor once, and it was OK. A little hard to get the lid on & off, but otherwise OK. The next time I went to use it (this would be the second time), the lid would NOT come off. After an hour of trying everything to extract my poor food, my boyfriend had to get out a hammer to pry the darn thing apart. I don't really ever use the blender, so I'm not an expert there, although when I did use it, it didn't seem to do the best job.I would definitely recommend getting separate products to do the different jobs. I tried to save money, and it back-fired, because now I have wasted $100."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inefficient, Not robust, noisy","review":"Broken after 1 1/2 years. Not terribly efficient - when making baby food for my daughter ALWAYS ended up with lumps no matter how often I stirred the mixture, tipped it up etc. Motor became really whiny - definitely not robust enough for frequent pureeing of baby food.

I have not been able to use the product at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blender is terrible, returned it without ever using processor","review":"Blender is terrible, returned it without ever using processor.Why bother paying for half a machine? I was so dissapointed by the lack of job the blender did I returned it without ever using the processor part.Blender jar is to wide, then goes in real narrow like small bowl around bottom of blades (but you can't see that in picture because of big thick bulky plastic bottom that screws on heavy glass jar/unit), it would be more of a 'chipper' flinging stuff about on the top parts of the blades without ever really getting down to business.Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK while it lasted","review":"This is my 4th blender - This blender lasted 30 days - luckily under the 60 day warranty.

Broke after 1 month of daily use","review":"I make protein shakes every morning for breakfast with ice cubes, frozen fruit, protein powder and milk. The food processor function did a decent job of breaking up the ice and frozen fruit. The stir function was a joke, because it didn't do anything after I added the powder and milk. I ended up stirring everything my self with a spoon. After 2 weeks I noticed a strange high pitched whirring sound and a little bit of clacking, like the base motor was spinning uncontrollably after I stopped the blender. Two weeks later the whirring and clacking became 50x louder and sounded like a loose part was spinning around inside the base. I thought the base was going to explode in my face. This piece of junk is going in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product dosent hold up to claims","review":"Working bowl broke after grating cheese the first time! Customer support would not warranty the product or stand by it's product.The problem with this unit is the plastic is extremely cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"I really liked it until the motor gave out. I haven't put particularly heavy use on it, but have used it fairly regularly and liked the results. It is somewhat problematic trying to get everything to mix thouroughly if you don't add a fairly substantial amount of liquid, but that is typical for a blender. Also, it is loud, but also at a level typical for a blender.My BIG problem with it is that Cuisinart will be glad to replace the motor but I have to pay to ship it to them and then pay them $10 to ship it back. What kind of lousy warranty policy is that? Granted, compared to the $120 sticker price, it is probably worth it, but it is almost a quarter of what it would cost to buy the the thing once the discounting from the online retailers is taken into consideration. It has shown itself to be an unreliable product and Cuisinart doesn't stand behind it. What a combination!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Blender and Super Loud Food Processor!","review":"I've owned this blender / food processor combo for less than 2 years and I'm about to get rid of it. The blender has been leaky for over a year now and I rarely use the mini food-processor as it's extremely loud and inefficient. Neither item works well and this was money totally wasted. I'm disappointed in this brand with my experience. I own other Cuisinart products that work really well, including the 14-cup good processor which I love.

Doing this, everything is still in great condition, no cracks, no breaks, no weird smells.Pros:- Works very efficiently, easy to store, and it's great to have a blender/food processor all in one.- Perfect size for a two-person household- Grater and slicer work great as well!Cons:- VERY loud- Retractable cord is a bit of a wrestle to get back in, but it's nothing terribly dramatic.Overall, a good tool to have in the kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mess of a Product","review":"The food processor piece was flimsy and was trash within a week.

I think do to it being plastic not a metal base. 1st time using the food chopper, which was the first day i bought it, I chopped a few onions - took of the lid to set in sink, put it back on to chop some more and it wouldn't work. I thought WHAT - why? I looked in the top of the lid and the stem that triggers the blade to spin when the lid is attached was not there. It was laying in my sink. OH MY WORD - can you imagine if it would have fallen off in what I was chopping plastic pieces everywhere. Why is this piece not actually made into the lid - why is it a separate piece which comes unglued and falls out. Terrible design. Be for warned. Not sure what other blender is good that also has a food processor. That is why i bought this.

I tried an onion, and got onion mush, with a few hunks of unprocessed onion in the center of the bowl.Don't bother with this machine. Go out and just buy a separate blender and processor.

A piece that is essential to making it work literally broke off. Imagine how it would stand up to regular kitchen use. I called Cuisinart to ask if they would replace it for free since I have not even used it and they said that since I dropped it that I would have to pay for a replacement. I said no thanks.

It is so loud that I bought a headset ear protector that you would wear when you mow the lawn or use a leaf blower. I warn everyone in the house when I am going to use it, and never use it if somebody is asleep. If you don't mind the noise, this is a nice little package that works fine for occasional use.

Bad design of the locking mechanism and cheap material.2) The blender blade got locked - who knows how or why - I swear we haven't misused it, all I did was try to make a smoothie. Its now basically impossible to turn the blades of the blender. I've tried taking it apart, but without a work bench its really not possible, since you need some kind of a clamp to hold down the piece that engages the motor while turning the nut that holds the blades in the opposite direction.Shame on you cuisine art.

The bottom shape of the blender is too flat and it leaves chunks of ice, banana, strawberries, or whatever you are blending. The base is hard to unscrew. If you don't screw it on tight enough, it unscrew's itself during blending. Then all your liquid ends up all over the counter. The food processor leaves chunks above the blade when you are trying to grate items. There are small area plastic parts that latch to lock it in place for use. These broke quite easily.

We were very frustrated because we've probably used the blender ten times since we received it. We were planning on getting Cuisinart to replace it, however after reading all of the reviews, I've decided to get rid of it (it never seemed that solid anyway)and buy another blender. No blender should break after such a short period of time and to have horrible customer service in addition to the breakage is unacceptable.

After a few uses, the plastic \\"ears\\" that lock the processor bowl in place (you know, after you twist it on), broke off...so we've had to carefully hold the bowl in place while using it.Recently, the bowl has completely cracked, so we're tossing the food processor parts.Now, the blender works fine, BUT as a blender alone, the capacity is far too small for its tall profile, so I think we'll be looking for a new blender pretty soon as well.I wouldn't not recommend this product, unless you plan to rarely use either appliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"As others have mentioned","review":"I really like this unit when i first got it. I had a krups blender before which i thought was horrible. Anyways it made margharittas relatively well and did everything i asked of it. The food processor attachment was also nice in that i don't have to get the full size processor out which is a hastle. Anyways after about 1.5 years of usuage the machanim that holds the blade (the drive gear in the motor contact this within the jar) has cracked. I was making hot sauce which shouldn't even been difficult at all for this machine to process. I would have gave this a 4 if this mechanism hadn't cracked. I will be going with another blender since so many other people have reported the same thing. To bad this could have been a great blender if cuisinart would have fixed that problem"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not last long","review":"This seemed like a good idea but the blender which I use almost daily for smoothies died within 2 months. The blade assembly bearing seized and the friction burnt and cracked the plastic around it.

I emailed and called Cuisinart and got no response. The blender, however, works great. This is a great product to save counter space but it is not a reliable product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap but Poor Quality","review":"I bought this item, thinking, like others, that the Cuisineart name meant quality. The blender broke about within about 6 months, but I kept on using the food processor. Light use, I might add. Just a few days ago, the food processor broke -- the plastic food bin snapped. This has been one of the most disappointing purchases I've made. Plus, it is unbelievably LOUD. I'm in the market for a more expensive, sturdy, reliable processor. You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather be next to a jet plane engine","review":"Worked great at first and was not too loud. Now after four years and not much use we decided to start using it again because of making baby food. Well, the baby has to be at the other end of our home and you need to wear professional ear muffs/guards to be able to stand next to it while it is processing. The muffs still don't even block out the majority of the horrendous shrilling noise.It chops the food fine in the processor part, but the blender doesn't work well blending fruit(always having to take off and shake around content so that it will blend it up).DO NOT RECOMMEND, JUST FOR HEALTH SAKE!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"loud, bulky, and cheap","review":"I bought this 6 months ago. I am already looking online for replacement parts because the base to the blade cracked rendering the blender useless. It is so loud, I have to plug my ears and it scares my kids. The food prossesor purees everything to a pulp, even when you pulse it just a few times. The glass blender is heavy, akward, and drips all over when you pour. I paid 80$ for this at a department store, lucky it was a gift card. For a Cuisinart, I thought this would be quality. Keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for two months...","review":"Like many other reviewers, I really liked this blender until it stopped working after about 2-3 months. Used it almost exclusively for making protein/fruit/veggie shakes every morning. It just couldn't handle the load and the motor burned out. It's still under warranty, but even if they repair/replace it, I'm in the market for a more powerful, heavy-duty blender that can handle making a simple daily shake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great product... for Cuisinart","review":"While this product ultimately works, and works reasonably well. Like others that have reviewed it my bowl has cracked, on one of the locks. The motors makes some funny noises and generally doesn't show much durability.I only use this casually for light tasks and for it to be showing so much wear and a general lack of durability, I'm terribly unimpressed. It's a good blender and a so so food processor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blender works fine-- Food Processor is no good.","review":"I bought this because I didn't have a food processor, and my blender had broken. I thought this would be a good compromise for my small kitchen. The blender has always worked fine. The food processor, however--1. When I got it, a small piece was missing, which meant I could not use the shredder/slicer. I had to wait months for Cusinart to send me the missing part.2. The bowl of the food processor cracked. Specifically, one of the locks that hold it to the base. Now, when using it, I have to hold the bowl down with my hand. There is also a crack in the top.3. It doesn't work well at all for grating cheese, which was the main reason I wanted a food processor! I end up with big chunks of cheese trapped between the top and the shredder blade.All in all, I don't recommend this product. The food processor should work as well as the blender... but it just doesn't. The work bowl is far too flimsy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save the box, you're gonna be mailing it back!","review":"My first call to Cuisinart was in regard to the ear-piercing volume of the food processor. They listened to it and said it was normal. Sooo, make sure you throw in a pair of ear-plugs with your purchase. And please note that babies' ears are very sensitive and they should NOT be in the room when this food processor is in use.My second call to Cuisinart was at the 6 month mark when the drive shaft exploded. They quickly sent me a new one in the mail and I was very pleased!My third call to Cuisinart was at the 9 month mark when I was trying to grate cheese (not even a hard parmigiana mind you, but a soft cheddar/jack!) This time they were unhelpful and told me I would have to mail them back the entire unit for inspection and include return postage! So now I have the burden of wondering if it's worth spending the postage and waiting in line for a hunk of junk that's probably going to break again in a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk Food Processor","review":"Buyer beware!

It takes forever to blend or chop anything up and doesn't even do a good job at it. It is noisy, hard to position in the base, and overall just a waste of money. The blender my grandma uses from the '70's does a better job! Anytime I use it to make smoothies, the blades push all the ingredients to the edge and creates an air pocket where they just spin and spin without touching any of the fruit. It also smells like burning rubber after just a few seconds of using it.

It does the basic functions fine. I wouldn't recomend it bacause I find it to be very under powered. When making smoothies, the motor smells very bad and a couple of times it's over heated. I only used frozen blueberries and frozen strawberries, never use ice. Also, I'm only using this once or twice a week and feel I'll be lucky if this appliance last 2 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not blend","review":"This blender is pretty useless and should be much better for the price.It has cheap plastic materials used on base. The blades are badly designed and do not blend the contents at all. I'm not sure what good it would be for any type of food processing.Both of the blending containers are badly designed so that if food spills down the side (and it always will) it goes into a gap that is unclean-able and inaccessible unless you dismantle it with a wrench.I thankfully got my money back and will never buy Cuisinart again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality!","review":"Received this set as a gift; was thrilled with the Duet idea. Quality is poor, blender leaked out the botoom almost immediately; hairline crack- repaired with gorilla glue; - Processor really too small for dressings and sauces; hard to remove base; and plastic broke by one year- blender resumed leaking- the entire set is in the garbage now. My 20 yr. old gold Oster blender came back in from shed. For Cuisinart, this is junk.One star for the idea only!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Junk","review":"The food processor container is too small for 85% of my prep needs. It's just large enough to shred a couple of carrots or a quarter of a very small cabbage at a time. It's too small to make even one pie crust at a time, never mind two.The blender is over sized but it's also pathetically inefficient. How hard can it be to make a smoothie with frozen fruit, for Pete's sake? As noted elsewhere, it's very loud and smells like burning electrical elements every time I've used it for the past year.I bought this in order to save on storage space by combining two appliances in one. As it turns out I got three-fourths of a gadget in one. Hopefully it will wear out soon (a pretty good bet) so I can replace it with two real appliances.

I just happened to discover it in NYC several years ago, but I have still never seen it in any local music store where I live. I guess with all the Britney, Hillary and Jessica CDs on the shelves, the merchants simply couldn't make room for Miss Ross. What a shame that we are subjected to the likes of these wannabes, while true, vocal brilliance like Diana's seems to remain in the shadows.In any event, if you like Christmas music and don't have this CD, click the \\"Buy This Now\\" button immediately!

In specific the catchy tunes and the meaning behind the music.This album was just bad, the music was not entertaining and there seemed to be this constant theme of protest against some authority that didn't exist. Much like you would expect from a high school kid listening to Pink Floyd or a burnt out hippy.Anyway, I would expect more.

This is probably the best of that entire group that I have ever read. Yvain is the greatest knight in the land, equaled only by Gawain, and though he is surrounded by corruption, he remains an unstoppable force for good, fearing nothing.

If I did, I would need to spend 4 hours a day at the gym and 2 of those high intensity cardio.Telling people to 'eat 4,000 calories a day' (at least) train for a few hours a week, and you will 'bulk up & get big' is misleading & dangerous. What real doctor or nutritionist would advise this. And even more absurd if you work a traditional 9-5 office job & only workout for 1 or 2 hours a day.

The exercises aren't the usual useless ones that people do... that is why they work. Consider that most people at the gym still look about the same as when they started. Do you really want to do what they do? It has only been a few weeks and it has already made a HUGE difference for him. He had settled for just being a fast runner and staying fit, but never had any hope of gaining noticeable mass.He is still the only one using some of the \\"hardcore\\" equipment at his gym, and is getting some wierd looks eating every three hours... but he is no longer getting the \\"chicken chest\\" jokes and with the added mass he no longer looks like a little kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stuff really works...","review":"Granted, the ideas behind this book are pretty straightforward...eat big and lift heavy and you will grow. Yet I haven't done that much growing in the past couple of years. After reading this book I finally understood what big eating really is. And the great workout routines and stretching prescriptions changed my approach to lifting. For the first couple of phases I barely put on any weight, but I found myself feeling thicker and getting stronger. Then I hit phase three, and all the work seemed to catch up with me. I put on about 12 pounds and only increased bodyfat by 2% (which was easy to lose). My net gain was about 8 lbs. of solid muscle, and I can't wait to do the program over again.

With a little planning you can set the dual alarms and the countdown timer and get as many alarm reminders as you need per day.I thought that using the vibe feature twice a day every day would eat batteries, but I have had the watch 1 3/4 years now and the battery is finally getting a little weak. The water resistant feature works, I've accidently dunked the watch a few time. Now to clean it I put it under the faucet.

I am a pilot and I wanted to have a watch that would have the silent vibrating alarms, as audible timer alarms (used for holding procedures) are rather inaudible in a noisy airplane.The watch fell apart - the face bezel came unscrewed and then fell off. Before it fell off, it was just loose enough to make an audible rattling sound whenever the watch vibrated. The vibrations were strong enough, but the buttons were extremely hard to push and had no feel to them. Also, I never got the automatic 'flick of the wrist' light function to work. Night-owls, don't bother: whenever you push a button it turns off the night-light so you can't see what's happening!!!I'm looking for a new vibrating watch - perhaps a Casio G- Shock. Hopefully someone at Timex finally gets the idea to start producing a vibrating digital watch.-Danny V.

This DVD really took me back on a nostalgic trip Freddie Prinze was great & wish he would still be around. He was on his way to the top rising up as one ( the only one) succesful Hispanic comedian of that decade. I want to watch those episode of him saying \\"Looking Good!\\" but none of these episode have him saying that frase.

I was fortunate to see two of their concerts in NY. I have many of their albums CD & vinyl). I was a bit disappointed with this album. It lacks clarity and spark perhaps it is how it was recorded. I bought the CD because it had some songs on it that I did not have. I think the 2 CD album The Essential Liam Clancy is much better. If you are a Liam Clancy fan you do have to have the album which is why I bought it. No one sings like Liam. The best two songs on this album are The Nightingale and Patrial Game two of my favorites by Liam. There will never be a replacement for Liam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ancient history at best","review":"The high school that is the subject of this book was on a creative track, but then lost its way.

He shows variations of the same posture, different applications but all in a simplistic way that you can easily learn and apply.

Anyway, it talks about filling a child's love tank by understanding how they like love expressed to them, whether by words of affirmation, physical touch, quality time, gifts, or acts of service. They say that it really isn't possible to detect your child's primary love language until they are about five--so express love in all these ways while they're young and until you find out which way is most meaningful to them. One way to determine their primary love language is just to ask them how they know you (the parent) love them and see whether they describe presents, time together, things you've done for them, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must as a parent!","review":"This book was so helpful as a parent figuring out the way my kids tick.

Additionally my own perspective is probably much different thanwhen I read it long ago. The narrative switches during the novel with much of it being the death house diary of the character I like to refer to as \\"the evil Holden Caulfield\\".

The quality is good (although not quite on the level as the Eagle Creek & not the same lifetime warranty) and it seems very durable.

My \\"smart power\\" 7 speed electronic LED has died after less than 2 years of VERY light use. No bread dough, or heavy batters. Now I've purchased a much cheaper mixer with higher wattage.

I bought this mixer approximately ten years ago, by accident. The dept store had sold out of the one I went for and offered me the Cuisinart instead of a raincheck. I agreed only because it was a good deal, since the Cuisinart was more expensive. I have never looked back. It has been the best \\"hand-mixer\\" I have ever used. I cook a lot and I have used this mixer a lot! About five months ago one of the beaters finally broke. It was pretty scary considering the power the machine.

My experience with the Cuisinart HTM-5 SmartPower 5-Speed Electronic Hand Mixer was the EXACT OPPOSITE from the previous reviewer. While I appreciated many of the design features (swivel cord, open beaters, comfortable handle, easy beater release), I have abandoned its use. First, the slowest speed was much too fast to incorporate dry ingredients. I had to \\"pulse\\" it by quickly turning it on and off in order to keep flour from going everywhere. Honestly, I found little difference between the lowest and highest speeds. Second (and most annoying), even of the slowest speed it splattered EVERYWHERE. I could reduce the mess a bit by keeping the beaters perfectly vertical, but even then the bottom of the mixer would be covered with batter (along with the countertop). I tried to return the mixer, but I no longer had the box nor the receipt, so it just sits on my shelf.

I purchased it a few years ago. The poor durability of this mixer in a brand that should deliver a better product is unacceptable. My old GE hand mixer lasted 5 times as long as this one did, and cost a lot less. I wonder about the quality of the motor if it could burn out in such a relatively short time. I do agree with other reviewers that the low speed was too high; no major differences between speeds 1-3; they were all fairly highspeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"At first I was happy with this mixer.

Great purchase and easier to find here than in stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite novel","review":"DEMON is the conclusion of Varley's Gaea trilogy (TITAN and WIZARD are the first two). The incredible imagination and dramatic skill Varley demonstrates in WIZARD finally come together to explode in DEMON. The ending is brilliant and unexpected--and utterly dramatic: Varley's diversity of characterization (arguably his weakest feature) here is at its best. This is a book about rebellion, freedom, passion, strength, identity, and even love--ironically, because many of the characters are grotesquely violent, even visceral. But he reaches the depths in order to explode to heights which are yet somehow not tinted with melodrama. Varley's work is romantic, but not naive--definitely not naive. And it reaches its very best in DEMON. Easily his masterpiece, and easily my very favorite novel of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEMON, part three of the Gaea trilogy","review":"Cirroco and Gaby have quietly planned to overthrow the mad Titan, Gaea, right the wrongs done them and their friends and restore peace. Cirroccos rebelliousness has earned her a new title. Gaea is a bit miffed with her. The saga unfolds revealing just how vile a being with umimaginably huge power can be. Gaeas form is the Wheel, and while it cannot travel her power reaches even Earth, wreaking destruction.DEMON is a gripping story and concludes the trilogy with bold, emotionally powerful strokes.Like any really GOOD yarn, it leaves you dreaming of times, places and peoples that aren't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"The conflict between Jones, her allies, and Gaea, a particularly crazyvery powerful being, continues. Varley uses this to comment on andsatirise a religion or six, in passing, as well as throw in a wholebunch of whacky movie stuff, like attack of the 50 foot Marilyn Monroe,horny King Kongs and other such wildness.So from that point of view, the last book is a bit more interesting, and definitely more fun via this crazy war."},{"rating":"2","title":"blackest comedy","review":"This is a classic movie which people either love or hate, and its hard to figure out which unless you watch it. Steiger is brilliant, Graham is beautiful, the scum are venal (especially the politicians) and the script is well-paced.

I started watching it out of camp value, issac hayes, lauren hutton, heather graham...I bet all parties involved wish this poo-bomb would crawl back to the depths of hell from which it was spawned. I saw that used copies were being sold as low as 43cents...this is way too much. You should be paid to take this off of someone.

But as the old adage goes. \\"One should not judge a book by it's cover\\".I'm glad I didn't let the cover sway me. In my opinion the cover tends to yell \\"romance\\". This, however, is not the whole picture.Sure there is romance in the book, as well as the series as a whole, but the action and historical events covered make this an enjoyable series for everyone (even us guys).If you like historical fiction with substance this is a treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thank my dad for getting me started on this amazing series","review":"My father gave me this book to read after he finished it, and it BLEW ME AWAY!

My definition of an excellent book is one that not only tells a story, but puts you there.

However, the base that collects the water that has been steamed is not deep enough and has overflowed each time I have used it creating a big mess to clean up, which makes this a useless product. It's not even deep enough to hold the same amount of water that you put in the water reservoir. I wonder how a defect like that was overlooked....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money....","review":"I find this steamer a hassle to use. I purchased it primary to cook rice. The tray is big enough to cook two cups of rice - not much if you have a large family. Everytime you want to add something in, you have to take out the fan and it is a hassle, not to mention the danger involved due to the extreme hot steam!!! Everytime you are done cooking, the water needs to be empty and it makes a mess. I find that the rice cooks much faster in a convention rice cooker - a much cheaper appliance. Overall, I am disappointed in the product. If you have young children, be sure this thing is out of reach when in use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Banal","review":"This work is actually a collection of short stories under the guise of a novel. Each story is connected to each other by clumsily written literary threads, providing cover for the fact that the author hasn't the imagination or the creativity to expand each story into a full-length book. I was looking forward to reading about vampires and werewolves, but they only appeared briefly in the stories, I found that immensely disappointing.

Leigh Koslow is back with her best friends in a mystery that will keep you reading until late into the evening. While working part-time at the local zoo, Leigh stumbles across a gruesome \\"surprise\\" in the tiger cage. Miss Claire is not graphic in her descriptions (thankfully!) of the crime scene, but your imagination will run away as you read the story.

Darkly suspenseful thriller set in a zoo, with Leigh Koslow tracking an elusive killer far more dangerous than the resident animals. Brilliant blend of whodunit narrative and down-to-earth characterization. Claire has a flair for developing believeable characters who seem like people you already know.

It really is the best source I've ever run across (better by far than Keirsey's Please Understand Me, although the ideas in it were based on Keirsey's and are an expansion on what he wrote) and it is an extremely useful tool for helping me figure out how to relate to everyone in my life. I am an ISFP and I am particularly delighted to find absolutely NO negativity whatsoever in Berens' portrait of Artisans! I am particularly impressed with the glossary in the back, which defines key words pertaining to the temperaments so that readers are not left to make their own conclusions as to what the author means by them. I especially appreciate Berens' definitions of words that are often used as criticism but which here are put in a positive light so that they can become assets in many situations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date edition","review":"This is an out of date edition.

The problem is that when most people start in network marketing, they are clueless on what to do and get easily frustrated. Conversations and the prequel, The Greatest Networker in the World will get you and your downline off to a fast start. I also recommend The Wave 4 Way to Building Your Downline and Wave 4.

They say that you have to use CDs not CD-Rs to make copies of your album and they use DVD-Rs to make copies of this DVD! The sound is not professionally recorded, I guess they used a couple of HandyCams to produce this DVD with the internal microphone of the Cams. You hear a lot of shhhhhh, and to hide it they played a rap music in the background all the DVD.I think the DVD is made specially for rap music industry, because I find it hard to apply the tips suggested in the DVD on other types of music like jazz or flamenco.Still you can learn new things from this DVD, but not much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please!","review":"Love this book.

If they would only reprint \\"The Perfect Pancake,\\" we would buy several copies of it too.As for the stories themselves, they are charming, and Virginia Kahl's writing is fantastic.

The answer is simple. this is not funny. I waited and waited for laughs. None came. Maybe I've seen too many comedy shows, but this one does not move me at all. Lil Darryl is more tragic than humorous. The 'Church Lady' brought a few chuckles the first few times he brought her out. The bit about the bass player needed to be fleshed out. But, the music he used had no prominent bass playing in it, so it didn't work. Sorry Ricky Smiley, but you need to put some thought behind your act.

I saw possibilities that he might release songs sounding more like remixes, or else might go for the sound of songs like \\"Star Fruits, Surf Rider.\\" Instead, this album seems to be more focused towards a certain style of music that is hard for me to describe but sure is excellent.With all the songs flowing together through the sounds of birds chirping and other sounds of this sort, i feel that this album must be listened from begining to the end with no interuptions in order to be fully appreciated.Basically If you are a fan of good music who is looking for a great new album try this out, i think you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely superb","review":"POINT is what I like to call a \\"lava-lamp\\" record. Much like a lava lamp, this album makes you cooler simply because you own it. Like Beck's ODELAY and The Avalanches' SINCE I LEFT YOU, it's a record that relies heavily on inventive sampling, and yet would not sound out of place in a collection of jazz music.The songs are amazing in their simplicity, and Cornelius' English lyrics never degenerate into the \\"Engrish\\" that turns many American listeners away from Japanese music. While this album does have a few mood swings (the thrash-punk \\"I Hate Hate\\" being an obvious example), the best tracks on this album (\\"Smoke,\\" \\"Brazil\\") make for some of the best chill-out music from any continent."},{"rating":"2","title":"hybrid-o-licious","review":"this guy is nothing like pizzicatto 5, or sushi, or any of the other psuedo-shiny-happy-makefunofitall-lounge-punks. he seems to actually care about being both human and post-human. fantasm is one of the best albums in any genre. this one is also brilliant, but is warmer and more relaxed. run, don't walk, cornelius is making music about and for us now."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a truly eye opening collection of essays","review":"This book was printed some time ago but has been proven even more significant as time goes on.Anyone interested in how America was allowed to devolve into it's current state must read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"white nationalist work","review":"This is a collection of essays from the white nationalist organisation American Renaissance.

Boulez needs clarity of performance, otherwise these piano pieces could be written by anybody. Helffer rushes almost all the time. Sometimes his fingers are moving so fast that the notes literally don't speak. A good example is the 2nd Sonata, 2nd movement. In this slow movement, there is a frank passage of 4 against 3. Helffer can't really delineate this rhythm - compare this with the excellent Pollini reading, where this simple rhythm is fashioned into an apotheosis.Add to that (what seem to be) a few bad digital edits, and this disc is definitely second place. I don't know any better recording of the 1st or 3rd Sonatas, but Maurizio Pollini's 2nd Sonata is still the most breathtaking Boulez performance by a soloist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"The rocket grill is the best grill I have ever used.

It was ridiculous. Aside from numerous grammatical errors and strange references to \\"real-life\\" evidence of the shark's existence, the book was pretty bad. My biggest issue with this book is that Charles Wilson doesn't seem to know what a fossil is. His Megalodons have BLACK teeth. It seems he once saw a black fossilized Megalodon tooth and assumed the creature's teeth were black. A note to the author: Fossils are, by definition, hardened remains of plant or animal life preserved in ROCK. The rock is black, not the original tooth. No living sharks have teeth of any other color than white, and I'd like the author to find any living fish/animal with black teeth."},{"rating":"1","title":"These guys love to say, \\"gaping maw.\\"","review":"I find it more than a little difficult to believe how many readers fail to see how poorly researched this book is. I nearly collapsed onto the floor with laughter when I came across the point where the shark actually starts rolling on a small patch of marsh in an effort to get to the hapless (or should it be brainless) victims, who sit in the middle and wail for help from those in the boat. Also, if these great ichtyoids are ancestors of today's Great White, then whouldn't it be reasonable to assume that their respiratory systems would be somewhat similar if not the same? There are numerous spots in the sequence of events where the Megalodon is just hovering motionless in--and even out of--the water. I am well aware of the fact that many species of shark can lay on the bottom and push water past their gills, White Sharks are not one of these, therefore it would be much more believable if the Meg was the same way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Summer read for the Beach","review":"An interesting plot. What if an extinct great white existed. A shark larger than most yachts. What if when it takes a victim the mouth is so large that there are no body parts? It may keep you from the ocean for a while as you wonder just what is that shadow in the water I saw? My only difficulty with the story is that the author does not describe the surroundings well. This makes it more difficult to develop a visual image of just what is going on at sea"},{"rating":"2","title":"In defense of the author...","review":"I have already reviewed this book and declared it to have shortcomings; however, I did have a fairly lengthy e-mail conversation with Mr. Wilson regarding this book, and he acknowledged he did not put the necessary description or feeling into the book to make as mesmerizing as it could have been. I hope all of you who give this book horrendous reviews will realize just how much work the author did put into this though he fell into a human failing of not adequately capturing our interest. I doubt any of us could have approached the creativity level of this or any of his books, and I feel Mr. Wilson deserves much credit for his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid Killer Shark Novel","review":"I read this book back in 1999, along with Steve Alten's Meg and The Trench. At that time I was only 12 years of age (I am 24 now). Also, I was, and still am, highly interested and in love with sharks (I attend Millersville University and have two semesters left for my Bachelors of Science in Marine Biology). While Meg, before Alten edited the book, was poorly written it was fast paced and had more plausible science. The Trench was much better especially the writing. Extinct is dreadful. Black teeth? Rolling on a marsh? 200 foot shark? Growling shark? Swimming up freshwater? Grenade death? Charles Wilson, maybe you should have done a little more research.As to the two reviewers on here with their \\"shark sense knowledge\\", lets clear some issues up.In Meg, the Charadon megalodon is surviving in the abyss. Its glow is from bioluminescense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"I Read this book in 4 weeks.I liked the whole book,but I thought the ending could have been better.I wished there would have been more attacks and more chases.I really like the idea of a 200 foot long shark.Now I want to tape the miniseries when it comes on.Reading this book makes me want to read MEG and THE TRENCH by Stephen Alten.Now I want to learn all I can about the Megalodon.Don\`t be suprised if you hear of Megalodons surfacing at a beach near you.I live in Southern Louisiana,not that far from where this story takes place.As a message to all Megalodons out there,you can come but I\`ll be ready and waiting.Come and get me."},{"rating":"1","title":"AT TIMES EXCTING BUT TOO OFTEN SLOW PACED","review":"I found EXTINCT was excting at times but often more times than not I found myself wanting to do something else. I found this book too unrealistic at times i.e. the length of the megaladons that are described, especially at the end when the 200 foot long giants appear. Now I know we don't realistically know how big the megaldons really grew. But I found that length to be a bit much. Also I really couldn't relate to the characters at all. .They just didn't grab me and make want to rally behind them. Also, I doubt megladons would leave any part of a human being behind. since 6 grown men can fit in thier jaws. I believe this is could be, or may have been the shark that swallowed Jonah whole in the bible . All in all, in all I can't really recommend Extinct."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Jaws","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Although some of the ideas were far fetched;Sharks communicating vocally; many of the facts in the book seemed right on the mark. I would recommend this book to any shark enthusiasts who believe the possible existence of Megalodon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giant shark thriller is missing giant thrills.","review":"A big (and I do mean BIG) shark goes up river and begins feeding on swimmers and fishers in Biloxi, Mississippi. The book is as silly as it sounds.I will give Mr. Wilson the benefit of his obvious hard wark in researching how something like this could possibly happen, but sadly he does not manage to make his story easy to swallow, nor does he make it very suspenseful. Attacks happen, people either narrowly escape or are swallowed whole. It is hard to care either way. Also there is a twist, but anyone who has had a steady diet of this kind of material will see it coming from a hundred pages away. Reading this it is far too easy to see why NBC scuttled the mini-series. There really isn't enough material for a good saturday night movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked MEG, well here's a BIGGER ONE!!!!!","review":"After reading Steve Alten's \\"Meg\\" I got into a sort of shark frenzy, and when I heard there was another book out there with the same subject matter I immediately purchased it on that premise alone. Charles Wilson's Extinct takes a much more serious approach, although slower paced. Also the design of the Megalodon here is a tad bit more plausible, and a hell of a lot bigger than the one found in Alten's book! The ending was great, no matter what you've heard. For fans of Jaws, Meg, Deep Blue Sea and any other sea creature book or movie out there here's another one to add to your list. And remember, if something bumps you while swimming in the ocean you never know what it might be...!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this book made me cry","review":"I had originally bought this with two other books.The other two being Meg and The Trench.I read this book first and it was just a disgrace to the shark itself.Besides switching scenes every other sentence the author treated the shark as nothing but a soulless beast. i read up to the last five pages and couldnt bring myself to even finish the book because it was so bad.

The author does however waste too much time with the smaller 25 feet megalodons. Jaws was the same size, so this is not new territory. The real monsters don't show up until the very end. The idea of these monsters in shallow fresh water is new and pretty scary. Extinct is the better book, but MEG will be the better motion picture. In movies, you don't need much of a plot or deep character development"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously implausible, a mass-market jest.","review":"The premise for \\" Extinct \\" is tired and over played. How many more novels concerning killer sharks need we have? The book is well researched, the authou obviously having taken great pains to learn about his subject, the prehistoric chacarodon megalodon, ancestor of the great white shark. Then he mixes in the factual aspects of the fish with the rest of the book in such a way one gets the feeling the scenes were written after the rest of the book and added later. Any ties to the megalodon as it was are brutally severed in a premise so hackneyed one wonders why the author bothered to ground it in reality. A potentially good tale is flushed away in uninteresting charachterizations and murky action sequences. In addition, this novel was a miserable choice for an NBC special, which the cover advertises"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good quick read.","review":"This book didn't have my attention for a while but when it finally did grab ahold of it the book was great. It flowed well, I like Wilson's writing style, short paragraph after short paragraph, you can put the book down and get right back into it that way.The book lacks some of the details of other Marine thrillers but the book doesn't suffer without them, in fact after reading many marine books the biology bits just get in the way.All in all the books reads as a typical book like this would except it has alot more action and suspense then other books of its type, it is definatly a good read, you will find you read it very quickly due to the action scenes which have you hooked to the book.4 Stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wasn't expecting a documentary.. were you?","review":"Implausible? Maybe. But I still had one helluva time reading this book. It may have a some innacuracies andmay stretch the limits of believablility, but it does what it set out to do: it created some genuinely shockng and terrifying attacks. MEG may have been better, but this book takes the prize as far as sheer horror goes. Plenty of guesome attacks.As for the characters and all the filler material that take up the space between attacks, it isn't so bad. The characters don't bear the same grim reality that the ones in Jaws did, but I care about them when they are in danger. And there is plenty of that for all the characters. I can definatly understand why so many people hated this book on account of the characters and beleivability, but for a 6 dollar paperback, the shark horror is worth it"},{"rating":"2","title":"I looked for months for this book, it was worth the wait!","review":"This book was a page turner.

A little bit predictable. When hunting for the shark, it comes right a way. Somehow, a little too convenient. But it was a fun read. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I felt although this book was good, some of it was unlikely.","review":"I read Extinct last summer and after reading Steve Alten's Meg this morning would like to comment on it. Though Wilson certainly lacks the clarity of view of men such as Robert E. Howard and Edgar Rice Burroughs, he does present a very entertaining, scary read. At first, the novel seemed perfectly plausible though in the second half, I felt it began to stretch credibility with a shark foraging up the Mississippi and finally a pair of 200-foot sharks appearing for the finale. Despite these perceived shortcomings, though, I felt it was well worth my time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"The most realistic, scarey thriller I've ever read. It'll make you think--twice before you step in the ocean."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a edge-of your-seat, fast-paced story","review":"I read this after reading MEG, a book by Steve Alten. Both books are about the extinct shark, and both are excellent. Although they are told in different ways, in different locations. Extinct hits close to home though, it is easier to put yourself into the character's place while reading when you're reading about things happening in places you may have visited.I reccomend both Extinct and MEG as good summer reads. ="},{"rating":"1","title":"PLENTY OF TEETH....BUT NO BITE!","review":"I hit EXTINCT with plenty of excitement because as a certifiable \\"Aqua-Phobe\\" I just love shark books.Mr. Wilson does a nice job of keeping the early suspense and really delivering on some nice deaths along the way (minors being eaten is always the sign of someone who is throwing P.C. out the window)...come on that's why you read a shark book...for the body count!But sadly, the book swims off course near the last 25 pages and ends with a very silly turn of events...too silly to even hint at (but monster film fans of the 60's may have a shot at it).Of all the shark books I've read...Extinct really comes up lacking. So if you're in need to be scared out of the water...stick to THE TRENCH, MEG, or the much overlooked HUNGER and make your thoughts of reading Extinct...well extinct! (pun intended)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"Extinct, like Steve Alten's Meg, concerns the modern existence of the Carcharadon megalodon. Beyond that, the similarties really end.The probability of this book is slightly lower than that of Meg--a C.megalodon working its way into the Mississippi River--but the writing style and character development make up for any plotholes. The ending is done especially well, and could actually make your brain hurt over the possibilities.Given the choice between this and Meg, I think I'd recommend Extinct first. And before it's too late: NBC is intending to release one of their notorious miniseries, tainting the original story forevermore...--Gremlinwww.gremlin.net"},{"rating":"2","title":"How America Was Built","review":"Extreamely interesting book about the tools that helped build America.

It was a nail-biter to the end, with so much invested in the characters. Clem Sheutz is a street smart kid from a 50's Cincinnati neighborhood of German Immigrants. In the main story line, he is in his 20's fighting in the Cuban revolution - just because he's nothing else to do. After witnessing a brutal hanging of a woman, he loses touch with reality. He tries to grasp onto some sense of self by reconnecting with his past. Meibers effectively uses flashbacks to critical moments of Clem's life, that shed light on his unexpected reactions to those he's reunited with from his past. You see an otherwise hopeless life mature into a character that you want to see come out for the better on the other side. This maturation is frustrated by many of those who he's reunited with. An enjoyable read. Great characters and fine details that immerse the reader in story."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent story, an excellent first novel","review":"\\"Steal Away Home\\" is my kind of book. Richard Meibers tells his story in a direct, uncomplicated style that leads us through the events of his tale in the emotional and sensual manner in which we actually experience events. Meibers avoids the pitfall of intellectualizing, but in the simple telling of his story he evokes from the reader's imagination some profound questions. I found myself empathizing with Clem Scheutz and feeling his effort and longing to find his way out of the maze of insanity and pain into which he was born. This is an excellent first novel, and I'm looking forward to hearing more from Mr. Meibers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice lenses","review":"I like that the protection filter is threaded so you can screw a conversion lens right over it, rather than having to use one or the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought this book","review":"and even my close friends noted the change!You can\`t believe how easy it is to enhance your personality until you have read this!SO EASY!SO PROFITABLE !"},{"rating":"2","title":"COMO SER CUIDADOSOS EN NUESTRA PERSONA","review":"Es muy importante ser cuidadosos en nuestro arreglo personal, ya que de eso depende que nos puedan dar un trabajo de acorde a como nos ven..

The countertop cleaner really bothered me most of all, because it would be on my food eating and prepping surfaces.The more I was around it the more it bothered me. I would even say it was overwhelming on my table while I ate and the fragrance got into the food when I used it on my butcher block.My wife also got the hand soap and having just used it I found that it too caused me some flushed feeling. So I decided I should share my experience. I have never written a product review before, but I've decided I find the claim of natural and \\"green\\" to be a bit misleading.

I cleaned my countertop with a few squirts of this spray several hours ago, and the smell was overpowering! It was like I had spilled an entire bottle of perfume (not good perfume, either -- more like eau de grandma).

The scent/fumes were overwhelming and I had to open the window and step out of the room. Today I tried using it on my kitchen counters and again I found the scent much too strong.

This stuff smells great and works much better than the Windex product I have been using on my granite countertop. Upon receiving Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day Counter Top Spray (box of 6), I tried it out right away. At first I thought the smell was a bit strong, but then, between the results I was seeing and the fun I was having, the smell got much sweeter. Then, my husband came home and asked what smelled so good. Well, as we all know, that is the true test. He thought it smelled good, and immediately noticed how shiny the countertops were.I was unstoppable and continued cleaning. I love this stuff!

I was very happy to find that I could get some more of it, and at a decent price too. It cleans off the counter very well, and I actually enjoy using this because the scent is heavenly!I also have the Mrs Meyers liquid soap in lemon verbena, which is wonderful too.

No thanks.","review":"I'm sorry, but all the run-on sentence/paragraphs without any commas or anything even drove me nutty! This book totally brought me back to 1997 considering all the music and fashion mentioned (in which I was a teenager at that time as well). It was nice that they gave you so many perspectives in this book. Sadly though, I was bored out of my mind. I was glad this was such a fast and short read. I couldn't even attach myself to the characters. I was extremely surprised to find that this book did so very well in Austrailia. The poetic pieces were wonderful in the book but I just had a hard time enjoying this. I also think that it lacked realism by making everything so happy for everyone in the end of the book. I don't think things always turn out that way considering how the characters are described throughout it. It was like everything had a quick fix suddenly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably good for beginners","review":"What I received was not what I had been expecting. As someone who already has a basis with the MBTI, this book was overly simplified for my tastes: too short, filled with figures and tables.

I thought it was my kids not shutting it all the way, but then it kept dripping more and more. Decided to take it out and lo and behold, one of the O-Rings had a small tear allowing water thru. So this time I bought the Moen replacement. Time will tell if that one leaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope you like your roommates...","review":"Because this product requires me to shower with a friend... and not even in a fun way.The tension in the cartridge is weaker than the Moen's. This causes the weight of the shower head nozzle to drift downward/ not stay in place while taking a shower. And it moves pretty quick.After trying two of these with no change in results, I just ordered a Moen replacement cartridge instead. Until it arrives, me and my wife switch off holding the shower handle in place while the other quickly prepares for the day. When the wife sneezed in the shower this morning, I was treated with scalding hot water across the body.Unless you're looking for an unpleasant way to lure your roommate into the shower with you, I'd spend the few extra bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Moen one instead","review":"We bought this less than a year ago.

He will listen to it as many times in a row as I or daddy will read it. He knows large portions of it by heart.

I especially enjoyed it since I was a football manager last year when this book was being written, so I remember all of the events in the book. It's also written so casually, which is fantastic. Not many books refer to people as \\"a cool cat.\\" And it often shows Coach Willingham with his guard down a little; just relaxing. Nobody ever sees that side of him, but he's a really cool guy.

While going through the book, I found that, the author has rightly focussed on the most fundamental aspect of wireless communications i.e. maximizing the capacity and at the same time getting rid of effects of radio propagation channels. Not only the author presents the text superbly supported with mathematical explanations but also uses felicitously chosen examples from the gamut of wireless technology to put forth the concepts.

While explaining time and frequency coherence, they show an equation with a factor of 4 in the denominator and then later say in the following text- 'many people use a factor 1 instead of 4, the important thing is to recognize that ....the relationship is reciprocal '.Furthermore, the authors do not understand the theoretical implications of an underspread channel. A statement in the book reads:'This is the so called underspread channel'with no further explanation.I don't expect this description from a UC Berkeley or UI Urbana Champaign faculty. A solid joint time frequency analysis of the wireless channel is missing.A lot of mathematics is presented in the chapters on MIMO. An intuitive presentation of the MIMO channel using fundamental random processes is still missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbalanced","review":"The book claims to present a system's view on wireless communications.

Other than that, the storyline was okay. Mathayus wants to avenge his father's death, so he trains for six years. When he comes back, the man who killed hid dad became king.

Songs like \\"Leader of the Pack\\" and \\"Give Him a Great Big Kiss\\" were never intended to be heard in stereo when they were recorded, and the manufacturers of this disc took absolutely no care in remixing the original mono recordings of these singles.

When I saw this disc, I thought it was a straight reissue of the previous RPM collection (which is the one I have). The first collection doesn't have \\"Simon Says\\"/\\"Simon Speaks\\", which this does, so all I've got to say is...HUH? Was there not enough room for all four songs(who knows, maybe there wasn't)?

I was so excited to see this book and I just knew it was going to be worth the wait. While this book started out fairly interesting, this quickly changed. The pace was too slow. Too many details, not enough story. I found myself skipping to future chapters to see what was going to happen and to see if it was worth my time to finish this boring book. It wasn't.

It has to do with this author's lack of skill.She repeatedly shows us the physical trappings of wealth in a cumbersome, awkward way. The way she writes of a \\"shiny white Lexus\\", a \\"three story house\\", and even ice cubes from a refrigerator's \\"built-in dispenser\\" seem like the writing of a pre-teen who has never actually seen any of these things, but imagines that they must be amazing.Others have mentioned the pacing. Much of this is due to bizarre details that add absolutely nothing to the story. Why do we need to know that she put on sweat pants and a matching t-shirt to get the mail? At times, she enumerates her character's every move: she opens the door, walks inside, turns around, closes the door, walks into the foyer. None of these details are useful in any way.In all, it's a useful way to eat up a few hours, but only if you enjoy trying to edit for the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just was not feeling it.","review":"I just could not get into this book.

This was utter trash. Apart from my personal opinions on interracial relationships, the book didn't flow well and I've read creative writing stories by sixth graders that were better than this.The characters were weak, soap opera-ish and one-dimensional. I realize that sometimes fact is stranger than fiction, but come on...Who in their right mind (some of you know what I mean when I say \\"right mind\\") would run into the arms of a white man when their spouse has left them for a white person, goes to work everyday to be betrayed by white folks and then in the end is still pushed aside by said white man?Every page seemed to be a PSA for the Rainbow Coalition as well as justification and rationalization.

I was enjoying the plot of discrimination at the workplace and even the feelings that the main character had vis-a-vis her husband leaving her for a white woman. However, I felt that her love affair with Frank Coletti was way too rushed to believe that her feelings were genuine. The ending seemed to be very rushed and left me with a much unfulfilled feeling. The only reason I give this book 2 stars is because it builds up well. Other than that it's a big let down. Do not read this book unless you mind feeling frustrated at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Reality Check","review":"This book should be read by all colors. It shows that there is still racism in the work place no matter how high on the ladder you are. this book was easy reading but not as good as her others.

I also think Anisa was a winer. Why was it so important that she get that particiuar position? In real life when management is against the applicant getting a position, it leads to nothing but stress. No matter how well you do the job, it won't be good enough which means very bad performance evaluations.

Initially early on the author states clearly what the issues are for the main character, so seemingly one would think that the plot would move quickly. However, this wasn't case and even half way through the novel the main character was still naively having the same dialogue about the same issues without moving towards any hint of a resolution. I grew increasingly fatigued by the single character narrative and the constant dialogue with the same characters about the same issues.It was as if Roby got stuck and didn't know how to move her main character, Anise, along.

Although Ms. Roby tackled some very important issues in the workplace the story line was very weak. It didn't immediately grab my attention and the book just seemed to have dragged on and on.

This is the most influential book I've read since graduate school. Campolo does a superb job of pointing out how the world views evangelicals and all the baggage that comes with the term. He proposes to the reader to replace the term evangelical with the term \\"red-letter Christian\\" as a way to help Christians define themselves instead of being at the mercy of the media and the general consensus of the public. Campolo tackles hot-button issues with much precision and thoughtfulness. He is truly a prophetic voice in our world today. I've given away several copies already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Letter from a ... ?","review":"Campolo has a long reputation in crying foul concerning the evangelical church in America. In Letters, if one gets past Campolo's \\"Red Letter Christian\\" agenda, there are some poignant observations. Favorite targets are the Southern Baptist Convention (role of women, non-Pentecostal orientation), and dispensationalism (end-times pessimism).Campolo displays the same animus towards \\"Evangelicals\\" as liberal/secular critics with a surprising lack of perspective for someone who is supposed to be in the loop. If the kingdom of God was truly manifesting itself (Campolo is a postmillenialist), then why is he so critical of the vast majority, and why are there so few \\"Red Letter Christians\\" (apparently this is a catchphrase he has come up with himself)? One can only conclude that folks with his view are solely responsible for the Kingdom's so-called advance.

Are the ideas Bright is attached to in support of or in opposition to inerrancy, infallibility and inspiration of the Bible?If it is that Bright stands in support of those issues, then I will certainly be interested in his work. If however he is opposed to them, then I would not at all be interested, for I do not care to be reading 'Christian Evangelical' works on the Word of God that do not espouse precisely those issues.Since when is anyone qualified to comment on the bible who does not hold to its being precisely the Word of God?"},{"rating":"1","title":"screwholes","review":"It is missing info on the screwhole distance.

A lot of the cheesiness many associated with the genre has been eliminated, and now many are having a change of heart. An album like Frantic 2002, is what is causing this sudden change of heart. Disc 1 is mixed by Andy Farley, one of the most popular Hard Dance DJ's in Europe and his mix is as furious as it is relentless. Nick Sentience's \\"E-Trigger\\" and Mauro Picotto's updated version of \\"Pulsar\\" pave the way in Farley's mix. Not to be outdone, Phil Reynolds does the dirty work on disc 2 and the mix takes on a more trance-ier edge. Reynolds' own cut \\"Vinyl Addiction\\" takes the cake on his mix. The combination of Farley and Reynolds was a great idea, and both of their mixes will keep the masses listening to the Frantic and Nukleuz labels, but more importantly this package will drive the Hard Dance genre to new levels of respectability."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WRV200 has issues...","review":"I am terribly disappointed with the WRV200 (running firmware 1.0.32.2) and wish I had read these reviews prior to purchasing.

It's really no surprise at this price, but for those of you who aren't experiencing trouble, I would invite you to try using FTP or ICQ for more than 2 hours...good luck.Support is non-existant, and if you search Google for 'WRV200 reviews' or 'WRV200 FTP problem' you'll quickly see why Linksys is in no hurry to help you...get in line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"These things are HUGE!!!

So disappointing!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better choices...","review":"I fyou want to know about Sandy Koufax, there are better written books to choose from than this. While factually, there are interesting nuggets about the amazing pain and endurance that marked his career (300 innning seasons, 250 pitch 13 inning complete games with bone spurs and arthritis), this book was sorely in need of a qualified editor.I found the flashback style terribly distracting, as if the book was written while watching \\"For the Love of the Game\\". Also, Mr Gruver's tendency to state a point in his own voice, and follow it with identical quotes from 3 other people. Repetitive and unnecessary.The writer has had no input from Koufax, and as such is reiterating old interviews. there's nothing new here.So if you're new to the story, the factual info is all there, but there's got to be a better way to get a grip on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Koufax Was Great, This Book Was Not","review":"I learned a great deal about Sandy Koufax by reading this book. But unfortunately, author Edward Gruver intersperses details from many time periods, without making making it clear what time he is talking about at any given point. There are many editorial conventions ( dashes or stars between paragraphs, two spaces between paragraphs instead of one ) that would have made it clear that we are moving to another thought, or here, another time period. Gruver, or his editor ( was there one? ) does not use any of these conventions, so details get lost in a mishmosh.How can you write about a perfectionist athlete, and not pay attention to details in a book about that athlete? Nontheless, the book had some interest to me, as I learned many facts about this great athlete. Gruver is not a bad writer in spots, but this book clearly looks like it was \\" mailed in \\", with minimal if any editing done on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do justice to the man","review":"Koufax was the greatest, he deserves a better book. I suspect that some of the more positive reviews posted are more a reflection of the reviewers' feelings about Koufax, rather than the book. This book is poorly written and incredibly boring. How any writer could make the subject of Sandy's brilliant career boring is beyond me. But Gruver finds a way. The writing is dry and disorganized, there is little flow to the material, too many meaningless quotes from others are included without sufficent editing, and a plethora of unimportant details not only overwhelm the narative but are frequently repeated, sometimes three or four times. I've just ordered Jane Leavy's book, it's got to be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sousa Marches On Today","review":"I was delighted to hear these remastered Sousa marches.They were true to the sound of antique Sousa recordings without the scratches and needle noise.These give me insight into American military band music of today.If you are a fan of military band music, buy this record.It is of great and pleasant value."},{"rating":"2","title":"colin\\"s opinion","review":"I found this item to be very good the sound was crisp and the songs were well presented and enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Disappointed, the last of the recording is of very poor quality.

Also part of a larger history when you research the March King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sousa","review":"I'm not buying this CD. I don't believe Sousa ever recorded. It was members of his band most likely conducted by Pryor who did. Also, it was not the full instrumentation because of the limited space in the recording studio. Sousa was not in favor of \\"canned\\" music because of the negative effect it had on live music. Also, some of the tracks on this CD were not written by Sousa. There is an excellent series on Naxos by Keith Brion up to Volume 8 (and counting) which is recording not only marches, but other great Sousa compositions. Keith attempts to duplicate Sousa's actual performance technique as closely as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music Different than stated","review":"This was a total disappointment and had to be returned.First the music on this CD--was not the music listed .Very poor sound on the CD.Stay away from this garbage !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Protestant family life as loving and liberating for all members","review":"Excellent historical study of marriage and family during the Reformation that combats the typical PC doctrine of university history departments (\\"the Reformation was oppressive to women!\\") by bringing German and Swiss primary source documents to bear on the subject.

My order was received in a very timely manner also. I would not hesitate to use this vendor again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiration from a Friend","review":"Reading My Naked Journey is like sitting down with a great friend and having her tell you interesting stories that openly and honestly illustrate her thoughts on life, love, authenticity, embarrassing moments and more. It is thought provoking as well as an inspiration to be the best person you can be -- while never asking for perfectionism or that anyone be anything other than her authentic self.Maureen's stories are entertaining, open, honest, and real. There is no pretense or posturing, just an open-hearted sharing of the human condition and some of the challenges we face. The stories are short, so it is a book you can read straight through or a little at a time. Or you can do what I did and read straight through and then go back and read them one at a time. It's a book that I'll read many times over -- each time I pick up something that I hadn't seen before. Some of the ideas I want to keep coming back to and exploring.It's a lovely book -- I hope you enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, Written from the heart","review":"Maureen has written this book from her heart.

It is a completely different system... I haven't been sick at all since exercising with it!

The author doesn't tell where he learned this or give any other information about its history. The instructions regarding breathing are sometimes confusing. The illustrations are small and the text sometimes leaves out instructions about when to keep moving your feet and hold your breath. I think that this guy is only interested in making money because now he travels around offering private instruction... If he didn't have exclusive dibs on a \\"secret art,\\" then he'd probably be back on the corner."},{"rating":"1","title":"reviews to sell???","review":"well i've just started reading this book. I'm completely new to the field of Nei Gung/Chi Gung and such...while reading this book i came back on Amazon to read the reviews again to find what specifically in the book did each reviewer benefit from, and I accidently stumbled on this...all reviewers with 5 star rating have one review and that is for this book...having seen that I can only assume someone is keen on selling more of this book...that is sad...cause I've now lost half of my interest in this book however good it may eventually turn out to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe not so secret! New agey stuff.","review":"The review system is somewhat mysterious to me. The best review on this book is \\"Secret art??\\" by a California reviewer. Nonetheless that review has a very poor feed-back. The reviewer said that this is Chi Gung and HE IS RIGHT! Just go get a couple of books about Chi Gung and see it for yourself. The author's claim that this is an UNIQUE art not are proven. The author says so but he doesn't prove it. The unique lineage he claims is not described at all. Author's claim that this is a 10000 years old art is ridiculous because the oldest writing records, the cuneiform, date back 5000 years. This having said, this is not a terribly bad book. If you you wrecked your body because of neglection, it may help you out. The author clearly knows about motivational arguments. The ninja-stuff art cover is really cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic, delicious food","review":"Having grown up in Egypt, I had no idea what I took for granted. Delicious stuffed tomatoes, fresh lemony salads, vine leaves, meat stews. It's such a pleasure to find a book that allows me to recreate these meals I had back at home. It's easy to follow and the ingredients are readily available here in the States. I recommend this book for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intiguing & darkly mystical action/adventure tale","review":"Steven Barnes has written alot of good, solid science fiction over the years -- and he uses that experience here to build a contemporary mystical fantasy adventure that entertains, intrigues and engages you completely. Iron Shadows makes forays into the darkly mystical world of cults & sexual magic, while maintaining a James Bondian plotline and reaching deep into the frailties of human interactions. The erotic tension and gripping issues make this a hard book to put down. My only amazement is that in all the explorations of human sexuality -- the only character that crosses over the standard straight stereotypes is the \\"evil\\" villain. Trite, but it doesn't destroy the quality of the remainder of the novel. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting Topic written with Barnes usual flair","review":"Steven Barnes has a been personal favorite of mine ever since I read \\"Streetlethal\\". Barnes is an avid Martial Artist and student of eastern philosophy whose considerable knowledge in both of these subjects shows in his stories. If you are interested at all in either of these subjects you will definitely enjoy this book. On a story level, Barnes' plots are usually not too complex; however he is a master at characterization and he really makes you care what happens to his characters.

This PPV is like a Sci Fi show and should have not even taking place. Ive seen Lashley wrestle live and the guy stinks; He's a modern day mix of Ultimate Warrior and Ahmed Johnson.

That is the overarching theme of this 70s political thriller. America is in dire financial straits, with a falling dollar and stagnant economy. A major US aerospace company, buffeted by these trends, finds that it can save itself at the cost of selling out America. Foreign powers maneuver to take advantage of the faltering United States. This novel, while containing details that are anachronistic today, nevertheless has an eerie relevance as we watch the dollar plunge, gold skyrocket, and America become uncertain of itself in the 2011 time frame. Highly recommended. RJB."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not thrilled","review":"I wasn't completely thrilled with this product but it wasn't very expensive.

I would highly recommend it to any movie score lover. One of Randy Newman's best work and an outstanding film... one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"trailer music","review":"People who were asking about the music in the trailers -- Music you hear in the trailer for a movie is rarely (if ever) the actual music for the movie. This is for two reasons -- (1) the music hasn't been mixed and recorded yet, so it isn't ready when the trailer is ready for theatres, and (2) if the music is finished, it is likely that the copyrights haven't been completed so they won't be able to release the music with the trailer. That's why you'll often hear the score from a familiar movie on the trailer of a new movie. Hope this helps. And Seabiscuit is a wonderful movie with great music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music!!!","review":"First off - to Frank Sloan (first reviewer of this soundtrack), the music you heard in the trailer is from the movie, \\"Rudy.\\" It was used because both movies were under the Universal company.

However, as to another reviewer's claim, there is no relationship to the track from Moby's \\"Play\\" release. Aside from both songs having been recorded with nylon-string guitars, I'm not sure how the two could be confused. The ASIN number for the \\"All The Pretty Horses\\" CD is B000056KYJ.

The author selects several disasters and analyses the technical and psychological factors that caused them. Although names are named and mistakes are identified as such, the book is objective and does not cast participants as stupid or slovenly (mostly) as some books are prone to do. Instead, it provides thoughtful insights into how even seemingly qualified and concerned people make errors that lead to accidents.

I have small hands and some of the other fancy hooks are too heavy for me. You don't have to grip this hook so tight as it won't slip in your fingers.

Reading this book and studying it with a group was so valuable. The book lends itself to discussion based on one to two chapters per meeting so it is easy to read and prepare. Studying and talking about the cornerstones of Jesus' prayer life with others is an excellent way to really get the best from this book and its realistic suggestions for improving prayer in our daily lives.

Actually this is an e.p., but it still feels like a loss. Suffocation has always meant business wether it was shoving gutteral Death Metal vocals down your throat, or crussing your rib cage with an assault of double-bass drums and blastbeats enough to level the entire city of New York City. This is Suffocation which also means it's well worth your money. I thought this was their best one to date. It's very technical and very brutal. Not to mention the sample in the beginning of \\"Funeral Inception\\" is just worth the cd itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"The fact that so many people consider this Suffocation's best says a lot about the mentality of your average death metal fan. Pierced from Within is, without question, one of the most musically accomplished death metal albums ever made. Rhythmically complex, but also tonally sophisticated, with a use of dissonance and harmonic sensibility that I have never heard elsewhere in death metal. And beyond that, the songs retained a visceral power and immediacy that almost all technical death metal bands lose. You can listen to the album 30 times and still discover new things.For Suffocation to turn around and write this is a complete disgrace. It's nothing but generic death metal, with simple structures and riffs designed only to be catchy and brutal. Sure, it has a huge and intense sound, but that's all it has. Sadly, it seems that most Suffocation fans never heard more than that in Pierced from Within either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great band right here!!","review":"Very impressive stuff that suffocation brings to you! I love this album and i was happy when i saw them live because they gave an amazing performance...

I cannot imagine who designed this tray or why anyone tries to sell it.My first day was indicative of things to come. I pushed the tray back under the desk and the tray and the keyboard fell on the floor. A rubber bumper designed to stop the tray broke (or at least fell out). I slid the tray back in the holder. The next time, I tried to turn the tray out of the way and the same thing happened. Another rubber bumper fell to the floor.The tray is not wide enough for a standard keyboard and a mouse pad. Therefore, the makers attach a mouse pad that hangs down from the tray. Unfortunately, it has to be separately pulled out and pushed back. After a little while, it tilted so much that the mouse regularly fell to the floor. Finally, it fell to the floor.I gave up. My return for credit period had expired but I sent it back to Amazon to get it out of my house.I bought the 3M tray and have had no trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this keyboard tray.","review":"Pros: Great price, various adjustments for ergonomics.Cons: slight wobble if you are a heavy handed typist.I actually own two of these trays, and I bought this one to replace one that after years (7 years) of service finally broke. I looked at others but chose this since I was familiar with the feel and handling of this model. I looked at the others and felt that they were either too simple or too elaberate and expensive.The ergonics for this keyboard tray is very good. You can adjust the height and the tilt of the keyboard. And when you're done, you can slide it under the table and/or swivel it out of the way. And the mouse surface fold away under the tray.My one complaint of this or any other keyboard tray is if you are a heavy handed typist like me, it will wobble or bounce a little. I got used to it but I rather have it on a tabletop if at all possible. But if you don't have room or if your table is too high, I highly recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fellowes keyboard review","review":"I like the product. The only issues I have with it are that the mouse tray is a bit flimsy and sits a bit too low in relation to the keyboard tray.

I wish that there was a little more flexibility in positioning and movement, but it definitely is serving it's purpose.

Stove dissects some of the major, largely forgotten philosophical movements of the past, with the aim of showing where they went wrong--and of casting light into the darker fallacies of contemporary philosophy. His list of forty statements about the number three that embody distinct kinds of error in thinking, for most of which we don't even have labels, was hilarious and disturbing at the same time--a fitting end for this eccentric book. Anyone who finds philosophical questions compelling ought to be able to get something out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mad magazine of Modern Philosophy","review":"Combining brilliant hyperbole with caustic understatement, Stove recouts the horrors and madness of two and half thousands years of philosophical nonsense from Plato to Hegel, Kant, Poper and Kuhn.

But the only thing out there is his no-budget 1999 ripoff of the Michelle Pfeiffer Midsummer Night's Dream (mmm, detect a pattern here?). It's out there, but only in the sense that it rushes through the play badly with just the same complete inability to understand what its actually about that his Wells' fiasco has. Add bad production values, non-existant editing and direction and all you've got is one long deceased Bard of Avon rotating in his grave.The best you can say for this sorry soggy effort is that if you hated Timbo's War of the Worlds, you'll hate this, and that if you loved Timbo's War of the Worlds - well, then you must be Timbo Hines."},{"rating":"1","title":"The authors should get real, and better informed","review":"I found this book not only insulting to most women's intelligence and lifestyles, but, in some cases, just plain uninformed! Where did all this hysteria about an occasional cup of coffee (or an occasional treat for that matter) come from? My doctor just shook his head when I asked him about some of the ridiculous guidelines. And what sorts of jobs do these women have to suggest carrying wheat germ to business lunches to sprinkle on food in restaurants? Get a clue!

We all want to eat well when we are pregnant to ensure a healthy mother and baby, but this book sets impossible standards for the average woman to follow. Anyone who shops at a normal grocery store will find this book's guidelines hard to follow.

My wife and I went out and got an arm full of books and this was one of them. The positive side is that it did seam to provide some good recommendations for what to eat and what to avoid. It also gave us a good idea on the special health and nutrition issues for pregnant women. What we did not like is it seams that this book should have come with an overbearing adult wagging her finger at you. I don't think we needed or cared for the tone the book had about the authors militant views on what not to eat - is 1 coke really going to be that bad? 50 years ago women worked in the fields or factories all day, smoked and drank like fish and we all turned out ok. Overall a nice overview with some good recipes, but if you are aggravated by being talked down to then I would look someplace else."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sets impossible standards","review":"This book sets impossible standards and makes you feel guilty.

Eat lots of fruit, but scrub everything first with soap and water and then peel all fruit so you don't expose your baby to more harmful chemicals. And my all time favorite, don't eat any sweets or bad foods, but if you absolutely must, you bad, selfish, weak person, limit them to once a week. This includes a piece of white bread, an ice cream cone, or a muffin made with sugar and less-refined grains. Being pregnant is to be paranoid enough. These women are alarmists.

It's an excellent book. It implies work and strong will, and also sacrifice, but if you want your baby to get the best of everything, you'll have to work for it - it's not for free. To me, all efforts are worth my baby's health. I highly recommend it to expectant mothers who are unselfish and smart enough to work for the health of their babies. This book will either make you change your eating habits and have a healthy pregnancy resulting in a healthy baby, or hate the authors (or maybe yourself for not being able to meet the standards)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a saint could follow it. . .","review":"It was a very difficult diet to follow, and this from someone who was already seeing a nutritionist during pregnancy. If it had MORE recipies to help you eat the stuff they want you to eat, that would improve the book a great deal. But dont dismiss the herbal tea claims outright. It is very easy to cause an abortion through the right combinations of herbs. I know people who did it on purpose (a combo of certain herbs and vitamins) and have had it happen to me, once, also. Use it for a guideline to help yourself eat healthier, but I cant see anyone following it to the letter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy this is tough to follow!","review":"This book includes the strictest diet I have ever seen!

I recently gave birth to a healthy 9 lb baby, and looking back the suggestions in this book are arrogant and offensive. Pregnant people gain weight at different rates, and this book takes a very judgemental attitude toward people who gain more than the \\"recommended\\" amount. Pregnant people are beautiful and generally gain weight everywhere, regardless of how carefully they eat. Buying into this unrealistic mindset just sets a prospective mother up for being at the mercy of so-called \\"experts\\". For some people, who live on chips and soda, perhaps this book will be corrective and helpful. For the rest of us, who know better than to drink or smoke or do drugs or live exclusively on bacon and doughnuts when pregnant, our time preparing for the birth of our children can be much better spent than by reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What to eat when you are expecting","review":"I have not received this book yet. I ordered it over a month ago!"},{"rating":"1","title":"you gotta be joking","review":"I read this book in conjunction with it's companion, What to Expect When Your Expecting, it was just plain silly. To begin with the recipes were not good. My dog wouldn't eat the things they had me make, and unless you grow your own wheat, and raise your own livestock, this book would have you believe your baby will be born with health problems and you will gain 500lbs. Please. A little common sense goes a long way. DO NOT read this book if this is your first baby or if it's your 10th. Rely on your Dr. or midwife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some parts too simplistic; others much too complex!","review":"This book was a contradiction and a great way to make you feel guilty!!! If you want to blame yourself for anything that goes wrong in pregnancy, -please- read this book. If not, forget it! I especially loved the short little section \\"don't eat for emotional reasons.\\" If you really do eat for emotional reasons (as I do), you need help with changing your mental processes, NOT a short paragraph making you feel even worse about it (which leads to eating more!!). These gals need to live in a real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time & money!","review":"I started reading this book early on in my pregnancy because a friend gave me her used copy. (I now have a healthy 2 month old son.) I was excited to start reading it, and expected some great advice. Not so! This book was a huge let down, and suggested almost impossible standards. No sugar? No white flour?! I don't think I would have made it through 4 months of morning sickness with out my Jell-o and crackers! Don't waste your money. The advice my OB gave me was to limit caffeine & sodium, and snack on fruits and veggies as much as I could. Just follow the advice of your doctor. =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What To Expect When You Buy This Book","review":"I bought this book because I thought it would help me change my eating habits in a healthier way. It certainly didn't.Although they make you believe that it's easy to follow their advices at first; it turns out later that it is not.My husband wanted to help me eating healthy for the baby but changed his mind when he found out how impossible it is.Might be a good book if you know everything about good nutrition already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"A friend of mine actually said her doctor told her to stop reading this book because she was getting so stressed over the completely unrealistic expectations. If I followed all the advice in this book I would need to quit my job and stop calling my friends and family so I could devote my life to reading food labels and farming my own produce.

For example, eating a bagel is considered a \\"cheat\\" and should only be done in extreme moderation (like once a month). I felt that if I tried to follow the eating guidelines set up in this book I would be destined to fail, because they suggest such a strict diet. I doubt that any pregnant woman with normal cravings would succeed according to the authors of this useless book. I quickly gave this one away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patronizing and Insulting","review":"I, too, was happy to discard this book quickly after reading it. The tone is a cross between intolerant and imperious, and the authors clearly suppose that the average woman is completely ignorant of matters regarding health and nutrition. A person who advocates the rigid lifestyle championed in this book is sure to become the type of parent who will make her children absolutely miserable once they are born. Furthermore, the book's haughty condemnation of women who gain more weight \\"than they should\\" embodies the exact mindset that has led to the prevalence of eating disorders and self-loathing among women in our society. As the cover illustration suggests, this book is dated and completely impractical for modern, well-rounded women. In short, the only commendable thing about this book is the delicious irony that the authors, who suppose themselves to be masters of balancing diet and lifestyle, are really ridiculous extremists!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wants to pay good money for 13 year old information","review":"I was so disappointed in this book that I have decided not to buy What to Expect when You're Expecting.

As soon as I got them I went out and bought the battery and a memory card for it. Then I took a walk through the park and shot some pictures with it. They are not crystal sharp pictures, but they're not bad either. For the fun of it, I took a video clip of the flag blowing in the breeze. I stood about 70 yards away from it when I did this, and it came out very well.Keep in mind that whenever a picture is taken from far away, even with a zoom, you will lose quality then if you took a picture close up. For the price, this is a good item. I am rough with my stuff, so I was happy to see that this is well made.I think this is a great buy for the person who loves to hike and doesn't want to lug both a camera and binoculars with them.

In this book, Elen Hawke goes way beyond the usual brief descriptions of waxing, full and waning, covering unusual events such as eclipses as well as the less commonly worked quarter phases. The author, who is also a very experienced astrologer includes chapters on the full moon through the signs of the zodiac, and how this may be utilized magically as well as the Indian lunar zodiac and how the moon's position within it may indicate personality traits. There is even a chapter on the celtic tree calendar which relates to the moons cycle.

Cropsy was an old camp counselor who was the brunt of a prank gone extremely wrong. He was burned badly and left for dead. A few years later however Cropsy has returned for REVENGE! There is some nice gore in this film and a scene in which Cropsy kills four teens in about 10 seconds.The Burning is similar to Friday The 13th in a lot of areas.

I'm not gonna be too specific. The burning starts off with a group of teens at a summer camp that wanna play a trick on a nerdy loser. The trick goes wrong and the loser gets burned up. Flash forward to the present and a new group of teens is attending the camp. People start getting picked off one by one as the loser gets revenge. A lot of pretty good death scenes.

Casablanca is arguably one of the best films ever. And to say Friday the 13th is like that film in comparison to utter swill like The Burning, that's quite a bashing. The greatest detriments have to be the acting and the script. The ONLY reason to watch this refuse is for the raft scene-- admittedly impossible to achieve such carnage with a pair of shears, but still entertaining-- and that's only in the Amazon release, to my knowledge. And you can find that raft massacre on a clip somewhere on the web, so get that instead of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't deserve any accolades","review":"I do not understand why this movie is lauded.During the 80's slasher wave, this fit in pretty well with the usual \\"Friday the 13\\" stuff, but, today, this film looks so cheap and poorly produced. The acting is terrible, the potential victims are simply meat (no character development whatsoever), the villain is hardly menacing and the kill scenes are so fake. The canoe scene is sooooooo ridiculous!If you view this movie as a training ground for up and coming movie makers than I can understand some form of appreciation.

That's a damn shame. Everytime I listen to this record, I am blown away by Tucker's drum work. This guy givers even the great Don Brewer a run for his money. It's also funny how the guitar and keyboard parts seem like they were intended to be psychedelic but end up sounding almost new wave. The closer, \\"Solid Gold Brass\\", is quite possibly the most rocking song ever written. Are they not men? They are Sweet.

Desolation Boulevard is one of my favourite albums and its one that still sounds as good today as over 30 years ago when it was recorded. Technology wasn't available then either so they had to be able to produce the goods for real not rely on sound effects and drum machines and they did so with devastating effect.

This anthology was terrific. If you are tired of Star Wars and Star Trek franchise novels; read this novel. It's where a lot of material was drawn for future movies and films. I can see why William Jenkins (the author's actual name) was called the dean of science fiction.

Would not recharge battery, would not run. TIF (now owned by SPX distress business management...) would not honor the 25 year warranty without the original sales receipt. I bought this unit online several years ago and due to computer replacement no longer had the original invoice. I guess that's their way of avoiding repairs. Nothing to lose so I pulled it apart and found a couple of transistors fried. Oh well, so much for the TIF brand. I purchased a replacement CPS detector instead of messing with the TIF anymore. They have since discontinued this model leak detector and replaced it with a refaced unit. Use extreme caution when purchasing anything with the SPX brand logo on it.

The \\"narrator\\" has a particular problem with figuring out how to use his trunk, which he refers to as his nose, and tells his tale in a manner which I suspect will have children laughing. I found it educational and entertaining. Although apparently a single book, it has the apperance of perhaps being the first in a series of books about animals. If so, I am looking forward to the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Time, Interesting Person","review":"In March of 1941, Butch Voris joined the Navy as a pilot trainee.

The book is just fine at explaining concepts and ideas, and providing test strategies. But the CD is deeply disappointing. The questions are full of errors, many of them simply a matter of poor proofreading (in one, the greater-than sign is reversed into a less-than sign, making the entire question unsolvable). My husband was two questions away from the end of one of the practice tests on the CD when it froze up.

There are many questions in the book which are not addressed in the review section. The Verbal review is TERRIBLE. If you aren't an english major, I guarantee you will not understand what they're talking about. The best part of the book is the review questions, which any other book should be able to provide. The CD-ROM was VERY disappointing. If you're taking the test and want to stop, you can't save and come back to it, you have to take each test all the way through before you can see the answers.

Both the stems were each of the lengths of the same side of the triangle, one being larger than the other.Oddly enough, you cannot find another side to the smaller triangle (or the large one, for that matter) because they did not state that it was a right triangle. Had they stated that, the question would have been right. Instead, it was wrong.There were several questions like this.

In the actual GMAT the tester is presented in with a passage and all questions related to the passage are listed together. Not so on the Barron's CD - the software presents questions related to reading comprehension in random order across the test.

Unfortunately, that's about where it ends. There are very few practice questions, and several of them are incorrect. Additionally, the CD that comes with this version - which nearly doubles the price - is almost completely worthless. The first question of one of the CAT tests had an error which made it unsolvable. On top of that, you can't save your progress if you don't want to do the entire exam.If you see this at a garage sale, by all means, pick it up.

He is very likeable too, and since I live in Palm Beach County, Florida, the site of most of the book's action, that is fun. This character I liked, but the book itself sometimes was a little slow paced. I call it a beach read. Better than ok, but a little lacking. To be sure I will read James O.Born again. His stuff is good but not Elmore Leonard, yet, yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent book by James Born","review":"I just finished reading Field of Fire last night.

It is the most poorly written, worst piece of trash that I have ever read. And this comes from one who has previously enjoyed Griffin's books, particularly his series on the Marine Corps of which I am proud to say I was a member. He starts well with a recapitulation of prior characters. He introduces a new character with potential. And then proceeds to get absolutely lost in his plot if there ever was one. He plods along for another 400 pages or so (for a total of approxinately 600 pages) and then mecifully ends without a conclusion.

He brings in the detestable Macklin in a complete waste of time for a few heart beats. Griffin leaves as usual the ending open for his sequel. It is a poor unanswered ending to a question that he has failed to convince us is important and has impact! There are no real hero's in the magnitude of his past editions. We are instead thrown a few bones and given a taste of what once was from this great author. I am sorry to say that this is a weak (and probably his weakest) attempt ever.

The taking of the islands before the Inchon invasion was true, except that, of course, MacArthur knew about it.The interesting point to me was the failure of intelligence about the communist Korea invasion that Griffin uses at the sart of the story but does not document. General Singlubs book, \\"Hazardous Duty\\" does document the failure. It shows that the CIA knew about it, informed the top people in Washington, and that General Willoghby, MacArthurs Chief of Intelligence, had specifically downgraded it as \\"unreliable.\\" This ties in exactly with the way that Captain McCoy is treated in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under Edited","review":"Totally disappointed with this one. Of course the publisher of this book knows loyal Griffin readers will buy it upon or after it's release.

It's about an 11 year old girl that lives in Sarajevo. At first her life is as a normel 11 year old girls should be. Then a war starts. She loses: friends, relitaves, pets, and her childhood. I sympathize for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"To me this was book that really was not written that well, b","review":"I t was a story which in many parts was very sad, for being an innocent child being destroyed for the rest of her life because of war, but the book was not that great because Zlata mainly repeated most things over and over. For being in journal form, it was all right."},{"rating":"2","title":"A young girl's journey from childhood to war","review":"This book is a must-read/must-have for anyone! I was deeply moved by Zlata's accounts of life in Sarajevo and found myself in tears many times. Having friends from Bosnia, I often wonder what life was like for them during the war but was always too afraid to ask. Zlata's Diary answered many of my questions and gave me a better understanding of the true tragedy of war. Everyone should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zlata's Diary: A Child's Life in Sarajevo","review":"This book was a window to what children go through during a war. At first I couldn't get used to the style( journal entries) but I did and the story was exeptionally interesting. The main point of the book was to give the outside world a chance to see war through a childs eyes. The ending was both logical and happy. This book changed the way I saw war. No one, especially children, should lose the freedom of playing in the park, going to school, and having sleepovers with friends. Before I read this book, I took all of these things for granted. Hopefully, when others read this book, they will be just as influenced as I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny!","review":"Zlata's DiaryZlata is about a girl who at 11yrs old writes a diary about the Bosnian war. A war that destroyed her childhood. She took piano lessons and she liked going to birthday parties. She witnesses kids and their families getting gunned down. I felt that the book was very good because she talks about a lot of stuff that happens and could happen in childhood. The way she wrote the book was ok. It was very humorous. She stated facts about the bombing and the killing of children and adults. The characters are her family and friends they played very good parts. I think she and her mother could have got alons better than what they were like. She is closer to her father than her mother and one of the things I like about it is that she was doing normal things like going to birthday parties spending the night with friends and family enjoying her life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Disappointing","review":"I didn't like the fact that Zlata kept saying the same thing over and over again. All she basically said was \\"Oh no the water and electricity is out again. The ending was really boring too because the same thing happened in the end as it did in the beginning. It was a good survival book but not a book that I would recommend to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little girl's recollections of the war in Bosnia.","review":"How does war affect people. If you read Zlata's Diary, you will find out how war has affected a little girl. Her friends move away, one friend is shot, and there is the lack of electricity, food, and water. She notices that her parents visibly age as the war progresses. Everybody is under tremendous pressure. She spends many days couped up in her apartment without seeing daylight. Snipers shoot into her bedroom making it unsafe. This is the sad fact of war and how it affects civilians. Zlata shows the world the inhumanity of warfare and its affects on children.One thing not talked about is who Zlata is...Muslim, Serb, Croat. I know the reason why this was left out. It was to show the effects of war on children regardless of enthicity. Other than the reader's curiousity on this, this is a sad story on what warfare really does to people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy read, but not very interesting.","review":"Zlata's Diary was obviously written by a fifth grader. The vocabulary (may have been changed a little bit by translation) is a little above a fifth grade level, but the sentance structure is the same. In the middle of the book she finds out her diary is going to be published. I think this impacted her writing, because after that she started talking just about the war, not her feelings. If you are interested in the war, not how someone lived through the war, read this book. If you are looking for feelings and thoughts more, read Anne Frank."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tragic and very human tale of lost childhood in Sarajevo..","review":"I encountered Zlata's Diary in an adolescent psychology class in college. Her haunting words became the impetus behind my subsequent research in law school and other work relating to the wars in the former Yugoslav republics. I can vouch for the authenticity of Zlata Filopovic's account. Zlata's words portray a true picture of what life was like during the blockade of Sarajevo, and the feeble attempts by the international community to do something about it.This is appropriate reading material for high school students, as well as adults who simply want to understand the horrors of the Bosnian civil war. One note of caution, however; it is not an easy book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointed!","review":"As this book was a diary of a girl which was written during wartime, I think it's boring for her to repeat and repeat the similar miserable comditions of no electricity, water and gas almost everyday.As well as the birthday partiessssss!!These would greatly decrease the extent of compactness.After Zlata knew that her diary was going to be published, her style in writing changed,it became more and more emotional or even made me feel a bit of hypocritical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair enough read:","review":"However, to compare her with Anne Frank is an insult to her memory. Zlata is nowhere near Frank's ability as a writer. Zlata comes across as empty headed girl intent only in having a gala time for herself. Her greed for food is evident in her chubby cheeks, budding moustache and a fat body (for a war) - tragically at the same time when her poor parents were reducing to size zero. I know for a fact that Yugoslavia in 70s was never a rabid Communist state fetching the stick at every Soviet Command."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lauren's Review For Zlata's Diary - A Little Disappointing","review":"Zlata's Diary was very disappointing because she kept saying the same thing over and over and over again. The ending was the same as the beginning. All Zlata basically said was, \\"Oh no the first day there was no water or electricity!\\" Then the next day she would say \\"Yay it's back on!\\"Again, I think that there could have been a little bit more variety of things that happened. I think that if there was it would have been a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda","review":"Zlata's Diary is a shameless propaganda ploy. Zlata Filipovic went to live in a Paris villa shortly after the Bosnian civil war started. She lived in luxury and splendor. The real Ann Frank died at Auschwitz. Why is Frank's memory being abused by propagandists? Amazon.com itself noted that the Bosnian Government may have tampered with the book,i.e., organized the propaganda campaign. It is a cute idea! Pretend you are somebody else. It is a form of theft. It insults the memory of the real Ann Frank. If you love PROPAGANDA and being lied to and hoodwinked, you will love this book! There is a sucker born every minute! It ain't real. It is REAL propaganda though.Sorry, I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Poor Canary","review":"Read this book with several other classmates and found it ridiculous.

I liked it because--surprise--I could relate to her. When I tried to reread it yesterday, however, I had to give up. It has absolutely no merits whatsoever. I also disliked Zlata's drawing a similarity between herself and Anne Frank. The comparison is almost laughable. Though I'm inclined to blame someone who has put that idea into her head, not Zlata herself.Don't get me wrong, I'm sure Zlata has grown into a decent woman, and I'm sure we all had our delusional moments when we were teenagers, but I'm rating the book here, not the author. And it sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zlata's Diary","review":"Zlata's Diary by, Zlata Filipovic is a tremendously exciting book. This book was defiantly a page-turner for two main reasons. First, the thoughts and feelings coming from this 11-year old girl is phenomenal. Second, her story starts out like any other and it is incredible to see how much her life is affected by a war. A girl having a near to perfect life, going through a war, then having her friends and family ripped apart. The reader thins they can predict how things are going to turn out, then all of the sudden, it all changes.

The author of this book is Zlata Filipovic. This diary of Zlata takes place in Sarajevo in the year of 1992. The message is to tell about how a girl named Zlata has to go through a terrible war. Zlata has lived through a rough life. She has had people die and also move away. This is sad if you are sensitive. Who I recommend this book to would be people who like diaries and also people who like to learn about recent wars. I would compare this book to the Dear America books because it is written in diary form. I liked this book because it was very interesting. It also kept you hanging to see what happened next. On the other hand I did not like the sad parts. The reason it was sad is because people were dying.Amber Measell"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save You money - you need common sense","review":"This book really disappointed me it really did'nt have anything that jumped out at me, that made me say \\"O - I forgot about this\\" maybe because I'm a SysAdmin I might be more up to date than most.

It was also shot using consumer gear when the director was homeless. The final movie isn't perfect, but its AMAZINGLY good given the resources. Its also more a drama than an action film, and a lot more about mood and tone than splashy effects (even thought he visuals are great). The only people I know who didnt like the movie should stick to things with Transformers in them. But if you actually care what goes in your eye and ear holes and can make ANY use of it, you should check this little movie out.

Great episodes of an EVERYMAN that we need for this day and age. Themes of Good versus EVIL, weave through every episode. It's a simple formula, but brings back memories of simpler times in 1950's America. This three show DVD brings back the adult westerns. Not just shoot-em-ups, but with drama as a major component.

Looking for all the seasons to be released!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great dvd","review":"This is another great show, one that has clear lines about who the good guys are and who the bad guys are.

Maverick was most enjoyable, and was looking forward to another entertaining evening with \\"Cheyenne\\".The acting was terrible.

First person accounts of this quality are rare and valuable, giving those of us who are curious as to how a civilized nation like Germany could turn itself into the soulless, mechanistic killing machine it became under Hitler a look at how ordinary people contributed, by omission or commission, to the coming horror. Dr. Manz has more than atoned for his own omissions by writing this excellent, gripping book, which I recommend to anyone interested in this perplexing episode of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing","review":"It is ironic and appropriate that I finished Manz' book on July 4th eve.

However, I most definitely recommend reading the book first, because there's so much that has to be cut to make the story fit into 2 hours, and no movie could come close to capturing Zora Neale Hurston's amazing use of language."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay. It's not bad. It's ............ okay.","review":"I'd say the book is probably in my Top Twenty Favorite Books list. The thing that the movie's missing is the narration. In the book, there's two distinct personalities : Janie as she's growing and Janie as Narrator. It's the sheer presence of the narrator in the book that makes it. It's Janie looking back at her life and explaining the inner dialogue and why she did what she did, and what she learned from it. That's distinctly missing from the movie. They tried to blend the two and take out the narration for the majority of the story, and that was the mistake.It's.... okay. It's not great. If you haven't read the book, you'll probably like the movie. If you've read the book, well, you'll see what I mean. It's still worth watching the movie as Halle Berry's performance is very well done. There's just a lot missing in the production of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie that should be bought for your collection","review":"Picture quality was excellent. Great actors.

A thinly veiled Hurston lives vicariously through Janie, who wanders through life looking for a man who will bring her fresh strawberries and go fishing by moonlight--and she finds him in Tea Cake.Oprah's intro to this film is telling when she says that a woman can die happy after being kissed by a man like Tea Cake.In short, the film is masterfully filmed, character-driven and true to the era of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Janie And TeaCake","review":"I enjoyed this movie the same as Lackawanna Blues. Their is something about my people back in the days that I just truly enjoy. Janie and Teacake show us what real love is truly about. My favorite scene is where Janie is calling Teacake's name. This is a movie I can watch over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their Eyes Were Watching God...NOT!!!","review":"I didn't enjoy the movie because I expected it to be more like the book which was way more interesting. The book had so much more detail it gave more examples, more to imagine. There's a part in the book were it shows a Ms. Turner, but in the movie there was no Ms.Tuner. Another part is when he has to bury dead bodies it shows nothing about that in the movie. The movie cuts out a lot of parts that were in the book. Maybe if i would of just saw the movie it would have been better, but since I read the book first I expected more scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. I'm also a huge fan of Halle and Oprah, but I found this to be a very bad adaptation of the book on many levels. It was just bad. I have no idea how one would receive this movie without reading the book, but it left out so much of the book. It lacked the emotional depth. And the saddest thing is that when I first read this book in 1993 that Halle Berry would make the perfect Janie. I still think I'm right. And the fact that this was done in 2 hour movie was an atrocity. This should have been a miniseries. I still applaud Oprah for bringing Zora's work to the masses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Regardless of the Novel","review":"First, I will begin by saying that this movie is a poorly done romance movie, evident from the moment it \\"starts\\". The adapted story is purely plot that abandons many of Hurstons Motifs and symbolism, while making many unnecessary metaphorical inserts. All dialogue in the book is done in thick southern vernacular, something that the film neglects. Overall I would say that the movie isn't very enjoyable on its own, and not tolerable after reading the fine piece of literature that it is its inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their Eyes Were Watching God","review":"The movie wasn't a good portrayal of the book. It lacked details that were vital to the whole story. When you read literature you are able to grasp the whole story and a portrayal of it could have more details, but it should never lack details. While watching the movie I was able to point out the movies qualities and flaws and how different and alike they were. \\"Their Eyes Were Watching God\\" DVD got the basic idea of the book , but the details that are missing give it a two thumbs down on my behalf. In the book when Janie Mae Crawford meets Tea Cake and they begin to become comfortable with each other , Janie leaves behing her mourning in black and starts to wear blue( being that this is Tea Cake's favorite color). In the book this was a way of showing Janies' change in attitude. These details along with many others weren't apart of the movie which threw me off and i truly disliked the movie. Some parts were exaggerated, others just weren't there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Woman Figthing to find her True Love","review":"The movie \\"Their Eyes Were Watching God\\" i think deserves a 4 stars even if it had some differences from the book like: they never talk about her trail to see if she was innocent or guilty, Tea Cake never hit her and didn't show jealousy in the movie. In the Movie they didn't have the Characters Mrs.Tuner or her brother. But even all these differences it still had the same feeling as the book. It showed all her 3 husbands how Tea Cake made her feel, how Joe made her wear a rag on her hair, and etc.. This is why the movie deserves a 4 star rating. It changed a few things but it never changed the theme. Thanks for listening to Angie and Beba."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pears and the Bees","review":"I found the moving didn't capture the true essence that the book illustrated in its pages.The DVD left out so many important details that were just so necessary to reach the maximum potential needed to live a fullfilled life. The book had so many details the reader would say \\"hey, it's like I'm in the book.\\" Janie in the movie acted more childish and didn't undergo the transformation that I saw in the book. Two Thumbs Down! HA HA HA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This film is great...","review":"Although Ms. Hurston's book leaves a greater impression than the movie, I still say that this is a great movie to add to any home collection. This movie shows how true love can come from unexpected places. Janie was a wealthy woman but still had nothing because she was not being true to herself. Then, she meets Teacake and begins to live life fully. This movie also show that love is not something to be taken for granted because just as fast as we are blessed with it, it can also be taken away.

IMaxmovies are shot on larger than normal film to achieve very high resolutionand smoother color transitions which will only be noticable when projectedon giant movie screens. When the film is transferred to DVD and viewedon your much more inferior and small TV (as compared to projected film),all of the IMax advantage is totally lost. This goes for all IMax titles.If you only want to see random scenes from animal life in the Serengeti,you might like it. Otherwise, first consider the many National Geographictitles about African wildlife (even on VHS) some of which have won awards."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice video, little short","review":"I just got back from my own african safari and i wanted to order this to see how it stacked up. Aside from its short length (a little over 30 mins), the DVD was wonderful. I was in Africa for the Great Migration and this video is true to every aspect of the migration.

Sure, MTV played the music videos and I heard occasional talk about the girl who came out of nowhere (well, the Internet is more like it), but I didn't really pay too much attention. But the infectious, albeit repetitive sounds of \\"Smile\\" permeated through my ears recently and I was drawn to the British pop star, and I ended up buying her CD. The album contains a good share of great songs, including the hilarious bro-bashing \\"Alfie\\" and \\"Not Big,\\" and although Lily lacks powerful chops her sweet coo suits her individual style quite well. Lyrically, you can't get anything more entertaining - or, at times, odd - than here, but, again, that suits Lily's personality perfectly as an outspoken, unabashedly unique singer-songwriter with an excellent debut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nepotism at its' best","review":"I watched Lily Allen on Saturday Night Live last night. This stage is awful, one of the worst, but it never fails to separate the truly talented from the talentless hacks.After Allen's performance, I looked her up and wasn't surprised to learn that her parents are stars in their own right and have connections in the business.Allen has about as much stage presence as a lump of jiggling jello. But what of her singing chops? Her vocals are so ordinary she wouldn't even be granted a minute of fame on American Idol's worst auditions reel.Her voice has absolutely no power, no depth, no resonance, and no range. There is NOTHING about this bad-tempered, poorly-reared, wannabe pop star worth listening to. Her lyrics are garbage.She is a perfect example of why the music business is in so much trouble.

Well, I thought it was until I heard Lily Allen. The lyrics are insipid and repetitive and the music is standard issue, overproduced pop. There are apparently lots of folks who go in for that, so I'm sure Ms. Allen will be huge. For about 6 months. Then the next pop sensation will arrive and we'll forget all about her. Good riddance, in advance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun times","review":"Great songs that often make me laugh - I used the tunes for work out music, since they are fast to keep you moving, but slow enough that you can catch your breathe."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY TOO HYPED!","review":"I saw Lily Allen play a gig in Boston and I had never heard her music before. I thought she was cute and her music was very upbeat- i was glad i got a chance to see her live. After the concert, however, I went home and downloaded this CD and i HATE it. Her voice gets annoying and the songs all sound the same after a while. She is definitly better live, and that probably has to do with her visual appeal. Take that away and she has little."},{"rating":"2","title":"70's music snob finally finds SOME REALLY GREAT MUSIC","review":"LILY ALLEN is very talented (ok; i admit she does need to find a better back up band); her music is funny and a fun sticky treat of yummy smack; kindof like cotton candy with a swig of vodka after it. I havent heard 1 new artist in 6 years that i adore and my sister and i have been laughing, dancing and grooving to this CD for months now. Lily has amazing wit and wisdom beyond her years.i grew up on Blondie, The Specials, English Beat and Bob Marley so this albulm balms my old tattered soul. This girl is going far! catch her now as she will be a huge star in 2009. \\"smile\\" is an amazing tune, but \\"alfie\\" \\"Knock em out\\" and \\"nan, you're a window shopper\\" are my favorites; i crack up every time i hear them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Get It!","review":"I'm always looking for fresh and unique non top 40 artists but I don't see what is the deal with her.

I can't praise this cd enough. It's completey out of my diverse collection of genre....but after a few hundred listens to this cd (literally), it really hits every genre of my interest, coming to realize that this beauty is in a genre of her own. I do hope she continues on a successful path, if her follow up is even HALF as good as her first disc, I will love it just the same. Cheers to new talent, and to one who knows how to present good music. No fillers AT all on this cd, every song is infectious and addictive. Buy this cd, you will have no regrets. It's blowing me away! Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music, not enough \\"bleeps\\"","review":"I love this CD. The only problem I had was I bought the censored version so I could listen to it in front of my kids and there are a few songs that could have used a few more words bleeped out. Only the MOST offensive words are bleeped. Some songs I cant listen to at all just because of the subject matter, not specific words, which is fine, we just skip those. But some songs would be OK if they only had more bleeps but I have to skip them too. All in all I can only listen to about 5 songs when my kids are awake. (ages 4 and 2 1/2) Still worth the $$$. Good in the car when the kids are with Dad."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Fun of Them All","review":"Short Version: BUY THIS ALBUM...YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!Long Version: Lily is the british version of Pink in my mind because of the attitude she brings to her music. I love this chick. She has a maturity that I think will sustain her as an artist for a lot of years. We may never really get to know her in America, and that is too bad (I hope differently though). However, of the 15 albums I brought, this is honestly my favorite. Any chick who sings \\"...you must be joking me, if you think that you'll be poking me\\" has something I want to her more of down the road.Mostly, she is really refreshing change of pace. Part of me want to know what she listens too when she has time.Kevin"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can clean to it","review":"Lily Allen's second cd is fantastic.

Actually I have been listening to Lily for the last few days straight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop delight","review":"Alright Still is a most appealing collection of quality pop songs infused with wit and humour. There are lots of catchy hooks and lilting reggae rhythms and the music is interspersed with appropriate samples that give it extra depth. The streetsmart lyrics are clever and engaging, especially on a track like Smile. Lily is obviously one tough girl who takes no nonsense from anybody, least of all an ex lover. My favourite song on Alright Still is LDN, a tuneful song about life in the big city. Knock 'Em Out is another highlight, a very catchy number with clever lyrics and samples. Other memorable tracks include Alfie and Friday Night. The music is an appealing blend of pop, hip-hop and ska/reggae and the lyrics are quite risque in places. Alright Still is a brilliant album of rhythmic pop songs with lots of attitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Artist","review":"Just yesterday, my dad got this CD. Lily's voice is phenominal! It's the perfect music for anyone. This young British singer/songwriter is a breath of fresh air compared to sappy over the top artists like Christina Agulaira and The Pussy Cat Dolls. This girl is totally on key, and her lyrics can relate to everyone . Those over the top groups or singers just put smoke into your mind. But this just clears away all that smokey badness. This is for all ages too.I highly reccomend Lily Allen and this CD. This is the first time I've heard her I am blown away. I am definity asking my parents' for another Lily Allen CD for my birthday. She's pop but not to POP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"different voice and wonderfully simple lyrics and songs.

I gave it a listen and really enjoyed it. Then, my favorite magazine, Entertainment Weekly, proclaimed the album one of the top ten of the year. This made me curious. Finally, I decided to buy it because I have a tendency to love the music imported from the United Kingdom (i.e.: Ms. Dynamite, M.I.A. and new comer Amy Winehouse).Lily Allen is no exception. Sure, she does not have a powerhouse voice, but I wasn't expecting one. The lyrics are brash, catty and hilarious. (For example, on \\"Knock 'Em Out,\\" Allen contemplates on ways to say no to a guy's date offer. She comes up with the following excuses; she's pregnant, her house is on fire, she doesn't own a phone, she's getting married soon and she has numerous STD's). The production fuses umpteen different styles all together.I was thoroughly entertained while listening to this album and I enjoyed it a lot. I highly recommend the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"This album is fun! The songs are upbeat and funny. None of the lyrics are very deep or insightful, but they're catchy!

Lily Allen rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty rad","review":"Lily Allen's music is pretty rad. She's got some cool reggae beats and intertwines it with her own weird stuff. And it's weird in a good way. Not to sound cliché, but she is a huge up and coming artist and she's got \\"wicked\\" style. Cool brit import. for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Openly Honest. Fun Music. Great Start For The Artist.","review":"A great compilation of songs by the brutally honest, open and most charming voice to hit the airwaves in years.

I love her and want to hear more."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful french film","review":"This is a wonderful example of a modernist suspense thriller.

Amazon said they were orginally releasing January 30th, not December so I was a little surprised when the shiped. Just so everyone knows, the cable is 9.8 foot long, and the audio and video cables are bundled into one thick cable till you get about a foot from the connectors. I like this, as it will keep the cables in check. And yes, being bundled can be a disadvantage if your audio hookups are not by your video hookups (but I believe nintendos are like this too). I haven't plugged them in, but I'm not expecting a huge difference, but then again I never thought the Wii looked that bad on my 32\\" LCD (1080i display)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't This cable Play All Formats? Not Downloaded Games...","review":"This cable DOES NOT WORK when you try to play games dowloaded from nintendo wii's site as advertised that it would play all formats.

I tried it on Toe jam and Earl and Zelda 1 from NES and Sega Respectively..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not necessary","review":"I was told by the manager in the EB Games store near me that this item was not necessary for my HDTV. He said they had the TV in the store hooked up to the system and it was not a noticeable difference.

In my opinion while the image may be a little sharper on my 42 inch 720p capable display it actually looks worse than interlace because of the pixilation you can now see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wii HD Cables","review":"I would love to be able to use these without having to unplug my Cable TV on my HDTV. We have been able to get no support from the cable company on a splitter or how to use these.The company, seems like a decent company and I would look to them to buy other items, and I have to admit, I have NOT contacted them for support on this product, but at this point, this product sits on a shelf collecting dust because it's a major waste of time and energy, to move our 37\\" tv every time we want to Wii in HD... When you work over 50 hours a week, and just want to Wii for a few hours when you get home, it's too much of a hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as Advertised","review":"Well, it does what it says it does for $10 less than the official Nintendo cable. The only ding I give this product is that the audio connectors are attached close to the video connectors. The result of this is that you can't, for example, plug the video into a TV and the audio into a receiver unless they are located very close to each other. Perhaps the official cable suffers from the same issue. Additionally, you'll only get a resolution of 480p from these cables, which is not really HD. This is a shortcoming of the Wii itself, not the cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Cable at good price","review":"Unlike some other reviewers I definitely noticed a difference switching from composite video to component and changing the Wii setting to 480p on my 16 X 9 TV. While the cable length is good, those who might want to run the audio cables into an amp or receiver might be out of luck as they are no longer than the video cables. If you are just going from the Wii to your TV it's not a problem. Don't be swayed but other Wii component cable offers that cost up to 3 or 4 times as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extra long just perfect for Hi-Def screens","review":"This cable performs just as well as the other more expensive options, save your money and buy this cable for your HD TV.

I prefer the Nintendo brand component video cables.","review":"I used my SDTV's component video input with my Nintendo Wii connected via this MadCatz cable. Using this cable provided a significant increase in picture quality over the standard composite video cable however, the connectors are a little on the cheap side. The wire itself is also a rather flimsy high gauge. After about a month of use, the Cb cable developed a short. I've never seen a cable fail like this without being tampered with in some way.This MadCatz component cable is not the best solution available for the Wii. I recommend the Nintendo's own component cable. It's more robust and delivers good performance for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cable says it is for Wii","review":"This cable says it is for the Wii which is why I bought it, the color codes do not match my tv and there is no instructions on how the cable should be connected, I would not buy a cable like this again from Amazon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Cables","review":"I have never saw the picture quality of the official nintendo cable to compare, but this cable did drastically improve the quality of my Wii's screen quality on my LED tv.

So even if the picture is better, the text wasn't.Save your money and just buy a new game."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: May create green screen problem.","review":"With proper settings enabled the cable increases the refresh rate of the picture and looks nicer. However, over random periods of time, the cable will cause the screen to appear in a green shade or hue. The only way to fix this is to completely unplug the cable and replug all of the components. During this time, the sound also becomes distorted. Its like it switched one of the color channels with on of the sound channels.Besides turning the screen green, which is making me buy another cable, the construction of these seems semi-durable. The only thing I don't like about it is the RCA plugs don't hold as well as standard ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, Great Price","review":"After reading the reviews, some of which were negative, I was hesitant about buying these component cables. I'm glad I did. These cables improved the picture and video quality, which makes me question the reviews that claim otherwise?"},{"rating":"2","title":"works well","review":"Cable suplied with wii gave a really poor picture - I suspect because it was badly shielded and I've got a lot of video/audio/computer gear around the wii.

These cables produce heavy vertical banding and actually wash out all of the colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"A blessing for a projector setup","review":"I have the Wii on a 100\\" widescreen projector. The picture improvement is huge. Much crisper, cleaner edges. When the screen is large enough, you easily notice the improvements. Even though it's only 480P, it looks much better. The length was good too. Having the extra few feet on the cord helped out with the setup. I wouldn't hesitate to to purchase these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Picture Quality","review":"These really improved the picture quality on my 37\\" LCD TV. I did not notice as big as a difference on a normal Tube TV. Overall these cables work great and I would reccommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh ...it's worth it allright.","review":"Playing the Wii on HD without this is a big mistake. If you have any eye at all for the difference between analog, and HD, then this is a no-brainer. On games like Tiger Woods, you can actually read the text on the screen, and it just looks so much crisper overall. On games like Zelda, it's overwhelmingly better. This is a must have. I'm sure they are all about the same, but this one is great for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"nintendo getting progressive, again","review":"cable came packaged oem-style but appeared new and arrived swiftly. i have yet to experience any vc incompatibilities, but i believe that is software related and nothing to do with any brand name or generic component cable. much less expensive than going through nintendo to get official ones as i did for my gamecube ages ago. wii and gamecube software looks great - noticeably sharper picture and cleaner color reproduction. note that the sharpness gained may showcase some aliasing issues plaguing certain titles that would have been lost with interlaced mode. just switch out of progressive mode for any game if it bothers you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it's supposed to.","review":"First, the product is misnamed... 480p isn't \\"HD\\" by any sense of the word. Either way, these cables do enable the widescreen capabilities of the Wii. Admittedly, I fell for an April Fool's joke that said the Wii got a 720p update... Ah well.

At only $20, how can you go wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would probably be better to spend the $$ and get the official Nintendo cable","review":"Good packaging, good cable length. I plugged it into my component input and adjusted the Wii to 480p. I noticed something bad. Vertical scrolling from some interference. The cables are just not shielded enough to prevent interference from the back of the TV. I had to rearrange the cables for over an hour to get the verticle scrolling 'waves' to appear as minimal as possible. I was finally able to eliminate them, though at times I still feel like there is a slight shimmer, but whatever.Would probably be better to spend the $$ and get the official Nintendo cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool?","review":"i was expecting a higher quality video signal from the wii with this cable. maybe its my tv? idk? get this if you need it though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"spend the extra money for a different brand","review":"The cables never quite worked. The color would go to blue or gray very often. The connection to the back of my TV was never snug. I used them for a weekend and they have been sitting in a box ever since.

Lesson learned - you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"I did not have a good experience with this brand. The picture was bad, lines all through the picture.

My only complaint is that my Wii is about 36\\" from the TV hookup, so all this extra bulky wire is annoying. There are plenty worse things that could be wrong with it. Take your 480p and run with it. (Cross your fingers Nintendo goes with HDMI next time)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Except for Splitter","review":"The HD cable works great. The only problem I had was that on the back of my receiver the video inputs and the audio inputs are on opposite sides. So, the cable has a splitter block and it only lets the individual wires go a certain distance. It was too short to reach both sides of my receiver, so I had to use rca couplers on the audio to extend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfectly.","review":"The cable is what I needed to improve the image from the Wii on my plasma.

My son and I were playing Super Mario brothers when about 20 minutes into the game the 'red' disappeared from the screen. I unplugged the cable from the Wii and plugged back in and it fixed it for about 3 minutes, repeated this several times. Finally got tired of this and plugged in the original RCA cable that came with it and no issues. When it was working the picture was definitely clearer. In good faith I am requesting a replacement. Everyone gets a lemon from time to time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a Karaoke CD","review":"In my opinion, this is a plain accompaniment track CD, not a karaoke CD.

My mom took me to new york city to see the show and I loved it. I'm in middle school and I wanted to sing along with the songs for a talent show, but it was hard. This CD should have a cast to sing with, sometimes its hard to know where you are in the music. I will buy the other Wicked album from Stage Stars, they have both singers and just music. Its easier to learn the songs, when there is someone to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great !","review":"I absolutely can't understand the bad 1st review:It's a AUDIO-CD (of course it has no lyrics) and the quality is overall impressive. OK, the orchestral soloparts (especially the Intro) can't compete with a full orchestra, but the songs are very close to the Original Cast Album. You can play both at the same time with almost perfect sync & tune.But you will have to buy the Cast-Album too, because it contains the right lyrics, the vocal selection is a completely different version!The only really negative point is the fact that 2 tracks are missing: \\"March of the witchhunters\\" and the Finale.It's not easy to sing without a conductor, but real fans gonna do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good investment","review":"The backing tracks on this CD are quite well done. The instruments sound pretty good, though of course not as good as their acoustic counterparts. (Tip: If you feel that instruments on a track do not sound right, try playing it through a different type of speakers - this can make a real difference.)The timings and orchestrations are easy to follow if you know the songs well. There is one part in Defying Gravity where it is challenging to jump in at first, but once you listen and count it a few times, you'll get it. I have used this CD for performances with my voice students and also personally and I would definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT A KARAOKE CD!","review":"This product shouldn't come up under a keyword search for \\"wicked karaoke\\".

Except there are strange gaps in Dancing through Life (one of my favorites) that when I sang with my son, we couldn't figure out...but the orchestration is awesome. Wish it had a \\"karaoke\\" track so you could figure out where to \\"come in\\" on some parts but VERY VERY good. Enjoying it.

It is spare on the basics that it proports to teach and seems to go on endlessly about the group itself that produced this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Will Work!","review":"I ordered this book unseen because her other book, Phonics That Work!, put a terrific glow on my teaching.This one is just a good.

This is a book that will work in your classroom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Practical Resource","review":"If you are a novice at using a word wall or have had one in your classroom for some time, you will find this book to be a great, practical resource.

Also included are activities and lessons that you can use in conjunction with your word wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Race","review":"This is one of my favorite movies. The first time was when I was a small boy watching it with my dad. I hope my son will watch it with me. This is a great movie take the time to check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Blake Edwards","review":"In many ways this is a story that plays like a cartoon with real live characters on screen, but still a lot of fun to watch. For me, this is one of the best comedy roles (2, in fact) that Jack Lemmon has done, especially the drunken king. Blake Edwards probably just gave Jack free rein, and the rest is comic history.Sadly, they have all since passed away: Blake, Jack, Natalie, Tony and Peter. I miss them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Push the button, Max!","review":"A must for Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis fans--but to be honest, everyone except Felix Ungar's alter-ego were sleepwalking their way through this movie. Jack Lemmon made it all worthwhile in his over-the-top portrayal of the villain, Prof. Fate--\\"Fate the Magnificent!\\" 7:30 in the morning, you idiots, I'm seasick! Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Race is timeless","review":"Newer generations need to see timeless films.Films without gratuitous violence and sex.

Home Video released a dvd pressed froma brand new digitally restored remastered negative. as anyone who owns said dvdwill atest the picture and sound quality are !!!

It was NOT an original product, looks pirated with a home printed casing and shrink wrap. I would not buy from this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorites.....","review":"The long wait is over...this great movie is finally coming to DVD!! This has to be one of the most underrated comedies ever and certainly, the late Jack Lemmon's \\"Professor Fate\\" character is arguably one of his most convincing performances.If I'd have to pick one scene from the movie that makes the entire movie worthy to buy, it's the out-of-control pie fight at the castle. Just buy this movie and watch that scene....totally worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic comedy adventure at its best.","review":"The Great Race is one of Blake Edward's best comedies. There are too many great comedic moments in this movie to enumerate. Two, however, especially stand out: possibly the wildest bar room brawl ever, and THE most spectacular pie and pastry fight ever filmed. The cast is outstanding: Tony Curtis is the dashing hero, Natalie Wood is a beautiful feminist newspaper reporter, Jack Lemmon is the ultimate villain, and Peter Falk is his bumbling henchman. Add an enchanting Henry Mancini score featuring the beautiful Academy Award nominated song, \\"The Sweetheart Tree,\\" and the result is a genuine masterpiece of romantic comedy adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality","review":"Love this movie but had to return the DVD because it was of very poor quality. Sound faded in and out and picture quality not up to par. Very disappointed in the product and will try to find it someplace else where I can view it for quality first."},{"rating":"1","title":"the Movie is GREAT! The DVD isn't!!!!","review":"A lot of people were waiting with anticipation for the release of The Great Race on DVD. This is a very funny classic movie! The new print is GREAT!But Warner has made a huge mistake on this DVD.The problem, and it is a major one, is with the new Dolby Digital soundtrack. In some scenes in the beginning of the movie the dialogue is barely audible. And during the opening credits when everyone boos Professor Fate and cheers The Great Leslie, someone switched it to everyone cheering the villain and booing the hero. The French audio track has the original soundtrack which correctly has the boos for Fate and cheers for Leslie.This is a MAJOR mistake! Warner should recall this DVD and restore the soundtrack to the way it is supposed to be. For fans of this movie, it ruins what would otherwise be a great DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"question about the dvd sound","review":"Love the movie, but don't yet own the dvd. I've read some reviews saying the picture and sound on the dvd are great BUT a number of other reviews say some sound effects in the first reel are out of sync (\\"boos\\" for Leslie and \\"cheers\\" for Fate) and also that the dialogue is barely audible for the first twenty minutes.Which is it?Are there some defective dvd copies and some good ones? If anyone has a dvd with correct sound sync in the opening titles, please mention it here so I know I can purchase a copy and have a chance to get the right audio. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure magic","review":"I once read about a lady who had seen 'The sound of music' 50 times. Well, I'll probably beat her when it comes to 'The great race'. Not yet; I've only seen it 18 times. But I still have a few years to go. Now then. As a comedy, this is a perfect movie. It has all the ingredients: the hero, the bad guy, the lovely lady, lots of around-the-world action and classic slapstick (the movie is dedicated to Laurel & Hardy, and it's easy to see why). But, far more important: I saw it five times in my early youth, and it established my picture of the world. There's good guys, and bad guys (who aren't so bad after all) and lovely ladies ... Well, you can imagine what this movie did to me. Buy this video, enjoy it yourself, and then show it to your (young) kids. It's a blessing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shocking bomb","review":"Given the stars, the music, and Blake Edwards on a roll, one would think this film would have to be good. It isn't. The reviewers who raved probably like network sitcoms. I counted two laughs, which is less than one an hour. Slapstick by the Three Stooges is better and funnier. What went wrong? It's the script, I think. It depended entirely too much on gadgets and stunts designed to tickle teens. A waste of all concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap Click Case Cover","review":"Amazon needs to indicate that this comes in a cheap click case and not a hard case as this matters to some of us choosing to buy this edition of the movie. Should be listed in the \\"details\\" of the product.A Blake Edward's classic...fun,fun,fun! Great cast. 5 stars for the movie..rated the presentation 5 stars because of the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"A role only Jack Lemmon could pull off!","review":"I remember watching this movie with my dad when I was a kid and the both of us laughing hysterically. Jack Lemmon is without question one of the funniest villians in the movies. The fight scenes, fencing and pie fight near the end are flawless and entertaining to watch. This film defines slapstick comedy and demonstrates that you don't need to be vulgar or crass to be funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Comedy","review":"Perfect casting, in all roles big and small, greatly contributed to this wonderful comedy which I have viewed too many times to count. The plot is based on a real New York to Paris race that began on Lincoln's birthday in 1908, and took 170 days to cover the 21,000 miles, after a send off watched by 250,000 people. The movie features the biggest pie fight ever filmed, and the best sword fight I've ever seen. This movie never fails to make me laugh out loud, I'm laughing now just thinking out Professor Fate's moose (look for it), and anyone saying \\"Rise and shine\\" brings a smile to my face. The real race was won by the only American entry, but watch this movie for an even better ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun!!!!","review":"This movie has been around a long time. In fact just about everyone in it has passed away. It does not have the modern special effects that seem to dominate the box office these days, but it is great fun and very entertaining. Tony Curtis is well cast as \\"The Great Leslie\\", and Natalie Wood is wonderful as the \\"liberated heroine\\". Jack Lemon steals the show with his portrayal of \\"Professor Fate\\" the dastardly villain. Peter Falk who plays Fates sidekick Max, also has some hilarious moments. This is old time melodrama at its very best. This movie is a mix of \\"Around the World in 80 Days\\", and \\"The Prisoner of Zenda\\", but is a lot more fun. One of my favorite scense is the pie fight near the end. Classic comedy. This has to be Blake Edwards' best movie ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Push the button Max!\\"","review":"I was SOOOO happy to find this! This has been one of my fav movies for years. My mom rented it back in the 80's (don't know when really, I was little) and copied it. I wore the old tape out so bad that for the last year before it finaly broke, it rolled like crazy. I love the song \\"Sweetheart Tree\\" and I find myself humming it sometimes when I get bored. For some reason on my DVD part of that song is in sing-a-long, but not the whole song. Seems silly but it's true. This movie is a classic. If you've never seen it, you don't know what you're missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie But Goodie","review":"This title still holds up well today. It's good clean slapstick humor. I was skeptical when an older friend of mine recommended this one, but I came away from it pleasantly surprised. Reminiscent of a live action Dudley Doright episode. Also features Jack Lemmon in a great performance as Professor Fate."},{"rating":"2","title":"We enjoyed this","review":"We enjoyed this slapstick humorous adventure of a New York to Paris car race. The story takes place around 1910. The good guy wears white and is all good. The bad guy wears black and is all bad (and amazingly inept). Our kids loved the physical humor: pie fights, falling into the water, crashing into manure. Parents of younger kids might want to preview the movie first; there are a couple of scenes with a fair amount of female skin and a couple of scenes where people are obviously drunk. We felt it was okay because it is about what our kids see when visiting the beach. Overall, we really enjoyed this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Race, Great Humor, Great movie.","review":"Jack Lemmon's Professor Fate character has to be the best comedy villian ever. If you want a movie to watch with the family this holiday season The Great Race would be great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Movie","review":"I always wanted to add this movie to my library.

Please help."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Trace!","review":"When I hadn't received my copy of \\"The Great Race\\" neary three weeks after purchasing it, I contacted the seller via e-mail inquiring as to the status of its delivery. The vendor told me that it had been shipped nearly two weeks earlier and then, without hesitating, offered to send me another copy they had in stock, which I received a few days later. I was very grateful for their professionalism and for caring about me as a customer. Although this experience makes me a little nervous about having items shipped via regular mail, the response from this seller makes me feel reassured. I hope all the sellers at Amazon are as cool about it. Thank you again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"No it's not great cinema, but it is entertaining. I remember watching this movie many times as a kid (\\"Push the button, Max\\"), and thought my own kids would get a laugh.

More brandy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can you say CLASSIC?","review":"This movie is indeed a CLASSIC! Jack Lemmon is wonderful in all he does! The two characters he plays in this movie, are incredibly well done. They are night and day, and very diverse! I wont ever get tired of watching this movie. It has lots of antics, and funny situations. You cant help but laugh a lot. I am glad I finally purchased it, for it is a movie I can watch again and again! A True Classic movie in its own right! You cant help but love this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish real-life crroks were like the villian in this film!","review":"I lost track of how many times I have seen this film.

What's next?\\" \\"Car number 5, the engine falls out!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie, awesome seller","review":"When I look back to what few memories I shared with my Dad, watching this movie comes to mind very fondly. When I was a kid I laughed throughout the whole movie with my Dad, every single time I watched it. That was 15 years ago, and I still laugh every time. The seller was great too."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of our favorites","review":"For those who have an appreciation of the \\"old movies\\", seeing Jack Lemon and Tony Curtis do their version of \\"Prisoner of Zenda\\" is a real treat. Jack Lemmon is at his comic genius best with help from an atttentive Peter Falk. Natalie Wood's costumes should have been award winning and accent a truly beautiful lady. Even the support cast of actors from our past, like Kyneen Wynn and Vivian Vance, are fun to see again. Growing up, our son used to enjoy watching this with us and now has introduced his children who also enjoy this old fashion melodrama with a tongue in cheek."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie","review":"I remember seeing this movie on TV when I was a kid.Movies like this now are classics.The ones that have an all star cast are hard to beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but slapstick!","review":"This was not as I remembered it from long ago. My wife and I started to view it ( I was especially interested in seeing those wonderful old cars). But we didn't get very far. It seemed to be nothing but slapstick.

But that is not the case. This film is overly long with a plot that should have been overhauled. One wishes that the climax would come soon but on and on it goes. If it was'nt for the great performances of all concerned I'm afraid this would have been a total flop.

With humor that will keep you watching for many many years to come. We wore out the VCR tape over the years so we got the dvd. My kids have all had their friends watch it and it is fast becoming a CULT film here in the NW. If you dont like music you wont want to watch this but if you enjoy a very funny film that over the years has gotten funner(?) this is the film for you. ANY AGE CAN ENJOY THIS FILM. and you wont belive the pie fight, largest ever done for a movie ..I think this still stands today."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sweetheart Tree","review":"Loved Natalie Wood singing The Sweetheart Tree song. It is a happy song with happy words.Cinematography, soundtrack and acting are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Well, Fiddledy Dee!!...\\"","review":"For me, this is one of those movies that brings back such fun, wonderful memories from my childhood. This one was an annual favorite in my home, and everytime it appeared in the TV guide we always gathered around the set and had an enjoyable evening. This is certainly not a blockbuster movie by any means, but it is a good movie with clean fun, humor and slapstick. Performances by Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood are good, but my favorites are Jack Lemmon and Peter Faulk who really steal the show.The DVD picture quality is good with plenty of color saturation and contrast. The sound quality is also quite good considering the original audio format. I really enjoy the fact that this DVD also includes the original opening score, intermission, and exit music that was originally shown in the theaters. It would've been easy to cut that out, but it adds to the overall presentation as it was meant to be experienced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Upsetting","review":"The Great Race is one of my all time favorite Movies. I can't see it too many times. But the DVD and the case it came in are very poorly made. You cannot hear the voices talking during the first 20 min. or so of the show. If you raise the volume to hear the voices, the music gets so loud you cannot stand keeping that way. The \\"box\\" it came in was not the Industry standard all plastic box. It was most made of heavy paper and is wider then my other DVD's, so it will not fit in my DVD file. To sum it up -- I give the movie a full 5 star rating, but I give the DVD and it's pacakging a 1 star rating. That makes me sad..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Forever","review":"I loved this movie as a child and my kids love it now. An all time classic that never gets old. Buy it and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super comedy!","review":"THE GREAT RACE (1965) is an excellent movie. Interesting to make one about the early 1900's. Jack Lemmon is great in his \\"Professor Fate\\" role. Peter Falk does well as Max. This also includes Vivian Vance from I LOVE LUCY in a small role. This includes the biggest pie fight I've ever seen. This movie is more like a cartoon than a live-action film. This movie is 100% recommended.Grade: A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Released","review":"I just got this fifth installment of the new adventures of the Knight Sabers last night. I have greatly enjoyed this new rendition of the classic anime story set in Mega-Tokyo. This tape contains two episodes (EP11:Sheer Heart Attack & EP12 Made in Japan) that supply additional insight into the backgrounds of Linna and Sylia. There is also plenty of action when the shorthanded Knight Sabers take on a gigantic military boomer. Nene finds out a secret and the second episode ends with you wanting the sixth tape ready to stick in the VCR. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much and not enough","review":"I wish that I could begin to understand the depths of racing that Mr. Beyers does. But alas I am stuck with 30 plus years of experience. I am sure that there is good information in this book. But for anyone that knows the depths of this game, knows it is all numbers and chance that get you. There is value in speed figures, but not much. I wish anyone luck in this game but this book is way too complicated and complex to have any real value to the average gambler.I Wish it were not true."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one that started it all","review":"I've read many fine books on handicapping and this one is probably the best of them all. A real easy read, its peppered with fascinating and often humerous anecdotes and rules of thumb.Beyer first introduced his speed handicapping concept in this book, and he shows how to compute the now famous Beyer speed figures. Even though they're available in the Form, its still good to know how they were derived.At the time Beyer wrote this book, he focused most heavily on speed handicapping, and he would more thoroughly embrace other factors such as pace or trip handicapping later in his career. But he does at least touch on all facets of handicapping in this book, and either a beginner or expert will find it a informative and amusing read.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Birnbaum's Walt Disney World For Kids By Kids","review":"A friend showed me this book after returning from Disney. I found it to be very helpful and am ordering one for our family. The book tells what you need to know about the ride before you put them on it. That allows me to know whether or not a ride is too scary, rough or dark. That information is very helpful. My daughter is only 5, and she enjoyed looking at it with us. I think it is a must before you go to Disney World. It also has a section in the back for autographs and lots of helpful hints."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good way to get your child involved in the planning.","review":"I brought this book for my son to help him prepare for our trip in May 2001. He absolutely loved it! He made a list of all the rides and attractions that he thought he might want to experience himself. It was helpful to him to read the different reviews that came from each of the kids. As we walked around WDW he would say \\"I read about this ride in the book.\\" This book also helped to enhance his reading skills, which is always a plus.

This is the actual film of Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary's historic first ascent of Mt. Everest. While not as dramatic as other films on the subject (if only because the outcome is known), it is none the less very well made, and an important historical document in filmmaking. Some viewers today may feel the film is dated, and even trite in spots. But the narrative moves very well, and its superb historical content make up for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"The original is still the best.","review":"I haven't seen this film since the 1950's, Million Dollar Movie, Channel 9 in NY.

Powerful guitarist who is equally alive using accoustic or electric guitar. Bravo!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe Bonamassa - No Need To Cry Over This One","review":"Joe's 4th album is another killer blues rock disc. There is more rock than blues to be found on this one, which puts some of Joe's fans off a bit, but this is more really great stuff. Joe seems to incorporate more acoustic and slide elements on this one, and there is even a rockabilly almost country influence to be found as well. Some of these tracks remind me of Swedish guitar phenom Mads Erikson in style. I don't really have a lot more to say about this one other than it is another rock solid album from an incredibly talented guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another unbelievable triumph from a master","review":"After discovering Joe two years ago, I searched out everything I could on this amazing musician -- I'm constantly evangelizing friends and strangers alike on his musicality, his raw talent and his passion for his music.HAD TO CRY TODAY has all that and more. BLUES DELUXE was one of my favorite CDs of all time, but HAD TO CRY TODAY is giving it a run for its money, with astonishingly varied tracks of superb and liquid brilliance. There simply are no throwaway tracks on a Joe Bonamassa collection. With stellar support from superb bassist Eric Czar and drum-lord Kenny Kramme, Joe delivers the best there is.Buy two copies. No, buy three: one to play, one to get signed at one of his unbelievably wonderful live shows, and one to give to the next person who's never heard of Joe Bonamassa. They'll love you for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it I did!","review":"The first track says it all, Joe is an awesome guitar slinger. While some reviews here are critical with his diverse song selection, I am very happy with it. It shows that Joe is expanding his skills, and that will only lead to even better performances in the future. His guitar work is blistering when needed and full of emotion. Not just another SRV wanna be, he is the real deal. Way to go Joe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"JUMPING JOE\\" WAS MEANT TO SING THE BLUES! NOT THIS!","review":"If you're looking for some of \\"Jumping Joe's\\" classic blues (See Rick \\"Shaq\\" Goldstein's previous FIVE STAR review of \\"BLUES DELUXE\\"!) this is not the CD for you. If you want middle of the road rock guitar, and not the full \\"smoldering, cauldron, of thunder and lightning, guttural, volcanic, power, vocals, that \\"Jumping Joe\\", is capable of, this is for you. For a true \\"Jumping Joe\\" blues fan, the only thing this CD will do for you, is complete, your collection of his music, and you won't wonder if you missed something. In closing, a personal note to \\"Jumping Joe: \\"please record more classic electric blues! When you put out something like \\"Blues Deluxe\\" you are truly the greatest living electric blues man under 70 years old! This CD is beneath you and your loyal blues, \\"street gang!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Mix of songs nice album","review":"Album sounds better with each listen. Can tell Joe put some effort into this album. Too bad not better known, have liked all of his work. Joe's vocals are excellant and so as is typical the guitar playing. Joe is one of the best there is, if do you not know him buy this album and get introduced. Joe mixes Blues, country and Classic Rock together. You can hear a little of each in certain tracks. The highlights include Had To Cry Today {yes this is Blind Faith's song nicely redone}, Around The Bend and When the Sun Goes Down. I miss some the harder, edgier tracks that have been on previous albums; this album is in my opinion a mellower effort. But, as I previously said it gets better with every listen. Not a weak track and the order flows. Joe and company paid attention to the details here, the more you listen the more you appreciate and understand the album's overall depth. A high quality effort 4 1/2 stars. As good of an album as I've heard in 18 months, seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Blues CD","review":"If you are looking for blues, this is not it.

She was dealing with her mother's death and there was alot of details that made it interesting. It was written in a way that I could understand, it wasn't too complicated.

I was excited when my soon to be wife called to tell me that someone had bought the knife. My elation soon turned to disappointment once I began using this knife. The first thing I noticed was the \\"non-stick\\" dimples aren't very functional. Carrots, garlic, apples, chicken, etc all stick to the blade. Now approx. 6 weeks later, the blade has several deep pits as if someone has been chopping bones or metal (it has not been used for anything like that). This knife has only been used on a bamboo cutting board, washed and dried immediately after use. Now, I have a $40 knife that to me is worth less than the cheap Farberware knife I bought 4 yrs ago.

Most of the movies in this genre are cheap and unimaginative. I am a fan of movies like Reservoir Dogs and Snatch, and would have never thought a movie like this could have been made. This film has the feel of such films, yet has something to say about, not only life, but the after-life. The casting was very well done. I especially enjoyed the cameo by Stacy Keach. As a Christian independent filmmaker, I was elated to realize that a movie can be made especially gritty, yet have this kind of message behind it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid drama about family and spiritual turmoil","review":"What makes this movie work is that the character who receives the strongest \\"preaching to\\" is a clergy-candidate. Many viewers are put off when the super-righteous spiritual persons speaks down to the ignorant sinner. The hero, Jeremiah, is torn with guilt over an incident that took place when he was 14. His twin brother was under attack and he froze. The guilt has scarred his life ever since. Mercy Street's primary story is Jeremiah's journey through this guilt to true reconciliation with the episode, with his brother, and with God.The frame for the story involves a criminal counterfeiting scam. Even the unsavory Rome, the chief \\"counterfeiter,\\" gets to preach at Jeremiah. The plot does offer suspense on this level, but also much light-hearted humor.Bottom-line: This is a solid drama that should lead to interesting discussion. It garners four-stars as an excellent film, with a strong \\"Made For TV\\" feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A silent winner","review":"For an excellant movie it could have done better with more marketing in theater's.

Mercy Streets shows to everyone that anything is forgivable if they mean it. The mean, sick twisted brother looked like he would always stay in the darkness of sin forever because he was leading such a horrible life. Through the forgiveness of his brother and more importantly God, he was able to be rescued and to live a life of happiness even through his past events. I rate Mercy Streets 5 stars and I hope everyone does too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie","review":"Seen this one in the theaters when it came out. Was very impressed by the actor David White and really enjoyed this film. One of the best Christian films so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly done movie, not particularly Christian.","review":"We heard this was a Christian movie, and were sorely disappointed after viewing it. First, the Gospel was never clearly presented. The church represented was the Episcopal Church, which is a mainline denomination where few claim to be \\"born-again.\\" Secondly, the plot is confusing and silly, with the main character playing two roles (identical twin brothers) who essential change places. However, the good one is supposed to be a pastor, and yet he is willing to commit a crime for his criminal brother, and he also cannot seem to understand salvation, as he ends up in another church being preached at by Stacy Keach (actor playing a priest). The story is a non-sensical mess. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, at least its not End Times junk!","review":"Acting is ok. The plot is a little generic with the twin brothers, one a priest and the other a two bit thug. Lawrence Taylor and Stacy Keach's roles are completely pointless. For instance, Keach has about a paragraph or two of lines as does Taylor. They are EXTREMELY minor roles, though the trailer would have you think otherwise. I think the producers got them in the film to just have a selling point of two big names.I'd say this is a step up for Christian films in that its not End Times and it tries to deal with real life though the ending is still happy but too sun shiney and flowery. Theres a good amount of Christian content in the film. Not too preachy but its not the most solid film, theologically or movie wise. Some violence and references to violence. Parents should probably view it first before showing it to kids under 13.Worth a rent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasingly entertained","review":"I love this movie. It's not a Christian film just because it has religion in it. What it is is entertaining. The drama, the love between estranged twin brothers that changes lives for the better. The compassion and goodness shown in the brother who was raised by criminals and who overcame his upbringing to do the right thing at his own sacrifices. The revealing of humanity in the hearts of the not so fortunate. The struggle of a young man who wants nothing more than to make amends for a decision made as a boy that cost him his brother. Finding out his brother lives gave him a second chance, a second hope. Switching places, one a priest in training, one a criminal by vocation, brought out the best in both. They found each other and then they found themselves. Laugh, cry, and be entertained by this unusual and remarkable film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the logic ?","review":"This is a poorly constructed thesis and serves only to display the typical weak minded headonism of carnivores.

There are some pretty good suggestions (read the newspaper, practice your jokes, etc.) but you have to wade through thousands of words to find them. And the stories! I felt like I was being dragged kicking and screaming through story after story -- most boring. There is enough solid information here to make a good ten page magazine article. The rest is fluff -- filler. Granted, it's easy to read. It just doesn't say anything. Save your money and buy \\"How to work a room\\" by the same author.

Susan RoAne offers the \\"do's and don'ts,\\" from discussing business during lunch to comforting those in mourning. She even devotes a chapter to effective cyber-chatting. She will make you more aware of your body language, facial expressions, gestures, eye contact, and listening skills. Many of RoAne's suggestions are common-sense and you probably already use them, but not consciously and with much reflection. This may cause you to consider what you do and say, and how you come across. RoAne emphasizes courtesy, respect, and the value of truly listening to others. We recommend this book to help you build confidence and generate lively, informative conversations.

I guess, if you are having major problems conversing with people, (people leave when you enter a conversation, or the conversation dies when you speak) then you might get this book to find out some of her don'ts.I expected her tips to include more examples of conversations.

For example, to \\"look at bad pictures, or touch yourself or anyone else in an impure way...\\" introduces subjects which are inappropriate for such young minds. Furthermore, the suggestion that children should busy themselves in \\"work or play\\" when bad thoughts arise is not the Catholic.

What I'm trying to say is I haven't seen much of his comedic work so I really can't formulate an opinion. He was brilliant in Martin Scorsese's masterwork, \\"The King of Comedy\\" and he had a terrific turn as a garment salesman on the great TV series \\"Wiseguy\\" in the Eighties. \\"Cracking Up\\" isn't a comic masterpiece but it's darned funny. There's no real plot here persay but a series of vignettes. Some of it works and some don't but enough does to make this worthwhile viewing. Lewis demonstrates his adeptness here not only as a great physical comedian but also a master of the visual pun. I was reminded of Rowan Atkinson's inspired comic creation, Mr. Bean, but I'm sure Atkinson took some of his cues from Lewis.

He recreated them for the 21st Century.Blue Shoes is his duo with acclaimed saxophonist Snake Davis; \\"The smallest band in the world\\". They still perform around southern Scotland and northern England regularly when Diamond isn't in his old duo Ph.D with Tony Hymas, who also has jazz and blues leanings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Set for a Little Girl","review":"My daughter got this for her third birthday.

We do have central air, but it does not do a great job cooling off the second floor, which is where our bedroom is located. After reading some reviews online about this particular air conditioner we went to Lowe's and purchased it for about $400. This is the second day we are using it and I can honestly say it is the worst air conditioner. It does not keep the room cool at all. In fact, it's warm in here right now with it running on full blast (my dog is panting). It is also extremely loud, even on its quietest setting. We are going to pack it up and return it tomorrow and purchase a window air conditioner that will hopefully do a better job at keeping us cool and comfortable in this 95 degree heat."},{"rating":"1","title":"One works, one doesn't","review":"I have one which is great and one which is bad---it fills with water after just 1.5 hours which makes it unusable.Delonghi has poor customer service and is not inclined to make it right.

I learned the technique in an hour. I had my clubs bent up 4 degrees to compensate for the upright stance.It's neat to be able to aim at a target, and hit a ball straight to it. Your back swing is no higher than your shoulders.You eliminate all the angles of the wrists and elbows. You don't sway, because your stance is wide. Your grip is left handstrong, right way right, like nailing with a hammer. You learn to acquire distance with solid hits and confident followthrough. I'm hitting in the low 80's now, having lowered my scores by 10 in less than a month. The pictures and philosophyare helpful, and encouraging. Golf is not life or death, its more important, and like life, keep it simple stupid. This bookmakes it easy, fun and gives you confidence you will improve every time you go out, without stress on your back.Get it.

I think this toy is worth the money.Cons: My main complaint is that he looks nothing like Prince Stefan from the movie. If your daughter is a big fan of the movie and a little older, this is sure to disappoint her. (My daughter didn't notice but Mom sure did). And I didn't like the fact that his hair is blond (Stefan was a brunette) and the heavy, coarse gel they put on it made his hair feel like a rock but still failed to keep the cowlicks away.Overall I would have to say I liked this toy, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtly Urges Your Little Princess to Marry Well","review":"A fundamental tenet of good parenting is that one should ease one's children into life's deeper lessons at an early age. Some of our best tools for doing this come from fairy tales and their morals, others from the raw materials of play. To this arsenal the wizards at Mattel add a vital weapon in the form of Ken Doll Prince Stefan. A single glance tells it all - the fine Italian clothes, the solid gold accoutrements, the he-tiara - Ken Doll Prince Stefan is loaded. An hour or so of play with Ken Doll Prince Stefan provided the perfect segue to revealing the broad outlines of our fading financial circumstances to our young daughter, and to explaining how finding herself a real Prince Stefan might one day help her transcend this situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad product!!!!!","review":"I have to go through the hassle of returning this Paper Punch as it does not work at all.

As a Christian, I have a much different knowledge of what happens after death. But even if I didn't have my beliefs, I'd still find this a discouraging book. The message seems to be that after we die, we just sort of drift off to somewhere, someplace, some kind of undefined existence -- like a balloon that's been released. Will there be joy? Others? Experiences? Growth? Who knows -- the author doesn't seem to.There are better answers than the abiguity that this book promotes. If you start with Jesus, you can't go wrong. With this book, you'll only become depressingly lost. There are plenty of children's books about death that are written from a Christian perspective, books that are vastly more reassuring and encouraging than this. They're based on truth, not on wishful thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I was looking for.","review":"I have been buying books for meself and my two boys for a loss of someone very dear to us.

It was a lovely gesture, and I am glad that so many people have been comforted by this book, but I must say that I found it trite and uninspiring. The poetry is poor, and the illustrations would rate as mediocre in children's book. The substance of the book is new-agey and shallow. For our grieving family, getting this book was like being handed a red balloon and being told that now everything would be okey dokey--it trivialized our experience. Please consider the sophistication of the recipient, as well as his or her belief in an afterlife, before giving this as a gift. It's not for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"Hearing this poem read aloud recently at a memorial service reinforced the opinion I had formed earlier upon reading this picture book that the poetry is trite predictable and banal.

We both love literature and beautiful poetry that stirs the emotions and stimulates the mind and this does neither. I knew long before the reader got there, exactly what the next line would say.

It was so depressing. For those of us who know what heaven is like and how wonderful it will be, this book is just sad. The afterlife suggested in this book would be horrible. Just floating around, not even having an identity any more. You're all alone, not being able to see those you love any more. If you're a Christian, steer clear of this book. A much better book is \\"Someone I love died\\". It's very solid."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"The Next Place was recommended to me for use with families who have lost a loved one. As a Christian pastor, I would never give or recommend this book to a grieving family. Why? Because it presents an afterlife without God, without heaven or hell, without bodies. It's Gnosticism 101. New Agey. No comfort here for the faithful of God."},{"rating":"1","title":"offends no one--means little","review":"The reviewer who stated this book is so ecumenical that it can offend no one is probably correct, as long as it's ok with you that it doesn't mean very much at all.

This book was perfect. I read it before I bought it, because it was that important. It's not religious. It's not a story. But, rather, conveys messages that help the mourning to understand what they're going through, and why their deceased loved ones can't hear them. The theory is similar in ways to many religions, although not obvious to anyone, or any specific religion. It explains a lot in terms that can be digested by the young, so that they can continue on, with hope and understanding. It's been almost two years since my neighbors' loss, and they're just finally coming to grips with it.

I always did love this song, and have longed for a copy of it many times over the years. I had a cassette tape with the song on it at the time; however, the tape has been long lost. Periodically over the years I have checked in music stores and have never found it. Since finding Amazon.com last year, I checked the music section every few months or so searching for this song or for Matthew Wilder. I was speechless when this new CD showed up on the screen, and quite happy when I could actually listen to part of the song over the computer!! Needless to say, I had to have it and have listened to it every day in my car since. My two children have also become very fond of it! Thank you, thank you Matthew Wilder, for making fond college memories return for this fan!!! How lucky I am!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chess ye fellow pirate lovers?","review":"I got this for my 12 year old son, as he loves chess and collects different sets. This set has been excellent. I usually like the wooden, stone, or glass sets. I have to admit though that this is more enduring the accidental drop from his brothers because of the rubbery nature of it. The pieces each have what they would be on the set so you don't have to wonder which is a queen/king or anything else. This set was a full thumbs up!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chart your Chess Board for Fun and High Seas Adventure","review":"This Pirates of the Caribbean Chess set is a treasure trove of fun.

Examining in-depth the litany of persuasive techniques used by the regimes, and ultimately concluding that the government expected more of propaganda than it was able to deliver, Bending Spines leaves no word unturned in its search to comprehend what truth moves and manipulates human hearts and minds.

Of all the different types I've used, including the very good Belkin hideaway cord concealer, this one is by far the worst. It's pretty cumbersome to install, the sticky tape comes off fairly easily, and it doesn't sit very cleanly on the wall. Plus, the whole thing is only 4 feet long, which really doesn't help when you're trying to hide away a cord from ceiling to floor. People also mention that you can only put in 1 cable cord on each side, for a max of two cable or power cords, and this is definitely true, as well as a huge limitation for home theater use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not flush, not worth it.","review":"Although all the pictures show the edges of the covers flush to the wall, and it advertises that you can paint the cover, in reality there's a very significant ~2mm gap between the edge of the curved cover and the wall itself. It's large enough that you can't possible cover it up with a liberal dose of paint, like I was planning to do.The shadow caused by the cover makes the gap very visible, and honestly it looks awful, like I've slapped a cheap piece of plastic over my wires.On the upside, it's extremely easy to mount, and the adhesive mounting means that when I take this off my wall to throw it away, I won't have left a mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap, easy, and fast solution for cables","review":"I purchased these to hide cables running from my 40\\" Samsung HDTV to my Onkyo A/V reciever which is stored in a shelf about 15\\" below the TV. Set up was super easy - simply place the cable guides on the wall by removing the double sided sticky tape on the back, line up the cables and place them inside the guides, and snap the outer cover on. Whole process took about 4 minutes. Now we have a clean looking system with no stray cables.I took 1 star off because the double sided sticky tape is horrible and needs to be replaced. Within about a month the guides started separating from the wall and the tape has lost its stickyness. Easily corrected though - just pick up some double sided tape for less than $2 at any hardware store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic junk","review":"3 pieces of plastic for $30.

So I bought it as a set, well I know I should have paid better attention as the shelf had about a 4 inch cable management system and this was maybe 2 inches so they do not go together at all. I am sure that it would work fine if that is what you want but I spent $20 on something that didn't work for me because of the way Amazon promoted it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cheapest way to go","review":"If your looking for the fastest and cheapest way to cover cords on your walls I guess this is your product. You can only hide a few cords. Power cords are thicker and have a tougher time being tucked away behind these covers. You have the option of screwing the snaps to these covers into the wall or simply using their stickers to hold them up. You then stap on the outer cover you see in the picture to the brackets. Either way the covers continually pop off. You have to paint these if you want a flush look."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you see","review":"This product does the job it says: covers wires, however the do not say it barely holds in the wires actually used for TV's and/or DVD players or other things.

Be sure that you take the time to plan the path you want the wires to run. The installation is simple but not the easiest job you will ever take on. If your spacing is not even or if the path is not straight the cover is difficult to \\"snap\\" into place. I would recommend using the included anchors and screws opposed to the adhesive.

While the plot may not be the worst part of the film, the saccharine aloofness with which the subject matter is treated is enough to bore and disappoint anyone who has seen at least one good romantic comedy in his or her life. The last five minutes of the movie may be redeemed somewhat by a lyrical musical score and a few beautiful scenes in Schumacher's usual style; however, you are still most likely to leave the room in an empty mood of deep disappointment. If you don't find The Lost Boys, Batman & Robin and 8mm sufficient proof that even the creator of some essential movies of the last two decades can have his dark hours, see this movie, and it is almost guaranteed that you'll change your mind.

In a world filled will hourly reminders of hatred and sadness, I need the occasional escape into a world where true love really does win, and jerks get what they deserve in the end.

I just wanted to draw attention to the fact. If S.D. Perry had included everything like with \\"Umbrella Conspiracy\\", the book would be incredibly thick and dull.Some readers claim that the Res. Evil novels are not \\"scary enough\\". If you played the game then you already know what to expect. Does one need to see all 9 \\"Friday the 13th\\" movies to know Jason murders all jabronies that enter his forest? No, you don't.

Each moment in the book carries the suspense and mystery of what is to come. Even though I have never played the game, from the beginning the book threw me into the plot and got me into every breath-taking scene.

I was pretty much skipping every other word as I hurried thru the book to see if there was anything that the book told, that the game did not. There was very little and the little there stated in the book was not enough to justify reading it.

Resident Evil City of the dead or Resident Evil 2 is the novelisation of the award winning Resident Evil 2. What i have numerous times stated with these books is that they dont just describe the plot in the game but also give you sub plots of what other characthers do ie Chief Irons and Anette Birkin who you dont have a clue what theyt were doing intill this book reveals it. The book follows Leon.S.Kennedy and Claire Redfield as they battle throught the racoon police department and try to escape. For some reason or another actually knowing what will happen (I have compleated the game loads of times) makes the books even better because you want to see how S.D Perry describes the main events of the game. the book is massive 330 pages of it and every single bit of it will get your juices going.

The story took hold of me from the start and I found the book hard to put down. The main character, Galvin began as someone I had no respect for but as the story progressed, I actually began to like him for his undying pursuit of the truth and justice.

A gear completely broke in under 6 months (with light usage), causing a tapr to be stuck inside the VCR. Panasonic's \\"1 year warranty\\" is really no warranty at all because they do NOT cover the cost of labor, and you can't just get a replacement, you have to take it to a service center, which costs more then the VCR itself.

That was just the start...as time went on, the heads quickly wore out (I hardly use this VCR) and suddenly I started hearing some very strange noises when I would go to play or rewind, etc. telling me that it was time to throw this piece of junk out.

The \\"new age\\" label is tacked on -- there's nothing contrived here, nothing \\"new-agey\\" about Kater's expressive playing (unlike many of his later works, in my opinion). The music excels at painting mental pictures, and most of the songs are worthy of their titles (e.g. Summer's Innocence). Like looking at a masterful painting, the music will transport you.

It is easy to tell that voices and sounds are coming from the speakers, rather than feeling like they come from the television itself. They have a lot of bass and can handle all 120 watts from my HK stereo receiver. I love playing video games through these speakers.

Philosophy is contextualised, introduced and summarised in the most lucid way imaginable in Philosophy for beginners and no amount of 'analytic' posturing obscures that fact.

Also, what's on the inside holding the Nikon logo on scratches the camera.The batteries are okay for back up, but definitely don't expect to go on a day excursion or even a birthday dinner with them. They work okay for about 15 minutes, and then the camera starts to really slow down (i.e. the picture is taken a full 4 or 5 seconds after hitting the shutter button, and then it takes another 15 seconds or so to save the picture to memory).

As you learn from the liner notes, an unfortunate side effect of this new feat was a wave of violence at shows. Still, I'm glad Mike Judge was pissed enough to do this for the scene.

Years later, when Lexie has almost forgotten, Merrina returns to help her in a last act of friendship.Reading it again as an adult, I was aware of the beauty of the language and descriptions evoking the sights, smell and feel of the landscape.This is not a sweet story.

It delivered on that point, but the quality of these deleted scenes and extended footage was about as good as a tape you had played a hundred times. It was fuzzy as hell. The view goes from clean to poor too often to ignore. I was told this was because this version was taken off of a foreign laserdisk. I would recommend getting the new bootleg version. It's the dvd with the paper cover. In this version the poor image quality problem has been fixed. So in my opinion, steer clear of this dvd and get the bootleg version."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant dialogue","review":"best part of the movie: zombie woman: \\"you once found me attractive\\" ash: \\"well, honey, you got real ugly\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I must agree with some of the other more negative reviews, this was the first DVD I have bought that truly disappointed me, and I love this movie. The alternate ending was interesting but why wasn't the original included somewhere?

Just when you're into the film the picture goes from clear & sharp into what can only be described as dirty & grainy..a complete joke.

This film takes something of a departure from the first films in attempting to mainstream the series. It is more humorous and it is virtually bloodless. It is also interesting that director Sam Raimi took the series into a time-travel vein. The action scenes and special effects are terrific. This film is played for macabre humor as opposed to outright horror. Star Bruce Campbell just continues to amaze as the series progresses. He had already proven himself as a comic force in \\"Evil Dead II\\" and here he expands himself as an action star something akin to an Errol Flynn or a Harrison Ford. If you want to wean the squeamish on the series start with this film and go backward."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIRECTORS CUT","review":"Unless you're a hard core Evil Dead fan- You probably won't be incredibly interested in the directors cut version of Army of Darkness. There's fifteen minutes of bonus footage including an alternate ending but most of the added footage doesn't seem to be as glossed over to fit the rest of the movie. The picture doesn't seem as crisp and the sound quality isn't as good. Although enjoyable I prefer the original version to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Army of Darkness","review":"The only reason I gave it 1 star is because they don't have a negative setting.

They say watch it with fun friends. I did. It was so bad. There is no plot, it goes from one thing to another with no explanation. Unless you don't know a good movie from a bad one, don't get this. The \\"comedy\\" in it is so repeatative. He fought the mini version for it seemed like 10 minutes and he fought the deadites in the well for another half hour. The phrase it's so bad it's good don't even apply. It passed that point on how bad it is. The action is horrible, and you shouldn't waste your money or your time on the \\"greatness\\" this movie supposedly has. Disgrace to movies and horrible spin off of an H.P.

Anyway, if you remember seeing this at the theater way back when or on TV at some point, you'll be underwhelmed with its lame \\"director's cut\\" butchering of the ending as well as its complete lack of good extra features.

Don't walk, RUN to get this amazing film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, rediculous and cheesy.","review":"The hilarious horror of the first two Evil Dead films is missing in this third instalment. That's OK, though, because the lack of horror has allowed Sam Raimi to develop the \\"cheesiness verses evil/sexy fantasy world\\" seen later in his glorious Xena and Hercules series.

The humor is retarded, and the effects are poor for 1992!!! I wish they'd cut out the noticable humor. In Evil Dead, it was funny, but not ridiculous. It was scary, too.

The one thing that I have noticed is that many people say that this is a bad horror movie. For anyone that has seen the Evil Dead trilogy, you should recognize that THIS IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE! It is the most entertaining movie (along with the Holy Grail) ever made. I don't think Raimi had any intentions of scaring people, he wanted to produce the movie as eye candy. He was trying to do something different that does not fit any one genre of style, and succeeded. Do not watch this movie with any expectations: except to experience a wonderful 90 minutes of eye candy and great one- liners."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS MOVIES RULES!","review":"This is better then both 1-2.The Special Effects are so groovy,Bruce Campbell have done some cool action -scenes.And I like the shoutguns seen verry much.ARMY OF DARKNESS Rules!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"High Camp and Bruce Campbell, What's Not to Like","review":"This movie is hilarious throughout, it takes the Evil Dead mythos and spins it into a fun medieval adventure punctuated with complaints and a## kicking from everyone's favorite film hero...Ash. While not as good as the other two Evil Dead films this one is still a great movie. This movie thrives off of a passion for films and filmmaking. Sam Raimi's great camerawork is on display as usual.

This movie shows our hero taking a continuous beating from zombies, haunted books, and anyone else he comes in contact with for that matter.

A horror cult classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Army of Darkness aka evil dead 3","review":"Warning.This film comes in three parts. Evil dead 1, 2 and the Army of Darkness. Each part can be seen seperatly, but for the best effect watch together, I have also seen 2 endings to the last part of this film. If you are interested in hearing about them mail me. These films are one of my all time favourites. This is a horror, suspence, comedy, film. Lots of blood. Also lots of really violent film deletions, or should I say sensoring. If you are unlucky enough to get a sensored version, then I would be very sorry for you, but this film doesn't rely on scenes's of incredible viloence anyway. so still worth the buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie gets 5 stars not the dvd.","review":"I love the Evil Dead trilogly so naturaly it gets 5 stars.

There is a short message from Bruce Campbell scribbled on the back of the 'bag' as well. The dvd disc itself has been made to look like a 4x DVD-R, labled with a felt pen also. Pretty funny stuff!The contents of the disc are exactly the same as the limited edition version, even the menus are exactly the same.A great disc, and much cheaper than that hard-to-find limited edition version... if you missed the LE version, or just want a copy with hilarious packaging, then grab this now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the greatest achievement of Mankind","review":"This movie is the best movie I've ever seen...

I loved every minute of it. DO NOT buy the universal edition of it, that edition has no special features. If you're a huge fan of the original ending, get the standard anchor bay edition. If you want 15 more minutes of AoD, like me, and don't mind having a different ending, get this director's cut edition. P.S. It is not just for horror fans.

I waited in line for four hours to see Bruce Campbell's book signing. He autographed my Army of Darkness t-shirt. Theoretically, I should love this DVD. But they cut out the best part! For those who have seen it, I can tell you that the real ending is nowhere on the DVD, replaced by the \\"original\\" ending. And when you see it, you will realize why they re-did it. No Bridget Fonda, no \\"Lady, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave the store.\\" Granted, the Audio commentary is great, which saves this disc from getting one star out of pure spite. But come on. Would it have killed them to include the real ending? Or was this a cynical ploy to force us to buy two copies? Why should I buy this if I have to ALSO buy the real version to get the full effect? Ridiculous. If you are a hardcore AOD fan and want the commentary, buy this.

What a great movie. I wish I saw this wonderful flick on the big screen. When I first saw it, I needed to see it again. Although this movie is not at all as gory as the first one, it still is a fun movie to watch. I love the fact that the director made Bruce Campbell act by himself. This shows a lot of Campbell's talent as a stand alone actor. If you want some middle-aged fun, watch this movie(especially the part when Bruce fights the three little bruces).

I had always avoided most zombie and Undead flicks, but this one sucked me in. Bruce Campbell takes himself so seriously, and the action is so wacky that the horrifying Undead creatures are not the main focus. Sure, I was pinching the seat a bit, but the humorous scenes were relief from the Insane Lovecraftian creatures.The superhero was so smug and sure of himself that he inducted me into Zombie / Undead flicks, and I've always loved this Campy movie. This is one of those flicks that you can watch again and again. Also, if you can't get people to watch Undead films, this is a good initiation for your squeamish friends. I wouldn't start them off withThe Evil Dead (Ultimate Edition).Army of Darkness is one to treasure, and it is always good for laughs amongst fellow geeks.

I suggest you get the non-bootleg edition though. I like the S-Mart \\"Hail to the King, Baby\\" ending better than the \\"end of the world\\" theme.The extra footage is kind-a boring (I can see why they cut it out), but it still rocks. If you like great BC quotes, don't buy this. The regular version has better ones (\\"Good. Bad. I'm the guy with the gun.\\"). Anyway, the movie is funny as hell if you like semi-slapsick moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic","review":"Army of Darkness is one of those films that can boast that it's main protagonist is entirely unlikeable and obnoxious. For Evil Dead fans who enjoy comedy, it's a total treat and really exists almost strictly for laughs.

Lets hope for another entry into this cult series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hail to the King, baby","review":"Just one of many great one-liners from this movie. Although usually found in the horror section it's really a comedy. Think of it as a big budget \\"B\\" movie and a sequel to Evil Dead 2, which is also great. This movie propels our reluctant hero Ash back in time to conquer evil. It is an acquired taste and is considered on of those \\"cult\\" movies (I dislike that term). Nevertheless, it's just a fun and silly ride into the past to fight an even more silly foe. No bones about it, Army of Darkness is a great followup to Evil Dead 2 and especially enjoyable with a group of friends on a weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Movie--Bad DVD","review":"I must agree with some of the previous reviewers. This is a good movie, but the quality of this DVD is VERY POOR!!! The final battle scene is grainy (worse than on a VHS tape) and the dubbing is bad. The words don't match the actions of the actors mouth during the final battle scene in some areas. I guess I'm going to have to buy the other (THX) version of this movie.

It distracts me from enjoying the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ultimate version of AOD","review":"This two-disc limited edition, featuring the director's cut, audio commentary, a couple of excellent extra features and the original theatrical version as well, is the version of the movie to get.

Some scenes are crystal clear while others you need to stand 2 inches away from the t.v. to see anything. trust me its worth the extra 4 bucks for the original version i just learned the hard way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, crappy DVD","review":"Well if you are trying to buy AOD on DVD, you probably wanna know more about the features and quailty, not if its a good movie or not. Well, sadly the DVD quality is really bad in some parts, I mean like they took a camcorder into a theatre and bootlegged it. And other parts of the movie are just fine in picture quality. Sound is okay in this version, I wish I had picked up the THX remastered version they had avaible for a short time. As far as the alternate ending goes, I think it's not as good as the theatrical release's ending. So all in all I would wait for a better edition to come out, this one kinda sucks. Doesn't matter though, any real fan of this movie will buy to see Ash use the really effective back-breaker on a skeleton warrior"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Picture Quality","review":"The only redeeming aspect of this disc is the inclusion of the alternate ending which works much better than the theatrical version. As for picture quality, it stinks. I've never seen a DVD with such poor quality. The colors are muted and deteriorate throughout the course of the film. During the final battle at the castle, the picture completely loses coherence and is bathed in blackness. My VHS copy of the film has much better picture quality. I assumed that the disc I purchased was defective, so I returned it for another copy just to see the exact same piss-poor quality on the new one. Army of Darkness is a great film, but this disc does not do it justice. I suggest buying a different version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most entertaining undead movie ever","review":"I don't know about the specific special release or bonus packages for this movie (so maybe I should be careful how I rate this), but the movie itself is top notch.

Basically \\"Evil Dead\\" 3, takes place in the past after our hero gets sucked through a time portal. There he must save the kingdom from an evil army of the dead that has risen from the grave (something he actually caused). The effects are dated but very well done and there are so many sight gags and great lines that make this a must see.

Most of the time the transfer of the video is great, but whenever it shifts to the new bits added, the video quality becomes nothing short of horrible. That really pulls me out of the movie and that knocks 2 stars off the scoreIt really is a shame they didn't take the extra effort to remaster the new scenes added in. Hopefully the new \\"boomstick\\" edition due out in March will feature a vastly improved transfer, that would be reason enough for me to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Hail to the King!\\"","review":"A great film made ever better for the fact that it isn't cut.

I Don't Think So....","review":"Evil Dead fans all hailed this the best film of the series...WHY?!? I loved Evil Dead, and the sequel was just as amazing. So, I wait for the third installment. Video stores where I live don't have movies like this, so I pre-ordered it from Amazon and waited. Once the DVD arrived, I wished I could've shipped it back! I failed to find the obnoxious humor that every other fan knew and loved. The film wasn't scary, more of a comedy -- and a bad one at that! Bruce Campbell reprises his role from Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn -- and director Sam Raimi returns to direct this piece of $h!T -- what a joke! Film is terrible, in short, if you loved Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 because of the gory fun and (sometimes) funny plot, then avoid this like the plague!"},{"rating":"2","title":"funney meets horrer great outcome","review":"this movie was very funney through the whole movie. some parts that where supposed to be scary where pritty lame. the best part of this movie is when ash is in the graveyard and is impersinating the 3 stooges. other then the lame scares it was a great movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT MOVIE!

(Blade Runner is #1 on my list.)This movie on Blu-ray was supposedly \\"digitally remastered.\\" This is one of the worst transfers to Blu-ray I have ever seen. Most of the frames have so much noise, that each frame looks like a stipple painting. (Stippling is a painting technique with a bunch of dots grouped close together.)Bottom line, this Blu-ray quality was so bad that it was distracting enough to reduce my enjoyment of the movie.It might be best to stay with a good DVD version of this movie until they release a better quality version on Blu-ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shop smart, don't shop Anchor Bay...","review":"Greedy, grubby, money-hungry, milking leeches.

Bad DVD","review":"Right off the bat let me say that the visual quality of this DVD is THEE worst i have ever seen. I saw the movie twice in the theater and at least a half dozen times on VHS and i never remember that quality being this bad. Some of the scenes are restored beautifully, while some are just horrible. The action scenes are a blurry mess, especially the windmill scene. Very distracting. The fact that this is Director approved makes me question Sam Raimi's ability as a Filmmaker. Another big problem i had with this film is that it's not Dolby 5.1. A six speaker system is wasted here. 2.0 is weak weak weak! The deleted scenes are interesting and the commentary is entertaining but it's not enough for me to recommend this DVD to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny uh oh","review":"Picks up where the second left off. Campbell is transported back through time with his chainsaw to the days of black knights and the landscape just happens to be crawling with dead people. He is tasked by the village people to save them against the evil which he excepts on the basis of being sent home directly after. A nice recovery over part 2 is smothered in immature jokes that will have the kiddies laughing their butts off. Not really designed for an R rating, this is plenty safe for children. In fact, one could argue that this was entirely made for children. Older generations won't get much of a kick out of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"VHS Widescreen is Edited","review":"The VHS Widescreen version of this movie is edited from the original movie. There's all kinds of nips and tucks throughout the movie, the \\"little Ash'es\\" scene was cut in half, for instance.

I think that this is the best part and series. I only wish he were still alive to continue making characters come to life. One complaint however, is the quality of the disc production, i.e: the sound and lighting that we have found on some of the disks in this series. We have been unable to watch a couple of the episodes because the jerking and interuptions of sound and photography were such as to make understanding impossible.

Comrade Brown's memior is well written and very interesting.The main problem I have with this book is that I feel Elaine's narrative is biased and self serving. (Especially her commentary on Bobby Seale.)Furthermore, I can't help but to wonder if some of her sexual adventure chronicled in this book are overblown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"Its when reading a book like this that you wonder about the other women who history has forgotten, but who played a pivitol role in getting to where we are today. Although I stumbled on this book by accident, it was certainly a profound experience in reading it. Those who claim some sort of moral superiority over Brown, do so with the risk of looking ignorant. Brown never claimed to be an unflawed leader - she is human, with all her fallacies, and that makes both her and the story of the Panthers a raw and powerful one, that ultimately rings true. Its important to understand the good and bad of the struggle that was (and is) the struggle for equal rights. Brown's touching autobiography gives as a very human and insightful look at an important woman during an important time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms.Elaine Brown: Example of Progressive","review":"...readers of this book may be intersted in what author's political opponents have to say.

The book was incredible to say the least. Though only a small segment of the book discussed sexism in the party, the message was overwhelming. Male chauvinistic attitudes, to a large extent, destroyed the party. Elaine, though seemingly strong-minded, also struggles with the self-worth issues that are so common amongst black women. She tried hard to fit into the schema of black womanhood that others (whites, her mother, black men) had created for her. She moves quickly through the ranks of the party, experiencing a taste of power, but in the end she wonders if she lost herself. READ IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You Won't Find the Truth in This Book","review":"If you want the truth about the Panthers and Elaine Brown you won't find it here.

Unfortunately, the director seems to lack any concept of comedic timing. Every plot element is derivative. For example--gosh, not only do we have to deal with being gay, but we've got these cultural differences to overcome! The majority of the cast delivered their lines as if the story was as uninspired as it is.I was willing to forgive so much to enjoy this film. Unfortunately, the terrible comedic pacing and predictable plot made this impossible. The director seemed to know that conflict drives the plot. However, conflict without viewer tension is ineffective. Maybe I have seen too many movies, but there was never a time when I did not know what was going to happen or how the conflict would be resolved. Good cast, mediocre script, terrible direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but..","review":"I am happy with the quality of the movie but it did not come with a case. It is in a cd paper slip.

I found myself laughing at the sad parts and rolling my eyes at the \\"funny\\" parts.The main character was completely unconvincing and her acting seemed forced, at best.In between \\"dramatic\\" scenes, I was forced to watch the lead character have lengthy pensive moments on her motorcycle, which reduced a friend of mine and me to utter hysterics.As if that weren't bad enough, the lead character's sister ended up taking a pensive ride by the movie's end.The movie was also predictable...within 5 minutes, I knew it would blow. This movie was recommended to me by a friend, and I'm sorry to say, she is no longer my friend. Maybe my review will help save other friendships from a similar fate. ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie in every way!","review":"How is a lesbian of color in New York City going to have close to no friends of color?! This movie is way too white-washed to be believable. It just re-enforces myths that gays and lesbians of color are just honorary white people.

It is actually written by several people with Fink and Graham editing. This causes several problems, the worst of which is repetition. Fink and Graham frame the major issues at the beginning of the book, and the contributors spend half of the rest of the book repeating what was already written. Also, none of the contributors were actually close enough to the source to offer interesting insight--most of the book seemed to be sourced from the AP. Ironically, the book suffered from many of the same problems as the Carter administration: too many people too distanced from the subject trying to be too objective and never delivering on clear goals.

Looking at the manufacturer's website, I find that this item can be adjusted to 20.5-25.5 inches high. Since the legs that go into the tub need to be shorter than those that go outside the tub, the transfer bench will be perhaps 22 inches off the floor when the bench is level. For many people, their legs will be hanging at this height or they will be sitting on the edge of the bench weight resting on their wet slippery feet. It's ridiculous that the supplier hasn't warned potential customers that this item is unusually large.In all other respects, this transfer bench seems perfect fine.
