The characters are endearing and the plot has many unexpected moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a great book.","review":"When I started reading A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY I liked it. In the beginning, it showed a lot of promise for becoming a good book. But as I read on, it seemed to go downhill. I liked the part of the story when Joe and Owen were young, but when Owen became a smoker who slept with his best friend's cousin, I began to lose intrest. I also thought the referrals to President Reagan were boring and pointless. Although, some parts of the book did make me laugh. Like when Owen wet his pants, and when he moved a car into he auditorium. All in all, I would not read this book again, or recommend it to someone. I just don't think it's worth all the effortthe reader has to put into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Dickensian\\" MY ARSE","review":"Several times, I've seen people compare John Irving to Charles Dickens. This could not be further from the truth. Dickens wrote in a way that allows the reader to make his/her own discoveries about a character through patient, nuanced prose that is in no sense self-aware. Irving, in contrast, like so many popular contemporary authors, draws such conclusions for the reader, telling him/her exactly what to think. If I had the book with me, I'd dig up an example passage, but I'm talking about things like, \\"He was one of those people who has property X.\\"To make matters worse, the narration from Canada was out of place and exceedingly awkward, and it even weakened the already ruined novel.Recommended for light entertainment only, and even that only for those who do not mind prose that is blatantly self-conscious."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American classic","review":"I've always loved JI since Garp but for some reason haven't gotten around to reading more of his novels till now. Glad I picked it up. JW is the perfect narrator for this moving novel about a young boy/man who alters the lives of everyone he meets by the sheer power of his personality. Other reviewers have done a fine job describing the general meaning of the novel. The charachters are life like and JI's abnormal insight into the human character makes this novel an absolute joy. It's also a bit of a mystery novel where you know the ending but don't know how you'll get there.I would give OM five stars but I know this novel is destined to be a part of high school required reading for years to come and no doubt stuffy teachers will take the joy out of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of John Irving!!","review":"I read this book about 15 years ago while I was in Hawaii.I remember not going out of the room one day so I could finish it..It left a big impression on me..I just downloaded the ebook so I could reread it because I remember the feeling when I finished it..I have forgotten some of it and want to see how I feel this many years later. I haven't reread it yet because I am finishing up a couple of other books, but I'm really looking forward to it again..I highly recommend it to anyone.!!! An astounding book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This book perfectly captures coming of age as an outsider.

Hate to lay it down for there never seems to be a good place to do so. Wish all books were like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational, Irving's Best Work","review":"After a slow start, this novel will take you places few others will: this book is both inspirational and luagh out loud funny. You will not regret an investment of your time here, especially if you cared for other Irving works. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely my favorite book of all time","review":"This book is quite seriously my favorite book of all time, and I don't throw those words around lightly. The story is alternately baffling, inspirational, and hilarious. John Irving is an expert at weaving an intricately unexpected story that is both minute and all-encompassing, spiritual and socially conscious. Irving delves into the most sincere human emotions, while commenting on one of the most crucial events in recent history (the Vietnam war). When this novel could become trite, it doesn't. And that is how it succeeds."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever","review":"I just finished reading this book for the fourth or fifth time. Owen Meany is certainly one of the all-time great fictional characters. I recently saw a list of the best 100 books of the century, and could not believe that \\"A Prayer For Owen Meany\\" was not on the list; it should easily have made the top ten. Touching, funny, absorbing: without a doubt Irving's best effort. One of my favorites, and I'll certainly read it again in a few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books.","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I never know what I'm going to get with a John Irving book--very often, his characters or situations are just too bizarre for me to wrap my brain around. But this book was just great--sympathetic characters, realistic situations--I read it several years ago, and I'm still excited about this book. Read it; you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is one of my favorite books EVER, and I have read it at least three times. I always marvel at what a wonderful writer John Irving is, his is truly a god-given talent. His characters are refreshingly developed, and this book offers some of the most comic entertainment to be had in a book--I laughed out loud more times than I can count. The story is amazing; it is so unusual and thought provoking. A truly wonderful read--but be prepared to have to think, not to just whiz through like you would a Clive Cussler novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best book ever","review":"this is the best book that was ever written. when i finished reading it i didn't want to leave the story. you deeply connect with all the characters and the ending is extraordinary. a must read for anyone with feelings"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I will ever read!","review":"I have just finished reading \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany\\" as an English assignment for school.

Owen Meany has touched my heart, and will not soon be forgoten."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"I catch myself thinking about what Owen would do in certain situations and I used to find myself feeling a little foolish for harboring such thoughts. But after reading these reviews and finding out that there are others out there like myself who have found this great book, I am proud to say that Owen lives in my thoughts. The story is so well told- something I find only Irving masters. I recommend Cider House, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, best book I have ever read!","review":"This novel envelops the life of one man, but in fact, depicts the lives of the common lost American. This is the only novel in which I have openly cried and laughed from page to page. Not only is it a rollercoaster of the emotions, however, it presents the reader with a glimpse of hope in an unenhanted world. I do have one question to people who have read the book though, what do you think tha armadillo really symbolizes?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind-blowing!","review":"My best friend reccommended this book to me and said that I would be amazed; he was right! A Prayer for Owen Meany is a book like none other; however, the full scope of Irving's genius doesn't hit until the end of the book. Read it and see what we mean! It is life-changing (at least for me)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!","review":"I read this book and was captivated. It must be the best book I have ever read. If you read nothing else-read this book, it cannot fail to have impact and keep you rivited until the last word. Keep the tissues handy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best American Fiction in 50 years","review":"I won't write a long, glowing review because everyone else has already done a fine job. With this book John Irving proves himeself a truly Great writer. He and Kurt Vonnegut are the only two Great American writers in probably the past 50 years. Get it. Read it. If you have an ounce of human feeling, you won't be sorry. I truly feel sorry for the one or two angry, bitter people who panned this book - they obviously didn't get it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage John Irving","review":"FROM THE BEGINNING OF THIS NOVEL I LOVED OWEN MEANY. IRVING'S SIGNATURE WRITING STYLE WAS EVIDENT FROM THIS EARLY WORK. I NOTICED MANY SIMILARITIES IN CHARACTERS AND SITUATIONS TO HIS MORE RECENT WORKS--READING THIS ONE IS LIKE LIVING THROUGH EVOLUTION IN PROGRESS. WONDERFUL BOOK. TOUCHING AND POIGNANT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just can't put into words-You'll have to read it yourself!","review":"I am finding this review hard to write. There are so many levels to this novel and it covers such a long stretch of time...I enjoyed the struggle of faith that is dealt with throughout the book. Mr. Irving makes a lot of good points about what it is that makes us believe (or not believe) in God. His characters are very believable and well rounded. They grow, they move on.I just can't express what a moving novel this is. I would highly recommend it and enjoyed it thoroughly but there is too much to share and too much I wouldn't want to give away. I have read three other Irving novels and this is by far my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"truly inspired work...","review":"When i found myself reading the last page of this book, it was clear to me that i will never forget the time in my life that i was introduced to \\"OWEN MEANY\\", much the same way those in November of 62 never forget where they were when news of the assassination of J.F.K.was made known to them...

Moreover, he even was at the origin of his best friend's mother's death! Whereas this best friend he had, the narrator, seemed to be nearly unexistent, always hiding behind Owen's acts and thoughts (which were one and only one thing, since Owen Meany always did what he wanted to do..). Nevertheless, as I kept on reading the story of such a great character, I got attached to such a man, who always remained faithful and loyal to his best friend. His death, even depicted by Owen himself long before he died, was a real shock : I coud not open a single book for several days after reading A prayer for Owen Meany, since I missed him and I knew well I would not find such a strong character, and such a strong story for a lon time. This is a wonderful book, thank you Mister IRVING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An addictive piece of literature !","review":"I was sitting in a cafe in Amsterdam when I saw a fellow American reading A Prayer for Owen Meany. Having already read Garp and The Hotel New Hampshire, I felt compelled to engage my fellow American in conversation about this book with the odd sounding title. The Man, whose name I don't recall ( remember, I was in Amsterdam...) told me a friend recommended the book to him with the words \\" It was the greatest book I ever read \\".It was these words that came back to me as I was in search of a new book to read. I wasn't disappointed. 1 month after reading the book I am still digesting everything Irving encompassed and intertwined into this throughly enjoyable novel. I am looking forward to reading it again and my sincere thanks to my American friend in Amersterdam for the recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had no idea!","review":"I was just humming along, reading a funny, entertaining and very well-written book about these kids and their lives... and WHAM! The ending took me totally by surprise. Now I find myself reading more and more books which \\"wrap everything up\\" like Irving did with this one. I used to work in a library and heard many men saying that Irving was a \\"chick writer\\". Well, my incredibly manly sexual dynamo of a husband enjoyed this book too, so there"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does everyone love this book?","review":"I really don't understand it. This book was recommended to me, and I couldn't even finish reading it. It got about a third through it, plodding through it, to see if it would get better. I found it extremely tedious and uninteresting. I was not as impressed with Owen Meany, either - certainly not as much as Irving was."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will never get back this lost time!!","review":"I have read other Irving novels & have greatly enjoyed them. This book was reccomended to me by English teachers at the school where I teach.I hated it. I forced myself to finish it hoping for a punch line or some fantastic ending. Nope - did't get either of these.Worst of all my daughter is having to read it for her English class & all I can do is mentally scream every time I think about it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1-star rating is even too much","review":"This book, despite all the acclaim it's received, is nothing but trash. Irving writes with a forced and awkward hand - there is no fluidity in this novel. It is incoherent and utterly ridiculous. The reader experiences no satisfaction at the end of the book, not even considering the untimely demise of the irritating Meany boy. Ugh, if burning books weren't frowned upon, guess which one would be roasting right now? Go on, guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"it usually takes me around half a year to read a book. i read this one in about a month.read this book. its a worthwhile story"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most tedious books I have ever read.","review":"This book has so many digressions, it is impossible to enjoy any story that might be hidden in the text. The nostalgia element of how neat it was to be a boy with a tragic and funny best friend was lost on me. I found myself using all my energy just to push through the book and finish it. But now I am sorry I didn't put it down when my instincts told me to. I will never get that time back."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Irving Classic","review":"Reading this novel, I didn't know what to think. The characters were very original. Owen Meany was just so courageous and funny. All of the characters had an important part to play to the very end. I didn't think there were any wasted moments, nothing we could do without. That is what I loved about this book. No wasted moments. It is one of his best works yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"very fun and enjoyable","review":"This was a great, boiling story, fun to read and very satisfying. It did not review well and if you want to be a snob about it, it does have its faults, but none that barred the pure enjoyment of this long, complex story with two main characters that are lovable. Its religious theme was carried all the way through and done well, it was quite interesting. The narrator, who was a slow student in school to begin with, ends up as an English major with an advanced degree and I personally enjoyed that aspect of the story as well. A good book is like a love affair, where you think about it a lot while you are a way from it, and are anxious to get back to it. That's how I felt about \\"Owen.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Selected readers will enjoy this book!","review":"This story of Owen Meany is a special one. I have never been into books that contain a ton of flashbacks and Irving resorts to this technique to tell the story. I was pleasently surprised when I read this book. The events that took place grip you and the way chapter end make you want to read more. Everything in the book all compiles together in the end to make (some) sense. The great thing about this book is you can read it again and again and gain a deeper understanding to what Irving is writing. It is a book for people who have the time to read becasue of its length and do not have a problem with religion. In conclusion, I am very pleased with the book and reccommend it to anyone looking for a change in pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"A wonderful book with a great ending. Why John Irving isn't higher up on the bestseller list is beyond me. His characters are the best and his writing style is unsurpassed. He's a national treature.Also recommended: McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Prayer for Owen Meany","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone! Before I read this, I never really had a favorite book. John Irving is brilliant! I was required to read a book from a list of authors for English, and I thought the assignment would be boring like most usually are. But Owen Meany is fabulous! It was unpredictable, entertaining, and hilarious! There was so much symbolism and irony, I've never had so much fun reading a book before! I will definately read another of John Irving's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book deserves nothing less then 5 stars!","review":"This book deserves nothing less then 5 stars. I'm a bibliophile, and read darn near every book that I can get my hands on.....all types of books, and this is by far one of the best books ever written, if not THE BEST! It has everything you could possibly want: it will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will make you ponder LIFE ITSELF. The characters are easy to get to know, and hard to ever forget. The ending is phenomonal, even though it is no surprise and you know what will happen, you will not want to ever say goodbye to Owen......will NOT want the book to end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"A Prayer For Owen Meany is a beautiful story about faith and destiny.

You may love it, you may not. Irving likes to walk a tight rope without a net holding an umbrella at most. He sometimes goes where Angels fear to tread. Some readers can be uncomfortable with that. I have been at times. Ultimately, I find him rewarding and one of the few living American authors that I have read consistently, pretty much all his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"NICE!SO GOOD.

Although, other reviews on this title have been positive I would question the motives of such reviews (Beckwith is a close associate of Parrish's and has co-authored other works).

I like Romeo and Juliet-esque books though... and that's what this is. Very sweet and the emotions Kait felt were shown very clearly in the book. Her journal entries were beautifully written.Unfortunately, you could tell very easily when things were going to happen, only because it followed the very typical plot of where everything goes down at the big party... and the book ended to suddenly.

The characters weren't real. They weren't believable. I didn't care what happened to the lead girl. Why was there so much hated between the sisters? It was never explained. The murder wasn't explained thorougly. The hatred between the families seemed lame also. I was not impressed with the book as a whole.

Two families have hated each other all their lives, and continue the tradition by raising their children to hate each other.

But who should she meet but a boy named Bram who also likes to spend his time in the shade, quietly drawing. The two are drawn to each other and all is going well until Kait finds out who he really is. Can their love overcome their family history? You'll have to read to find out!Overall it's a cute story, and though I don't expect one, I'd love to see a sequel.

At 2:30 in the morning, I finally finished and could put the book down.Pearson has taken a classic theme and given it a contemporary twist. The characters are NOT the cookie-cutter stereo-types found in most teen romance stories. These are well-developed, believable people facing a situation that has been brewing for more than a hundred years.Pearson's rich writing style and grasp of young adult emotions and reactions make this a very satisfying book.

Great set of accessories, amazing artiuclation, excellent physical attributes with great posing ability. Downsides: the shoulder holster keeps coming undone, it is difficult to remove and replace boots, in particular as one of the feet tends to curl under, making it either impossible to put the boot on or will break. Hint - use a tiny dot of lotion, lubricate inside of boot, it will help it slip back on. Make sure that the foot is not curling under. Otherwise, she's terrific.

Christopher Franke does an excellent job combining the instruments to make you feel like you are a part of the music. People who have listened to Volume 1 might notice a difference in the theme of the music. The music in Volume 1 has the theme of the first two seasons of the show. It seems to relate the mysteries and wonder of outer space. The music on this CD is more of a description of Seasons 3 and 4, with a heavy and dark tone to parts of it.I highly suggest listening to this CD with the volume turned up pretty high (earphones might be a good idea) so that you can get the full effect of the instruments, some of which you might not notice with a lower volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Babylon 5 Fans","review":"It seems that everyone who likes this CD liked the TV show first, but I was a Chris Franke fan before B5 (which I didn't watch too much), so my review is of the MUSIC. Frankly (no pun intended), it's weak. Since leaving Tangerine Dream, Franke has added an orchestra to his electronic sound, and it gets in the way on this CD (The first B5 release is better). I guess I won't know how the rest of the B5 albums sound, since this one was so disappointing. Electronic music lovers should start with KLEMania. Chris Franke fans in general should gauge how much they like the TV show before investing in this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommanded to B-5 fans","review":"I am a big fan of the series,and I liked this CD a lot.

Well, it was free because it was very slow. After a promising start, the plot grinded to a turtlelike pace. Formatting is awful with capitailized roman numerals serving as partitions in the chapters. I was constantly reminding myself that this was Victorian British Scifi.

The instructor walks through every motion and they do about 2 body band motions and then move on to the next. It is a constant stop and start. This has nothing to do with body sculpting.

In this novel Carthage is in its death throes as an imperial nation---eternally at war and unable to meet the daily needs of its citizens. They are forced to believe in an ecstatic religious cult that demands the sacrifice of humans. Flaubert's language in this novel even mirrors the internal frenzy of the citizens who always have to be prepared for yet another war. (I finished this novel in one day, I could not put it down.)Salammbo needs to be read as a novel; not as a work of history in order to truly understand what Flaubert intentions were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak depth of character","review":"I was not expecting anything from this book, though I loved Madam Bovary. The problem with the character, Salambo, a temple girl, is that she was missing in action. Instead, the author uses the title as a pretense to explore and describe ancient Carthage, and gives us little opportunity to know the main characters. Salambo says a few vague lines and then she's off, usually in a huff over her father, then Flaubert starts his travelogue on Carthage again, panning the lens around. If you love sheer exotic scenery then you might like this story--but if you also want memorable characters, this is not the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in Taiwan.

The tip off is section entitlked, \\"Fact/Value Split\\" where the author refers to \\"infamous Kennedy decision\\", referring to Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's decision on abortion. I should have stopped reading there, but once I start a book I finish it through. The book puports to be a \\"Students Guide\\", but it is nothing of the sort.

Realistly the retail value is not $80 it is around $40. The fabric is not all that soft however with a few washings it should be great. If the thead count bothers you like some other reviewers spend more money don't complain about it when it's plainly listed. An easy way to solve that problem if you are on a tight budget now is to buy it and then later buy a duvet to make the comforter softer. The only reason I deducted a star is because the bed ruffle is very flimsy. It feels like it would tear very easily. This is not a problem for me as I find them annoying but may bother some people.

Also, I still love hearing Rozalla belt out the inspiring \\"Everybody's Free.\\" Just a great song, period. Plus, there are some other hidden gems on here, including the funky \\"I Lift My Cup\\" from the underrated Gloworm, Kym Sims soulful \\"I Must Be Free\\" and the thrilling \\"Do You Believe in the Wonder\\" by Jeanie Tracy.

The price at TCM was $ 17.99 and at Warner Archive itself was $ 19.95. The price at \\"these sellers\\" was almost $ 40.=. But for customers overseas it is impossible to buy at TCM or Warner Archives and \\"these sellers\\" make abuse of this. I know if Amazon is offering it itself it still is higher in price than with Warner Archives but at least $ 10.= cheaper than \\"these sellers\\". Well, I hope someone at Amazon will take notice of this and start offering the DVD because at a price of nearly $ 40.= I feel swindled.

Unfortunately, only a few of her movies are currently available on DVD. My favorite June Haver movie is this one. Maybe this is in part because this movie also features a very young but very pretty Debbie Reynolds -- another favorite of mine -- in only her second role. Also featured are singer Gordon McCrae and dancer Gene Nelson, but June Haver was the star. To be honest -- despite the fact that I love this movie -- it certainly is not a great one, although it is pleasantly entertaining. But the main reason to acquire this movie, in my opinion, is to see the talented Debbie Reynolds when she was in her teens and the beautiful and very talented June Haver, who once was an outstanding star and deserves to be remembered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Movies","review":"Would highly recommend this movie.

That is how this book starts out. The planet was half-destryoed by a toxin which was why the rest of the survivors had to evacuate.The masters had to leave their padawans to deal with the people evacuating, while they help the sick and dying in the Isolation Sector, where the toxin is.The padawans discover that an invasion is about to take place. They try to contact their masters to tell them about the isolation.With comlink failure, the masters have to find out on their own.

There is not enough of Obi-Wan, there are about five chapters in his POV. The Shattered Peace was more exciting than both the books combined. You could see the villain a mile away in #1.

But when a deadly toxin infects a planet, the four Padawans and Masters must separate in order to stop an invasion and to make sure lives are spared.I think this book would only appeal to Star Wars fans because you have to know a lot about it to understand what's happening.

So just trust me when I say grab it- if for no other reason the exotic locales, Shirley MacLaine's beauty, charm, and smarts (not to mention the stunning wardrobe by costumer Jean Louis), and the fun interplay between MacLaine, relative newcomer Michael Caine, and the urbane and charming Herbert Lom.

Unfortunately, this one is in the \\"not at all\\" group.I have used these, per instructions, about 3 times a week and have gone through almost the whole box. I have not noticed any improvement in the puffiness under my eyes, nor in the fine lines around my eyes. Frankly, I can't see any change at all.The applicator is okay, but seems to be a real gimmick to me. It says to \\"massage\\" the eye area to help reduce the puffiness, but this is contrary to every other thing you read which tells you never to tug or pull on the delicate skin around your eyes, and despite my best attempts, there is no way to \\"massage\\" with this product without tugging and pulling the skin.

The sponge felt like it was leaving microscopic scratches on my skin which was probably why the eye area had a burning/stinging sensation after the application of the cream.

For the money, I'd rather have the tube. I can figure out how to put a drop or two on my skin without the expensive \\"delivery system\\". Most of the money seems to go to the elaborate packaging, sponge system to apply the serum. What a waste! You can't even tell how much gets on because so much is left in the sponge. Plus, the sponge is quite rough for the eye area. I don't think this whole idea was thought completely through. Spend your money on the tiny tubes made for the eye area.

I still use the product but use my finger to rub it in, which i believe for the price, is not worth it. I'll just buy an eye serum instead.

Otherwise it would be 5 stars. When we go out with my mom (she has a minivan) my kids, who are 4 years and 2 months, absolutely love it. The front seat doesn't recline too far back, but my little guy likes to sit strait up so he doesn't miss anything.

It takes up less space than my Graco single stroller does (they only thing I have to do is remove the canopy but the fact that it fits I'm ok with that!). I wish I had known about this stroller when I was pregnant with my first because I would have just bought this one then and not purchased the single one.

The sun shade provides nice coverage. Easy to fold and unfold. A big bulky, but is to be expected since it is a double. I do think it would benefit from sturdier supports, feels a little wobbly with the weight and the push up hill. Do take into consideration my son is a bit big to be riding in a stroller.

We live in a city and have a primary stroller for every day use so this stroller did not meet our needs for several reasons. We have a 2 1/2 yr old & a 2 month old.*When using the extender for the infant car seat it is actually over 50\\" folded despite what the dimensions read on the description and it didn't fit in our trunk.*When using it with a car seat in the front you have to recline the front seat & it makes it very uncomfortable for your toddler to sit on back seat (you can see this in the pics). So it is not the best option when using it for a toddler & an infant.*You also have to put the car seat in the front & I would prefer to have my infant closer to me than in the front of the stroller so after much comparing of these type of strollers we found that the BabyTrend Sit N Stand Ultra is actually a better choice cause it gives you this option. Its much more versatile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, we have 3 of these.....it's that good..","review":"We own an orange ultralight for home, and a regular weight red one for one Grandma's house and a regular weight orange one for another Grandma's house.

I was looking for a tandem double stroller that is lightweight and maneuverable and let me tell you, Joovy did not disappoint me. It maneuvers great even with one hand. I agree with other reviewers that the sunshade doesn't work when the infant seat is being used and the basket is hard to reach (you have to slide rear seat out in order to access it ) but I am ok with that. The only thing I was not excited about when I received this stroller was the color...orangie, I loved this color in picture but actually its way too bright, almost florescent. But that's a choice I made, nothing wrong with the stroller.

It does a great job sealing off sound but when I pull them out of my ear, I have very bad pain inside my ear like the suction is pulling out my ear drum. No matter how slow or how careful I am pulling them out, i 'm still in pain. Like I said, use ear plugs to sleep all of the time, I suspect it is the extra cushion on the outside of the plug that is a culprit . Very bad product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well, But Get Ears Checked For Wax","review":"I used to sleep with them all the time, to avoid outside noise of busses, garbage trucks etc. in the morning. While working well to reduce noise, when I visited my doctor and audiologist, both said that they do increase wax buildup in the ears, meaning that over time you hear everything more poorly.So if you use them regularly, I recommend having your doctor check your ears when you see him/her next as you may need to irrigate your ears to remove excess wax."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so hot so","review":"this is, i am sure, a perfectly helpful book across the pond. in america, especally the upper midwest not so much. the measurements are off and the ingredients are not readily available fresh or frozen. very few recipes i can use. some interesting ideas tho."},{"rating":"2","title":"D-Link DWL-M60AT works well","review":"This antenna gave me a 30% signal boost when switching from the dinky little plastic antenna on my dlink g520 card.

Great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing performance","review":"Returning this antenana because the performance was actually worse than the tiny standard Apple G5 antenna with its theoretically less advantaged placement under a desk. Mac Stumbler rates the signal strength around 45-51 with the standard T shaped antenna. Even raising the DWL-M60AT to head height the signal strength never rose over 43%. Maybe the omini-directional standard antenna is better at dealing with the obstructions and DWL-M60AT would perform given clear line of sight. Perhaps the larger Dr Bott directional antenna is worth the 5x premium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Replaced one of my DIR-625 router omni-directionals with this, carried my signal strength meter around the house and saw absolutely no change.

However, the rendering of this DVD product is inferior, containing numerous splices and film scrathes which badly interfer visually and aurally. The seller claims this: \\"Brand new and factory sealed Authentic Region 1 DVD. Direct from the distributor.\\" The package claims a copyright for Nostalgia Family Video.

I don't think anybody cares about the sex, but you were hypocritical by going after prostitution rings while at the same relying on their services. It must be excruciatingly painful not being able to live up to your own expectations. There is no doubt that you are very smart, and that you have done a world of good before you became a governor. I hope you realize now that you will be measured by how much of a difference you make in the culture around you rather than by handing out fines while history simply keeps repeating itself. Now there is no place to go but do what you are best at and doing it with grace. Keep up the good work.A very excellent movie by the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential reading for the coffee afficionado","review":"This book is wonderful just to read; it is rather more like a memoir, full of stories, anecdotes and facts. The history, customs and gracious living associated with coffee culture are well-described by Roden. The end of the book has recipes, including some sweets to go with coffee, punches and other recipes not usually found in books. But mainly, I enjoy reading this book.

They show real machines doing real work, with voice overs for each machine (\\"Hey kids, welcome to the garbage dump! I'm Spike, the garbage truck\\"). I like them because they are simple, educational, and the boys just love the machines. There is not a lot going on visually, so your kids won't get ADD from watching them.I guess not all boys are into machines, but if your kid is, this is a terrific series. There are many different DVDs (not just this Making Tracks set).

Really wholesome.2) Lots and Lots of Trains: Entertaining and instructional with plenty of songs and an abundance of trains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandson loved this","review":"Bought this for our Grandson for Christmas and he loves Trains.

It was also a reminder of how brutal the human race can be, no matter the nationality. The protaganist, Balthazar Wood is an irreverent but latterly idealistic computer programmer with a dry sense of humour and the story covers human smuggling, the fallout to people's lives and minds from war and relationship struggles. A great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bass Trombone Case","review":"Neotech doesn't make a separate bass trombone version of this case (I wish they did), but a friend of mine had one for his bass trombone straight mute and was able to get his inside.

Holly Lisle DID NOT contribute. (The book says she did) 2). TWO days after I had purchased LAMMAS NIGHT the cover fell off! In conclususion: This book was a waste of money. Get it from your local library if you want to read it that much! :^("},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it, interesting concept","review":"This was a very interesting collection of stories. It's neat to see how different authors interpreted the song and provided their own little twists. To the people who say that the story is repetitive...You have no idea what you were talking about. Each story was different from the one before it; though the main points were the same (ghost, spell, Lammas night), that was the only thing that was. I found myself enjoying the stories and wondering how each author would make each one new and interesting. I especially loved Miranda and Lady of the Rock. If you find the stories repetitive, read them one at a time whenever you feel bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Enough","review":"I liked this book, I really did... And I understand that, as they're all based on the same song/poem, the stories are all going to have some things in common.

I'd recommend buying this used, or taking it out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par!","review":"When I bought this book the synopsis sounded interesting but I would have bought it anyway since Mercedes Lackey's name was on the cover. What a disappointment. The story was good as far as it went, which was one chapter, but it just kept repeating and repeating and repeating ad nauseum. When I finished what I thought was the first chapter I was intrigued and curious to see how the story would be developed. It wasn't. After the third rewriting of the story I put the book where it belonged, in the garbage. This was an extremely disappointing story. I also expected to find more development of the significance of Lammas (August eve). I obviously do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"something greater !","review":"...picked up this album a few years back ....Bernards drumming is excellent and he's fun to watch.The best track on the album is \\"Manny\\" by far !!!!."},{"rating":"2","title":"gem of an album","review":"I really love this CD, they've got this great honest sound about them, unique, alternative, melancholy pop type thing going on.

He's my superman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the theme music...","review":"L&C; was a great show, no doubt, and one of the best Superman adaptations of all. The music, as many here point out, really sets a standard for what theme music should be... something to enrich and accentuate the show, not sell CDs. But, the music is very calming and refreshing and sometimes inspiring.My one complaint... how could they leave off the two cameo songs performed by Terri Hatcher. She has an excellent singing voice. When she sang \\"I've Got A Crush\\"... BRAVA! indeed. They should have included her songs on the soundtrack. Without that, well, no five stars from me...Oh well..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Soundtrack","review":"What else can I say? A truly awesome musical score.

I know because I tried them."},{"rating":"2","title":"good grip","review":"The battery holder/grip improves the camera handling when holding the camera for vertical shots. It holds an extra D-L150 battery which can power the camera when there is no battery in the camera body. The grip also has storage space for the remote controller and space to store a replacement SD card. Unlike the battery this is only a neat place to have a spare card--it does not record images when in the holder. The grip does not hold regular AAA batteries. This is a mistake in a review on a photo magazine web page, it is a shame but Pentax does not make that claim. As I said, grip improves the handling of the camera when held vertically. The improved balance more than compensates for the little extra weight. If you have a K20D or K10D I can recommend getting this grip while supplies last."},{"rating":"2","title":"definately good to have","review":"The well thought design allows fully functional camera operation from the vertical. Good for back-up battery storage, which can be switched to electronically, once the battery in the main body dies. Also, storage space for extra memory card or wireless remote. Although it's a little bulky, I definately made a good decision in purchasing this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent- Ergonomic, Extends battery and function, Sealed","review":"I wasn't sure if I would use or need this but so very glad to have purchased it with new K20D. Not only does it provide a secure, convenient way to store an additional memory card and remote but automatically extends the batterly life. The additional controls and functions also make for a comfortable fit as does the entire grip...in fact, I STRONGLY prefer the grip as it just seems easier to hold and control.For those who may be wondering - yes, the grip IS sealed just like the K20D so no need to worry about a sealed camera with unsealed grip. I don't find it excessively heavy or builky - to the contrary it feels very comfortable even with relatively small hands. I enjoy the ability to use alternative controls when shooting at different angles and VERY pleased with this purchase. EAsy to install, intuitive to use, makes it nice to carry additional accessories without fear of loss. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!!","review":"The battery grip is awesome. There is storage for an extra battery, memory card, and a wireless remote. The battery grip turns a stardard SLR into a professional camera. If you are taking vertical pictures for an extended period of time, the battery grip makes it easy on the wrists and hands with the \\"bottom\\" shutter button. There are minor downsides to the battery grip - the battery and memory card are not active with the camera and you have to remove the battery grip to change out the battery. Other than that, I recommend this to anyone!! :o)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless for anything but an added hand grip.","review":"I bought the grip for the (supposedly) doubled battery life for time lapse shots and such. This grip does not double your battery life. It does allow you to carry an extra battery as it does an extra memory card onboard the camera but your camera will still shut off when whichever battery you have currently selected dies. In order to use the second battery you must restart the camera and it will automatically select the fully charged battery (most of the time).The only advantage battery wise from this grip is that you don't have to take an extra few seconds to swap the battery out. If you are expecting doubled battery time it is not happening with this grip.The only true advantage this battery grip has is the added hand grip area itself and this is certainly a high price to pay for added grip alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star is for AMAZON","review":"Do not use AMAZON - they cancelled my order after I had made purchase and I am now out of pocket due to currency exchange rates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Addition for K10/K20D","review":"I haven't owned the grip long enough to do an in-depth review, but my preliminary reaction is very positive. It gives the camera a nice balance, and the extra battery life is a real positive.The only downside--and it's not a major one--is that it does add a bit of weight, perhaps more than some will want to tote around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply derivitive","review":"A supervisor at Boston's Logan airport is murdered and union ramp agents are suspected. This is the premise of Hard Landing, and a clever one it would be if it weren't taken from a real-life crime. Heitman acknowledges her \\"inspiration\\" once during the novel by (shamelessly) citing the real murder as part of her narrative. One wishes she at least would have chosen a venue other than Boston for her novel, but being that the author worked at Logan for years I guess the familiarity was too great and the imagination required to transport the scenario somewhere else too daunting. Having said that, it was an entertaining enough read, but being somehwat familiar with the real-life murder kind of ruined it for me. Kind of tramples on the grave at worst and lacks imagination at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Bear, DVD won't play","review":"My daughter loves her Care Bear, but when I tried to play the DVD, it said that my DVD player could not read that type of disc.

Although not directly suited to my purpose, the book contains great advice on finding a small acreage (4-12) property in the country.Most of all the book made me feel even better about our opportunities- as the writer repeatedly commented on how much easier his search would have been if he was looking to buy 40 or more acres of land. Wouldn't you know it, that is what we are looking to do.The author has a flowing and folksy writing style, that doesn't get bogged down with too much technical real estate jargon- and footnotes are provided in the rare instances where technical terms occur. This book is in many ways much more than a book about how to buy property cheap, it is the author's life story- his dreams and aspirations for a place in the country since his boyhood.I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to purchase land in the country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for newbies, also has good ideas for more experienced buyers","review":"The book is easy to read and entertaining as well. It takes the reader along the path the author took when he bought his country property. He offers ideas and shares what worked for him as well as what didn't. He defines terms that any buyer should become familiar with when looking for land. Although none of his individual suggestions for finding small rural parcels are earth shattering, following his overall approach should yield good results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining and lots of great ideas!!","review":"I couldn't put this book down after I started it. A quick entertaining read, it was exactly what I was looking for! We just bought 7.5 acres of rural undeveloped mountain land ourselves, and are in the midst of learning more about how to prepare it for use. I had such a great time reading this book because it matched what we are doing exactly, from searching with plat maps and using aerial photos (as we did to find our property), to figuring out what's the best type of structure to put onto the land to be able to go out and enjoy it. I love the escapades about the tractor too, and the ending is just great! You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Country Property Dirt Cheap","review":"After reading this book I really became even more convinced that I could find and buy a retirement farm for myself.

I was on the adoption committee to select calculus texts. I had heard that the Stewart text was a national best seller, so I volunteered to review it. I was startled. I can see now reason why this text is widely used. It is even more difficult to believe that its author has had any classroom experience with honest-to-goodness calculus students. The writing is rambling and obtuse. The design is not helpful and blends prose with examples. The art is irregular, some art is small and some is huge, some topics that cry for graphs have none and some that don't need graphs have several. I have used several other texts and it appears that the author used a cut and paste technique to create this text, taking liberally from other best sellers. After a careful review of this \\"popular\\" text, I felt obligated to write this review. Someone needs to point out that the \\"emperor is not wearing any clothes!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"BLECH!","review":"This is an inferior text-book. I haven't the faintest idea why seemingly every college in America chooses this book. Stewart's tome is replete with \\"eye-candy\\" and is inconsistant.

There are 20 puzzles and I didn't read all of them. I scanned 10 and imagined attempting these with my 8th graders. The stories or riddles are so broad that I'm not sure the kids would be able to narrow their ideas to even get close to the answer.

It had a dozen or two political points to make but no cimematic point to speak of. Read the book... get all the same information... and skip the movie. It felt like it was way too long. The little promo cartoon in the DVD extra's called \\"Backwards Cow\\" or \\"Backwards Burger\\" was absolutely just as effective as the entire movie and pulled it off in less then five minutes. I thought the cast and acting performances were plenty solid... just wasted in this mess of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downer","review":"I really thought this would be a clever and well crafted expose on the business practices of huge companies like McDonalds. Instead I watched a really depressing movie about the use of illegal aliens in meat packing places that supply the fast food chains.

I was expecting a movie that took us behind the scenes of fast food restaurants but instead found a broad range of issues. Also the graphic nature of the film was very surprising to me.

I wish I had never watched the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply Troubling, Important Narrative","review":"This film dramatizes the many issues surrounding the changes in the food chain across time in the US. It informs the viewer regarding some of the harsh realities and potential hidden dangers in the food we eat.

Strongly recommended for folks seeking the truth regarding the source and quality of US food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the book is better?","review":"What a waste of 2 hours - this really is a meandering, disorganized waste of time. I felt like the movie's funding ran out so they just stopped filming. I'm all for shocking the senses and provoking thought, but this mess does neither.

Judging from some reviews, the book seems to be a lot better than the movie. The movie just seems fake to me because I wasn't presented with new surprising facts about the how fast food restaurant operates. I thought I would be getting some movie similar to Sicko and Supersize Me. The movie makes me feel like they are trying to connect two movie into one but fail to do that.

I would just as soon send it back just as fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"So What?","review":"The problem with Fast Food Nation is that it is a film that really doesn't know what it wants to be. There are three story lines, more or less related to the fast food industry: illegals working in a meat packing plant, young men and women working in one of the franchises, and the corporate executive trying to look into the whole fast food process, from processing to selling. Unfortunately, only the first plot line comes even close to being developed. About two-thirds of the way through Greg Kinnear (the executive) just disappears from the film! Unlike the book, there is certainly no sense of expose in the film - it's not like people don't already know about corporate greed, that fast food isn't good for you, that in real life the bad guys win most of the time.

You'll start to feel hopeful when you notice a snippet from the book emerge and then you'll be disappointed to see it quickly dropped in favor of a story about the lives of illegal immigrants. There is a lot of sex in the movie that isn't in the book at all and almost everything positive from the book has been removed. The issues in the book need to be considered by everyone in America, but this movie doesn't provide them in great enough depth.If you want to see a film about this topic, \\"Super Size Me\\" is much more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOK WAS STELLAR- MOVIE IS NO COMPARISON","review":"the book was beautifully researched and written to provoke outrage about all we let huge industries get away with. the movie was ALL about immigrants passing through the border and what they have to endure just to make a dollar. there was such a loose plot and the director dragged out scenes with lots of slow talking and shots that made absolutely no difference in what fast food nation is about.a documentary would have been more parallel to Supersize Me but way more entertaining and informative than the garbage this Linklater directed. [...] matter being detected in the meat of ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CAFETERIAS was more of a focus in the book which the movie DIDNT EVEN TOUCH ON.

While the film itself does have a very interesting story, and the acting is good, it is so shallow in comparison to the book. I realize that the book was a thoroughly-research academic work, and that one can not expect a movie to recreate all the information in the book. But this movie is a gross simplification of the really important facts. If you have NOT read the book, you will probably enjoy the film. But after you watch the film, be sure to read the book -- it is VERY enlightening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for Thought","review":"It can't be easy to make a film about the fast food industry without coming across as preachy or judgmental, but \\"Fast Food Nation\\" does just that. The film does a good job of showcasing a diverse array of characters who are involved in the fast food industry on a variety of levels; from high school student cashiers, to an upper level marketing executive, to illegal immigrants working in the meat packing plant. It helps that an impressive level of acting talent was engaged for the film (including Patricia Arquette, Bruce Willis, Greg Kinnear, and Wilmer Valderrama, who is somehow far less annoying when he's speaking in Spanish), and the talent all helps to flesh out characters that could easily have come across as two dimensional. Each character, although superficially different, is each depicted as a person doing their best to survive in society, despite their reservations about their job or the industry they work in. Is there anyone who can't relate to that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-see!","review":"Those who see Fast Food Nation as simply a movie about hamburger or even the fast food industry miss the point. Fast Food nation uses the fast food industry as a metaphor for the degradation of EVERYTHING from the land to the lives of ranchers to the the people who work within the death machine which is modern corporate culture. It is broad in its scope, but it must be. The banding together of young people to fight the ills they saw through direct action gives hope for the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapoiting","review":"The movie is about the fast food industry, the lack of sanitary conditions and the lack of humane conditions. Throw in some race issues, gender issues and men being chauvinistic pigs PLUS some lack of self-respect and this is the movie. I was dissapointed, this movie lacks a cohesive plot and all plots are left somewhat unresolved. They could have had a great movie had they carried out the plot better. Instead, the film debased each and every one of its characters to the vilest of actions and morality. The film merely points out to the issues of race, animal rights, sex, etc...but does not really explain their nature, or a solution. The characters are left to exist within their own world, existing selfishly through the own suffering and preserving it at the same way as they fall in the viscious cirle that started at the beginning of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"More relevant than ever!","review":"Fast Food Nation sheds light (as it should do) on several important matters, including: how powerful the Fast Food giants and their associate companies have become, the poor quality of meat and health standards, and how immigrants are being treated and exploited by Americans and other immigrants alike.The film brings to the screen the parallel stories of various people associated with a meat packing plant in Colorado that supplies the patties for a (fictional) fast food chain called Mickey's.Greg Kinnear, Bruce Willis, Kris Kristofferson, Ethan Hawke, Avril Lavigne, Luis Guzman, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.The setting, the plot, and the dialogues are all good and even though it's quite graphic at times it does get the message across loud and clear.In short, Fast Food Nation is a movie definitely worth watching, as it is surely an eye opener. 3.5 Stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"ho hum","review":"There is really no story to this film. It just keeps jumping around. There are a couple of sex scenes but nothing really exciting.

Someone told me to watch this one as it gives a look at the meat processing area. I think they movie could have done more to show how the dirty side of the processing plants.

I was looking forward to seeing this in the theater but it was pulled from theaters what seems like 2 weeks after it was released. When i finally got the DVD I was very disappointed. Fast Food Nation the book is a fantastically researched book about the fast food industry in America. Fast Food Nation the movie is just a poor attempt at trying to make money off the famous name of the book. Firstly I wasn't expecting it to be fictional. i was actually expecting a documentary type movie. After I put that aside, the story is just bad. It is a love story mascarading as something based off Fast Food Nation. I really don;t recommend this movie.

I expected it to be informative while entertaining. I should have carefully read the rating and fine print on the back. It says: \\"Rated R for disturbing images, strong sexuality, language and drug content.\\" While the idea behind creating this film was noble, the actual presentation is crass, boring, and random so it was difficult not to fast-forward through many parts. The constant cursing and perfunctory smut (including one graphic sexual scene) make this film totally inappropriate for families. I would NOT recommend Fast Food Nation to anyone unless you have 114 minutes to waste on something that could have been presented tastefully and intellectually in 30 minutes.If you are interested in an entertaining and family-friendly \\"documentary\\" on the fast-food world, try \\"Super-size Me.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"I was hoping to use this to show in my high school health class - no such luck.

Ditto the quickest way up Mount Everest. Some things are going to be impossible for the ordinary mortal - to wit, the quickest way to get rich is to marry money, or, to get invited to The White House, donate lots of cash. There are fun things, like how to solve a mystery, and how to perfect your golf swing, but all are only one or two pages of very spaced type.

The film quickly and easily summarizes the chapters in the book and I enjoyed the fact that they cover the chapters backwards. In response to one of the comments about his speech impediment, that's just disrespectful and the reason why they did not comprehend what he was saying means they obviously were not paying attention to the speakers much.

Apparently a stripper's near naked butt is grounds for termination. (Personally, I found the sumo wrestlers more disturbing.)The teacher is not protected under the First Amendment. So, do not show this in your classroom, even though you will not find anything here more disgusting than you would see on a daytime girls' talk show or a modern mainstream comedy.The video is paced well, except for the dud skateboarder who thought the army would let him join.Enjoy...and then think about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"an entertaining motivator to read the book","review":"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed the book I fully expected this would be a glossy overview and, for the most part, that's what it is. It's not superficial by any means but the discussions are not as deep. Given the format, there's no real way around that. The movie is fun and serves its purpose well.I think the best use of the movie is to motivate someone to read the book.

I Did It Again 3:31CD comes in a cardboard cover. The greatest track on this CD is Track 4 it kind of reminds me of an Alice Deejay song. It is upbeat and not too fast but it is a Dance/Techno Mix w/ a cool break in the middle that sounds kind of Hip-Hoppy but it is so cool. Track 4 is a typical Dance Mix but dont get me wrong its groovy. The other tracks are ok the remixes of \\"Oops!\\" are Hip-Hop remixes they sound good but I dont think they work well with me but they are cool.

Now for my second child who slept through the night in a pack n play from day 1: when we put him in the crib he fusses and is up every half hour. He slept through the night perfectly when visiting my parents on their sealy crib mattress so we bought a cheap new mattress and he's sleeping perfectly. The starlight supreme is simply as hard as a rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I have been using these cups for almost 4 years now. Initially difficult to insert but I had less trouble than when I had to figure out tampons. They are so comfortable and reliable! rarely have I had any problems with them. I know they are supposed to be disposable but I have reused them a few times without problems and still worked great. I highly recommend it, but it takes an open mind and lots of tries before you realize how much better they are compared to tampons!! You can also have sex while using them, particularly at the end of the cycle. Absolutely recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful, awful product (for periods anyway)","review":"I usually use a mooncup which I am very happy with but having bought the softcups as a fertility aid I decided to give these a go for a period I was due while travelling as I stupidly thought it would be easier to use them than sterilise the mooncup.Almost as soon as I used them I knew it was a mistake. I was in a constant state of minor leakage. No matter what I did I was always leaking small amounts. I read the instructions to see what I was doing wrong and learned that small leaks are normal with this product! In what world are constant small leaks ok? Certainly not in the world of the owner of two scenthounds anyway.

How wrong I was? I'm a heavy flow for at least 3 days and this was so inconvient, I had to change these at least every 3 hours like a tampon and so for me these didn't work. The only good thing I liked was that I could use them on my last 2 days or so, so that was kinda good.. I in my opinion they're okay but I'm thinking of trying the divacup instead.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious Leaking Problems","review":"I was really looking forward to this product after reading all the rave reviews about how life transforming it is especially for those with heavy periods. Everyone was saying how it doesn't leak and you can leave it in for hours. Well I'm here to tell you that wasn't my experience. It started leaking after about 2-3 hours. And it is an absolute mess to remove. They are probably better than tampons but quite frankly that's not saying much. It is very easy to insert and fit in place, but it's definitely not as reliable as I would have hoped."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone!

Tampons are much easier and less messy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, but","review":"These work but I'm perplexed by the grossness of changing it. Ugh, what a mess. It was easy to insert, not too hard to take out but I keep wondering if it would leak when it was time to change (it did). There are a lot of positive reviews of this item and similar. I think tampons are easier though. This product may take some getting used to. It's definitely harder to deal with when traveling (which I was the first time I tried it).

Aside from being difficult to insert into the proper position, and messy to remove and dispose of, the stupid things leaked at completely random times. It might be okay for an hour, and then would shift and spill, terrible leakage. Sometimes it would be okay for 3-4 hours and then leak all over making a horrible mess. Truly not worth the cost, not worth any cost! I would not use this product again if I was paid to, honestly. I have since purchased a Diva Cup and couldn't be more thrilled. If you are looking for a menstrual cup that preforms, doesn't leak and lowers the risk of TSS you must check out Diva. But please leave Instead on the shelf!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this product at all. When ...","review":"I didn't like this product at all.

The fit was semi-correct and as far as comfort, I couldn't tell I was wearing it at all. Even though I wore the cup for only a short period of time there was some slight leaking.

Yes, this DVD was funny, yet not as good as live, nor as good as this \\"Live from Wembley\\" copy. However, I'm extremely disappointed that they changed the name. I had no idea this was exactly what I already owned, and now since I've opened the package I cannot return it. I will say the quality is better, and his delivery is too in this edition.

It is a waste of your money to buy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eichmann","review":"While the main actors in this movie did an excellent job, the movie overall was very disappointing.

I thought it would have been neat to watch a movie about Adolf Eichmann but the movie turned out to be a big disappointment. I wanted to know more about Eichmann and instead alot of the scenes were focused on the interrogator. The baroness sex scene with Eichmann bragging was completely pointless and unnecessary. The baroness really had no purpose in the movie but I guess movie makers these days have to add some sort of irrelevant sexuality to gain viewers.Overall the movie dragged on, lacked climax, had bad script, and most of all, lacked Eichmann. Save this movie for the rental. It's not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schlock - Glad I Bought a Used Copy","review":"This could have been a good movie. It is nice for me that I didn't pay a whole lot for this piece of junk. As a historical reference there are probably comic books that would do this tragic period in history better justice. The flashbacks to Eichmann's career as a over sexed killer along with his aristocratic Hungarian mistress is pure b.s. The incident where he shoots a infant in his office of all places just dosen't work. Eichmann was a \\"desk killer\\" who supposedly fainted the first time he saw the dirty end of the death business. The scenes of his interogation with Capt. Less wasn't too bad; the actor who played Eichmann pretty much nailed the appearance but it all ends there.The schlockmeisters who made this rubbish should have hired a historian to at least get some of the dates right.

These two men have the capability of being a big part of Democratic wins in not only 2006 but in 2008 as well. But they have to stop being authors, reporters and media dandees and start getting dirty again. Democrats need all hands on deck and I feel this book is fantastic in it's timing if it has been released as an advisory for 2006 and 2008 but these two will frustrate a lot of people if they don't get directly involved with the campaigns.Al Gore / Hillary Clinton in 2008!

The majority of the songs definitely are geared towards the more vocal and pop-like aspects of trance, often crossing the boundary so much I wouldn't even classify them as trance any more.Even so, if the songs were good I would have given this album a higher rating. I don't expect every trance CD to be Oakenfold, Sasha & Digweed, or Christopher Lawrence.

It captures misery very well. The jungle scenes are well done. It works very hard to be \\"artsy\\" but comes off a bit pretentious. The acting is decent for the fairly weak script. The horror comes from the atmosphere and the mood. Both serve to make this film \\"interesting\\" but not really \\"good.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring \\"Vinyan\\"I","review":"I rented this film primarily on the basis of its stars, the beautiful Emmanuel Beart (Manon of the Spring; Coeur de Hiver) and Rufus Sewell (The Illusionist; Dark City). At first the suspense of trying to find their child was intense but as the film progressed, I gradually lost interest in whether they would find their child since it started to become very tedious watching them slough the mud and losing their connections. I looked at the \\"Special Features\\" and though it may have been pleasurable for the actors, this viewer was left in the lurch. The only thing that caught my interest at times was the lovely Beart who had a brief nude scene with Sewell but outside you may as well \\"Appocalypse Now\\" instead of this tedious film."},{"rating":"1","title":"probably the worst movie I've ever seen.","review":"This movie was painful to watch. The only reason I kept watching was to see if the couple ever found their child. Well, that was a complete waste of time. The only memorable thing about this movie was the amount of tits shown & I will never get the image of about 20 young boys rubbing mud all over the lady & squeezing and groping her titties while she giggles and moans. Unless you are a pedophile, you will probably not like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies of all time...","review":"watched this movie out of curiosity and both my wife and i regret it.. we fast forwarded through a quarter of the movie and were hoping for some extraordinary turn-around that never took place... we've been to thailand and it definitely does not make the movie any better...on a side note, emmanuelle beart is a great actress but you just want to punch her face in during the movie. really, this movie is so bad, it is almost funny. it is so bad that people who get together to play the worst b-movies should showcase this as the main event. i would give it negative stars if i could."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Song Played In This For A Few Seconds","review":"I purchased this because one of my songs was in the movie for a few seconds.

It is a very dark story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bleak Yet Beautiful","review":"A desperate couple's search for their missing child takes them from the uglier streets of Thailand deep into the Burmese jungle.Slow-grinding, gorgeous but intensely grim psychological tale sporting some of the best performances in a 2009 horror film.Very unnerving for those who allow it to be, but it's leisurely pace will likley infuriate many viewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frightfully Boring.","review":"Like some of the other reviewers, I saw this movie expected it to be an undiscovered gem. The premise is very intersting and I'm a fan of Rufus Sewell. The only thing scary about this film was how boring it was. The director lingers way too long on scenes with no dialogue and random images. Possibly to make up for the total lack of story or characters to care about. I kept waiting for the film to pick-up and do something that made sense. One thing that would have made sense is for the lead male character to leave his crazy, pouty-mouthed wife in the jungle to talk to the trees. But alas, we're expected to believe that a pampered European couple could wander aimlessly through the jungles of Southwast Asia without running into anything worse than a pack of children with pointy sticks. Yes, the imagery was intriguing but I could have gotten that from a documentary film about Burma which would have been more interesting. However, a bowl of cereal would have been more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"It caught my eye too...DON'T DO IT!","review":"I rented this movie with hopes of an unknown treasure and all I got was a movie that made the viewer feel more pain watching then the main characters felt losing their money over and over again.The movie starts with promise, I didn't expect great acting but talent was there. After about the first half an hour I wished for some shed of light to peak out of the darkness and there was nothing. The movie is simply the hopeless search for a lost child that leads his parents on a pocket-emptying journey through Burma. The father whines about the money he's had to fork over to the natives and the mother goes crazy.

I felt it went on longer than it should have.It was well acted and filmed. The characters were convincing, but after an hour, it was just too depressing and harrowing.The score was horrendous. It seemed that appropriate music was written, but recorded in a distorted style, much like how music becomes when played too loud for the equipment it is played on. Lots of feedback and hiss.You knew by the first ten minutes that there will be not much good out of this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Flies gets a Twist","review":"This is definitely a disturbing film. And it has good reason to be.....I don't believe it portrays reality of the real world (the life after the Tsunami in Malaysia) but I do find it an interesting story. It keeps interested throughout and has a world of its own. Draws you away from the initial storyline and you get lost in the film. Very good storytelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not The Official Blink 182 Book !","review":"I recently bought this book and though it was alright.

On June 21 in Oakland, CA at The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show, I met Mark Hoppus from Blink 182 and showed him this book. \\"This book is so faulty.\\" is what Mark said about it. He looked at every page and then signed it. All I have to say is that it's not okay to try and make money by writing a book off a band you think you know with faulty info!

She has already been in preschool for a year and a half, but Kindergarten will bring new friends at a new school. This story of an Open House and introducing new friends to a two mom family is very realistic and ultimately reassuring. She enjoys hearing the story and I enjoy reading it to her. I think it's a valuable addition for any two mom family or for anyone wishing to share family diversity issues with their kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are two Moms always a problem?","review":"Why are two Moms always presented as a problem? I have an 11 year old son and a 6 year old daughter. In Kindergarten neither of them even had the concept that having two Moms was bad or that one or the other of us was or was not their real Mom. I sure don't want to introduce those ideas thru a childrens book. Sure, kids have asked how you can have two Moms or do you have a Dad? But they are not so mean about it as presented in this book. Even though it all turns out well in the end, I wouldn't want to read the first half of the book to my daughter. It's time for a book for kids where there are two Moms, but that fact is just incidental to the story -- not the problem to be dealt with."},{"rating":"1","title":"not ready for Sony Playstation in Germany","review":"I'm disappointed about this product, because i ordered it in US for germany.

While the plot was fairly preditable, it highlighted the road to redemption fopr a youth (DJ) who was heading no where fast. Certainly the writing could be a bit better, but where did the writers say that this movie was suppose to be thought provoking. Its simply an entertaining movie with a lot of dancing. Sometimes, we try to criticise for the sake of it but we often misconstrue the purpose of the movie, which I think in this case was to simply entertain. Was I entertained? Hell yeah!

When i saw the whole movie i wanted to play it over and over again i thought i could do the moves myself. I had my whole family trying to help me do the moves. It didn't work out.

They connect copper, PEX and CPVC without any difficulty. They are rated to be buried in walls, and can handle both potable water and heating system applications. Make sure the pipe is cut square, clean, and push the fitting on. That's it. There is a sleeve and teeth inside to hold the pipe and an internal O-ring seal. I've used these where there was stress at the joint, and haven't had a problem, they hold great. The price is steep when you compare it to a copper solder or PEX crimp fitting, but they're worth a lot in time savings. No more sweating fittings between joists and worrying about setting the house on fire. I also like that they work right the first time, and I don't have to worry about bad solder joints. It makes a reliable mechanically sealed joint in tight spaces in less than 30 seconds. There is also a competing product under the Gatorbite brand that is essentially identical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read for the FAITH Participant!","review":"Robbe has written an excellent title for the person involved in the FAITH witnessing program to use what is learned to reach others outside a church environment (neighborhood, work, community).The book centers around using the FAITH outline not as just a canned presentation, but a lifestyle that draws others to Jesus Christ.Read and enjoy!

But the headmaster is used to Beatrice Baynes' objections and takes no notice. But someone must take notice when her dead body is found in the art building.There are lots of suspects: the headmaster herself, the art teacher and her patron, the goddaughter and the nephew of the victim. Scotland Yard, in the form of Inspector Pollard and Sergeant Toye, must untangle all the motives and see who the real murderer is.I enjoyed this book. I like the English mysteries.

If you are an Administrative Assistant for anything other than the White House, a Hollywood star, or a top level executive at a Fortune 500 company, this book doesn't really relate to you. I've worked as an Admin Asst for a large public company, a small manufacturing firm and a high school. Almost none of the suggestions applied to me. It was easy reading but really only applied to very high level or personal assistants. Also, the author related how what she learned allowed her to move up the corporate ladder and even go into business for herself. For someone who is looking to work as an Admin Asst for their foreseeable career, this book doesn't give you anymore information than you already know. Not a bad book, but keep in mind who it's geared toward."},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK Book","review":"The writer has great style and all, but it's really written for newcomers to this profession.I was impressed by the title of the book. I like the presentation. But what's really lacking is the content when I dig into it. I had reasonably high expectation of the book, that it's for the 'take-your-career-to-the-next-level' readers (seasoned office professionals). However, it disappoints me in this department.The information provided, particularly in the \\"Appendix\\" is relevant to the US, but may not be the case for other parts of the world. The concepts and principles are useful. Having worked and still do, in large American corporations, I find it easy to relate to the book.Having said all that, it still makes a GREAT book for everyone who is NEW and ASPIRES to be the BEST admin you could possibly be - A KICKASS ASSISTANT.

I mean, I don't need a 4 inch 3 ring binder in my hand at all times so that I can look up contact names, phone numbers, etc. for my boss. (Think Blackberry, IPhone...)The story line she followed was pretty self-absorbed, too. The author seems to think that readers will be really impressed with her name dropping, anyone ever involved in the Clinton administration. Like that gave her more credibility than, say, Bill Gate's assistant.All in all...a secretary in the 1920's would have found this book more useful than an assistant in the 21st century will.

Each track is based on a Brazilian folk song, which Perelman uses as a basis for improvisation that is Ayler influenced but also melodic at times. The all-star cast goes a little further \\"out\\" than on their own commercial releases, and everything comes together quite nicely. Especially for the low used price this is currently being offered for on Amazon, I would recommend this to anyone interested in improvised music that is not easily classified.

I did as recommended, and left the lactic on for exactly one minute as it was my first time using it. I have also been moisturizing at night with Vaseline petroleum jelly because of the dryness I experienced. Well, in three days, I noticed peeling, with my old skin being removed when I used my toner after washing. The result? Smooth textured clear radiant skin!

While the text is almost identical, the bilingual version translates the in frame descriptions off to the side. Things like \\"chop chop\\", \\"ashamed\\", etc are only translated in the bilingual. Beyond that, the bilingual version is printed on higher quality materials and features the outer cover common to manga, which the english version does not. Also, all of the volumes are available in the bilingual form, so you dont have to wait until december to get 6, 7, and 8. So, my final summary is that the story is very amusing, but you should get it in the bilingual form, which can be found online for only [$$] more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazonian lunacy: an exhausting must-read","review":"Redmond O'Hanlon displays a tempered lunacy in his account of an extraordinary search for the infamously violent Yamamoni tribe. It all seems a little contrived at first. He deliberately searches London for a traveling companion, then selects the most inappropriate he can find - a nightclub owner. Simon, his foil among the insects, snakes and spiders of the Amazon, loses his marbles half way through the book. The strength of In Trouble Again, is that despite feeling total sympathy for the sane, you can not help but admire O'Hanlon's crazed doggedness. Everytime he has an excuse to turn back, he redoubles his efforts, dragging his guides onwards. To say that he survives is certainly not spoiling the ending, but it is an extraordinary read and enough to limit adverturous dreams to the Discovery Channel. It deserves a 10, but O'Hanlon is obsessed with birds. I, like Simon, have always thought a bird is just a bird. Which is why I'm staying at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Perhaps, it's just my misunderstanding of a particular British sensability (I have enjoyed travelogues by other British writers),but I couldn't avoid the feeling that this author wrote this one while sitting, comfortably in a arm chair, poring over 18th and 19th accounts of Amazon travelers and making it up as he went. I'm sure he made the trip, but his style seemed to be finding as many adjectives as posible to describe every twig in his path. Half-way through, I just settled for speed-reading, looking for something with some meat. In fairness, I will read others by same author and perhaps change my mind. Maybe, his heart just wasn't in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Who needs wit when you're sucking the eyes out of a monkey's skull? O'Hanlon has plenty of wit for this story.

The fear will escalate, as will the love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, informative, humorous.","review":"I enjoyed reading this book; it was well-written. I learned a lot too; the author gives detailed accounts of his adventures as well as the plant and animal life that he encounters. Humor is sprinkled throughout the book; there are some really funny parts. There are also some parts that will really gross you out. It's great! The only drawback is the ending. It ends rather abruptly. I still wonder if he ever made it back home or if only his notes made it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Little effort on your part!","review":"This cutter is amazing!

Still, the scratchy, muddy sound adds its own texture in an era of pristine digital reproduction...This album was apparently hastily compiled from a number of different sources, which accounts for the number of different singers (where did Suzi Jane Hokom come from? and go to?) and Swedish/non-Swedish material. Whatever, it's classic stuff, but Smells Like Records could have done a better job with the sound and annotation. If there's no other way of getting this album it's an essential buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arcane Treasure","review":"A classic album, slightly cheapened by the shoddy packaging and sound quality. The sound is very muddy and wobbly, as if mastered from very worn tapes. The booklet features several black and white snaps, some LARGE PRINT bios and recording details, and a weird preface by Lee.

Mine is full of scribbles.

Many recipes make substitutions instead of using the original ingredients; or the recipes are 'modified' from the original.The author also includes a number of NON-Indian recipes in this book [especially in the dessert section]. What on earth are they doing in here?? How does this relate to 'Indian Home Cooking'??You also get a lot less recipes than you bargain for since many recipes are just slight variations of each other. I would have preferred more and different dishes.Of the dishes I have tried, none of them have been very outstanding and are not worth repeating."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't stand it any more","review":"My wife is usually good at following recipes, of Chinese, French, Italian cuisine etc. None of the dishes she made from this cookbook taste like Indian food. There is something bland about each dish, and most of them taste like cloves. I have quietly suffered through this, chalking it up to the difference between home cooked vs restaurant food.But I realize I have had many home cooked Indian food. My friend's Mom's South Indian dishes were great. My ex-housemate's cooking were excellent whenever we invited people over. His friends usually brought great dishes of their own. One time, a friend of mine whipped up a simple Aloo Mutter in 30 minutes, and I could eat that with rice all day long.But the dishes from this book, I can only rate them as \\"blah.\\" I can't believe the day would come when I start dreading Indian food, but that's what happened to me with his dishes."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much help","review":"I remained patient on this book, trying many of the recipes only to no avail.

I get almost the same experience from these lucious pictures. If you cook with your eyes, you'll love this book.Despite the incredible complexity of Indian flavors, every-day cooking is very approachable. This gives a wide sampling of favorite dishes, both vegetarian and meat-based. In addition to main dishes of many sorts, this covers the soups, raitas, breads, pickles, deserts, and beverages that complete the experience.There are more encyclopedic Indian cookbooks around includingClassic Indian Cooking, as well as books that pay more attention to regional differences. This makes a great book for the beginner, though, with its clear directions, variations on each recipe, and emphasis on accessible ingredients. If you cook for fun and a little dinner-time adventure, you'll find a lot to enjoy in this book.-- wiredweird"},{"rating":"1","title":"Adjusted for Americans","review":"I don't like this book, because it is too adjusted to Western taste-buds. Why go thought all the work to learn about a new cuisine go to ethnic supermarkets just to produce dishes that somebody considers suitable for American. Why not go more for the real thing? Or at least a book that would present the real thing alongside the Americanised/simplified version.Furthermore, there is no attempt to teach anything about Indian cuisine as if such a term really existed. The country is pretty big. We get some decent and some super simplified recipes. Honestly, what is the point of just removing the 20 minute soaking of the basmati rice before cooking? We are just told that the author uses this simplification. Sure the book can be useful for people who do not know anything about Indian cooking. However, I would direct those people to the web instead. For those of us in search for something more genuine this book is not for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"I finally leard Indian cooking with this book","review":"I tried several times to teach myself to cook Indian cuisine but didn't succeed until I found this book.

Obviously I was looking for different ideas and techniques than what I'm accustoemd to. For non-Indians this could be a good introduction to Indian cooking. However it would be quite a disappointment for Indians. It is full of useless pictures of spices and unconvincing anecdotes and the recipes are close variations of eachother. The rice cooking technique makes the rice sticky unless you add butter(not mentioned), which I'm sure most pro chefs do, but is not a good idea for everyday home cooking. If you've been cooking for a while then you can tell right away by looking at the recipes that they are only meant to sound exotic but are neither authentic nor will they be edible unless you make serious modifications of your own...basically not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceiving photo","review":"The photo shows two dumbbells but they only send one.

The only plus side and reason I ordered them were because of the tape that allows you to stick them to the floor or each other. There is only tape on two sides not four. The pee soaks through the pads and the pads remain wet and don't dry like other brands. Also they are only good for one maybe two uses and I have a small dog 6lbs.

While I found it to be good for a few laughs, I felt guilty about it later. Molly Keane is a little too skillful at satirizing the tropes of the British-country-house novel, and I suspect her of being a misanthrope. All of Keane's characters are flawed people, to greater or lesser degrees, and I hadn't thought I had sympathy for any of them, but at the end, when the author brutally gave each person what he or she supposedly deserved, I felt a little sick.Joylessness isn't what I look for in a novel like this.

It has great Blues, R&B, Jazz, and Cajun songs. My favorite tracks are \\"Don't Let The Sun Catch you Crying\\" by the always soulful great, Ray Charles. Another fantastic singer featured on this Cd is the very talented Etta James. Her song, \\"Sunday Kind of Love,\\" is an absolute classic. There are some great instumentals and Jazz music by the late genius, Louis Armstrong. I also loved the Cajun tune, \\"C'est Pas La Peine Brailler,\\" by Geno Delafose.

Then I find ice in between the supposed waterproof layer and the inner liner, so they got even colder, even though I have been careful to close them to keep snow from blowing into them, but in doing so, (not roughly) a tear developed on one side along the seam on the shell right near the hand entrance, after the ice developed inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE VICIOUS RUMORS FROM THE U.S.!!","review":"This cd is not by the band Vicious Rumors that released the classic \\"Welcome To The Ball\\", \\"Digital Dictator\\" etc.....this is an English band from the eighties with the same name!!Don\`t make the mistake I did!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique history of London Music Clubs in the 1950s/1960s","review":"This is a marvellous book - a unique history of the London music club scene from the Skiffle and Folk eras of the 1950's, through the Blues, R&B, and Rock scenes in the 1960's.

The fact that they chose to put that in the trailer should clue you in to the fact that the movie is really about something else.This is a fine role for Daniel Craig.

Please stop making this film unless it is with a very new unique twist. This film tries to twist it up but it's absurd when it all comes out. I figured it out way before the film explained itself.

It's not horrible to sit through one time but I can't fathom how anyone thinks this is a good movie. We've all seen it before.

Wow, Even Better... then it Sucks....","review":"Craig and company deliver great performances. The acting is top-notch. It starts off interestingly enough - and there are other reviews that'll give the reader more detail, and then it gets REALLY interesting, as the director proves that he bites off more than he can chew, and one has the feeling that somebody needed to up his meds, stop his meds, or in some fashion not panic as he did. It takes thoughtfulness to pull off a Mulholland Drive or Momento. What happens here is a sudden concoction is poured into the viewer's lap to pull all the pieces together that is so sophomoric and un-intelligent, un-creative and flat out-last-minute-i-dont-know-how-to-end-this' so I'll wrap it up this way' piece of mediocrity, that you feel cheated in the shell-game.What is so shocking is that so many millions of dollars can be spent and still allow this mangled jumble to get out the door the way it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"This movie honestly bored me to tears.

The protagonist (Hank) seems to have expertise in every aspect of life, from weapons to explosives to even telephone systems. Twain continually puts forth an anti-religious message; an extremely closed minded message that seems to ruin the book by interjecting that belief at every possible oppertunity.

Published by Biblio and Tannen, New York, 1967.Only 7 black and white photos of very average African tribal objects, which wouldn't be so bad if the text wasn't such dated pretentuious nonsense.

As others pointed out, this fan needs to be within about 3 ft to work well. Unlike other fans, however, it is no problem to position it at close range. It has a very small footprint, looks good and, most importantly, is really quiet. On the low setting it is barely noticeable in a quiet office at 2 ft distance, yet moves enough air to make a hot office (mine usually runs in the low 80s) bearable.

There is also not enough emphasis on the \\"language that will make one successful\\" and I don't mean the overpaid athletes!

The drawers themselves are very, very flimsy plastic and deform easily. Their edges - the parts that are supposed to keep them in their tracks - are no stronger than the drawers; it's a recipe for disaster. If one drawer slips off the track, it shifts its weight to the next drawer, then the next.

Other highlights are You and Me My Love, Naturally, People in me., etc. I think maybe this album swings the most for me of all her albums and contrary to the reviewer I felt that Liebman did a superb job of backing her up. On a lot of her other albums I felt the back up musicians were great instrumentalists but they interfered with her vocals. But this is actually my favorite Liebman album as well.

Liebman's solo statements are brief and his hard, Coltranesque tone and his characteristic embellishments and grace notes aren't a good match for Abby Lincoln's vocal style. Liebman has never had very good luck with singers in general. Surprisingly, Liebman's style seems to be appropriate for 60s style R&B, as you can tell if you happen to be lucky enough to own a vinyl copy of \\"Light'n Up Please!\\" which features Pee Wee Ellis of James Brown's band, bassists Jeff Berlin and Tony Saunders, and Richie Beirach on piano, among many others.

Since then, they have released dozens of excellent studio albums. \\"In search of space\\" from this period was their finest moment, until the release of this greatly underrated and overlooked masterpiece...\\"Electric Teepee\\". If one looks in the racks at large record stores in the US, one is overwhelmed by absolute garbage live recordings from Hawkwind that have been re-hashed and re-packaged to infinity. In addition, there are dozens of banal compilations that suffer the same problems. Take my word and avoid them like the plague. Instead, buy \\"Electric Teepee\\" and \\"In search of space\\" to begin your Hawkwind collection, and you will have two gems in your collection. My favourite tracks from \\"Teepee\\" are 'LSD\\", \\"Blue shift\\" and \\"Space dust\\". Most of the 78 minutes is first-class. I never tire of it- Magnificent!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely durable and easy to maintain","review":"These belts have great color, durable leather, and are easy to wear in both casual and business dress circumstances.

She has taken court TV to its highest level. Having been a judge for twenty years myself, I can say without reservation that Judge Judy's instincts are without equal. She knows when someone is trying to give her a snow job, and she does not hesitate to let that person know that he or she is lying. The difference between Judge Judy and the rest of us is that she says outright what we are merely thinking. The only thing about Judge Judy that isn't good is that there are only two Judge Judy DVDs for sale.

Sure, but most Americans don't care about things being pure to their source material (look at Transformers and comic book movies... -____-).

Would definitely recommend this film! :o))"},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"This movie has all that you would expect from Statham lots of action from the first and all the way thru.

Frankenstein!","review":"I didn't expect much from this movie but I am sure glad I watched it. I was a fan of the campy Roger Corman origional and was glad to see that this movie did not disregard the origional. Jason Statham was excellent as he is in just about all his movies. The guy is the action star of NOW. Joan Allen was very good as the menacing and hot MILF warden. The cars, the guns, and the action were all top notch and this movie is one heck of a fun and action packed movie. Oh, and don't forget the hot babes too!If you like good nonstop action and good actors wrapped around it climb in start your engine and hang on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great guilty pleasure","review":"I hate just about every Paul W.S. Anderson film, but he actually pulled this one off. The action scenes are intense, helped by the use of practical effects, rather than CGI overkill. Just wait until you see the tanker truck getting flipped in slow motion. Almost as cool as the semi truck flip in The Dark Knight. Jason Statham is the action star of this decade. The man has muscles everywhere and does the most with his limited acting range. Ian McShane of HBO's Deadwood is given some good lines and is one of the more memorable characters in the movie. I hope he gets more big screen parts in the future. Joan Allen turns in performance I could have never pictured her doing before today, and it worked.Death race will likely give you a headache with it's shaky camera movements and some of the dialogue could have used some work, but I had a great time. If your of the male gender, the cars, guns, explosions and babes will keep you entertained.3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad!","review":"I am a fan of Jason Statham's work and this was pretty good.

Just cars, crashes, murders and action. Statham is great ... just his usual self. How can you beat it? Don't look for Gone With the Wind, and you'll be happy.A great non-chick flick. Don't misunderstand, I like 27 Dresses, but as a mindless wonderful action film, this one is just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will be surprised!","review":"I remember seeing the previews of this movie thinking \\"meh\\". I was wrong. I watched this movie and couldn't believe that it was the movie from the previews. It is no oscar winner for sure, but I doubt anyone reading this thought it would be. It is a very solid action movie. There are some surprisingly great actors in the movie. The cars are cool, the action is great, and the movie delivers.If you like action movies with a plot that is decent enough to accompany the action then you should add this to your cart or at least to you netflix queue.

The movie apparently is a remake of a book or movie called 'car wars 2000' though i was interested in the concept because of a game called 'car wars' by a dice game company.The movie has a very simplistic character development and you don't feel the characters so you don't really get into the film. A lot of the film is quickly moved on. Again no development.The Plot is written to move quick and like the characters pretty blah. so you can predict its every move.As for the action, it is alright though if you want to actually see the action it is a bit like 'daredevil' in that the camera bounces around so fast you can't really see what is going on or get an idea. I personally don't like that as much.The way it is shot, the taste of the grit look is nice and gives a nice appeal.i give it a C- really. not a memorable one, nor really just fun, but just is. A let down for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage Movie","review":"Didn't enjoy this movie.

Only a 12 year old boy with an upper limit IQ of 10 could find this offensive, moronic, childish nonsense \\"fun.\\"Death Race had a lot of guns, gun eye candy, gun flames and gun blow up scenes, but nothing else. The writing was dull and the prison aspect took away from the original story. Death Race fails as sci-fi (a future world or society is not explored).Overall this movie just gets boring after watching the same cars drive around in a small circle over and over again with no people dying.I was incredibly let down by this film. This is a phenomenally unintelligent movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO stars","review":"Just bouncing around the Amazon Blu Rays and happened to notice this trash at an average of FOUR STARS! Just like the Dark Knight has... except Death Race is a total joke. NO character depth in the LEAST, action that is pointless since the motivation is weak, and an ending I saw three frames back. This movie has all the appeal of an urban produced jail flick.Please, if you want a Blu Ray just for picture quality and do not intend on watching this non sense ok, but if you want a GOOD Jason Statham flick try Crank, but Death Race is ABYSMAL on every level except picture transfer, but have some pride!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Game Is Over.","review":"This is another horrible remake.

This movie is packed full of action and has a simple enough story that it is quickly established for the audience and quickly moves to action, action, action. The concept seems like a mix between The Running Man and the Twisted Metal video games. The main character is framed for murder and sent to jail where he gets thrown into a brutal game of survival and hopefully freedom (sounds like the Running Man, huh?) and the cars are racing around with an arsenal of weaponry and armor on a race course with it's own hidden dangers. The races are amazing to watch and the \\"weapons\\" and \\"armor\\" and \\"death\\" symbols cars must cross over to allow use of their cars' related function brings to mind the Twisted Metal video game. This movie was done very well and I would definitely have to recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guy Stuff","review":"Jason Statham framed for the benefit of a televised prison massacre on wheels; more punches, explosions and gunfire than Roger Corman could ever have imagined; the evil and sadistic female prison warden who learns the meaning of karma the hard way... what's not to like? If it's unbridled mayhem and no-holds-barred prison warfare you want, this fits the bill. Short on plot, long on action... and a foregone conclusion: Statham gets both girls - the hot one and the cold one. Satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death Race 2000","review":"Excellent movie a real guys movie lots of gunz and lots of chicks.Incredible action."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Staying power of Statham","review":"Jason Statham. Wow. Even a bad movie he makes a small 30 second cameo in is better for his overwhelming badassness...and this movie isnt too bad. He's what Vin Diesel should've been. I don't think you can really quantify the qualities he adds to a movie, just a sneering, Charles-Bronson-Clint-Eastwood granite-like presence that adds a lot of credibility to an action flick.And this flick could probably use some credibility. Dont try to approach Death Race too cereberally, it is named Death Race after all. You can drive the behemoth truck \\"Dreadnaught\\" through the plot holes and circumventing of reality this movie frequently puts out there.But damn its fun. Ian McShane says it best, \\"That's entertainment\\". It is, and a 90 minute movie with no lull in the action is something that is sadly missing from Hollywood these days. As popcorn flicks go, this is one of my favorite in a long, long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticky and skips","review":"I was very happy with the shipping and handling of this DVD, it was fast and packaged well.

It was not a five star movie but if you are like me and like scary movies and just want to be entertained it was really fun to be scared by \\"The Lights.\\" Good Job!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lights Out","review":"THE LIGHTS is categorically one of the worst films I have ever seen. The acting is far more horrific than the horror could ever be. The plot is flat, derivative, and stupid. The premise is tired and overused. The effects are poorly executed. I wanted my time back after watching this one. It was not scary, but silly. The attempts it made to be funny or have a sub-plot failed utterly. The Lights themselves are an aside and are never explained. I think I could say that this movie ranks in the absolute top ten worst films I have ever watched. Destined for the $4 box at local retail stores. I would have given it 0 stars if the option was possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie that involves introspection,reflection, & redemption","review":"I thought this movie was going to be a typical one. First, I was upset with the profound language, but as I watched the movie more, it had more meaning and depth to it. The movie could have ended with the main character changing his evil ways, but it shows the temptation that he meets once he returns to society, and how is inner strenght must keep him alive as he deals with daily disappointments. The last 10 minutes of the movie has no dialogue, but so much is felt by the viewer. Hats off to the director, and the composer of the background music which strongly underscores the main character's road to redemption. As a teacher of high school students, I recommend the showing of this music to your students. Just be forewarned, the language is strong and you might want to get clearance from higher-ups."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never recieved the FIRST TIME FELON DVD.","review":"It is now more than one month I have not recieved the First Time Felon DVD.

Djilas was a Yugoslav guerrilla who was chosen as a representative to the Soviet Union. In this series of meetings over a period of six years, his idealism is washed away and he becomes more pragmatic on the Communist system. Not only does he see Stalin for what he is, but he becomes cynical of the whole system.This is an interesting and quick read. One understands why Yugoslavia broke away from the Soviet orbit. It also shows Yugoslavia wanting to make Albania a part of its country. We now know what that would have caused. This shows an interesting perspective on the different perspectives each East European Communist government had.

I couldn't get the Cuisipro open and when I did win the battle with it, what residual batter was left in it added to the mess which was once my kitchen.

In this one Toxie needs money to buy his blind girlfriend her eyesight back and so accepts a job from the devil himself. After that it all goes a little bit strange with Toxie playing a video game for his life. There is hardly any violence in this turkey and the only funny moment in it comes from Toxie urinating on Satan's face. It's totally lame and was made by stapling all the cut elements from the previous two flms together. Unless you're a real maniac you'd prefer to watch Barney the dinosaur than this (oh hang on...maybe not). Total tosh. The only reason I didn't give this 1 star is because of the pretty cool gang fight at the beginning but that's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a Disappointment","review":"As much as I like Troma films, this movie was seriously disappointing. As a fan of the first two films in the Toxic Avenger series I was expecting a lot more from this third installment. Instead, this movie is a large step backwards from the previous two. The acting is horrible, the fight scenes are awful, and the plot is lacking.And it features one of the worst endings ever. The \\"videogame\\" showdown makes little to no sense. Regardless of whether or not you're a Troma fan I recommend steering clear of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phoebe Legere sings \\"Amazing Grace\\"- AWESOME!!!","review":"I loved this movie, mostly because I am in love with Phoebe Legere"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Trash!","review":"Hardly even worth the review but here goes: It isnt Funny, not enough violence,stupid plot.

I usually give 2 stars to a film that at least makes an effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel let down.","review":"I bought this movie having high expectations after seeing the first one(best movie ever created by man). I popped it in and was pissing my pants in excitement. Little did I know that what stood before me would be the biggest let down in my 16 year life. The one part that made me smile was in the beginning when Toxie ripped that bad guy's intestines out and wrapped them around his neck. I have very high hopes for Toxic Avenger 4 since they really need to make up for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty boring!","review":"The movie started out good. You see Toxic have a pretty good fight scene with some bad guys. Then, it goes off telling us about what happened to get to that point. Well, that was when it got bad. Toxic turned Corporate and turns his back to the people. After that it gets boring because there's really no story to get, he just goes around thinking about what he has done. Then, after he finally realized that he was wrong. He then trys to do right. The only thing is that there's no good fights scenes. All there is boring talking and cheap stunts to see. Then, Toxic just wins and the movie is over. This was pretty disappointing to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"These poems capture an emotion that is rarely shared ...","review":"The poems in this book are not easy reading ... Pavese writes about himself in narcissistic detail and yet he is clearly resigned to his suicide. The despair which tumbles out of the pages leaves a lasting impression and i know of few examples of work written in such hopelessness. The reader is left to try and answer the questions which cannot be answered. Pavese said in his diaries .. '..my activities are pointless and still more bleak. The joys of life not only do not satisfy they do not exist...' if you know what it is like to live this way you will find a fellow soul in Pavese."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Mortal Huh?","review":"Now, calling this TMC in the wake of the two previous albums (\\"It'll End In Tears\\" and \\"Filigree and Shadow\\") is a bit of a stretch. Missing here are the massively-important large-scale contributions of the likes of members of Cocteau Twins, Dead Can Dance, Cindytalk, Colourbox, et al from the 4AD stable, and accordingly, the cinematic sweep of atmospherics that characterized those albums never gels here. Much more of a 'song record' than even the first album, the choices of material here don't always seem as focussed as on the prior efforts. I recall being very excited when this came out...and very disappointed when I sat down to check it out. Not the place to start with TMC; get the first two releases and see what all the buzz _really_ is about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Very relaxing and enchanting music!

Of the 5 or so people in my group of friends who are TMC fans, the sentiment about Blood is unanimous: they were trying to do another Filigree & Shadow, and fell way short. I gave it a couple years' worth of sporadic listens before finally selling it to a used store. Can't say I've ever missed it. Especially when I can listen to Filigree & Shadow and hear what this excellent band was really all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But not the Best TMC Album.","review":"There was a great deal of change between Blood and Filligree and Shadow. Blood is much more focused than F&S, and it has many more female singers. In fact, There is only one male singer singing on one track (I am the Cosmos) May it be a cover of another artists song, or a TMC original, nevertheless it is done extremely well. It is extremely difficult to classify this music. One could almost call it Ambient.. or perhaps Dream Pop.. it seems to be a popurri of different styles put together in Ivo Watts Russell and John Fryer's melting pot. If you are just learning about This Mortal Coil and are interested, pick up Blood or It'll End in Tears. If you enjoy it, pick up Filligree and Shadow. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say \\"Resting on their laurels\\"?","review":"Very disappointing. Music's not half bad (a little generic at times), but lyrics are torture to listen to. It's not a crime to take yourself too seriously (it even occasionally leads to suicide, which can be beneficial to others if not to yourself), but these folks have got to lighten up. Which is really too bad because all the other stuff I've heard by them is fantastic. Stick to the early material and leave this one alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"sounds approaching coherence","review":"The stars maybe in your eyes, but not in mine. \\"Blood\\" is like trying to listen for a glimmer of recognition from the \\"B\\" songs on a favorite album. As a whole, it bears strong affinities with the single \\"No.9\\" track on the so-called Beatle's \\"White Album.\\" If you truly enjoyed that endeavor by John Lenon And Yoko Ono, I would guess you'd like buying \\"Blood\\" too. (If you have never heard \\"No.9\\" check that out first!)\\"Blood\\" is neither as satisfying as the famous surnamed phrase \\"This Mortal Coil\\" (Shakespeare?) would suggest, nor as celestial as so many five-star reviews could guarantee. Drats!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"I love ambient music, but this is too depressing and dark, and unless you're in a huge downer kinda of mood, this will not be of enjoyment to you. The song Nature's Way is simply awful and akin to funeral music. The picture of the cover sums it all up, horribly dark and depressing. I am a fan of spooky sounds and haunting ambient, but not a fan of lyrics that have everything to do with death...it's simply too morbid and depressing for repeated listenings.

He wrote with the assumption that his readers needed psychological counseling in the area of life. The book reads poorly and it's quite obvious Victor did not take the time to hire an editor as the typo's, mis-spellings, verbage used, and grammar errors were so blatant it was pitiful. In one chapter, it's so bad that several paragraphs (approx a page worth) was repeated, exactly word for word (and it doesn't happen once). I read it fully just for the dis-belief that someone would waste their money putting this to print in the condition it's in. Further, the exercises he demonstrates in the back of the book are nothing new but only a way for Victor to get some face time in front of the camera. In a nutshell, it's a book written by someone who claims to be a professional trying to pad his wallet.

The game requires the player to do a lot of \\"setup\\" of each hotel in the campaign before a simulation actually begins, and given the poor design control interface, this becomes extremely tiresome after about the second scenario.Bottom line: stay away from this one -- you will regret buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"B-O-R-I-N-G.That pretty much says it all about this game. I've been trying to think of at least some redeeming qualities to this game for those who enjoy its premise, but sadly there are none.Sure you can design rooms and kitchens, bars, game rooms and meeting rooms, but that's about all there is to it. There's none of the snappy humor you get in other SIM games; and the customers are whiny about every detail from not buying THE most expensive sink in the public restrooms, to not being on THE most expensive chairs in the restaurant.Even the \\"challenge\\" levels are quite dull. It's definately not the game I was expecting. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"interface too difficult","review":"I thought I would love this game, but I found the interface so awkward and the manipulation of things so awkward that I never stuck with it long enough to actually play it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick!!

No matter how appealing your hotel might look to you, only about 10 people (max.) will come. It's not worth it! And, it can be very frustraiting. For example, if you want to put a chouch in the corner it will put it somewhere else. It takes about 3-4 tries to get it where you want it! I hate games like that!

Seems to be a defect in that the unit has to sit just right on the base or it will not go on and off by itself. You have to juggle it to be sure it is seated just right to get it to come back on after the oil is heated up and then you have to be real careful that it stays seated just right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had only used my fryer a handful of times before I noticed a significant decrease in heat. It was nowhere near the temperature indicated on the dial and I would have to increase the heat frequently just to keep cooking at a lower than desired heat. By the end of the second or third batch I have the dial maxed and it's barely adequate to get the job done. The troubleshooting guide in the manual made no mention of this particular issue. I've gone back to frying in a pan and shopping around for another deep fryer.The only reason I'm not rating this a 1 is because of the convenient features; filtering system /oil container, dishwasher safe parts. Great additions however the entire unit seems rather flimsy, especially the removable handle. The bowl is also quite small. I could fit close to double the amount per batch in my old fryer.Overall I'm pretty disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!

More variations to exercises and more workouts, and detail as to when to up the ante and weight. With TfT, you can break up the upper/lower body workouts to spread out over the week but that's about it.

Not only is it based on a graphics chipset that is about to be discontinued (can only be found on very low end graphics cards today), but it uses system memory, which is slower than graphics cards with their own integrated memory.

Now 5 yrs old, in remission for both leukemias, and about to go off treatment altogether, she still must spend one day in hospital a month for chemotherapy and an IV-IG immune system boost. This video is the first thing she asks for when she gets to the hospital. In fact, her regular nurse usually has it waiting in the room when she checks in.Sesame Street's \\"Visit to the Hospital\\" does an excellent job acquainting young children with the routines of the hospital, and of dispelling their fears of standard procedures, doctors and nurses, and hospital stays, in general. It tells its story with humor, music and compasion. Invariably, I enjoy watching it too; at least the first time through each stay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Football Cleats.","review":"These shoes are nice and comfortable.

The universe is vast and finding the roots of humanity after 10,000 years (or however long its been) could be a problem. Plus the idea of Psychohistory, where worldwide events can be predicted based on events from the past, cool!! This book has aged well, nothing seems to naive or too far-fetched.

Written in an odd style, mixing history books with storytelling, this is probably my favorite book of the series. After struggling with the style of writing in Foundation, and anxiously reading though the Foundation and Empire, I finally found my pace in this book. By the end of the book, I was holed up in the bathroom with shaking hands, trying to escape from society long enough to FINISH THIS DARN BOOK!! The ending is spectacular, letting you toss and turn your way though the book just waiting to know what happens. Though not expected, the book finishes in perfect key with the rest of the story, and makes you ask yourself why you couldn't see what was right in front of you all the time. Overall, an exellent story!!-LJ"},{"rating":"2","title":"The return of the psychohistorians","review":"_Second Foundation_ is the third book in the original Foundation trilogy, and addresses the problem of what happens to the Seldon plan once the first foundation is aware that the second foundation exists. First the Mule goes searching for it, and then in the post-Mule era the people of Foundation search for a way to escape its influence.For me, this was the weakest of the three books, not the best note on which to end a trilogy. I think that the character of Arkady herself was an influencer in my opinion-- she seemed a pale shadow of Bayta Darrell (her illustrious grandmother from the second book) and I found her annoying rather than captivating.

Read what ever reviews you wish but remember it is fiction,...Science Fiction and at the time of writing it was Isaac Asimov's, one persons, vision/opinion/thoughts of the future of mankind.

The Foundation is back in operation now that the Mule is gone, but the 2nd Foundation still lurks in the background. A small group of people are hot on the trail of the Second Foundation to root it out and expose it.But where is the Second Foundation? That's the basic theme of the book. But a war could get in the way and end the freedom of the Foundation.Asimov does his usual workman-like job of story telling. The plot moves along -- most of the time -- with a few slow areas.I went for days without picking it up, so I kinda lost track of the many characters, which made restarting somewhat confusing. Part of the problem was that the characters weren't well-developed except for Arcadia, the brash young teenage girl.If you like vintage Asimov, you'll like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Price a Digital Copy at the Same Price as the Paperback?","review":"There is simply something very wrong about pricing a digital copy of a book that has been in print for decades at the same price as a paperback book.

I hate deep fryers and wanted one that is easy to clean and take care of. This is it. We both love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy it again","review":"Wanted this because of the way it lets you drain the oil so that the next time you use the fryer the oil is clean. That's the only good thing about it. I've had mine a few months now. The first time I used it and washed it , the writing came off the front so you can't tell where to turn the knob for the right temperature. The oil leaks out the bottom (even though I make sure it securely seated on the heating unit) and goes across the counter, can't pick it up to clean the oil up until it cools down. The handle on the basket won't stay locked and when you go to pick it up out of the fryer with the hot food in it, it comes unlocked. After burning my hand because of this, I decided to write this review. If I can find one I'll go back to using the Grandpappy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last a Year!!!!","review":"Worked great till it bit the dust. Flimsy untill you put grease in it. It was just the right size for my son's cheese sticks and okra I cooked for him. I liked the 'idea' of being able to throw it into the dishwasher but waited too long between fryings as I used it several times a week and grease would build up and lo and behold it wouldn't come off until I scrubbed it myself. The basket scrapped the teflon sides and the handle would come apart at the most inopertune times and that was dangerous. I didn't trust it as light as it was. I made the children get out of the kitchen area while I cooked as I was afraid they would bump it and it would spill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oily, messy, but good cooker when cleaned up","review":"Like everything about this fryer, except, it is a bear to keep clean and oil somehow gets underneath unit, on table and all.

The author does a good job of portraying a side of postmodernity that is inevitably linked to modernity, contrary to the wishes of many postmodern theorists who like to portray postmodernity as a strict reaction to modernity.I haven't read the whole book, but what I have seen details the destabilisation of identity via modernity, and the resultant commodification/consumption of identity hence forth -- a very unstable state of affairs to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book written on Revolutionary War artifacts.","review":"George C. Neumann and Frank J. Kravic have really done it this time. Hands down this is the best book written on artifacts of the American Revolution. From A to Z you can look up nearly anything that was used in the War For Independence. Great for amateurs and pros alike it is an indispensable reference tool especially with museums and private collections. Very popular with online auctions as this book is referred to often. Great photographs that are clear with a brief description of every item. Some of these artifacts are now on display at Valley Forge. For collectors and historians alike this work is unparalleled and for over 20 years has been the \\"bible\\" for collecting artifacts of the American Revolution. No other work has come close.

He's writing style demands a high level of awareness to wit and sarcasm. The references, as the woman had said, are stated in way that encourages you to study further. The leftist argument is a bit understated. This is radical beyond negative connotations and stereotypical political stigmas. A book worth reading especially given the economic climate and the underlying tone of superficiality found within America. Don't let his dense articulation overwhelm you. I put this book down once out of intellectual apathy for his dense vernacular but picked it up and can't put it down. It's easing that political vindication I have against our socio-economic system and this vicariousness is only creating higher anticipation to flip the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wowza","review":"I never even use balsamic vinegar in my daily food repetoire, but I tried a sample of this at Sur la Table and oh boy.

It can take hours of movie clips in various formats and sew them together in a nice coherent package using a whole slew of powerful editing options. Sound can be manipulated in just about any way you can think of, and videos can be brightened, stretched, put in different tones, slowed down, etc. The program also includes many different transitions and ways of applying effects more or less strongly during different parts of the same clip. The layout is very intuitive and easy to use. DVDs and (s)VCDs can be recorded easily and directly using the program's DVD editor and burning utility.The one drawback for me is that the program does not readily read AVI (MJPEG) files from my digicam, whereas Ulead's video editing software does.

It discusses sophisticated methods of valuing business enterprises, and critiques competing models with a matter-of-course approach. The reader is given the perspective and reference to related work. Pitfalls of prejudiced and lackadaisical estimation are shown with neat examples.On the technical side, experienced MatLab users find good ready-to-implement tools, code segments, and references in the book. The book encourages the use of simulation analysis, and brings it down from its pedestal to business-management level as part of a standard business-planning procedure. Given the traditional disregard for detailed GIS data (springing from the absence of software and expertise), this book also brings up the role of multifaceted geography in business performance and strategy. While not a textbook in GIS methods, it fills a gap in reference literature and shows how loaded the concepts are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of money","review":"I agree with the other reviewer who gave 1 star for this book. I have no idea where the other reviewers are coming from. This book is extremely superficial. If you are a graduate level student trying to learn how to model or solve business, economics, and finance problems using Matlab I cant' see how this book will be of any use to you. Even if you are just seeking a very basic introduction to these topics, this book is way too expensive given the content. You can learn more from wikipedia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"A superficial book that mentions everything from fuzzy logic to Ito's lemma and knows what a Main Street economic consultant would. (I am not seeking to disparage a profession, only to define an area of expertise). It fails completely as far as Matlab and Simulink are concerned: the code is sketchy, and model diagrams sufficiently incomplete and uncommented to be useless. The positive reviews by self-identified doctoral students invite sad thoughts."},{"rating":"2","title":"DJ history","review":"Live at the Social 3, I mixed 10 years ago stuff from the vinyl. Now I finally found the mixed CD's for an exceptional low price. And the mixes are awesome. Despite being old, the mixes are still fun to listen too.CD1, the Andrew Weatherall mix is the more party-compatible mix. Deep House at its best. It is amazing how different Andrew Weatherall's DJ style was back then compared to now. The outstanding tracks are Gentleman Thief's \\"Havana Twillight\\" and Weatherall's own Silicone Soul \\"All night long\\". All night long - that can be the motto of this mix, it is not to fast, not too slow, keeps on and on and on, very cool stuff.Then CD2 - Richard Fearless. This mix is more electro and techno. Chicks on Speed, DJ Hell, Kevin Saunderson and especially Ratio's Spacecats rocks (still) every crowd. CD1 is the summer mix, CD2 is bad ass dark and very druggy - nothing for everyday listening. Still, for a small smoky club as the Social it was probably very fitting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess it's good if you like house...","review":"This collection doesn't hold a candle to the first two in the series. While vol 1 and vol 2 were way-out breaks, acid, hip-hop and dancehall, this installment is nothing but house. House, house and more house. If you're like me and got sick of the stuff in 1994, don't bother. If you need 140 minutes of 4-4 beats, feel free.I must say that this is good house, but nothing more.

Neither of these movies has much (if any) of the trademark Chan humor.

I would have liked \\"Snake Fist\\" better of the two movies, except that Jackie never finished it so the Evil Lo Wei used a double (blind-folded or seen from behind). However, in the scenes that Jackie shot, the movie is kind of touching, and Jackie's character is so sweet that I just wanted to adopt him (but then, I have sons that are older than Jackie was when he made this movie).These movies fall somewhere between \\"Eagle Shadow Fist\\"(God-awful) and \\"Drunken Master I\\" (very watchable)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This price, only work as VCR /DVD player, no recording","review":"Purchased from Costco last year, it was ok but VHS to DVD was very bad quality even manufacture issed VHS tape.Few months back, DVD recorder simply won't record anymore with any empty DVD.

It's also probably the best Dracula movie ever made. So why release such a shoddy DVD of this horror masterpiece? If there's a film that deserves audio commentaries, behind the scenes footage, biographies or even a decent photo gallery, this is the one. Yet, the producers of this DVD thought so little of this film that a still photograph on the rear cover isn't even from this film. Affectionados will probably recognize the buxom victim represented as being from the later 'Dracula A.D. 1972'. If you can't even get something as obvious as that correct, then you shouldn't bother at all.

First, this film has always been considered a classic movie with fine production, acting and script components.So why is the outside of the front cover listing the film as Christopher Lee's \\"Fang-tastic\\", first ever, etc...??? I take umbrage with the use of this explotative term, that I would coin for an Abbott and Costello movie. And why would they use such a ... cover poster. Dracula does not even look like Christopher Lee. Fo course the last error is the obvious glitch on the back cover, which I don't need to mention again here..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best in the entire Hammer series!","review":"Definitely the best of all the Christopher Lee Dracula films. The sequels do not live up to this film, mainly because they do not contain all of the original characters such as Lucy, Jonathan Harker, and of course, Van Helsing. This film sticks with the original Bram Stoker novel with these characters. The only person missing is Renfield, plus nothing is ever mentioned about Dracula being able to turn into a bat, a werewolf, or mist. Yes, this was 1958 before visual effects were what they are now. But, in the Bela Lugosi film, at least mention is made of these things.Lee is smooth as the Count, and Peter Cushing is a delight at Professor Van Helsing. These two were great together in other films, and it is too bad Cushing did not continue into the sequels (with the exception of the present day setting films). He would have made those films better and much more entertaining to watch.A must have for any horror film fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLOODY GOOD SHOW","review":"Hammer Films was fortunate enough to have some really talented actors, script writers, directors and composers to work on their series of horrifying movies that started in 1957 with the \\"Curse of Frankenstein\\" to their second, \\"Horror of Dracula.\\" While taking many liberties with the original novel, this version stays closer than most and offers Christopher Lee in his first spin as Dracula. Although on screen very little, his presence is smoldering, fantastically evil and domineering. Peter Cushing, as always, plays the fanatical Van Helsing with heroic finesse and a bit of charm as well; Michael Gough in one of his early roles is a perfect foil as the upper crust Homewood; and Melissa Stribling as Mina is subtly seductive. The lighting and camera work are wonderful and James Bernard's score is one of horrodom's best.A truly important film in the horror genre, it still maintains the ability to frighten and entertain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Vampire Film EVER!!","review":"Like Mike Wheldon says in \\"The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film,\\" HORROR OF DRACULA (1958) is \\"the best vampire film ever.\\" Even after 40 years the picture is still an effective, exciting adaptation of the Stoker novel--in my opinion, the one movie that truly captures the spirit of the book. Christopher Lee is a worthy successor to Bela Lugosi in the title role, and the great Peter Cushing makes the role of vampire hunting Dr. Van Helsing his own--intelligent, intrepid, kindly, yet not above cooly staking the undead when the situation calls for it. The part of Van Helsing has since been played by more famous actors like Olivier and Anthony Hopkins, but even these fine performers can't hold a candle to Cushing. HoD is the first and best of England's Hammer Films' Dracula series and required viewing for all vampire movie buffs. And I agree with another reviewer in recommending BRIDES OF DRACULA (1960), the second greatest Hammer Horror of them all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whose idea was it ??","review":"If there was ever a Christopher Lee film that deserved full dvd treatment, this film is surely it.

Direction, acting, writing, photography, musical score; all the proper elements come together to make this production a timeless masterpiece, as magically effective today as it was during its original 1958 release. Peter Cushing offers a riveting performance as the crusading scientist Van Helsing, while Christopher Lee combines vestiges of humanity with a profoundly alien nature to create a terrifyingly believable monster. Not just for fans of the genre, this film will appeal to anyone enjoying great moviemaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super, Hammer films at its best.","review":"Lee has never been better!

The Magix support staff, of course, blamed Cannon and provided no help whatsoever, even though the Cannon AVI files work fine with competitor software produced by Roxio and ArcSoft. Considering the popularity of Cannon cameras, this incompatibility is a major liablity.2.)

It's very easy to read and keeps your attention. I was flying through it faster than most books that I read. It's always a good sign when you cannot put a book down! The book's lead character is a middle-aged man who is not in good shape, who is a liberal and who goes through dramatic change to become a vigilante because of what happened to his wife and daughter.

As soon as it starts Mastodon takes you and doesn't release you till then end, and by then you feel as though you've been slammed against a wall. The sure force and power of this band can't be summed up by words, you really have to experience the power and intensity of this band. This is a truly amazing work of art.

Check this one out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is..............","review":"........that it would seem unfair after regarding their other albums.Mastodon is an absolute tour de force in the world of metal and rock music.They have schematically themed every album to date. This record being that of \\"fire.\\"It is exactly that. It's an explosive, premature ejaculation of an album. Almost every song is fast, furious and demanding of an ear that has a taste for the insane. The few moments within that are slow and melodic seem forced in a primal manner to lure the listener into the onslaught of rage that follows. Mastodon is a band that have taken all of the positive elements of today's metal and refined them into a very different style of music. Their later albums are definitely more polished. Remission is devastatingly heavy beginning to a band that has shown their desire and love for the art of music. As a lover of everything music, this album should never go unheard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mastodon fire element","review":"I like this band cause it keeps up with its name, especially in this album. Though it's not my favourite, it comes to you like a giant crushing everything between its music and your ears. I prefer the following albums, where Mastodon shows that they learned how to \\"tame\\" their music and know when to unleash the beast and when to keep it calm. This album is somehow to me confusing, but I guess that's what Mastodon is.This album is a good start if you want to become a Mastodon fan. If you like this, you'll love the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Phenomenal Album","review":"Mastodon is definitely one of the most original and interesting bands to have come out during this decade. This CD is definitely no exception.On \\"Remission\\", Mastodon blends together many elements of music and basically define their own genre. You can call it sludge, progressive, doom, death metal, whatever. It's brilliant and stands out in each of these genres. Brann Dailor's drumming is fantastic. Guitar work is excellent.

What a shame that was, I could have saved people some money. This album sucks. The members of Mastadon are deaf, and real musicians everywhere call for them to be beaten to death with thier own instruments. Some of the goons who have reviewed this album say, \\"oh, the drum tracks are a little heavy . . .\\" or some generally whiny crap like that. The drums are not nearly as bad as the singing/screaming or the lame guitar work. Hell, the drums prevented me from slitting my own writsts during my initial listen. Go get yourself some Orange Goblin albums, or some Obituary (if you are into death metal), some old White Zombie or Black Sabbath Albums instead of this rotting lack of music titled \\"Remission.\\" Hell, a Chet Atkins album is more tolerable to a music fan than this crap-tastic outing by the world's most deaf band: Mastadon.The Real Music Lover"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE FINEST WORLDJAZZ INTERPLAY","review":"A NEW MUSICAL LANGUAGE A NEW KEY TO MUSICAL EXPRESSION ?YES AND SOMETHING MORE . virtuosity interplay and timing at its best .SUPERB RECORDING AMONG THE BEST WORLDJAZZ RELEASES EVER MADE .The gift of musical communication among dave holland /double bass mino cinelu /percussion and kevin eubanks /acoustic guitar is absolutely AWESOME ."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"I was disappointed in this fragrance.

That definitely alerted me that something wasn't quite right. The glasses themselves were surprisingly small and obviously of a much lower quality than genuine Riedel. Mine had imperfections on the base and looked more like ordinary glass than German crystal. Furthermore, the seal on the base doesn't even say Riedel, it's some other logo. At this price, this is clearly a rip-off. Stay away, either buy genuine Riedel from a reputable merchant or go with another brand like Spiegelau."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best wine glasses for the money!","review":"These are the best! They are incredibly well priced considering they have such thin, cut rims. They are a pleasure to drink out of. They are not ostentatiously tall or large like many other glasses on the market, so they are very easy to handle at the table, even after you've had a few glasses of wine. They have a nice, general shape which works well with a lot of different types of wine. I have both the white wine and red wine glasses and love them both. If you are not a wine snob but want well made glassware, these are for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"good wine glasses","review":"These were great wine glasses.

They're not! They're tiny little taster glasses that can't hold a proper 5 ounce pour without being too full to benefit from the fancy shape (too little head space for proper bouquet or slosh-free swirling).If you just want cute little wine glasses you can get them much cheaper and they'll work just as poorly. If you want proper wine glasses to do all that sniffing and swirling you need ones that are much bigger.Yeah, this is the same review I put for the red ones, I bought both at the same time without looking carefully at the dimensions because they looked normal (shape-wise yes, size-wise no)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money on the White Wine Glasses","review":"I got the package deal, 4 white and 4 red wine glasses. The white wine glasses have too small an opening to be of any use to a real wine drinker, since you can't get your nose \\"in\\" to smell the wine and that is the essence of wine tasting. The reds are okay, but I'll be using them for white wine (when I opened the box, I first thought the reds were the white wine glasses!). I have Reidel crystal wine glasses (which cost a small fortunate and were received as wedding gifts many years ago) and was looking for a cheaper alternative (due to breakage over the years), but I doubt I will ever use the white wine glasses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly","review":"Quite possibly the most overpriced crappy wine glasses anyone could find.

Kennedy's goal is not to give answers to skeptics but to give Christians ammunition to win an argument. He is more concerned about ridiculing non-Christians than trying to help them understand his point of view. Some of his claims are absurd, his logic is filled with gaping holes, and his tone is arrogant and condescending. Kennedy gleefully charges through the book building one flimsy argument on top of another. If you are already Christian, you may claim that this book helps to solidify your beliefs. If not, don't expect Kennedy to give you a single argument change your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, basic faith-builder","review":"I agree with the reader immediately below this review, in that Kennedy has a tendency towards being condescending.

My daughter has been telling me many of the things she has learned from this book, like how healthy eating can effect your hair and skin. I would recommend this book.

Not quite as shiny as they make it look in the pictures. Maybe not worth that much money either, but only time will tell with that. I like the belt just fine overall. At 50 bucks it would have been 5 stars.Edit: Over time this belt has developed a crack at the hole where the prong protrudes. This started to occur at about 16 months in. I have $20 belts that do not do this after 10 plus years, so I'm not too happy about this belt doing that. Have to downgrade.

A little different from some of the other BBC movies I've seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"South Riding review","review":"Although I liked the production and the characters, I feel the author made some implausible choices with the plot. First, most patients with ? schizophrenia don't jump off tall buildings while normal when young as Robert's wife did. Exactly what was wrong with Robert's wife was never developed, likely because of a lack of knowledge of psychiatric disease. Also I found it very odd that Robert's daughter chose to go with her grandfather at the end, leaving behind the house she had lived in all her life and all the people she had ever known--unbelievable considering her extreme anxiety and previous clinging behavior! And then the darkest part, the cliff breaks off and dumps Robert and his horse down to the sea! The exact reverse of the male protagonist in Jane Eyre, whose wife dies, freeing him to remarry. Overall a very unrealistic and unfulfilling story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or bother","review":"While the actors involved were first rate, there was nothing for them to do but wallow in one of the worst scripts I have ever seen produced by PBS.

The scenery was lovely, but does not make up for the horrendous story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused Plot - Uninteresting Characters","review":"South Riding was very disappointing! The plot is an undeveloped hodge-podge of clutter all crammed together. The male characters are stiff and boring and one wonders why the creators would choose those actors at all for male-lead roles. None of the characters make me care about them at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing , depressing and disjointed","review":"I wish I could write a more positive review but I really feel only 2 1/2 stars is the best I can do. The plot of South Riding would do Thomas Hardy proud except that he would have filled in the spaces. There were so many possibilities here that were not explored adequately or at all and were brought to a hurried and jumbled end, and of course the overall tenor was grim. I did like the actors--especially Anna Maxwell-Martin.. All the central characters were well acted-- David Morrissey and Penelope Wilton were both memorable but were constricted by the script. I would very much like to see more of Maxwell-Martin because she is new to me. The scenery was, as many have noted, stunning, and it certainly got across the dismal quality of life in that era. However, there were just too many dangling story lines and too many things happening without adequate leadin or explanation, and it really was sooo depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parents Beware!","review":"I am a huge fan of BBC mini series usually but I got this film out of the library last night and as I was watching it with my daughter all of a sudden without warning there is a sex scene, back alley type, with sound effects etc. I was so very grieved and disappointed that they threw this in there of course involving a man of the cloth to make matters worse. I am sorry if they are going to have such adult scenes at least they could warn you instead I had to turn it off afraid to continue for fear of more of the same...badly done from a director that I have come to admire.

Macapella (6:22)5. CJ FXTC Instrumental (6:14)6. LP Version (4:26)OK, I like the R&B; Mixes, but the FXTC Mixes are too repetitive.

But consider this:I've self-taught myself most of this book in the past year, while attending school full-time as a materials science major (a whole field known to shy away from mathematics).This book is unbelievably affordable and covers most of the main topics of modern algebra (good enough for those of us who just want to learn basics).The book is entirely self-contained, which helps a lot if you don't have the most extensive mathematics background.If your discipline isn't math but you're tired of \\"learning,\\" ie. skirting around mathematical topics, in your classes, check out this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attractive & rigorous but probably best as a supplement.","review":"Hard reading at times but worth the money. Get Durbin's \\"Modern Algebra\\" if you can afford it. Despite what some other reviewers are saying the exercises alone validate buying the book.

However, there are two major problems.1) The book goes for breadth and sacrifices depth. 2) Most of the exercises are inappropriate.For example, one little section studies cyclic groups briefly, but the meat of it is presented in the exercises, such as the exercises requiring you to prove Sylow's theorems. How can a reader who's barely grasped the material from a few scant pages tackle such a complicated assignment.this makes the book quite useless for self study, but it's kind of nice as a reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book for self study.","review":"I bought this book for self study. I would not recommend it for that purpose. My main problem was that there aren't any solutions to any of the problems. I am (and I think most people are) someone who learns math by doing math. I also need to know if I am making widely outrageous mistakes. I don't require every problem to have a solution, but I can't learn when I have no idea if I'm doing it right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally worth it!","review":"This is the first set of Blu-Ray DVDs I've purchased, and I must say that the quality if superb. You really feel like you are watching the actors in your living room. With that being said, it's well worth the extra money to purchase Blu-Ray DVDs if you have the player.This is a great first season of True Blood (I liked it better than the 2nd season, just because it focuses more on character development and personal issues, versus season 2 which focuses on a CRAZY story!) The only part that was missing from the DVD set is the lack of special features. Other than commentary (mostly done by Lafayette) and a few extra ad-type visuals, there are no behind the scenes, no bloopers or anything like that. Hopefully the 2nd season will contain these benefits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"This DVD came in the time frame the seller said it would and I had two different DVDs, they both arrived in the same package, I was a bit surprised, because I thought it was going to take longer.

Season 1 of the show follows book 1 pretty well, with just enough changes so you don't get bored if you've read the book. I'm guessing season 2 will stray a bit further because it introduces some new characters that don't exist in the novels.

Now people say that I will compare it to the books and that's not true. I just don't think it's any good. My first complaint is that Sookie and the vampires (Bill and Eric) aren't good looking enough. Sorry if you don't agree. That's also true of the Twilight movies, too. Secondly, the writing is so bad! OMG! There is not one likeable character on the show! And what is up with Tara? Why is she such a jerk? If you love vampires, do yourself a favor and read the books and forget about this show.

Both Bill and Sam prove how much they care about Sookie, Jason and Tara are headed down new paths (but not necessarily together), and Sam seems to have even more in his past than the previous two episodes let on.

Sam's secret does not sit well with Sookie and she wonders about Tara's reaction (since Sam and Tara have off again on again relationship). Tara has a revelation of her own that makes her mother's turnaround more puzzling as well as having to deal with the likely wasting of the money she spent in the last episode.

The DVD's are enough like the books that I could still relate to the characters, but there were new characters and new situations making the DVD's fresh.

It's really too much, and honestly it made me uncomfortable to watch it. The sexual aspect aside, it was very difficult for me to even get into the plot of the show.

I don't particularly like the South.I don't know if this show was trying to become the Dixie version of Twilight and I'll never find out either. The first ten minutes or so were interesting. The concept was pretty novel and it seemed to be moving along nicely... then they got to the bar. Besides the crude language and topics of discussion, then the overly gratuitous nudity and sex, there was the female psychic that can hear EVERYONE'S thoughts and she has a savior complex.Oh I tried. I fought very hard to continue watching. I figured: I paid for it, I'm gonna watch it. Then the vampire shows up at her house. At that point I could no longer hold my intellect in check nor my desire for a meaningful plot. I made it to the 34 minute mark and I had to quit.

Hopefully season 2 will be better and she can leave her goofy friends behind when she heads to Dallas."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Books are Better, but Eric is HOT.","review":"I got HBO to watch 'True Blood' because I liked the books so much. I canceled my HBO subscription at the end of the season. I only kept it as long as I did because I could not get enough of Alexander Skarsgard, who plays Eric. ( He was also fantastic in 'Generation Kill'. ) He and Pam are what got the 2 stars.The personalities of most of the characters are changed from the books, and mostly not for the better. Sookie, the main character of the books, has been warped into a bi-polar nightmare by the writers and mostly over-acted by Paquin. Important parts of the vampire mythology from the books have been left out and instead we get the \\"V\\" story line and the illogical \\"tribunal\\". Some great moments from the books are in the show but without the \\"glue\\" that tied them together the story often seems schizophrenic."},{"rating":"1","title":"entertaining in a way, yet a big disappointment to those who've read the books","review":"It is an entertaining tv series,( that's why I gave it a 2 instead of 1) yet, if you have read the books and expect it to be as good as the books, you'll be disappointed.1) it is nothing like the book, the books are so much better, i)jason is not an idiotic man ho like it's portrayed in the tv series. ii)the subplot of tara and her mom is not in the book. iii) in the book, vampire blood is not treated as a drug in the book, it doesn't give you stupid, over-the-top erection for one thing.2) Anna paquin is extremely annoying, she over-acts everything, and whats wrong with her accent? I have no idea why she won the Golden Gobe. I love her performance in 'the piano'. but in true blood, it's simple hard to watch.3) I love sexy and steamy sex scenes so don't get me wrong.

People, when something is on HBO, you should know that it will be graphic. You have to subscribe to the channel for a reason. Second, we're all adults here. Why is everyone so ashamed of sex? It's the most natural act in the world, and it's the reason you and I are here right now. Third, IT'S A VAMPIRE SERIES PEOPLE! Vampires kill people. Killing people is violent.

The differences from the book and the DVD just kept increasing to the point that I no longer wanted to watch.

Even though the show is not exactly as the books they still have made some characters that were not as prominent in the books come to life (Such as Tara and Lafeyette).Often they make series from books and its just not the same, but this is so wonderfully made I do hope the series sticks through it with all the books I love it! I dont watch much TV but this one is great!The acting is great so is the chemistry between the actors. And they book great people that were quite close to what I pictured in the books (***** for The actor that plays Eric btw heh)Lots of sex and violence so NOT for kids but great for us adults :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Characters you will never forget","review":"All of the HBO series are worth the subscription or the DVD set. Being a fan of the creative process, I am blown away by the excellent work of the entire cast and crew who put this show together. As with all of HBO's series, this production company never misses one detail to create the eerie effect they were going for. All of the actors in the lead roles are phenomenol and bring these characters to life until you feel like you know them. Great theatre. The show is a little too violent for me but the acting is intense and riveting and the cinematography is amazing as always."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not able to view","review":"I purchased this through our Amazon Account on our Blue-Ray player and was not able to view it.I can get sound, but recieved No Signal for the picture - not a good purchase on my behalf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad, HBO","review":"The first season of TrueBlood is pretty sexually charged, so don't let your kids stay up and watch!

Great great job way to go guys!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"entertain me!","review":"Loved the show, but there are some sex scenes that are kindof 'thrust' in there almost at random and with out real purpose to the plot. Dont get me wrong, those scenes can be alot of fun to watch.. but this was a bit over the top.Many people expect the book to line up exactly with the show. Dont set yourself up for dissapointment. The show is really good, with an exciting story line, even if it doesnt follow the books word for word. Its a bonus, because if you haven't read the books, you can still do so, and be surprised about what is going to happen next."},{"rating":"2","title":"A-m-a-zing","review":"I love this show.

I did picture Bill a little differently while reading the books, but Stephen Moyer does an excellent job with the role. My favorite character in the books as well as the TV show is Eric. Alexander Skarsgard is perfect as the sheriff of area 5. Yum! Anna Paquin is great as the feisty Sookie Stackhouse.The DVD features are ok.

I was happy to be able to start purchasing the series for my home collection and even more happy to start from the beginning to enjoy the relationship between Sookie and Bill unfold. I give the series 5 stars but would give the quality of the box itself a four. The corners of the box appear worn and torn.

The show is original, sexy, with the perfect touch of horror. If you're a fan of the \\"Vampire Diaries\\" or the \\"Twilight\\" Saga, this is not for you. Exit the \\"romantic\\" vision of vampires as twisted poets looking for true love.

I cannot believe how awful the HBO series based on the books is. I was so excited about the TV series based on the books but, I am sad to say I was so disappointed. They took a great book series and turned it into a smutty, foul-mouthed TV show. They have characters in the show that I do not even recall being in the books. I usually never write reviews for things but, I felt I just had to leave one on this series. The books are so good and I cannot believe that Charlaine Harris would want her books portrayed in this manner. I guess she is not bothered by it. I wish that I could get my money back on the DVD's. I will continue to read her books because she is such a good author but, I will just use my imagination and not watch the series.

I watched the first 4 episodes of True Blood, and that's four hours of my life I'll never get back. It's truly awful, the worst thing I've endured in years.My wife still watches, mostly because it's softcore porn and she's decided it's too awful to quit watching. She mostly laughs hysterically at it.Other than laughing at how terrible it is and looking at titties, there is no reason to watch this show. Absolutely horrible acting, and every single character is a terrible person.1/5 Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I love the Sookie Stackhouse books. Perhaps that is why I was so disappointed in the television series. Not having HBO, I had to wait for the DVD to come out to watch the video. To sum up - Bill is the only half-way decent thing about this series. It is a pornographic view of everything that is wrong about living in the South. I haven't been this disappointed in an adaptation of a book since Peter Jackson's high-handed re-writing of J.R.R. Tolkein's Lord of the Rings. If you want to watch a lot of sleazy sex, this series is for you. If you want to watch a story about a young woman with a special talent making the best of her life, and of the people in that life, you will be extremely disappointed. I will remain a fan of the book series, but I sure as heck won't waste my money on Season Two."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Blood: The Complete First Season","review":"When I first saw True Blood being advertised on the internet I was exited to see another Vampire TV show coming on.

That's when I understood why it was on HBO, that and the language.The sex slows down quit a bit after the second episode and is not so graphic BUT there is nudity, and language.Besides all of that, True Blood is a great TV series and I can't wait for the second seaon to come out on DVD even though I know it will be a while.I also just bought all of the Sookie Stackhouse Books to see how the series and books compaire with each other. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"First, if you love the book series - you will be dissappointed. However, as a series I thought this was good, because I like the genre, but it took me a bit to get past how it fails the books it is based on.I had no problem with the series developing minor characters - they're interesting, one of Ms. Harris' talents. However, the series couldnt seem to stop themselves from layering certain characters to an almost ridiculous level. LaFayette is flamboyant and naughty, perfect as a regular in the series. However, producers kept the flamboyant, gay cook, but also made him a drug dealer and part-time prostitute. Same thing with ego-centric Jason Stackhouse. However, this character is personally disgusting. Instead of seeing how he can be repulsive in his attitude - he lives in squalor and general behavior leaves little to sympathize with.I think they could have done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Stupid","review":"This is the most idiotic and ridiculous show that has been on in a long time.

The series is great, good storyline thus far. I like the southern creole vampire feel, kinda Ann Rice, but less gothic and more contemporary. Wish HBO would have longer seasons than 12 episodes and kinda silly that there is only 2 episodes per disc on the blue ray. Never was a fan of HBOs DVD formatting anyway.

And for anyone that reviews the show with one-star because it's nothing like the Sookie Stackhouse books, well, get over it.

Threwout the season we find out about Sookie's family history, her meeting her first vampire Bill. We also get background infomation on the other characters as the people start getting killed off and they try to figure out who the killer is. We also find out as a vampire gets older the more powerful of a vampire they become with their powers. As the season gets closer to the end we find out more about Sookie's power to see things before they happen, and what sam the owner of the bar is. But for the ending you have to buy the first season I will not spoil the series for anyone.

Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire stories are imaginative, edgy and humorous. Her lead characters are appealing and vivid. I had hoped the dramatization would be truer to the tone and feel of the books.

The death scences of a Vampires are gross when they turn into a mess of blood. The characters are hard to believe and act like idots most of the time. The love Sookie Stackhouse is supposed to feel for Bill the Vampire is lacking,you don't feel the magic between them. Their facial expressions don't even show a deeping love. The secondary characters are a drag on the show i.e., sheriff etc, very poor activng or directing, whichever. Emotion is entirely missing in the acting for the entire cast. It is definitely not one that I would considering purchasing or rewatching beyond the HBO initial series. Give it One * Star. After seeing Moonlight, True Blood is a belly flop, At least HBO didn't dump the audience that enjoys this show like CBS did Moonlight or Lifetime did Blood Ties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!

There's no way that the Tara of this show would be Sookie's best friend as the Sookie in the books does not like swearing. Nobody would want to be Tara's friend with the attitude she had in the show. The character of Sookie was okay until she proclaims that she loves Bill and then proceeds to kiss Sam. There was way too much emphasis on sex and everybody was doing everybody else. I ended up hating the majority of the characters. To say it's based loosely on the books is an understatement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"I checked this out to see what all the hype was about. Horror movies and even vampire stories have always been my favorites. Campy TV shows like Buffy are right up my ally. This show, however, reached a level of absurdity that I cannot tolerate. I begrudgingly made it half way through the third episode before I had to turn it off. My initial reaction to the first episode stuck through out. I didn't really care for any of the characters, the dialog was awful and the whole \\"forbidden romance between a girl and a vampire\\" idea has been played out, beaten up and burned down to the ground already. To be open minded, I did try to stick this out. I made it to the third episode hoping that the negative vibe I got would grow a bit. That didn't happen for me, however.Over all, this show feels like it's made for teenagers with a vampire fetish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Sookie Stackhouse Series...Alan has made his own world","review":"So I am disappointed....why may you ask? Well I love Harris's characters in her Sookie Stackhouse series and this just isn't it. Alan Ball and his screen writers have changed all the character events and their respective images. Most and almost all of the event in the TV series don't even happen in the books. I sat there and while watching this tv series saying things like \\"that's not what happened...Tara isn't like that in the book..Sam and Tara nope never happened...who the hell is that..?\\" It's like they stole the basic plot line (very basic) and the characters names and decided to throw out Harris's story. NOT HAPPY! The story was soo good the way it was. As a fan of the books...the TV series has not matched up at all to the books and the books are WAY BETTER than the series... On another note Paquin doesn't get Sookie right, but that might not be all her fault since the writers have flipped the story upside down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anna Paquin Ruins An Already Horrible Adaptation","review":"I could forgive the HBO series story-line for deviating from the book series, but Anna Paquin's horrible acting ruins the series entirely. She couldn't act when she was in X-Men and she apparently hasn't taken any lessons between then and now. With a new lead actress, the series would be at least less horrible than it is... except for the fact that the HBO series is nothing but soft-core porn aimed to disrespect and sexualize women - something that Charlaine Harris most certainly would not do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"These shows are complete TRASH! I have enjoyed reading all the Sookie Stackhouse novels, so I got the entire first season thinking I would really enjoy it. I was disgusted with what I was given. Sorry, people...from start to, I'm guessing, finish these are completely revolting. I didn't make it past episode 4...I was too sick to my stomach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much like Porn","review":"I read the books before I ordered the first season.(The only one I ordered) The books are much tamer which I found unusual because in my experence books are much more graphic, but not in this case. If you like porn with a good story you should love this series.I only watched part of the disks."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've been Biten!","review":"OMG!!!I LOVE this show!!! Blood,Sex,Humor, an actual vampire story line!!! I'm not a freak and dress in black but I'm a mild vamp fan. my favorite movie is the lost boys and like Anne Rice. This show is my new favorite and I'm counting down the days until this comes out on video so I can re watch them. If your NOT into vamps its ok because this show is still entertaining to anyone guaranteed! just found out that there are books and I'm all over it. Oh and did I mention I LOVE the show?"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I wanna do bad things with you\\"","review":"Since The Sopranos, Deadwood, Rome and Carnivale have left HBO, I was waiting for the next big thing from this once dominate original series network. To fill the void, I have been watching and remain hooked to Showtime's Dexter.Being a horror fan, I knew that this show would be right up my alley. I will admit that it took me longer than expected to get into the characters and the whole vampires being \\"out of the coffin\\" aspect. Since this is a show about vampires it thankfully doesn't shy away from the gore and nudity either. You will get more than your fill in almost every episode. Forget the watered down Twilight crap, this is how vampires are suppose to be.True Blood is a show that will grow on you and I am now really looking forward to the second season. By the way, sorry Dexter, True Blood has the best opening credits ever and a song that fits it like a savage bite to the neck."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay, but...","review":"It's okay but, it's not very good. It's just okay, I watched the whole season in one sitting cause I felt that I needed to finish it. Paid almost $40 for the set.If you like okay B movies than you'll like this series. I can't say that I didn't like it, but it's something I wished that I had rented first before buying.Quite a few of the characters are very easy to guess, you'll see when you watch it. I figured the whole plot and characters within the first two episodes. Which just made the other ten a bit forced to watch, cause once again, cause I bought the whole season.Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to Charlaine Harris' Series","review":"I expected to like this series since I really like the books. To say that the TV series is \\"loosely based\\" on the books is an understatement. The only things they have in common are the names of the characters and the fact that Sookie can read minds and that Bill is a vampire. Really a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very graphic","review":"I loved the books. I was stunned at how the HBO show is so sexually graphic. I went back and checked the books and there is some sex but that isn't the focus of the story. There is so much more sex in the show. It is unnecessary for the story. I wish the story line was followed more closely."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it--but","review":"This was a very well plotted series with many plotlines and sub stories, and personally, I thought it was one of the best series I've seen in a very long time. I would give it five stars except I can't. The sex scenes were over the top. Now don't get me wrong. I love intimate love scenes, but not hard core sex, and that is what this series had. Give me Titanic or Cold Mountain any day, but gross sex that demeans women, no thank you. If the plotlines were not so good, this would have been a one star review. I'm still undecided if I will buy the second season. I want to know who's body was in the detective's car, but I'm not sure I can stomach any more gross sex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show for Adult Fans of The Twilight Saga!","review":"This is a great show for the adult fans of Twilight! The action, adventure, and fun is a great way to sit back and relax! The books are great too!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I could not wait to receive this and I subscribed to HBO just so I could watch the second season. I read all the books first and then found out it was made into an orignial HBO series. I have watched the first season on DVD at least 3 times since receiving the DVD's. I am so ready for the 2nd season to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rednecks + Vampires?","review":"I was skeptical about this series after watching the first episode, but I gave it another shot and found myself enjoying it more and more. It's a type of show that doesn't take itself too seriously, despite some of the more serious plot elements, like murder. Anna Paquin is fantastic, along with several other members of the cast.Sure, the show's a little cheesy at times, but I think the writers are aware of that and it seems to add to the charm. Yes, there is a lot of gratuitous sex, but at least it's interesting sex and should probably be expected from an HBO program.Overall, I think this show is just dirty fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleaze Central, poor Sookie","review":"I gave this two stars for the intro song and credits. Great little mini-movie. I really like the books, but this HBO version just changes everything to sleazy, gross, nasty. No likable characters, way too much sex, too little internal consistency in the characters, not much genuine humor. Sookie is almost repugnant, a complete ditz. In the books, she's a very interesting heroine. And why so much time for a character not even in the books, Tara? She's OK, but far too one-dimensional (ie: angry) to carry half the show. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)","review":"I like the show, it just doesn't follow the books the way I thought it would. A lot of changes with Characters, but overall, I'm glad I bought it! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the books...","review":"No, the show does not follow the books that inspired it line for line. And yes, there is a lot of nudity---but it is on HBO and at night for goodness sakes! So far, 4 episodes in, I can say that the casting and music really do justice to Charlaine Harris's series of books about Sookie Stackhouse, a barmaid in small town LA, but Alan Ball has made the story his own as well. Check it out on demand or get the DVD when it comes out....Moyer is sexy as hell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlaine Harris WHY???","review":"I am a huge fan of all the sookie books. I have been waiting patiently for this series ... Can you imagine my shock with the content in the series. HBO does not always make things better. In fact the way they have done this is very upsetting to me. I'm not a prude but the content is pure raunchy sex. Some of the characters are off from the books and are doing things that if Charlaine wanted them to do, they would have done in the book. This series ranks right along with the american pie movies , she should have picked a better director because if they don't lay off the raunchy sex scenes, I won't be back for season two. Please don't assume because you love the books you will like the series. They are so bad the teenagers should not be in the room while they are playing . Sorry but this was dissappointing to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonnie","review":"Love this series....I'm hooked and am glad I own the first season. Very good series definitely worth buying let alone watching, which I have more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series on HBO","review":"I love true blood and I am so happy to own a copy of the first season on DVD. The seller was amazing and this set is wonderful.True blood is a spin off of a series of book writen by Charlaine Harris. It is about vampires coming out of the coffin and letting the world know they are here. The show is filled with wit, humor and adult content. Even though this HBO series is not realy following the stories of Charlaine Harris, it is still fun to viewEnjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"oh dear....","review":"After finally getting around to reading the books I finally decided to see the television show and oh dear...it was not what I expected. I get that sometimes the books varry from the television shows; however, I found the show very annoying and boring. I found Sookie's character to be annoying and I am attributing that to the accent and her whiney big girl attitude. Bill's character seemed overly stiff. Jason was just having sex with just about anything with a pulse and doing it at various speeds might I add. The only character I liked and the only reason I don't completely hate it is due to Eric's character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Expected","review":"I watched the pilot for this show and hated it; I did not like the main character and some of the campy-ness was lost on me. Later, I watched the season from start to finish with a friend; after seeing it in succession, I enjoyed it thoroughly. While the show is classified as drama, I figure it to be more of a dramedy; there were quite a few moments I could not help but laugh aloud at. The plot and storyline was even pace and believable, eventually I found characters that I liked. This show also gets better with repeated viewings, watching it the first time all I cared about was how some of the plots would be resolved. I purchased the season and after another watching found subtle plots and actions that help make the story more complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!","review":"Wow! This series is very addicting.

This HBO series is a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Blood: Fun Television","review":"I was skeptical of True Blood, to be honest. I am not a vampire fan, and the genre has become a bit stale to me. True Blood pretty much took that opinion and threw it out the window.

It could have been so much more, but being rooted in the bad source material is it's greatest foil, I'd have to say. Some of the acting, including the star, is below what I'd expect from a show with a budget this large. As a regular HBO subscriber I was looking forward to this show; only to be bored by episode three at the inane plot and meaningless direction of many of the characters and the MTV/slasher/rockstar depiction of some of the 'bad' vampires. A far better choice would have been to use the extremely superior Ann Rice series or Fevre Dream for a vampire setting; True Blood truly stinks.HBO, oh how the mighty have fallen. The Wire: gone. Deadwood: Gone. The Sopranos: Fuhgetaboutit.

I have always had a soft spot for vampire shows and movies. This puts the most realistic spin on vampires I have seen yet. Somehow it feels like it could almost be real. Nothing is over the top, everything is in perfect proportions. The swamp setting just lends itself so well to the dark nature of the show. Also, a perfect cast makes this show so watchable. Anna Paquin looks as sexy as I have ever seen her. Everyone is perfect in their roles. This is one of the best shows in television. It is right up there with Dexter. Showtime and HBO are really bring TV back with those 2 shows. There is so much more that can be said about True Blood but it just can't do teh show justice. Watch it and be amazed is all I can say."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to do bad things to Sam","review":"Sam Merlotte, played by Sam Trammell, is the sexiest thing on this show.

The major downfall is when they try to pull it into simple HBO \\"Late Night\\" softcore drama.I have one major beef however. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever that this first season should come on so many discs. There aren't very many extras and Blu Ray discs hold more than twice the data of a standard DVD (or so we've been told). To that end, why isn't the first season on one or two discs?

He then expanded that information and assembled the most complete compendium of labyrinth information ever assembled, from history to the modern era. Published by Prestel, a company in Munich, Germany, that specializes in art books, this compendium was available only in German until the current English edition, which took three years to translate and update. New material has been added to cover discoveries and contemporary labyrinths of the last 20 years, making this the most complete presentation of labyrinth information anywhere. It contains hundreds of photos. Granted, Hermann Kern is quite opinionated and confident of his opinions. Nevertheless, any serious labyrinth enthusiast should own this book. I rate it four rather than five stars because, except for a color section in the beginning, all of the photos are in black and white."},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to their studio standard","review":"I was, quite frankly, disappointed with this live album.

It was forwarded to my by a colleague, who is a fan of this authors work. I, however, found it to be yet another poorly written volume by a 'poet', another local favorite judging by the other reviews, with little or no actual literary skill selling a book to a select group of persons who buy it, and then rave about the contents, because they happen to be 'friends' of the author.

One of the best foreign films and one of the best films I've ever seen. The lighting, cinemaphotograpghy, costumes, editing, casting & every thing that makes a good story is in this film. It is a French film so there are subtitles but within a short period of time you probably won't even realize you are reading the subtitles because you'll be so engrossed with the story. I wouldn't recommend this film for children because there is a fair amount of frontal nudity and even more violence. I wouldn't suggest watching this film or not watching this film because of that, the story, character development, and couple with action and suspense really make this movie great. WATCH THIS FILM!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't believe it was in French","review":"I saw this in the theaters, not knowing it was a foreign film.

Proof to me of it's excellence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rousing and Robust","review":"I can't speak French unfortunately but the English dubbing isn't bad. The cinematography is just gorgeous and the sound is incredible. Great story and good acting make this well worth seeing. I took a chance and ordered this without ever seeing it based on reviews here. All I can say is, thanks for the heads up. This is a great period piece and action movie to watch.

I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long, Random, Fitting","review":"At first you'll think it's a drama/mystery, then you see the bad CGI effects, then it shifts into a sci-fi film, towards the end it shifts to action, and finally it shifts back to drama. The film was placed in the drama/horror section. I thought it was going to be a nice drama dealing with werewolves, but I was wrong. This film was a genre-shifter, it was suprisingly different, kind of enjoyable, and kind of long. It's hard to rate this film. The iron-chef was the best.

It was excrutiatingly looooooooong! By the time it ended, I was bored out of my mind.The cinematography is beautiful, & the story, up to a point, is engaging- but the length! The mystery surrounding the beast is interesting, but when we are finally allowed to see it, it is the silliest looking creature! It's scary, because it rips people apart, but it looks ridiculous! I though it was mechanical, but no, it's a strange species originating from Africa- oh, please!If you like super long movies with redundant action sequences & plot points stretched out with miles between them- than this is a movie for you.If you don't, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many confusing elements yields one weird flick.","review":"after reading the reviews posted here, i went to see this movie on opening night.it was one of the *worst* movies i've seen in a long time. a combination of french history, martial arts, x-files, and the muppets, the film was an absurdly confusing clash of cinematic themes and elements.while the fighting scenes were good, some of the battles were so ridiculous that many people in the theater burst out laughing. for example, when the identity of the evil protagonist is finally revealed, he inexplicably sprouts superhuman abilities, and fantastical weapons that make no sense at all (except that perhaps the special effects folks were experimenting with new cg effects).it's almost as if the directors wanted to make several movies, but, afraid of never getting funded again, decided to take their favorite parts of every movie they wanted to make and mash them all together in one film.ugh. wait for the dvd, if you must."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"Definately not what I expected.

Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!! I see there's even a 3 disc version! What more could they possibly add?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see","review":"This was definitely one of the best movies of the year for me. Fast, but well thought-through, sprinkled heavily with action sequences (I especially enjoyed Mark Dacascos and his superb martial arts training) but still not exactly an action movie. Also, the movie's pretty dark both in respect to mood and visual setting, very much like Tim Burton's The Sleepy Hollow. If you liked that movie, you'll love this one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific find!","review":"I hardly ever write reviews but I LOVED THIS MOVIE. Loosely based on a true story about a naturalist/taxidermist and his Native American companion hunting a wolf killing folks in the french country side. Our hero has a reputation as ladie's man but pursues the resident 'proper', innocent daughter. Of course, there is a secret society involved and our hero must solve the mystery of the giant, man-eating wolf while kicking butt and taking names. Lots of martial arts action (I mean who doesn't expect that in a french period piece). There are more twists and turns and I didn't want to spoil the entire plot. The skeevy brother is qreat. I reccomend this to all my friends. Better in the origional french.

Granted there are a number of flashy fight scenes andsome unoriginal camera work (that tries, but unfortunately fails toapproach anything like those other movies I mentioned.I thoughtthis movie was misleadingly marketed as an adventure movie when it isquite obviously a horror movie.

At least the sex scenes were done tastefully."},{"rating":"1","title":"The French are terrible at making movies","review":"This movie made no sense.(I mean it kinda did, but it was just stupid). The trailer had me excited to see it because it looked like it was going to be action packed. There was no plot and the acting was horrible. I'm very skeptical of French movies now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brotherhood of the Wolf","review":"This movie was by far the best foreign film i have ever seen. I saw it for the first time in the movie theater with the English subtitles, and I thought it was so great that I saw it again three days later.

What more could someone want? Based [lightly] on a true story of a terrible beast in France during the 1700s or something, this movie provides the most chances to say \\"wow\\" during a film. I tell you, this movie is colonial JAWS on speed...totally.And the DVD is great, too. Now I know it isn't out in America, but I got one from France and I can now watch it over and over (and in slow-mo when necessary). The picture is so clean, and - come on people...buy this movie! Buy it becauseit rules! The DVD rules! Brotherhood of the Wolf RULES!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little long in the tooth, but a pretty movie","review":"Brotherhood was a fair movie. It was like an action/sweeping saga movie, not too dissimilar from Crouching Tiger. (Although not nearly as good as CTHD) What saved it from a 3 star was the cinematography. It was splendid. The fight scenes are cut a little too close sometimes, but you will give a few \\"wows\\" while watching. The characters in the movie are adequate for the roles they are playing, I saw no break out acing though.I say it was long in the tooth because on the DVD the movie was actually longer than in the theatres. I can understand why they cut some scenes. This movie begged for some good editing for pacing. It was long and drawn out in some scenes, and in others they beat you over the head with obviousness until it hurts. That may work for the French, but we americans are not used to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't take your eyes off it!","review":"Let's see...hong kong kung-fu action, romance, mysticism, political intrigue, sex, horror, mystery, period ambiance, elaborate costumes, impressive art direction, stylized cinematography, etc. What doesn't this movie have? One of the most original combination of elements in film. While initially you may be taken off guard, after an hour, you will be completely entralled, as the film reveals more and more of its depth. While definitely not for everyone, it is an incredible tour-de-force for those interested in the unusual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lived Up to My Expectations","review":"A fan of period pieces, I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie. But I walked way feeling my money was well spent. All through the movie I kept wondering what the Beast really was...the peasants of France thought it was a wolf...I guess if you'd never been to Africa you wouldn't think it was a wolf. The scenry in the movie is breath taking. The earthly tones of stone, grass and dirt contrast against a sky that never seems to shine. As if the beast has taken over the working of the atmosphere.The movie can appeal to everyone, if you can stand subtitles: horror, mystery, love and suspense. The plot does take some abrupt turns toward the end. I'd like to see it a again but if you are queezie or against crulity to animals in form don't see with someone that says 'oh no' and covers their eyes every few minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific movie with a bare bones American release","review":"But do not worry. If you read Stevenseattle's review then take heart as it is being released as a 3 disc SE Region 1 in Canada. The disc will play on American dvd players absolutely fine.

If you want a gory french flic done well, stay in and rent \\"The Crimson Rivers\\" if you have any smarts in you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What You Expect","review":"You should rent this film before you buy. It is more about martial arts / romance and less about wolves / horror. Plus the beast in the film is computer generated and not even a wolf. It's easy to see why this film isn't even slightly scary. The fight scenes don't make sense and distract from the plot. On one hand you have a film that tries to seriously depict a true version of an anicent myth. On the other hand you have knights who practice Kung Fu on a computer generated Lion that wears a mask. The whole idea just doesn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film is rubbish","review":"There are several things wrong with this film. They are as follows: 1) Cheap special effects. 2) Too long. 3) Loose script. 4) Hammy acting. 5) Unrealistic inclusion of martial arts. 6) Soft porn sex scenes. 7) Almost all the main characters. 8) Boring - I don't care what the monster is! I would not recommend this movie. Why did I watch it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"I've seen the movie twice. I am on the waiting list to get the DVD. I loved the scenes, the actors, the story, everything very well done by this French director who already had done Crying Freeman (Mark Dacascos is Freeman in this movie). I recommend to whoever is interested in some romance, action, beautiful scenary and for the soundtrack fans, try to stay until the ending credits and listen to Felicia Sorenson singing ONCE the ending title, it is beautiful! Enjoy it people who aren't afraid of subtitles and know how to enjoy a foreign language film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Has Its Ups and Downs","review":"This movie, while highly entertaining, is utterly implausible in places. There are plot holes a mile wide. Example: Where the [heck] did the Iroquois sidekick learn karate? I wondered why so many guys were lusting after the love interest, whose name I cannot recall. She seemed kinda average to me. So why did I give this movie 4 stars? 1 for the fight scenes, 1 for the Monica Belluci character (Talk about girl power), and two for Mani the Sidekick. It was worth the whole thing just to see him running around in nothing but a loincloth. Mmmm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome potential for Interpretation","review":"This movie not only captivated my attention but also gave me something that no other movie has been able to provide for in about five years: an intriguing plot, **AWESOME** cinamatographty, and the formum for me to be able to read and interpret exceptionally executed metaphors and symbols as you would in a great book. Every scene made me wish that I could understand French so that I would not miss a single frame and I awaited every minute anxiously....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, just too much blood for me...","review":"Note: this movie is in French with English subtitles.In a nutshell, Brotherhood of the Wolf is an excellent foreign film set just previous to the French Revolution about the search for a beast which is roaming the countryside killing people. I would classify this definitely as a \\"guy\\" movie with plenty of action, fighting, a little sex, blood & gore, and some fantasy/magic...and then some romance thrown in for the \\"gals\\". It well deserves the R-rating, so don't bring the kids. The sound quality could use a little help and at times the subtitles were a little fuzzy, but the costumes, sets, etc. are realistic, and the special effects were unique to me (very cool dream sequence & weapons). Beyond all of that, the dialogue and story-line actually have \\"substance\\" which elevates this movie from the typical \\"Halloween\\" and \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 Disk version is available in Canada","review":"The deluxe 3-disk version can be bought at Amazon.ca and it's a region 1 DVD.

I was disappointed at my waste of a saturday night. The action scenes were exciting but not enough to keep the story line flowing and engaging. The actors were good but the movie was too long, conplicated and drawn out. The beast was comical. The bad 3D effect used for it reminded me of the old Sinbad movies. Visually the landscape shots were gorgeous...but the melodrama at the end got way out of hand. Could have been great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"This movie started off on a promising note. The photography was lush and beatiful and I thought I was about to watch an old French tale unwind.

The pace, this one drags along like a bad roadshow version of 'Carmen' and in some cases looks very much like it - also strongly reminds one of the \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" - with the ludricrous beast subbing for old Leatherface and his chainsaw.No, save yourself some time - see this one only IF you must - [gives 'Sleepy Hollow' a bad name].AND possibly the worst dubbing ever! Just what are those accents???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Visaually stunning mess.","review":"All i can say is this film was a disaster. A beautiful wreck of a disaster.When it was not stealing ideals from major films (the opening attack is a ripoff of the opening attack in Jaws) etc, it was trying to cram in so many ideas that not a single one was served well or fully cooked.But the Cinematography was at times truly brilliant.Unfortunatly, i made the mistake of watching it with the voice dub and the awful voice acting made the ludicrous and haphazard story even more insanely stupid than if I had read the subtitles.Of Course thats like saying 'infinity/2 < infinity'Its such a shame because there could have been a really good story in there somewhere....if they hadn't smothered it with all the extra garbage...what a mess. what a shame. what a loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"...

Too much of a cinematic confussion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad marketing","review":"I thought it would be a huge martial arts movie. There were some key fight scenes that played out well. Then, when the movie opened, I though maybe it'll be a horror movie. Some horror scenes were great too. Those looking for those things probably wouldn't enjoy this too much. What ended up dominating the movie was a love story and a metaphor for revolution, and a bunch of deaths that weren't really deaths or resurrections or I don't know.... Also, it took an hour and 28 minutes for our first real look at the wolf. The beatifully shot French countryside was a definite plus, but too many elements muddled the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK not great","review":"It was good up until half way thru. First, it wasnt based on true events, it was based on an old french fable. Camera work and costumes were great, plot was good, nice twists and turns but badly executed! I was almost embarassed at how cheezy it was at times. I know this wasnt a comedy but I laughed several times! It delves into all this subplot that would have worked better if it didnt try to come off as this serious/melodrama/hollywood action flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie","review":"I saw this movie when it came out and have looked for it for a long time and finally I decided to check amazon, there it was.If you like movies that show history in the more realistic with a plot and mythical mystery that this is the one you need to see. Brotherhood of the wolf is not a well known movie but, it is quite the leave where you are and travel into the past for the length of the movie.It also, shows how mentally unbalanced man can be.I received this movie quickly and with out delays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware the wolf...","review":"If you watch this movie with the complete intent to be generally entertained, you won't be disappointed. Sexy, action-packed, and interesting, Brotherhood of the Wolf will keep you guessing until the end regarding wolf!"},{"rating":"2","title":"... the editor","review":"This is a great, visually stunning film. However, it is about 45 minutes too long. It's a shame when the viewer is waiting for the film to end. I think that editing all of the unnecessary love story out of the film would have done wonders for brevity. The girl the lead character lusts after isn't even all that spectacular, inferior to the prostitute without a doubt. Other than that, this really is far superior to any American action film of the last 5 years and semi-rooted in historical fact. In reality, the werewolf scare in France during the time has ultimately been linked to hallucinogenic reaction to a fungus in the rye bread given to peasants, but that's another story. I have a slight problem with an Iriquois Indian and a French taxidermist being so proficient in marital arts, but I do believe strongly in the suspension of disbelief. Watch the film, and for God's sakes, watch it in French with English subtitles. You will lose so much with Godzilla-like English dubbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Class","review":"I went to see this film not expecting much, but I must admit I was absolutly blown away - this is an absolutly AMAZING film.It has everything - matrix-esque effects a la the lobby sequence, some kick ass action and some good acting.I must admit, I'm not usually a fan of subtitles in a film and prefer comedy dubbing, but I just didn't notice in this film, I was so absorbed.This film crosses many genres, including martial arts, horror, period, warewolf movies and murder mystries, and manages to mix them all to a creditable degree.Its based on a French legend, and is a French language film, but don't let that put you off - this film puts all of Jet Li's western film's in the shade.If you get the chance, see this film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie of all time!","review":"I am so glad that they finally released a collectors edition for this movie. The extras are what I've always wanted ever since the first time I saw it. The making of the movie is awesome, especially the making of the 'Beast'. Well worth the few extra bucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"was not what I expected","review":"This movie was more of a love story and the movie itself wasthe worst movie I have seen this year. Dont buy this movie itis that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feast for the eyes, but turn off your brain!","review":"Lush period piece . . . PERIOD. It features cookie-cutter characters, a crazed mish-mash of genres and styles, a painfully meandering plot (if you can call it that), gratuitous violence and over-the-top exhibitions of martial arts. The movie certainly appealed to lots of guys (including my brother) who checked their brains at the door, so I predict it'll make a fortune in DVD sales. That was probably the aim of the French: make a big-budget American-style film, throw in martial arts, add special effects . . . and make a ton of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy the 3-DVD set if you can","review":"Following the comments by Jean Beaulieu (September 18, 2002), it is true that the 3-DVD set is a must. I just bought it at a grocery store that has a great choice of DVDs.The movie looks great and the extras are fantastic for whoever loved that movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really cool movie but did you notice?","review":"I thought the film had a really good story and the action sequences were amazing. The creature looked cool too, but as I sat watching this film with my manager at one of our midnight screenings at the theatre I worked at, I wondered--had I seen this movie before? In a way, this film is a remake of Jaws. It begins with a girl alone getting killed and thrown against a rock, then a number of hunters go out and slaughter a bunch of wolves that they think committed the murder, ultimately to find three brave men to go into the woods by themselves to face the unseen beast. Obviously no martial arts to be found in Jaws, so this element was very well handed with amazing sound effects. This film will benefit with surround sound. I hope the dvd has alot of extras, but if not, the film itself is worth a look or a place on your shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorta silly","review":"You thought the French only made films of grace, intellect, depth and innovation? Think again. This one proves that the French can make a Hollywood no-brainer just as well as Americans can. Not to say that it isn't mildly entertaining. The action sequences are fun, if overdone. The costumes are fun and the CGI is a bit silly. The whole film is just a bit silly--Sleepy Hollow+the Lone Ranger+Gladiator+Braveheart+Dangerous Liasons+Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon=Brotherhood of the Wolf. Not bad. Not good. If you need a popcorn movie, check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"slowly lost its train of thought","review":"Here is a movie that started creating an interesting and moody quality. Unfortunately, the story began complicating itself for no reason, and refused to come to a conclusion until the audience just decided to leave the theater. I think the film would have gladly continued another three hours but there was no one left in the theater to watch it.I'm a big fan of french films but this director seemed to lose his mind after the first hour and a half and started adding elements which really took away from the movies initial premise. What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crouching courtesans, hidden poignards","review":"Review attacking the film for bad acting miss the point; it's about attitude. Lots of that. A bargain for the money is its supply of violence, sex, non-stop action and an obscure but cogent plot. The initial sequence, however, in retrospect made no sense as the pair attacked by the Wolf Men were subsequently revealed to be key figures in their group ??? Almost enough nudity but the \\"hero's\\" modesty was a bit jarring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A French Sleepy Hollow","review":"This incredible film is almost a French version of Sleepy Hollow, it moves along exactly the same, until it gets to the action, where it leaves the Tim Burton film way behind. Not that Sleepy Hollow is bad, but this movie was influenced heavily by Japanese video games. It makes the French 18th century country side look like something out of the matrix, with the camera almost stopping in some scenes, then starting up again, only faster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly watchable","review":"Normally, I would rather join the Richard Dawkins Fan Club than watch a dubbed film, but this time I was happy to be wrong. An absorbing storyline, beautiful location and costumes, very enjoyable action scenes, and all beautifully filmed. Didn't make to the cinema in time to catch it, but I'm glad I bought the dvd. Didn't even notice the dub.Cool.Baby Cromwell, Nottingham, England"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Nature of the Beast","review":"I'll say this much about \\"The Brotherhood of the Wolf\\"; it is a unique cinematic experience. Essentially, the story is about a beast that is ravaging a French province. The king sends one of his troubleshooters along with his Iroquois sidekick to help out in the effort to fell the beast. We do see the physical manifestation of the beast. Ah, but the beast is also a metaphor. A metaphor of what you say? That is dependent on your knowledge of French history. If you don't want to get bogged down in the metaphysical aspects of the film there's alot of eye-popping action and martial arts and cool camerawork and editing. The film has antecedents in other genres but it molds into an experience unlike any other. I'm not going to say I was completely floored by this film but it was interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"The film had potential...","review":"There is something vicious lurking in the woods around the mountains of France. It kills, it maims, it eats, and it is terrorizing the people of Gevaudan. On the kings orders, the royal taxidermist Gr��goire de Fronsac is traveling to the area with his friend Mani, an Iroquois who is a martial arts master, to investigate the dilemma. These men spend a lot of time in the brothel while maintaining a respectable front and when they have time they perform round house kicks left and right. In all honesty, this film had potential when they began shooting it, however, somewhere in the production the director must have lost focus from the theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"I THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE - FIVE TIMES","review":"Anyone who reads too much into this film like many are doing of course may be disappointed. Keeping in mind that it is still just a french horror film, you should watch it like its a horror film. It's fun and scary, the opening fight scene is sexy (but its too bad they cut Mark Decascos and Samuel LeBihan both fighting in that scene)and I feel the way it was filmed was extraordinary and beautiful. Yes, I agree the beast was a little disappointing. I was expecting something more realistic, but watching Mani and Fronsac easily made me forget about it. And I can't believe that I have not seen a comment by anyone about the fact that Fronsac looks like Mickey Rourke when he was in his prime. I am praying that this movie is released on DVD in the US because I will be the first to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-made, engaging, God-honoring film","review":"I can't wait to share this film with my kids! Its style is reminiscent of the beautiful BBC \\"Blue Planet\\" films, but with a Biblical worldview rather than an evolutionary one. I only have a few small complaints: 1) the film was too long and slow--with more concise writing and a single narrator (rather than several), it could have been shorter while being just as interesting and powerful, and 2) some of the camera shots were a bit too shaky (although I'm sure it's difficult to maintain stillness while filming from a boat). Still, it's great to see a high-quality, modern, creationist film like this. Keep up the good work, guys! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riedel is the best in fine glassware.","review":"I've been using Riedel for years. (Pronounced \\"REEdul\\") Their best line is handblown Austrian crystal and is called the \\"Sommelier\\" series. VERY expensive, but peerless in quality and beauty. The next line down is also very fine and is called the \\"Vinum\\" series. My white wine glasses are from this series. My red wine glasses are from the \\"Overture\\" series -- the Magnum glasses. These are just the right size -- the Vinum can get quite large. I also prefer a shorter stem, which these have. I thought the Overture regular reds were a little too small for my taste (and smell!).Overture is a little more durable, MUCH cheaper, but not quite as elegant. Still, they are very nice glassware and certainly nice enough to have for fine dining and guests.I would suggest you NEVER put ANY Riedel glassware in the dishwasher. This is high quality Austrian crystal and it is definitely not a good idea to do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riedel Ouverture Magnum Glasses","review":"Great size glass to use for water or soda which addsbeauty to a table instead of a heavy glass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality control","review":"I've been a Riedel user for many years, including a set of the Sommelier series. These Ouverture Magnums have been our everyday wine glasses, and when some break I order more. The most recent set was very disappointing, with visible striations on the rim edges from substandard \\"polishing\\" on all four glasses, and you can feel the roughness when you run your fingernail along it. So think twice or three times before you buy, and recognize that you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average at best","review":"Dpn't be fooled by the Riedel name on these.

Don't waste your time or money - I wish I hadn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good start","review":"Good start to a mystery series. What caught my eye was the picture on the spine of another Ella Clah mystery when I was at my local library. After reading the blurb about the series on the inside cover I knew I must read the entire series. The storyline was good and Ella Clah was interesting for a cop type mystery series (all the others I have read (Craig Johnson, Kathy Reichs, Sandi Ault, Nevada Barr), don't really seem to focus on the main character's heritage. Although to be fair, the other series written by the authors I mentioned, basically have a \\"white\\" main character. Whereas this series has a main character with a definite heritage/culture. I gave this a 4/5 because while the entire concept intrigued me, the story and characters did not immediately draw me into the story. I will start the second book soon and I do hope that this is a series that will get better and be one that I will forgo sleep in order to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good start to the series","review":"This a fine start to the series. Each volume can stand alone, but it's a good idea to read them in order, if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to learn about Native American customs and practices in a novel format vs. a reference type book. While it did give me some insight into Navajo culture, the book is written at about the 3rd grade level. It was mildly entertaining if you want a no-brainer type of book. But if you want something you can really sink your teeth into, this isn't it. The characters lack depth and the plot is hokey. I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypnotic And Lovely","review":"A very good first record for introduce to the Western World and Music to what Brian Jones loved at the time: ancient music, played with soul, old as the desert its played in, these chants, these ancient trance states are recorded with a great Respect, and the Master Musicians Of Jajouka deliver, as they always delivered and always will deliver, an extraordinary performance, where time and space stops for giving space to the music, to the eternal, to the meditation...Incredible record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live trance on disc","review":"First, this disc is not for the faint at heart; even if you like world music and freejazz it is difficult to listen to.

The competition is already competing with the Chamber of Secrets and the Two Towers coming out this fall. C.S. Lewis is a genius, a truly brilliant writer. He and Tolkien are my favorite authors. I would reccommend that you should read these books. If you are into fantasy and love reading, then you would like reading The Chronicles of Narnia. I would read the books before seeing the very poorly made movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chronicles of narnia","review":"The DVD's are fine but packaging was severly broken, outer casing torn and DVD cases snapped.

They were done in the 80s as well so you have to think that special effects have come very far since then. The acting is just not that great and parts of the video look like there was no editing it was just done live and then straight to video.I love the story line and they seem to stay true to the books from what i can remember (its been awhile since i saw these) If you want to see the books come to live go see the walden media production version. Huge budget and much much better.Kids might like this though just because it is a good story. My sister loves this but i am a computer person and a stickler for good special effects. I would rent these rather then buy them. If you like it then go buy it. I know blockbuster has these for rent and some libraries do as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY THIS MOVIE IF YOU WANT TO GO TO SLEEP!!!","review":"This movie was so bad, my kids begged me to turn it off!

I don't need the more involved details and special effects but in this case, well, after seeing the newest releases, this set is hard to watch. I've tried several times and I can not force myself to watch. I have seen most of it little snippits. I like the fact that the young actors are not in as much intense fighting which I find is way over done with the newer versions. :( I'm dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four Out of Five Ain't Bad...","review":"I LOVED 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', but was sorely disappointed in the others of the trilogy.

It was probably the most influential thing on my career (I work in comic books, film, and chilren's literature).For about 15 years, no one had any idea what I was talking about when I was trying to explain this to them. Finally, they're on DVD and I own them. This is such a fantastic collection, too. Beautifully packaged, well formatted, and just a wonderful set to add to your collection.Get these for your kids, they just might be the most influential moment of their lives. Get them for yourself, the power of Narnia is still there.Giddie like school boy,-Ray"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I was really looking forward to viewing the DVDs.

I found very little to praise in this package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chronicles of Narnia","review":"The DVD version left me flat.

It captures the Narnia from the books so well.My favourite in this collection is Voyage of the Dawn Treader (*swoon* Samuel West as Caspian). My only disappointment comes from the fact that Prince Caspian was so short, I really wish it had been longer. It would have also been nice to see all seven books made into the series but nevertheless it's a BRILLIANT collection and a must for any Narnia fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"wondeful.","review":"These are wonderful stories.

These videos are superb. Each movie is continuous viewing enjoyment, no breaks or intermissions. Don't buy these movies if you don't like to use your imagination. These are not high-budget special effects films -- they require effort on your part, like a child's imagination. These are classic films for children and adults and a recommended buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Newer Version","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia by the BBC is far better than the American remake of the original film, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.

Shortly after, the co-president was searching the web and came across the DVD and VHS. When she came to the meeting, most of us got extremly excited. We went home to our parents and begged for them. This meant extra chores and no more allowences for weeks. When the movies finally came in, we were VERY, VERY, disappointed. They did not live up to the books potential like most movies that are based on books are. I would not recommend the Chronicles of Narnia movies, but I WOULD recommend The Chronicles of Narnia books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Videos are not Disney","review":"I did not pay attention to who published these videos.

This is not the DVD youve seen here in the states. This seller is selling a DVD set of the BBC made for TV movies.

They had this version on VHS and said that no one ever checked them out.We bought the complete set of the Disney version of Narnia. Those I can honestly say are fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"No.","review":"So many problems with these adaptaions.1) The movies are very \\"BBC sound stage\\" -- they come off like a Mexican soap opera.2) Poor casting of the children. Just plain awful -- the actors bear no resemblance to the book characters, and it leaves you wondering who is the powerful relative who got them the role?3) Precisely what was the problem with the original dialog and plot? The changes that have been made are NOT improvements.4) The overacting -- LOTS of exaggerated facial expressions -- very weird.5) The cheesy special effects. People in beaver costumes? People in wolf masks, roaring? People with hairy legs being fauns? Glaringly obvious animation? This series has it all.

None of the Characters look like Lewis described them. Plus the witch looks like a drag queen. The movie is hard to get into and not very captivating, I had to drink quite a few cups of coffee to stay awake through just the first one. I understand that they didn't have as much technoloy as there is now, but the movies could have been made somewhat better. I would suggest watching these, but don't buy them, its a waste of your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Adaptation","review":"This is a series that I once read with my mother and have revisited every few years since. Then I saw the BBC adaptation of the first 4 books (according to the pre '95 non-chronicle numbering of the books) on the Disney Channel in the early 90's and found it to be a wonderful adaptation of these timeless books(even though they did not adapt all 7 which is a shame).

Definately a must see for families and fantasy lovers!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in the day.","review":"I used to borrow these from the local library when I was a kid. And saw it and had to buy it as a DVD set. I remember being scared of the White Witch, I think because she is so loud, but I had a great time watching them again 17ish years later. Wonderful story and fun to watch. I have watched the new Chronicles of Narnia and wasn't as big of a fan, much more CG and effects, but less entertaining I thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chronicles of Narnia (3 disc set)","review":"This really is an amazing trilogy.

Im 23 now and Istill enjoy the story, but I would also feel comfortableand pleased to show this feature to children. Withthe crazy ratings these days with films like\\"ghostbusters\\" and \\"Jaws\\" getting PG ratingsits hard to know what is good for kids and thesemovies are great for everyone!

The purpose of it is just to teach you phrases so that you could say enough in the language to, for instance, order a lager at a pub. These types of tapes are great if going to Italy, France, Germany etc., and there being a great need to know a bit in those particular languages. In Ireland, however, there is no need to learn Gaeilge. Everyone speaks English, but not everyone speaks Irish! You should have no trouble at all ordering your lager at a Rose&Crown Pub. This defeats the whole purpose of the course. If you are truly interested in learning Irish, there are better courses to buy. If you just want to impress a few Irish people with your phrases in their native tongue, then don't waste any more time reading me, and buy the tapes=)"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Inside the plastic shell casing you will find 2 cassette tapes instead of a CD/DVD so if you don't have a cassette player, you are out of luck.

The first one is pretty cool, but the second: Oh my goodness. It is AWESOME! Totally cool. Of course, this is no Lord of the Rings, and it's unfortunate they don't have a few orcs or goblins in here, but its still a really good movie. It's also faithful to the books.

PrinceCaspian was'nt exactly, what i thought it should be. the voyage of the dawn treader is simply superior to prince caspian & wonderful special effects. If anything, prince caspian should be remade, while the dawn treader should stay. then my second favorite,the Silver Chair, is PartIII and was one of the two best movies , in the chronicles of narnia.the time people get to this narnian ending, they will usually be curious to see if it makes up the holes in the series.So i highly recommend that you see firstly the wardrobe one, then skip prince caspian and go on to the voyage of the dawn treader so you'll be able to understand PartIII, the silver chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"just like the first one this one was okay, prince caspian was very short but the dawn treader was not all that bad. this was on okay movie still disney's version of prince caspian was better and i think thier version of voyage of the dawn treader will be awesome to"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Chronicles of Narnia - Prince Caspian ~1990~","review":"This is the worst of the BBC \\"chronicles of Narnia\\"trilogy. While the story of Prince Caspian is worthalmost 4 stars, the dawn treader story is boring anddone poorly. I understand that this film is 13 yearsold, made for TV and for children, but the scene withthe dragon is so badly done. I would have liked the BBCto elaborate more on \\"prince caspian\\", but I understandthey had to inlcude the \\"dawn treader\\" because we areintroduced to one of the main characters from \\"the silver chair\\".I liked \\"the lion witch and the wardrobe\\" and \\"the silver chair\\", but they will cost almost the same seperatly as the complete triology boxed set. I think older fans(13+) shouldskip this film, but younger fans(12 and younger) may like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BOTHER!!!!!!","review":"In fifth grade I watched this. It was horrible. The teacher even said that sixth grade \\"didn't appreciate it\\". Nobody in the class liked it, and everyone thought it was funny. The costumes were so cheesy a 2 year old could tell you that they're fake, the battles scenes were quick and fake-looking, and the acting made a Kindergarten play look like a high class French opera. But what I hated about this movie the most was that it insulted C.S. Lewis. So many kids thought that Narnia is a waste of time because of that movie.

However, the Prince Caspian video was truely horrible. The story was boring and the special effects were really bad. I couldn't finish watching it & stopped before it was half-way done.I loved reading all the books in the series.

Hated, hated, hated the new China in this book, hate the perfect stepson, and don't like the boyfriend anymore, either. The \\"mystery\\" wasn't too hard to solve but it took pages and pages at the end to explain it.

Either way they detract from the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Somewhat Gentler China","review":"I have been reading the China Bayles series, and this is the fourth book in the series. I strongly recommend that you begin at the beginning and read them in order. It's not necessary in order to enjoy this book, but it helps. Then you will see how much gentler China is becoming. She is certainly not as \\"hard-bitten\\" a heroine like VI Warshawski or Kinsey Mallone, but I like her because she is the way she is. This is a good series and, as always, there is lots of good plant information in this book. Unfortunately, I figured out \\"who-donuit\\" about 1/2 way through the book, but it didn't spoil the story. I hope that in subsequent books in the series, which I will be reading, Ms. Albert does not leave such glaring clues.

It is very educational and has great points that we haven't seen on other creation science videos. We love the other creation science sites, videos, books, etc., but this one is a great one to add to the collection. We also love that they acknowledge that secular evolution is just a religion. Evolutionists' view of science is based on a world without God as the creator.

The pricing is fair and not a level that you would avoid using them because of concerns about breaking one. The bottom line is that they represent a good value and they also do justice to your wine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I did it","review":"I was somewhat leary of ordering these glasses because of one of the reviews. It really had more to do with the shipping problems. End of story, mine arrived in perfect condition. I love the way these glasses bring out the best in a bottle of wine.

These are not large red wine glasses, but they are adequate and could easily double as an all-purpose glass for whites as well. A bit delicate, but I say that in a good way--they're elegant. The glass is thin, rings well and I would have thought it was crystal if I'd had to guess. Very nice...but my next set will be larger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many imperfections","review":"Maybe it was this particular batch combined with poor quality control/inspection, but there were lots of flaws on each glass in one of two sets I bought.

They are narrowly fluted, as white wine glasses are. Also, be warned that if you buy these glasses, you are not buying them from or through Amazon. The return must go to and through CentralChef. CentralChef charges a \\"restocking fee of up to 20%,\\" requires you to have an RMA code (whatever that is), and does not answer its phone during business hours--in other words, does everything in its power to discourage returns. I expected better from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are far too tiny to be real wine glasses","review":"Read the dimensions carefully on this one because the picture makes them look like real wine glasses. They're not! They're tiny little taster glasses that can't hold a proper 5 ounce pour without being too full to benefit from the fancy shape (too little head space for proper bouquet or slosh-free swirling).If you just want cute little wine glasses you can get them much cheaper and they'll work just as poorly. If you want proper wine glasses to do all that sniffing and swirling you need ones that are much bigger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Found it too small","review":"I bought these Riedel glasses for the reputation of that brand.

Not only did the shoulder strap break, on a second occation the handle strap broke. I did not like having to repair my horn because the case was not durable. The only thing in my case was the horn and a mute, no additional weight was involved. I do not know how the case retails for $150, but I would think twice before purchacing this product.

Some great revelations throughout, with a truly evil nemesis in the Archimanderite Luseferous (what a name).Banks has a lighter, funnier tone with dialogue that others in the genre (Hamilton, Vinge, Reynolds) that may seem a bit to modern-day, but actually works quite well within the other far-distant future themes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"This starts off slowly and gets funnier and funnier, as you realise what is going on. You appreciate it more and more as you go on.The main aliens, The Dwellers, while having ridiculous levels of technology and knowledge, and being billions of years old, sometimes seem like they have stepped straight out of a Red Dwarf/Hitchhiker's crossover.So there is some of that Culture-AI humor here, and AIs - and a super-insane religious/political/military leader, to top all that off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it an opera because of how it drags?","review":"I'm not entirely sure what a space opera is supposed to be. If this book represents the ideal then I'll never read another one. The story was a combination of insteresting elements interwined with numbing plot lines which either went nowhere or left me completely unfulfilled. If this was intentionally part of a sequential interlinked series, then I could perhaps understand the way some of it was presented. I don't believe that's the case, though. I don't mind a slow build to a story, but this was like a series of slow builds, and some of them never finished building. I don't find myself inclined to read anymore by this author on the basis of this experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Effort","review":"I've long equated Banks as being the Charles Dickens of SF. By picking up one of his novels, you tacitly agree to patience and the long haul. Yes, to reach the ranks of true greatness, a hard-nosed editor willing to cut out 100 pages of unnecessary exposition from most of Bank's novels is both essential and warranted. There are many instances (40-50) of what-could-be-said in one paragraph taking several pages, and many cases of does-this-drawn-out-scene even need to be here at all? BUT, for advanced readers who can deploy the patience/and or delayed gratification agreement necessary upon picking up ANY of his books, the pay-off is truly sublime. Far flung and exotic landscapes and concepts abound in this space opera, as well as hefty doses of humor and well developed characters.

I thought that a movie would be a great idea, and even though this version is truer to the story than the new Walden Media film, it looks cheap. It was a good idea produced when technology couldn't handle the necessities of the story. People in animal suits? Nice effort, but I was turned off by the bad attempts at acting and the even worse attempts at making it look realistic. Don't waste your money on the BBC.

However, it wasn't smart to make this movie at the time they made it. The 80's and early 90's didn't have the special effects that we have today. The scenery wasn't too good and the battle wasn't exciting at all. Also, it's not smart to have actors were animal costumes.

I can't believe all the good reviews it got. Maybe we were watching different movies? The costumes and makeup were really bad. The acting was overdone or underdone, but never believable. Even my kids agreed it was pretty bad. I love the books and I enjoy Christian themes. But just because I want something with a religious theme doesn't mean I'll settle for something bad just because it includes some Christian allegory. Do yourself a favor and just read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Child's Intro to Christianity","review":"Very faithful rendition of the CS Lewis classic; first of a series of books he wrote to introduce children to the precepts of Christianity. Wish this and the two other Narnia films were widely available - they're wonderfully done and just as enjoyable for adults as for children!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Availability","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia are available through the BBC in the UK. I purchased mine at the BBC shop in Portland Place (near Oxford Circus, next to Broadcasting House) in London. However the format for North America differs from that used in Britain. Since the videos are not currently available in North America, I suggest that keen fans purchase the videos in the UK and convert them to North American format when they get home. This is expensive but worthwhile, if you really love these animated stories as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"No grownups in beaver suits, please!","review":"Hoping for a good visual treatment of Lewis' Narnia books, I ordered this tape. My kids and I were appalled by the adult actors in cheaply made animal costumes, as well as the creepy special effects for all the non-actor animals apart from Aslan (looks like all the $$$ went into Aslan).Now with all the great digital computer animation possible, will someone please redo this series, a la Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love The Chronicles of Narnia...BUT","review":"Lewis said that he never wanted his work to be adapted to a live action film. He was concerned about how the talking beasts (such as the beavers) would look in silly costumes. He was right on the money. They looked foolish.The best thing I can say about this film is that it is true to the book, with minor exceptions.The worst thing I can say is that it was two hours and forty one minutes long! It dragged, and dragged, and dragged - and it didn't need to do so. People walked too slowly, talked to slowly, Aslan himself moved at the speed of a dying turtle. While the material presented was decent (effects aside), the pacing was horrid. It could have been just as true to the book and been *at least* forty-five minutes shorter.It's difficult for me to write a less than stellar review when the book is so dear to my heart. But here is the most salient point: I read the book in less than two hours and forty one minutes. So..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm just glad I didn't actually PAY to watch this!","review":"We checked this out from the library a couple of years ago. It really was torture to watch.

As it turned out I was very disappointed, mainly because the writer is so self-indulgent. That's to say, she's written for her own satisfaction, and lost sight of the need to hold her readers' attention. She constantly tells us that this is a book about story-telling. Funnily enough, that's why people buy books. It's like the packs of frozen food you buy, which have a picture on the front captioned \\"Serving Suggestion\\" that shows the contents on a plate. Which is not a bad metaphor, since I note from other reviews that some of this book's contents has been regurgitated from previous offerings, and served up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring - boring - boring!","review":"I am amazed at the rave reviews submitted so far. I just decided , twenty or so pages from the end, that the book is not worth finishing. Time and place seem confused for no purpose. In fact, the novel seems purposeless and pointless in general.

I was very disappointed to see the author took liberty with using a modern version. When Chapman quotes the Bible in the book the author has him quoting from a modern version that was not around then. A few times the King James Version was used. I do not think this should be done and is dishonest and none authentic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible version","review":"This is not a summarized version, it appears as if someone just tore pages out. For example chapter 5 starts out like this: \\"other, just like an endless cycle.\\" What is like an endless cycle?? Since when should a chapter start mid sentence? This is not a summarized version but a very very very dumbed down version. Just avoid this version at all costs, it's not even worth the $5.

There are many great examples of warlike behavior here but I found I had difficulty applying them to real life; Sun-Tzu implies every part of your body can be used as a weapon, but after extensive experimentation I can say that unless you completely had the upper hand there are some parts that just aren't going to cause much damage no matter what you do. Also, I think things are just different now than they were back in his day, and while engaging in warlike behavior on the battlefields of yesteryear probably brought honor, declaring war on the obnoxious cashier at the local Pic N' Pay will pretty much just get you thrown out by the manager. Still, it's a great book for all ages, and when you throw in the fact that Sun-Tzu personally signs every copy it's practically a no-brainer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've been deceived.","review":"This book fits into the palm of my hand.

On some of them Stevie's original track almost seems to be thrown in as an afterthought. What makes this one a must have is it's already become tough to find. If you see it, pick it up, you most likely won't see it again. I have every Stevie single released going back to the \\"Buckingham Nicks\\" days, if you're like me, you want this too.

If you only fir one of the three types of a system, you should really specify that, I just assumed since its a multi plug it would have a plug for each kind. Not the case. It has two plugs, one of which fits the SNES and one of which fits the NES but nothing for the Genesis.

In comparison to the Green Grocer, the Cafe Corner lacks an interior, which serves as an exciting side project planning for one. The ace of this set is definitely the design of the architecture and is amazing when displayed.I believe that these sets will go down in Lego and the Lego collector's history as two of most sought-after building sets.

And with bad grammer and incomplete sentences. I was as angry at the book editor as I was with the author. I kept thinking that English must not be the author's native language, but even so, the editor didn't do his job. That's probably why an updated version has not been issued. Get a new author! Get a new editor!The software also was bad. I have used Boson software and tests before and found them very good.

Songs like 'Wolt Ihr Das Bett In Flammen Sehen', 'Der Meister' and 'Weisses Fleish' add a head banging, hard rock aspect to the album while in direct contrast the song 'Seeman' shows that Rammstein have a quiter side. The best thing about this album is that 'every' song is of a high standard, something that the numerous american boy/girl band community could take note of. If you are looking to buy your first Rammstein album, bear in mind that this is their 'hardest' album as in the strong guitar sets and fast tempo certainly overhaul the keybord/synthesizer aspect of other albums, but it is certainly a brilliant bit of work.

This is undoubtedly the best pure metal band of all time. Only a more eclectic mix like the Pumpkins or Marilyn Manson can match them and only the incomparable NIN exceeds. There are no standout songs on this CD since they are all great. The grating repetition that plagues virtually all metal bands is totally absent in Rammstein. It can only be attributed to genius.

Clarity is good, allowing you to evaluate color. Easy to clean, and dishwasher safe. No lead used in manufacturing.Cons: Stem could be shorter and the base of the bowl could be wider. Narrow lip makes tasting a bit awkward.Overall: Great for nosing, tasting is ok.

It shipped really quickly. My hair is very fine, and every other straightener I've tried (including several more expensive brands) have caused static. Some of the expensive ones that get really hot have straightened my hair well, but they also make my hair look rather flat and limp. So far, the Ga.ma has straightened my hair as well as any of them, but my hair still has volume and body, plus there's no static! I hope it is as durable as it is good at straightening!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Advertised","review":"I had tried a Ga.ma straightener previously from a friend and loved it, so I thought I'd buy my own. The biggest perk for me was that it worked for both European and US voltages so that I could travel with it without any problems. However when I received the straightener, it did not satisfy the product description. The wattage was 85 not 170, and the voltage were 220 not 100-240. Moreover, the straightener takes a *long* time to heat up. Even after 5 minutes, my straightener still flashes the red light that indicates it's still heating.I contacted Goodman's (the seller) and they told me that they don't even sell straighteners that work in Europe, despite that they advertise the 1001HP that way.The Ga.ma straightener that I borrowed from a friend was one of the best straighteners I've ever used. It's unfortunate that the ones sold in the US are not the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"far exceeded my expectations!","review":"This is one of the best religious movies that I have seen so far.

The first aid kit was lacking to my standards but I also expected that as well. It is a good start but to be truly prepared though you need to purchase a seperate, more complete first aid kit.

The UK is having difficulty reaching agreement with the trash collectors union, so the trash is building up around the tenement buildings. The kids of the neighborhood run the streets like wild stray cats. They make sport of catching and killing rats. When they are bored with being mean toward animals, they turn on each other in far more subtle but more devastating ways. The canal in back of the tenements claims lives on a regular basis.

My son pulled on the growth chart a couple of times and it stretched out the loop, which throws off where the measurement markers fall. It wasn't accurate anymore.

How dare someone write such trash, and pawn it off as a novel. This story is so completely stupid, I am embarrassed for the author. I was fooled by some of the other reviews. I am embarrassed for those reviewers as well. How could anyone read this book. The author seriously needs some psychological help. The book contains foul action after foul action. I was hoping for a little bit of a story. Erotica can be tasteful. As a matter of fact, the more tasteful it is the more able the reader is to relate to the actions. This was purely in poor taste. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seized","review":"This novel is surprisingly short for the price. It's only 160 pages and it's not small type. This novel is a sequel to The Empress' New Clothes and can't really be read without it. Certain parts of that novel are repeated in this one. I liked Geris and Dak. I wish that their romance had a greater part in this novel. For some reason, the author chose to put in segments about other characters who I can only assume will be featured in other novels. During these times, the main characters are not even mentioned.Also, if you're in favor of complete monogamy from your characters as I am, this isn't the book for you. I found the love scenes to be rather more a description of sex than love making. I didn't find it to be nearly sensual or stimulating enough. And here again, I don't think the main couple was focused on enough. I can only recall one love scene that was properly described between the two of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seized by Jaid Black","review":"This is a good story.

I've purchased all the books in this series and I can say that she doesn't treat any of her white characters as badly as she treats Geris Jackson. I'm disappointed in Ms. Black and I'm sorry I purchased this book. I don't understand her need to see Geris humiliated and mistreated so many times by so many beings, even the High Priestess wanted to mistreat her suggesting that Geris be used as a dartboard. None of the other women were treated in such a manner, not even the women that belonged to warriors. I find it strange that a woman who was a member of the royal family could be treated in such a manner. All I have to say to this author is if you don't like a certain race of people you shouldn't include them in your book. In other words your hatred shouldn't be on display for the whole world to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is Erotic...","review":"I can't say I was all that impressed with this read. I thought for sure, with all the stellar reviews, that I was going to love it. In all honesty I read it in a few hours (it's about 140 pages long), and there wasn't much in the way of plot. Dak, a seven or eight foot alien comes to earth to take his life mate, Geris, after his Emperor claimed Geris' best friend as his life mate. Geris is mauled by Dak, aliens with butts for heads (I'm not lying) and little men that roam around and survive on fluids from a female. I suppose that's what made it erotic, but the sex between Dak and Geris was rather vague. There was a little humor that helped, but honestly you would be better off doing a search on the Internet for free erotic literature than spend eight bucks on this. I liked the premise of life mates and big, beefy men (who doesn't?) but the presentation fell a little short for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"So steamy!!!","review":"This is the first book of the trek mi q'an series I bought and oh goodness, I was in love after I finished!

However, my hopes were utterly dashed by this Sapphire-the-sassy-black-woman- stereotype mess of a book. In this book Geris is super, super combative...literally! She punches him in the eye repeatedly and goes crosseyed multiple times. Crosseyed!

The text regularly refers to \\"Class 2.5\\" or \\"Listing 3.4\\" (for example) yet none of the code listings are labeled, and may not be on the same page. You'll drive yourself nuts trying to figure out what he's talking about. Also, the text makes reference to code and listings that can only be found on the author's web page without explicitly stating this.

Five Lost Years dispels a lot of stereotypes about severe mental illness. For one, Ms. Alexandra is no dummy.

The book was written by Livia Bitton-Jackson.The setting takes place in Germany during World War2. In this book there are two main characters. Elli a girl that is tall, skinny, smart, and poetic. Mom is the other character that stays with Elli through out the war. In this book Elli experiences some tough times in Auschwitz a death camp. some of the things she had to fight through are starvation and torture. The theme of this book is racism and war are bad. I can prove this because the jews didn't want war but the Germans did. I would recommend this book to any World War2 buff that wants to hear a Jews perspective of the war and see how the war unfolded. The book I would compare this to is Parallel Journeys because both books give a Jews perspective on the war.

By \\"literary\\" definitions, it probably be considered a rather unremarkable novel, but its searing story alone makes it a worthwhile read. Somehow, Elli's simple, stark descriptions only serve to heighten the effect of this book, for as I was reading it, I mourned with Elli at the loss of her childhood home, rejoiced with her as she and her mother somehow survived, and literally cried with her as she realized the tragic fate of children in the concentration camps.

Much of the information in the book is theoretical, and borrowed from elsewhere. Apart from that, the processes are heavyweight, and not suited to the efficient execution of real software projects.It's a very dull book, and the author's self congratulatory tone soon becomes irritating.

However, as a casual read or even for classroom use, I could not recommend this book.The writing is dull and reminiscent of a poorly written textbook where too much information is crammed into too small a space. A better format for young adults, the target audience, would be less information with accompanying pictures, vocabulary definitions, and personal accounts.This book might be more acceptable to upper high school students and college students with a particular interest in science, but as a young adult book it deserves to be devoured by a black hole and regenerated as new matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"McCall is no Maupin","review":"First, I am a faithful reader of McCall's No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series.

Due to the requirements of the serial format, he was forced to combat that tendency in this book, with a happy result. Yes, it does meander a bit, but each meander is an interesting morsel in its own right, and it ties up into a fairly satisfying whole, if you can overlook a few loose ends.I do agree with the reviewers who pointed out that it must have meant a lot more to residents of Edinburgh than it does to us. Most of the references are clear enough from context (i.e., \\"the Braids\\" is obviously some kind of upper-crust district), but the knowing wink will be lost on most American readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different than Ladies No. 1","review":"Alexander McCall Smith takes a different route with 44 Scotland Street from the Ladies No. 1 Detective books. There's a different tone and since it was originally a newspaper serial there is a different rhythm to the story. Nonetheless, if enjoy a good story, a good book for a rainy day, this is one.What I love about Mr. McCall-Smith's books is that he does not spend a lot of time describing the characters' looks. I'm allowed to come up with my ideas of what is attractive or plain. These characters are also quirky without being too much so."},{"rating":"1","title":"The editor should be fired","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I had read The Number One Ladies Detective Agency and was looking forward to another exceptional read. What a disappointment! Many of the characters are dull and some of the promising ones introduced were not developed. Other plotlines were not developed (e.g., Did Todd's daughter find the man she saw on the escalator?).My main complaint, however, is the poor ending. As mentioned by another customer reviewer, it just ends.Maybe the author had to meet his deadline, but any editor knows that it's poor writing form to put a sympathetic character in an unpleasant predicament and end the book without resolution, leaving the reader wondering \\"what happened to --------?\\"If the plan is to print a sequel I will certainly skip it. If I hadn't read the The Number One Ladies Detective Agency I would skip all the books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"44 Scotland Street","review":"It's always a privilege to read the work of one adept at English and the serial chapters leave me anxious to move on to the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and uninvolving","review":"I couldn't even finish this one. Although I love Smith's \\"Ladies Detective Agency\\" series, \\"\\"44 Scotland Street\\" has none of the charm and personality of those books.Partly, I think, is the locale. I have a preference for either historical mysteries or those set in remote, unusual or \\"exotic\\" locations. Somehow, an apartment in contemporary Scotland just doesn't cut it (the Highlands, maybe....).Despite my enjoyment of his previous series, I've always felt that Smith's main talent isn't really his literary skills but in his ability to develop interesting characters and express his love of Botswana. Without those unusual characters and place, the result is a dull, \\"ordinary\\" book.I may end up judging some books unfairly since I don't see them through to the end unless I'm really taken by them. But there are just too many really good books to spend time on the second rate ones. This book just didn't make the cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, but...","review":"...this experiment did not work. I've read two of his other books, and they were a light, cute diversion -- not great literature, but entertainment. This novel isn't even that. The plot frequently goes nowhere, and has many loose ends that he never ties. The writing is trite, the observations pedestrian and cliched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly Interesting","review":"This book was just okay for me. There is a quirky cast of characters who offer a glimpse of life in Edinburgh. The book is lighthearted, whimsical, and unfortunately, quite often... boring. I found the book amusing at times and McCall Smith did have a few keen observations on the human condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"a delight in every way","review":"My spouse and I listened to this during a 2000 mile road trip this past week and it was indeed delightful. Beautifully read [this was the UK version, I don't know if it was re-recorded for the US market] with expert characterization and inflection, we started to refer to the protagonists--especially 5 year old Bertie--as if they were real companions. We found that the serial nature of the original book had produced a steady flow of small cliffhangers that kept us hooked across 5 CDS. Beware--you will read reviews that state 'nothing happens' in this story. While no-one dies and the terrorists have yet to strike at Edinburgh, nothing could be further from the truth. Of course, if you want shoot-em-up action and underwear flying in all directions, then read [or listen to] some lowest-common-denominator dreck like Dan Brown. But if you have the patience, imagination and brain power to listen, enjoy and savor the nuances, then this is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Mr McCall Smith have an urgent bill to pay?","review":"I've only just found out this was written as a newspaper serial. It now makes some sense. My initial impression was that it was dashed off to pay for a new sofa/yacht/Renoir for Mr McCall Smith, who had a weekend spare to knock it out. Knowing it's a newspaper serial it's more likely he cranked out each day's instalment while he had his morning coffee/tea/whatever.A handful of interesting, but only two-and-a-bit dimensional, characters do stuff. Some of this stuff has consequences - which you will predict with uncanny accuracy.There are some nicely-drawn scenes, and you get a slight sense of living in Edinburgh (well, part of Edinburgh). But basically sod-all of any interest occurs. And then it just stops.This is the first book I've read of his - having heard people rave about the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series. I don't really feel like reading any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Series - Scotland Street","review":"I was disappointed in this series. I had read the entire series of the Number One Ladies Detective Agency and loved the simple but charming prose. I had also read the entire Irregular Portuguese Verbs series and loved it for the witty arrogance of the main character. I was amazed that these two series had been written by the same author, since they were so diametrically different in their writing style. Therefore it was with great hopes that I bought the Scotland Street series. But I found it so utterly pretentious with characters who throw latin phrases around like colloqualisms and who seem altogether too clever to ever ingratiate themselves to the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dull story about dreary malcontents","review":"Based upon my enjoyment of McCall Smith's \\"No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency\\" series, I bought all four of the '44 Scotland Steet' books. I don't care to finish the first book, '44 Scotland Street', and plan to return the other three books. I have never seen such a dreary collection of mal-contented characters gathered in one story, and don't even care what happens to them all. If I can't care about at least one of them, then I can't care about the story's outcome. The author shows no resemblance whatsoever to the one who wrote about the noble characters and humorous daily life that I came to appreciate while reading the \\"No. 1..\\". series. There is no sizzle, no tension, no appreciation for the author or his characters, no timing. PASS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just 'ok'","review":"I started reading 'The no.1 Ladies Detective Agency' but could never really get into it. I liked the idea of this book however so decided to give the author another go. Sadly, although the book has some funny moments (Bertie's tantrums!)it never really gripped me. I love Scotland but am not familar enough with the places and slang terms so felt i missed out on the 'insider' comments. The book also has a very poor ending which leaves lots of loose ends and you end up thinking 'hold on what happened to..?' and 'what was the point of?'.On the whole it is ok and i imagine if you are familar with Edinburgh you would enjoy it more than i did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilariously entertaining","review":"This novel deserves 5 stars.I was given 44 Scotland Street as a Christmas gift. I assumed it was a \\"detective story\\" given the author's previous well known work. I was very pleasantly surprised to find the book was like nothing else I have ever read. I have lived in Scotland and have visited Jenner's department store in Edninburgh, as well as some of the other landmarks mentioned in the book. I can assure readers who have not been to Edinburgh that the descriptions and the characterizations are very real, for example, the rivalry between Edinburgh and Glasgow.Although it may be difficult for non-Scots to fully appreciate certain elements of the book, the characters can be found practically anywhere and in any time. For example, the narcissistic Bruce and the class-conscious Sasha.I would highly recommend this book to anyone and especially homesick Scots. I can hardly wait for the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged Goods","review":"I can't believe a bookseller would in good faith sell this book on tape. The disks were damaged and un\\"readable\\". I expect a few skips here and there on any used CD but this was ridiculous and it started on the 2nd track and continued almost without a break. Frankly I have little or no idea what this book was about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cozy and Quaint","review":"There is something about McCall's Smith's writing that brings a smile to my face. Having read all of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency books and adored them, I was hoping to find this series appealing as well and I certainly do. Meeting these Scottish characters is like sitting down to share a cup of coffee with a group of friends. Normally, the tangents some of these characters take would feel irrelevant and make me feel rather impatient, but I was willing to ramble anywhere in the city and cover any subject with these folks. I just wanted to spend time with them. I like Pat too. She's a realistic, sympathetic character and I look forward to sharing new experiences with her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love the author's \\"Ladies #1 Detective Agency\\" series, so I grabbed this book to read while waiting in airports while on holiday. I found the book nearly as tedious as just waiting. I finished it because I read quickly, and I kept hoping it would improve. It didn't. Many of the characters are downright annoying, and several of the storylines are never resolved. The book just ends. Maybe this was better as a serial, as a book it doesn't satisfy. I'm tackling \\"Portugese Irregular Verbs\\" next: I will save my money for the next in the \\"Ladies\\" series and visit the library to sample his other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"I love to read and was interested in a story set in Edinburgh. I found the characters not worth following and the story even less so. With nothing else new to read on my Kindle, I kept going back, hoping for something interesting to happen. Nothing ever did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, slow, and simplistic","review":"This author's books have been recommended to me, but if this is a true example of his talent I won't waste time reading more. This book was boring. The characters were simplistic and predictable. The story dragged along, not really holding my interest. I kept waiting for something to tie it all together but that never happened. It's a slice of a few very mundane lives. The writing is so simplistic that I suspect its target audience must be 12 years old. Yawn....."},{"rating":"2","title":"44 Scotland Street","review":"I love this series and purchased this for my sister so that we could talk about it. She likes McCall Smith's gentle style as I do and so it was a successful purchase. It arrived in good shape and very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"An uplifting read","review":"What a thoroughly good egg Alexander McCall Smith appears to be. 44 Scotland Street, like every other book of his I've read, is positively bursting with generosity and good will. It's funny too. And the bite-sized chapters, never more than a few pages long, make for an easy and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"Robert Ian Mackenzie brings \\"44 Scotland Street\\" to life! The novel itself is quite enjoyable - a wry, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but not unkind look at Edinburgh. McCall Smith is as skilled at capturing the genteel side of Edinburgh life as Ian Rankin is at capturing the seamier side of it.McCall Smith is generous in endowing his protagonists with flaws and human failings. But he is an enormously kind narrator, I found myself empathizing with each one of his characters and the interesting situations they find themselves in.I listened to the audiobook while traveling through Scotland and I must admit that Mackenzie's reading was truly outstanding. His mastery over his tone and diction added considerably to my enjoyment of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book -- Isabel Dalhousie, begone!","review":"I'm not really sure why I even picked this book up (or the other books in the series, all of which are just as fun as this one). I couldn't get interested in the #1 Ladies Detective Agency series, and I loathed Isabel Dalhousie, the smug, boring heroine of the Sunday Philosophy Club \\"mysteries\\".But this book is really a delight. The pacing of 44 Scotland Street is very deft and the characters are an interesting mix. I enjoyed reading about each one of them, the good and the bad, the weak and the strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little different book","review":"44 Scotland StreetThis was a different kind of story from the ones I have read by this author, but it was interesting and fun, once I got into the personalities of the various interwoven characters.It ended with open possibilities, so that I am sure there will be a sequel to the story.

The acting is excellent. I was particularly surprised with Tom Cruise.The only problem I had with the film is that it fails to mention the innocent civilians who have died at the hands of American imperialist agression.

In my experience with this product, I would say that it does not produce the intended results. But the same can be said for many herbs. Hell, sometimes even a strong cup of coffee won't wake you up in the morning. Point being, results are going to vary from individual to individual, but if you are really interested in this stuff, I would do a Google search for the website for the company that is based in Hawaii that also makes this stuff.

Despite stopping use of the cream, my face then swelled up to such an extent I had to take several days off work.

The pump is cool, as no light getting into the product is ideal. The feel of the creme is lite and silky, and within two minutes I felt a noticable plump coolness on my thigh. The vitamin k is to help with those little spider veins so I am excited to see less redness after 15 minutes. Not a lot, but enough thatwe notice, so I believe it will only get better after repeat applications.

I put it on and waited several hours before I looked in the mirror. I noticed that my undereye circles were suddenly more pronounced. (To be clear--I wasn't anticipating immediate results but was checking for any sort of reaction.) So I went online and read a few more reviews. I must have not been paying close attention before, as I did not see all the reviews noting increased redness and allergic reactions. I went immediately and rubbed it off. My skin has a slight redness but no itching or bumps. The area around my eyes looks very sensitive, as though I've been crying and rubbing the sensitive skin around my eye.I am returning this tomorrow to the local organic grocery store and purchasing Vitamin K capsules instead. Too weary of this product; I will not try this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for use around eyes!","review":"I started using this product about a month ago or 6 weeks ago, once per day. Approximately a week ago I noticed my eyelids stung a bit when I applied the creme, so I decided to discontinue using it for a while to give me skin a break. After not using the product for over a week, I woke up this morning with eyes so swollen I could barely open them. The skin all around my eyes is red, itchy, dry and swollen. This morning I tried cold compress and Benadryl, with no results, so I had to go to Urgent Care this afternoon. The Dr. said Vitamin K should never be used on the sensitive skin around the eyes, that any potency of it will eventually cause over sensitization and a flare up like mine. He gave me an Rx for a steroid cream, but says it may take many days for the redness and swelling to go down. It's a shame Jason doesn't put a warning on the bottle about not using on the skin surrounding your eyes, in fact they advertise it to be used to lighten under eye circles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Diminish Broken Capillaries...","review":"I bought this cream thinking it would get rid of the two red spots on my nose (broken cappilaries) or greatly reduce the appearance of them, but it did not do anything at at with consistant use and it discolored my nose an orangish color.

'The Perennial Enigma' is a CD reissue from a 1973 lp that I never even knew about prior to hearing this title. Best described as British psychedelic. Most memorable tracks here include \\"Get Up And Dance\\", \\"The Farm\\", the awesome sounding \\"All Down The Road\\", the inspiring \\"My Place\\", \\"The Prayer\\" and the tripping \\"Guitar Center On A Saturday Afternoon\\". Personnel: Big Boy Pete (aka Pete Miller) - guitar & vocals, Dave Merrill - keyboards, Sean Silverman - bass, Ray Moseley - tenor sax and Rob Anderson - drums. Recommended for fans of The Troggs, The Herd, Fuzztones and The Easybeats. If you're wanting a add a little-known audio gem to your sacred CD collection, look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great emtional, timeless, and original album.","review":"Life is Pain, is a great musical journey through a wide varieties of emotions.

This album will still sound current in 2020. I have been disappointed my many rock albums I have bought in the last 5 years, but Life is Pain in one of the few albums I will recommend.

Like many dark hair dyes, Naturtint uses p-Phenylenediamine. This is in widespread use and here is what the Environmental Protection Agency has to say about it: p-Phenylenediamine is primarily used as a dye intermediate and as a dye. Acute (short-term) exposure to high levels of p-phenylenediamine may cause severe dermatitis, eye irritation and tearing, asthma, gastritis, renal failure, vertigo, tremors, convulsions, and coma in humans. Eczematoid contact dermatitis may result from chronic (long-term) exposure in humans. In rats and mice chronically exposed to p-phenylenediamine in their diet, depressed body weights, but no other clinical signs of toxicity, were observed in several studies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burning Sensation & Hair loss","review":"Purchased this dye at a health food store for $15.99 believing it was all natural. In the matter of 15 minutes it started burning my scalp. I am suppose to keep this on my head for 30 to 45 minutes because of heavy grays. Rinsed hair, hair felt stripped of its natural oils, was tangled and noticed clumps of hair in my hand and sink. Well thank goodness for the conditioner which took some of the tangles but had to do a second treatment with my coconut oil. Once I was done with my hair project I decided to do a little GOOGLING and unfortunately this product isn't as safe as you might be led to believe. Will not buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"Where to start? First, this hair colro was WAY darker than it suggested.Second, as I rinsed it out my hair felt like straw.

Scent is what I call neutral, it is not unpleasant. Does cover the gray very well, even at the tempels. It is hard to find the right color, will have to experiment. This color came out almost black on me at first, but did lighten a bit and softened. It cost me $16 at HEB. Does change the texture of your hair and tends to dry it out. The change in texture makes your hair appear thicker, but makes it feel kind of wierd too.You might want to use a good quality conditioning treatment often with this hair coloring product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I LOVE this product! It is by far the best hair color I have ever used. There is almost no smell to it. It is so gentle on the hair. My hair felt measurably different in a healthy way after using it. My only advice would be is that the colors are darker than what they say they are. I had heard this ahead of time so I chose the Dark Blonde to get to a light to medium brown shade. It did turn brown like I wanted and eliminated some of the brassiness I had in my hair. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good purchase","review":"I wanted to try this product because I was looking for a non-ammonia permanent product. I have tried Naturcolor and Tints of Nature; both of these have strengths and weaknesses I won't discuss here. Anyhow this brand seemed to have a loyal following that extended for years, so I thought I would try it. It contains monoethanolomine which is still an ammonia but without a smell; it's still a toxic substance. The product had another type of smell which was like wet wool and not very pleasant. The gray didn't cover and the color came out too warm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like This Hair Color Product.","review":"I've been using this color product for a couple of years and it covers gray very well.I have hard to color gray but by just starting with the gray hairs first then waiting a few minutes before coloring the rest of my head I've gotten good coverage most of the time.It does wash out faster them some other hair colors but that may be due to the olive oil and coconut oil that I use to keep my hair from drying out.I wear the light chestnut and that can come out very dark if you leave it in too long but starts to lighten up after the first shampoo.I think this is a good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product! Almost perfect","review":"This is a great product. It completely covered my grays and the color lasted for a very long time. In fact, I think its coverage and color longevity is better than some of the more conventional brands of hair dye (Revlon, Clairol, etc). The sulfate free shampoo that it comes with is probably the best sulfate free shampoo I've ever used. I'm considering buying a larger sized bottle to use in stead of the one I use now. (Sorry, Renpure.)Only two minor drawbacks. Because the color lasts for so long, my roots grew out A LOT before the color faded. I wish the kit came with some way to mix up a smaller amount when you just want to do a small touch up. I'm not enough of a DIY haircoloring expert to measure out the correct amounts myself. Also, the conditioner is a little bit runny and doesn't seem to soak into may hair. I added a few drops of sweet almond oil to my hair while it was still damp as an added moisturizer/conditioner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not cover grey","review":"I really wanted it to work since I can't handle the amonia based color anymore.

What's worse: it's only been 9 days and any new color is completely gone. What's left behind is overly-bleached out looking and damaged. Will never EVER use again.

I started as a dark blonde (7N) and I wanted to go a little lighter for spring so I selected the 9N. It turned my hair red, not strawberry blonde, but brassy reddish. I then got an 8N thinking it would tone it down but no, it stayed brassy red. I then tried the ash to soften the red and low and behold, banana yellow! WHAT!!!!! I emailed the company and they said I need to mix the products so that the tones balance one another and you don't get the red or yellow tint, and yes, you can use it right away. Okay, I combined 8N with 10A - as per email instructions from the company and guess what - YELLOW! BANANA YELLOW!

Not only that, but it left my hair feeling brittle and dry.BTW, this product is labeled as organic. According to the most recent issue of Consumer Reports magazine, there is no such thing as \\"organic\\" when it comes to beauty products.

After a few strand tests, I ended up using three different colors, blended and managed to match my, (rather unusual) color perfectly. Since my hair is long, the extra quantity was not a problem, but, since you can measure out only what you need, touch-ups are not a problem either. The product is extremely gentle, (with red hair comes sensitive skin), not smelly and it lasts for as many as five weeks without fading. I will never, ever use a traditional hair color again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coverage but Messy and Stains Skin","review":"I have been using this product for years now because it leaves my hair healthier than other hair color products and covers the gray nicely. I have paid almost triple the cost of this product at an organic health food store but will definitely order it from Amazon from here on out.The only negative I can think of about this product is that it stains my ears, sides of my face, and along the hairline and I have to scrub hard with soap and water over several days to get the stain off. No matter how careful one is when applying color at home, it's going to come in contact with the skin (and bathroom vanity) at some point. For help their website says to apply vaseline on the skin before applying, and if there is staining, to use ash and lemon juice to remove it. Ash? Really?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely drying","review":"I die my hair the same shade as my natural color just to keep it shiny and get rid of the red tones caused by the sun. This didn't have too bad of a smell and came out the shade I expected, but it was extraordinarily drying. The conditioner it comes with doesn't seem to moisturize at all and even after using other heavy duty masks and moisture treatments, my hair is still struggling to recover. Previously I had been using natural match and natural instincts which I will be going back to. I'd like to go the natural route, but really dislike having straw for hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st time user","review":"As a first time user, i wanted to switch from toxic permanent colors to a natural permanent hair color. My hair had been previously dyed a light red. My natural hair color is dark brown. So, i dyed my hair with Naturtint 5m and here are my results.CONS- Made my hair a lot darker than the picture on the box- Instructions did not address special instructions or tips for previously colored hairPROS- Left my hair soft and shiny- Pretty good smell (a little like licorice)- Less toxic than other products*And heres a tip. If you have medium length hair(or longer) and are coloring for the 1st time, buy 2 boxes insead of 1. Or else you will run out.I gave this product 4 stars because it isn't 100% organic. And im trying to GO GREEN. Other than that, i would recommend it if you want to have a more pleasant dyeing experience since it smelled pretty good. And it didnt have strong hard-to-breathe fumes like most permanent hair dyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked It","review":"This is the first time I bought it from Amazon. I used to buy it from Whole Food. Price definitely is better here, Whole Food sells it for $17+. The product arrived timely, the package did not look in perfect shape but no damage to the product inside. This hair dye works well with my hair. It is gentle, does not make my hair dry, and the result is lasting. I would recommed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"Naturtint Dark Blond worked great on my medium brown hair. Lasts a long time and no funky odors or harsh chemicals. Leaves hair shiny and in good shape. I like to mix wheat germ blonde in with this for hi-lights."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this stuff","review":"I have use a lot of different hair colors but this is the best.

There is no smell and my hair always feels so soft even after a couple of weeks after I've colored it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DESTROYED my hair!","review":"I've used this product twice, after never having colored my hair before. The first time, I used a dark brown color to conceal my grey, and it was successful. The second time, many months later, I used a lighter color. It COMPLETELY destroyed my hair! My hair is now frizzy, regardless of how I style it. Some formerly straight strands appear to be wavy/curly, and it is so brittle and dry that I am afraid to brush it. Obviously, I will never use this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks awful :(","review":"It turned my hair bright yellow! It looks awful so I now have to get it fixed professionally. I followed all of the directions carefully, so I'm not sure why this happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works & No Ammonia, Resorcinol or Parabens","review":"I have been using this hair color for a couple of years. My hair is medium brown and this does get it to blond. However, just like all other hair color formulas, I do have to leave it on a little longer to get to the blond I want (probably 25-30 mins instead of just 20 mins). My hair is not as blond as the girl on the box. However a friend of mine uses this product & her hair is close to the color on the box. She also has been using it for years.The 1* comment claims this is organic. It doesn't claim to be organic, the box says, \\"With Selected Organic Ingredients\\". When going blond, you are REMOVING your natural hair color, other than the sun, I am not aware of any completely natural way of doing this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing dance music","review":"This CD is one of the best CD's to appear on the dance music market in the past ten years.

What I received was a silver non-tilting version of the wall mount. Hello? Did anybody at Sky Box read the order?After following their cumbersome request for refund/exchange process (which would not work correctly on my computer) I was told that they would check inventory for the correct mount and I would be able to exchange for one. Well, come to find out (many, many days later...on my on effort as they never told me anything without me asking for it first) that they did not have the correct mount in stock!

Entertaining","review":"If your looking for a book that's a quick read, light and entertaining...this is it. Some of the stories were a little too avant garde for my tastes but the book, overall, was funny and poignant and insightful.I don't know that I would get his other book, Fraud, but this one was worth the price and the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality book.","review":"I picked up this book right after I saw David Rakoff on The Daily Show. Watching the interview between Jon Stewart and Rakoff, I got the impression (like many of the other reviewers here) that his book would delve deep into the idea of excess and why the world wants more and more of everything. Instead, I found something just as wonderful, but more about the humor than the intellect.Albeit his essays are witty and smart, I found that they concentrated more on an anecdote than they did an actually comparative study. However, I was less than disappointed.Some chapters I found dull and devoid of interest, but still, the others made up completely for it.All in all, a good book if you're looking for something witty and smart. I enjoy his litterary style, a sort of snarky, I-know-I'm-right douchebaggery. And it's true; he's right."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth Will Set You Free!","review":"In \\"Don't Get Too Comfortable\\" author David Rakoff shines a light on the weirdness that is life in this modern world. Perhaps because he is originally from another country (Canada), he is able to see the strange in the ordinary. Perhaps he just has very good eyes for the absurd. Perhaps both are true. Regardless, the book is very, very funny.For some reason, other reviewers have compared him to David Sedaris-perhaps because both are funny, occasionally heard on NPR, and gay. Other than that, I fail to see much similarity. However, out of a sense of duty, I will now compare them for you: Sedaris makes you laugh about his strange life and family, while Rakoff's humor is more about the absurdity of what is now ordinary.Rakoff's book is quick and entertaining although his prose gets bogged down by the occasional literary pretension of the overly self-conscious. There are lots of chuckles and a few belly laughs. It's a great airplane read. Buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Get Too Comfortable","review":"I couldn't get past the first chapter. It seems Mr. Rakoff got his American Citizenship to slam America. I thought it was supposed to be funny. I'm not a fan of the Bush administration at all, but to have someone from Canada writing about how he regrets gaining his American citizenship.....waste of ink! I just couldn't bring myself to read anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"I have never felt so ripped off by blurbs for a book. This book is advertised as a satirical look at some of the indignites of modern life. Instead, it is the mean, cynical whining of a person who feels he is superior to the reader.He thinks that all conservatives are Nazis and gay bashers.Mr. Rakoff....I really dont care what you do in your own life.I could like you or dislike you if you were gay OR straight.Just because you are so unhappy, don't perpetrate yourself on the world in the guise of a judge of modern society.I was so offended and bored by this book that I threw it in the recycling bin rather than donate it to the local library as I always do with books that are not keepers.This book made me almost as unhappy reading it as Mr. Rakoff is with his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute at times, but mostly boring","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I got the audio version. I was expecting witty commentary on America's consumer culture and self-obessive nature. What I got was long, meandering stories about things like midnight treasure hunts in NYC that were anti-climatic, and the mildly amusing tale of the author applying for U.S. citizenship. It had potential, but just never got rolling. His penchant for being self-desparaging and sounding melancholy also got old very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Funny As It Could Be","review":"Rakoff was a highly depressed man, and this book overflows with that energy. Unfortunately, it comes out neither as funny as I think he hoped, nor as profound as he hoped. It is merely a collection of essays about his experiences in New York, which don't seem to cohere or accomplish anything such as amuse, inform, inspire, or move one to think. They're well written, but to what end?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What exactly was the point of this?","review":"Not good. I actually stopped reading and returned it to the bookstore about halfway through. Most of it was just meaningless; I'd reach the end of a chapter and wonder \\"What was the point of that?\\" While there were definitely funny parts, they were too few and far between. I expected witty social commentary, but all I got was pointless anecdotes and pretentious language. If I could describe the book in one word, it would be \\"self-indulgent\\"; I suspect that Rakoff is the type of person who talks just to hear the sound of his own voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Fraud.","review":"I was so excited when I saw David Rakoff was publishing another book. Fraud was, to me, mindblowingly clever and funny. While I thought the first story, \\"Love it or Leave It\\", in Don't Get Too Comfortable was as well-written and hysterical as all of the stories in Fraud, I didn't think the rest measured up. If you've read Fraud, don't expect more of the same from DGTC.

Four stars because it doesn't hold your attention like most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as much like D. Sedaris as some you think","review":"A funny book-not fall on the floor and laugh till you pass out Jon Strewart funny- but humorous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comparable to Sedaris? Not likely!","review":"I read this book because it was recommended to fans of David Sedaris and Augusten Burroughs. However, Rakoff should not even be put on the same playing field as either of those brilliant authors.I was intrigued to read this book because of the reviews on the back cover - I really thought that I would get an outsiders view of Americans and our over-indulgent ways. However, I was mistaken. Yeah, Rakoff writes about getting citizenship and working in Miami - but the reader never really understands why he's doing all of this. The stories aren't funny because it feels like Rakoff is forcing them to be.For example, Rakoff plainly states that he went to work for 3 days in Miami. It's not like he just chanced an encounter there and funny things happened...he made up his mind to go there, and barely stayed long enough to even get a good story.All in all, I was happy when this book was over and I think that you will be, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loooved it!","review":"As others have referenced, if you like David Sedaris, you'll love David Rakoff--who does have a slightly bitchier slant on things which I love.

This one isn't. Instead, it just comes across as pissy. The first few dozen pages or so have some amusing little vignettes, but after a while, one realizes that these stories go nowhere. Reminds me of another dud I recommend readers avoid: Red Lobster, White Trash and the Blue Lagoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"My husband recieved this book for Xmas. I started reading it and had trouble putting it down. My family got tired of me quoting it on our trip in Paris, so much so that they are all trying to read it at the same time. I love his off the wall twists and point of view on the the different subjects. OK so some of it is bitchy, which makes it even funnier!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The tone makes it unreadable","review":"I've been a long time fan of Rakoff; his poetry is absolute genius. But I had a very difficult time making my way through the vitriol in this book. He writes more like a political pundit than a comedian and the tone completely turned me off. I couldn't make it more than halfway through the book. If you enjoy Rakoff's contributions to public radio, consider Sedaris or Auslander, instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Funny","review":"I did not enjoy this book. I gave up waiting for the \\"belly laughs\\" promised in the description about 1/2 way through. Maybe I don't get it, but this felt more like a collection of rambling diary entries than humor. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really tried to like it, but come on already","review":"Rakoff comes off as trying to be a little too clever for his own good. His sentences are loaded with ten-dollar words that don't pay off. If it's wit you want, stick with Sedaris or Burroughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book tries too hard","review":"I was really looking forward to settling in with this book and having a good laugh. Instead, what I found was a pretentious book where the author tried way too hard to be funny . . . and very little of it actually was. The author definitely has a way of turning a phrase in an original way, but you cannot hang an entire chapter on one cute phrase. Reading this book was just way too much effort and not nearly fun enough. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title is deceiving","review":"I thought this would be amusing but it wasn't. I rented the audio CD and returned it after the 2nd disc. Too much whining, not enough humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great beginning ending uncomfortably","review":"I am writing this review 10 minutes after finishing the book. Rakoff has a great writing style, impeccable vocabulary and attention to details. At the beginning the book carries you away deep inside Rakoff's life events enriched with spicy humor as tasty as the \\"sea minerals from the crispy cubes of salt on the hot potato.\\" As one continues with the second half of the book the humor is fainting and the content gets monotonously populated with details. Undoubtedly, it is one of the better best sellers available at the time if you can rank any of them as best sellers. I liked the identity of the book, the Canadian spirit in it. It is straight forward, no police involved, no secret codes, or promiscuous humans involved in wild orgy -all famous American themes - I still wander how it became a best seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of hate and negatisim.","review":"Why does this guy live in the US since he does nothing but rip on our country.

They last pretty much as long as untreated strings. The wound strings do last a while, however. I don't see the point, though, if you need to replace the plain strings often.Sound-wise, I can't comment, as I don't have magic ears and don't really hear much difference between string sets. After throwing your guitar through different pedals and signal processors and amps, does it really matter, anyway?That said, if longevity is what you're seeking, have a look at Elixirs. If not, stick to cheap, untreated strings.

A very interesting read the author details the struggle to form the US Army Air Service from almost nothing to a fighting force that betters the Imperial German Air Service in less than 2 years. The struggle between the Regulars, Reserves, ground and flying officers as well as the ivy leaguers and those from the working class shows the inner workings of the Air Service taking shape in France. This struggle is overlooked or glossed over in the memoirs of the participants that I have read. If you have ever served in a Squadron or Battalion (or higher) you will find this hard to put down. A professional's look at the beginnings (wooden propellers and iron men) of the US Air Force."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Plan?","review":"Rehash and no real explanation.

Showing lots of skin does not make anything good, especially when it's blended with the incredibly didactic and lethargic Cavil (blargh-- there were multiple scenes involving Cavil with the cylon ladies that made my skin crawl). There are no new clips of Starbuck-- her scar continues to go unexplained. I certainly enjoyed the webisodes featuring Gaeta a lot more (and that's not saying much). This is told in a comic book shooting style where no scene (except those with Cavil) is permitted to play out. Don't expect this to reveal any big secrets, show a particularly new Cylon view, depict more than 2 minutes of any of the colonies before the attack. In fact, don't expect anything at all and don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battlestar Galactica The Plan","review":"After watching the series, which I thought was excellent, \\"The Plan\\" was a big disappointment.

The recap is given through the eyes of a cylon which gave a somewhat unique take on things, but if this was a regular episode on tv I would have turned it off. This was so boring and had unnecessary nudity (male too). An utter waste of money and I agree with another reviewer that this was just released to milk fans of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Your Money Or Your Time","review":"This DVD is a cheap ploy to squeeze more money from fans who were deprived of a decent show beginning in Season 3. There is only one major revelation here -- and that happens in the first 5 minutes. There is no need to to purchase this DVD. It is simply a re-stringing of key scenes through the first 281 \\"days\\" or so of the show, with a few new scenes thrown in that add little or no value. Ron Moore and the executives at Universal should be shot out a launch tube on the Galactica set for this. If I could return it, I would.

The series finally was one of the best TV shows I've even seen. The money I spent on \\"The Plan\\" I can never get back. To say this \\"movie\\" is a cut and paste puke fest is not doing it justice. If you saw the series then you saw 90% of this movie. None of the main characters were even in it. Or should I say in it much. The admiral had maybe three minutes of \\"new\\" shots and the chief was the big winner with about 7 minutes of new footage. 6 had a few gratuitous half naked shots so that might be good enough for some but not me. There was also several other gratuitous naked breast and butt shots so hide the kids eyes. Cylon No.1 Cavil was the big star and not very big at that. I'm going to re-watch the series finally so that episode will again be my final memory of BSG and I'll try and purge \\"The Plan\\" from memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plan? What Plan??","review":"I know! The plan was to cash in on a lot of unsuspecting BSG fans who were forced to spend a lot of money for a clip show, made up from first season episodes. I am sure that SciFi thought it was a genius plan, but as a fan I have to say that it was just plain rotten. Maybe, just maybe the story looked actually decent on paper but it so didn't work on screen. There was no coherent plot line. The movie simply jumped from episode to episode and introduced new characters that we had never seen before. When the plan of the Cylons was revealed, I had to say that I was very disappointed. Not only because anyone who has ever read Milton will recognize it right away but also because it was childish and lame.To any fan who thinks about buying the movie: DON'T. It is a waste of money, it will add NOTHING to the BSG story and you will not enjoy watching \\"The Plan\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another one star review for The Plan","review":"I first watched \\"The Plan\\" on DVD a few months after it was released. I was completely disappointed and vowed never to watch it again. But I just finished rewatching all four seasons of the main show a few days ago, so I decided to give \\"The Plan\\" a second chance.I'm both sorry and not sorry that I did. I am sorry that I watched it again because I can't get those two hours of my life back, but I am not sorry because at least I did TRY to like it.It's just not good.You know, I started writing a more in-depth review, but I deleted it because to finish it I would have had to spend yet more of my life thinking about \\"The Plan.\\"Even if you are a hard core BSG fan, you do not have to watch \\"The Plan\\" for your life to be complete.

I thought it would describe what events led the Cylons to dream up a \\"plan\\" and attack the humans. However, it only depicted selected events from Seasons 1 and 2 of BSG from a different point of view. Although some plot points were interesting and there was bit more character development, it was hardly worth making a 2 hour movie. Not to mention I thought the title was misleading. SPOILER ALERT. It gave the impression that the Cylons had some other plan than the annihilation of the human race. But no, that was the big plan.

But this was such a poorly written and confusing mish mosh that I couldn't even finish it. My brother & I were so excitied to watch it and we both absolutely HATED it. What a waste of time and old clips!

Caprica will be a hit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time, very dissapointing!","review":"I sat through what amounted to a 2 season clip show. Similar to the second half of season 4, they couldnt even get Lucy Lawless to make an appearance, not even stock footage and its supposedly the cylons story? They dont reveal the 13th cylon or even mention him. The events are implausible, they added Grain to already grainy stock footage so half of it is double grainy... WOW, I just wasted 2hrs of my life that should have been amazing. And they stop at the end of season 2, so is there The Plan pat 2 coming?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Moderate to mediocre","review":"I saw this on TV and removed it from my wish-list after watching it. It's always fun to watch anything from the BSG realm, but the story on this one was disappointing. I fully expected to see a masterful plan orchestrated by the Cylon agents on Caprica. Instead, I just saw one more thread of the BSG story that filled in a few details I didn't know. There just wasn't much to it. Plus, you'll feel like a little bit of the mystery of the whole storyline is sucked out. The Cylons seem a bit less scary, more human, less machine, and generally lacking direction. Bottom line: watch it once; don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"I thought it would be a good movie, instead it was like watching out takes from the show. Disappointed to say the least. It was blocky and thrown together, not much consistancy to it. I will be more watchful the next time there is a \\"new\\" movie out after a series closes. It seemed to take pieces from some of the better shows on the series and tape them together, it was nice to see the parts but it was kind of like an \\"I have been here before\\" feeling.It would have been better if they released it at a cheaper rate, like the best of Battlestar Galactica movie, maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a rehash...","review":"I was very disappointed with this DVD. Instead of a new movie it is merely a re-editing of the series from the point of view of the Cylons. There is very little new footage and what there is are all dialogue scenes. In other words 'cheap' scenes. This reminds me of the 'clip' shows of old sitcoms in the 80's. New footage is merely there to bridge gaps between clips of old episodes. I loved the Caprica DVD and the regular series but this is just a shady way of getting more cash from old episodes.Not worth the money. Not even close."},{"rating":"1","title":"from an avid BG fan - this is a menage of clips from the cutting room floor","review":"Wow, having just finished watching the series form beginning to end, I was thirsting for more. Well fans, this is not the place to get it. This is terrible. This is an exercise of how you take cutting room throw-aways and stitch them together with a storyline manufactured to accomplish the weaving. A bunch of cutting room clips intertwinced with a few new original scenes filmed to stitch this together. After seeing it, I wish I had not because what was left to the imagination before was better then this \\"plan.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessary and inconsequential","review":"\\"Battlestar Galactica: The Plan\\" is a story that's both, now that the series has come to a definite conclusion, unnecessary and inconsequential. The main character appears to be Cavell, of all \\"people,\\" the most radical of the Cylons. Cut scenes featuring him and the other Cylons are interspersed with footage from the series to basically try to explain what they were up to during the human exodus. This may have worked out as a 2-hour special prior to the ending of the series, but even then I doubt fans would have been much more pleased with it than they are now. It's an add-on after the fact, and feels a bit non-canon as well. I'm a huge fan of both the original series and the remake, but i just could not get into this movie which doesn't compare to \\"Razer\\" at all. No matter how much of a fan you are of BG, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not horrible...just not so good","review":"The Plan wasn't horrible. It just wasn't that good. If you are a BSG fan, you'll probably buy this dvd like I did. But, don't expect alot out of it. It will give you a slight BSG fix.Prequels just don't work well. The story felt jumpy, rushed, and disjointed...like a collection of deleted scenes thrown together with some new stuff. Some of the special effects were even shaky. Way below the BSG standard.Without going into specifics, and (gasp) placing spoilers in this review, a few small questions were resolved. For example, the person who met with Six at the fountain. However, there are no big revelations or reveals in this movie. Just lots of Cavil and Anders with a little Six thrown in.In summary, you could skip The Plan and not miss anything.p.s. I heartily disagree with reviewers who say The Plan is better than Razor. Razor is head and shoulders better than this mediocre attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly Incomprehensible","review":"There is no Cylon articulation of the Plan here. There are no philosophical underpinings from the Cylon's perspective. Instead there are outtakes, footage from the original series, and a back drop plot that is nearly incomprehensible. New characters are introduced which have nothing to do with the original series, nor do they advance the plot. In one scene the timeline is incorrect with that twerpy scientist being on the Galactica before he was actually rescued from Caprica. Avoid this at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plan? What Plan?","review":"oh my god.....what kind of skin job makes a plan like this. some don't even know they are cylons? why would you do that. seems like the moral to this story is like every other. a house divided cannot stand. is that what happened here. a plan to erase humans from the universe - only to be stopped by love. i hope that's not what this was. i'll go and watch some action film where someone on the other side decides to fall in love with our hero and help destroy the villian. maybe humans should love their creations - seems like that's how we lost our planet to those damned dirty apes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glorified clip show","review":"I suppose sitting over drinks the idea of retelling the first couple of seasons of BSG from the Cylon POV was a good one, especially when they found out they could use some new material containing nudity. The realization of this dream, though, is just a warmed-over clip show featuring pointless scenes of (largely) third-tier cast members failing utterly to provide a coherent narrative. More damningly, it contradicts the series in key places. Just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much pr0n, too little content","review":"Although it shows an interesting perspective regarding a couple points--such as that the original goal being the recovery of the Final Five, and the Four's storyline and the discussion between Four's widow and Chief Tyrol--I would not recommend it. It seems like only 60% new material, and the rest is like a summary documentary to show you what happened in the first 2 seasons. It's not worth the money, and the nudity is completely pointless. Razor was also \\"not rated\\", but it was clean. But with Edward James Olmos' direction on Caprica and The Plan, I have to say I'm never going to buy a straight-to-DVD BSG movie again. If a movie is made for SciFi channel or for the theaters, then it might be ok. But this is not something you can watch with your family."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Plan comes up short","review":"Watched every episode of BSG and own the entire series on DVD. The Plan comes up short. This is a movie where new scenes are edited in with scenes from the series. For me it seemed like it skipped around from even to event, with Cavil lurking in the background or speaking one on one with another character in a dark room, making his plans that never seem to work out as well as intended. It had a weird disjointed quality. I didn't feel the new scenes added anything beyond what had already happened in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless..","review":"I lived and breath BSG for five seasons but this movie was a complete waste of time. It's a rehash of things that happened during the five years. In fact I think 50% of the movie is lifted from the show.If you are new to BSG do not buy this or even rent it. You'll be completely loss. The movie jumps from scene to scene without much meaning or reason. We find out that Number one is even sicker when he murders a little boy. This movie was just a complete waste of two hours of my life.I think I would have rather seen how they got along after coming to Earth then this.This movie adds nothing new. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skips around way too much.","review":"This thing skips around way too much to be entertaining. I suppose that the ADHD generation would enjoy it, but for those sound of mind, it skips around way too much. I watched the entire Battlestar Galactica(BG) series and this wasn't really a compliment to the series at all. I felt like it was mostly clips pieced together from the series along with some very short skits that they threw in to fill the story gaps. It really isn't worth $14 because it doesn't really tell any more than you would have already known at the end of the BG series. And for those who have never watched BG, \\"The Plan\\" will make absolutely no sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so","review":"I remember being very enthusiastic about watching this back-story spinoff movie. But I don't think it was worth all the hype. I found that the back story didn't add anything to the existing story, and actually created some confusion about the main BG plot lines. Save your shekels for something more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"non-essential, but still enjoyable","review":"So The Plan gets a lot of hate, but I don't think it's really warranted. What basically goes on here are scenes from the 1st two seasons of Battlestar Galactica are revisited and then taken further in depth from the Cylons', mostly Cavil's, point of view. Nothing earth shattering is going on here, but die hard fans of the series should enjoy this. I also appreciated the craft of how seamlessly the new material is woven in with the regular series footage."},{"rating":"1","title":"No creativity","review":"Boring to the point of death, adds nothing relevant to the previous story, what a disappointment !"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Movie - Terrible Blu-ray","review":"Battlestar was an outstanding series ... too bad those who product and market Battlestar are out to destroy it.Cylons, perhaps? The Plan is an OK movie that does fill in some of the back story of Battlestar ... Gene Stockwell doesa great job. BUT, the blu-ray quality is terrible. Fuzzy and grainy one moment, crystal clear the next.Wow. Way to ruin a another Battlestar offering. First, you cannot buy Battlestar per season in blu-ray.Next, the full series in blu-ray is badly packaged and seems like it is targeting dumb 12 year olds, not those intelligentviewers who loved the series (and will watch it numerous times). Now, the badly produced The Plan blu-ray. Really, it's Cylons: Only concerned with the money Machine not with humanities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I love the new BSG but this was the worst movie that I have seen in a long while. It was just put together from a bunch of bad clips that did not make it into the original show. Do not waste your time with this. Razor was much better btw."},{"rating":"2","title":"For BSG fans only","review":"First off, you should only see this DVD after you have already watched seasons 1-4 of the main series, since it will tell you who the 12 Cylon models are. This DVD is not really a movie, it's more of a series of scenes which fill in various blanks of the first two seasons. Then we get two new short plotlines, one involving a number Four and one involving two number Ones. It seems to me the purpose of these is to show that no one in the BSG universe is totally good or totally evil, not even the number Ones, since we get to see a contrast between the \\"bad\\" One which seems to be the mastermind, and the \\"good\\" One down on Caprica.When you discover what \\"the Plan\\" is, you may very well be justifiably disappointed. \\"What about Hera? What about New Caprica?\\" Well, look at it this way: if they started each episode with \\"AND THEY HAD A PLAN, BUT THEIR PLAN GOT SCREWED UP AND NOW THEY'RE JUST WINGING IT\\" it would have been more honest, but could you take the show seriously?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dean Stockwell is Great--SPOILER ALERT","review":"When the series began, I was a voracious fan. When it ended, I was glad. \\"The Plan\\" doesn't add much to the series, and while there is some action, there is also much of the soul-searching that dragged the series into the abyss of sentimentality. Lots of this movie is rehashed from the first season, with some new footage focusing on Dean Stockwell's character, Number One. But the movie also doesn't jibe with the series. At the beginning of the film, we see Stockwell and other cylons walking among the as-yet-unresurrected Final Five before the strike on Caprica. In the series, though, they did not know who the final five were, not at first. They sought to discover their identity just as eagerly as the humans did.Stockwell, Olmos, and McDonnell were what was best in this series. It's good to see Stockwell get center stage here."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Plan","review":"Very unclear about any plan. Nothing more than a compilation of clips from the series. Do not recommend, very disappointing compared to the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Closer the Series","review":"This was a pretty decent closer to the series. I just wish they could have explained a little more of some of the actions of the Cylons like the one where Calli Tyrol is ejected out of the airlock by Tory Foster. Other than that I hope we see more Battlestar Gallactica in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of a good thing, is a bad thing","review":"This proves the old adage that too much of a good thing is a bad thing. This story would be better served to BSG super hardcore fans in novel form. While I appreciate being able to see it, I am not impressed with the acting, cinematography, and score. I think this would have been better as a filler 2 part episode in between the long wait of season 4 and season 4.5. Part of the reason I say this is plain economics. It's content is worth something about $4-$6 and not the $15-17 most retailers want."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding companion to the series","review":"Some of these ratings make no sense, as if the people rating this never watched the show.Excellent companion to the series, which will make you rethink many of the scenes from past seasons. Don't be surprised if BSG marathons are in your future."},{"rating":"2","title":"My least favorite Galactica entry.","review":"The Cylon attack has failed to wipe out humanity. There are 2 Cylon leaders with differing opinions on what to do about this unexpected turn of events. This movie is pretty good. It's cool to have a new perspective on things. The conflict within the Cylon ranks is awesome. Even though this is my least favorite Galactica entry, it's still an amazing movie. If you want to complete you Galactica collection you have to get this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What plan?","review":"Maybe I just had higher expectations than was reasonable, but I found this to be a terribly disjointed collage of individual moments intended to fill in gaps of certain characters and scenes from BSG. There was no symmetry to it at all. It focused largely on the lives of the 5 'parent' cylons during and after the attack, and also on the failed plan of the cylons to eradicate the human race in one sweeping blow. (that was 'The Plan' btw, destroy humanity, like we didnt know that). The Plan having failed we see the cylons trying to move forward with their hunt for humanity.I was hoping for a more comprehensive fill-in-the-blanks type of story like Razor, which did a great job telling the story of the Pegasus. This wasnt a coherent story as much as it was a series of short cut-scenes pasted together. I expected better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiter, please return this to the chef.","review":"Sort of like one of those sitcoms where they keep doing \\"remember when\\" flashbacks, 80-90% of this seems to be old content with some stuff thrown in. Unfortunately the new stuff they threw in made me like the series as a whole less.Sometimes mystery is better than mystery explained in boring fashion. I could only put up with the first 30%-40% before I quit watching.I was very happy with the series aside from the finale and one other episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I had expected this to be a bridge between \\"Caprica\\" and the beginning of the Cylon war, but it is nothing of the kind. It is just a condensed version of the series, and appears to use much of the original footage. A person who has not already viewed the series would not be likely to understand it, and a person who has seen it has no need to see it again. Two thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgrace to BSG","review":"Sometime toward the end of Season 3, the showrunners of the new BSG had started to lose track of what they were doing; season 4 saw the series painfully collapse under the weight of its own mythology, with the writers unable to come up with a more satisfying conclusion to the story than \\"God did it and the characters are angels\\". \\"The Plan\\" is the recycled vomit of that mythology, explaining things that were better left unexplained while failing to explain the things that really needed to be clarified. And, as can be expected from a group of people who had completely lost track of what they were doing, it contradicts previous canon. If the Cyclons' \\"Plan\\" was little more than \\"exterminate humanity\\", then why did the phrase \\"And they have a plan\\" continue to appear during the opening for season 3, during which the Cylons wanted to peacefully coexist with humanity and find Earth? All of this, plus a total lack of emotional depth, make \\"The Plan\\" a disgrace to the new BSG."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cutting room floor remake, little originality, choppy.","review":"First let me state I love almost anything Battlestar Galactica. This \\"movie\\" seems to be a cutting room floor remake, with little originality. It's a prequel to the new series, but intermixes sections, using material throughout much of the series. I found it choppy and erratic. The title should have been \\"We need a Plot Plan!\\" Skip this unless your really desperate for a Battlestar Galactica fix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money.","review":"This was very disappointing in every way. DO NOT PURCHASE. I only gave it one star because i could not give it NO stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the Dean Stockwell show","review":"It seems like they add his character into scenes that we have already seen while watching the actual series. Little excerpts added to stuff we have saw already.Very boring, uninteresting and hard to sit though even for die hard fans.You know how it ends. No need to see this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointment","review":"I wanted to check this out as a series recap summary and found that perhaps viewing the entire series, rich in detail, story and emotional realism was spliced and diced to the movie format. It didn't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"not that much new","review":"This mini-movie just recaps all four seasons of BSG from the Cylon's point of view. There are a few new revelations, and some things that didn't make sense in the TV series are explained, but overall there isn't much new here - it's just an alternative POV recap."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe it was so awful","review":"The Blu-Ray quality was great. The special effects were outstanding. The acting was as good as the series. My main disappointment was with the story. I am a huge fan of Battlestar Galactica so I have watched every episode ever made multiple times. So I was very disappointed when I watched \\"The Plan\\" and discovered myself pausing the movie midway through to check how much time was left before it was over. Yes. It was that bad. The story line was generally uninteresting. In my opinion, this movie is the \\"Galactica 1980\\" of the re-imagined series. No, there weren't any flying boy scouts in this one ... but there was a snap-zoom on a nude man's private parts. A die-hard fan, such as myself, will still want to add this movie to their collection. All the rest should just wait till it comes on TV or rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't quite work","review":"After a promising start, it rapidly fades. For me, the Cavil character isn't strong enough to carry the film. A few explanations for issues unresolved in the series but that's about all. The rest is just a load of badly cobbled together scenes from the excellent series This should have been part of the BR box set and not an extra. As a plan it's half baked."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no plan...","review":"In a word... Awful.The entire movie plays like one big 'clip show' episode, the kind one would expect at the tail end of a season when production costs are running a little over budget.Yes, one does get the Cylon perspective of the first battle and subsequent scenes from the few seasons. In the end, however, we wind up not caring one 'frakking' bit for any of them - human or Cylon. The scenes just keep jumping around from location to location.Mind you, there are some solid moments with Simon, underused Cylon model #4 and also a few nice bits from Dean Stockwell. Otherwise, one is left feeling cheated. They should have focused on fewer Cylon characters with deeper storylines.Plan? What plan???This is a movie without a plan...What a mess and what a shame.Watch at your own peril."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Battlestar Galactica ever!","review":"Very little action and it's covering things we've pretty much already seen in the series. If I were you, I'd stick with season 4.5 to end my Battlestar Galactica collection.Not recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Plan just bad editing of old clips","review":"If your looking for some sort of revelation that a Plan really existed your wasting your time, this is just a rehash of old clips coupled with some bridging scene's and a tiny tiny bit of extra info into what was going on behind the scenes. If your a true Fan you will watch this and be seriously dissapointed, but if you just want towatch another scifi show then this is a good way to kill 2 hours or lul you to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battlestar Galactica \\"The Plan\\"","review":"\\"The Plan\\" is a spliced together mishmash of out-takes and quickly produced snippets that try to bind them all together. It purports to be new backstory though most of the info is already out there. Mildly entertaining to the real BG fan but likely to be a bust with the less devout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much new","review":"I was disappointed with the minimal new content in this DVD, - it felt like it was just a vehicle for Edward James Olmos to try directing and an excuse to reuse the sets while waiting to do Caprica.The actual \\"Plan\\" which I had hoped would be some complex, revealing twist turns out to be a complete anticlimax (I'm trying to stop short of spoiling it if that's possible.)It was a little interesting to see (almost) all of the Cylon models with enough frequency to actually keep track of which is which. In the long run, I'd say the missing element was an actual plot line. Most of the footage was old which could be deemed an excuse to not be able to introduce a new story ... but anyone who has seen \\"Dead men don't wear plaid\\" knows it can be done. <-- (I'm guessing that's the first time *that* movie was referenced in the same conversation as BSG :-0)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good realy.","review":"For real fans of BG this will be a little disapointing, lots of clips from the first series tied together with a weak story line. This movie does damage to the reputation acheived by the series, not so good realy."},{"rating":"1","title":"BSG's Dean Stockwell Hour, w/nudity","review":"I just watched this for the first time after waiting for quite a while to finally see it. I loved the series! This however, lacked any, and I mean ANY of the outstanding drama and action of the series. And for whatever reason, because it did absolutely nothing to further the story, the creators decided tho throw in a few gratuitous nude shots of women, and even a quick zoom on one guy's appendages, just because they could I suppose.As far as the story goes, there was nothing to be learned here. It was completely predictable, except for the parts where Cavil gets to \\"get it on\\" with the younger hotties. I did NOT need to see that.If you're a huge fan of Dean Stockwell and thought he needed more exposure in the series, they more than make up for it here. But if you're looking for a good solidly entertaining BSG fix... good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written and Directed by a toaster","review":"A soul free, super boring re-cap of the series with lame new footage shot to throw in between existing footage you've already seen.

It's like one of those lame \\"remember when we did this\\" episodes of a sitcom that always sucked so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"If you have seen the entire series this is a waste of time and money - don't bother with the \\"plan\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucked!","review":"It sucked!As much as a fan of this story that I am, I found this movie vary uninformative. There are too many questions left unanswered and so few answered in this short story. The nudity was not needed and the origins of the 12 are not explained. I was just disappointed. The writers need to listen to the questions the fans have and for once answer them all instead of leaving a big mystery. They can do better than this. Both this and Caprica have been a big letdown. Sorry, but they need to try again, and do it right next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A String of Outtakes","review":"The Plan is a pathetic string of outtakes from the television series.

Advertised as the story from the Cylon perspective it is essentially a two hour clip show with some extra footage added to try and weave the Cylon story.

It hurts me to say it, but this strikes me as the lowest point of the whole re-imagined series. It looks like they had a bunch of good ideas and tried to do all of them, failing to execute any of them well.I will say, if you're a fan of any of the Cylon Characters who never saw much development, you can definitely see it here. If you're a Sam Anders fan there's some fan service here as well, but otherwise it's just blah. There's an interesting retroconned side character who is married to a Cylon and spends a brief chunk of time with the Chief, but it's so brief it can't carry the whole two hours.There's even times I have issue with the special effects, which is the first time I can say that.And as far as it answering the big questions, like who put the \\"12 cylon models\\" in Adama's cabin, it doesn't even really do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a Re-Run - nothing really original","review":"I watched this The Plan last night on the SYFY channel and thought I would buy the movie once I saw the quality. It is just a re-configuration and re-run of past clips. I found it quite boring. I love scifi and and I'm very forgiving if a program has a few problems. I would suggest watching it free somelace if you haven't seen it. The most I'll pay for this program on-demand is $2. It is not a $15 movie. I did buy all the BSG series and they are worth the price on-demand. I do love on-demand at Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overmilking the Cash Cow","review":"This episode was penned by Jane Espenson, who I actually think is one of the weaker sci fi screenwriters today. She's always sentimental, never scary, and writes male characters like large neutered house cats.If you are so jonesing for BSG that you are willing to sit through half repeat scenes/half scenes that should have seen the chop block, then you will probably still like this. But if, like me, you were hoping for insight into the psyche and earlier motivatins of the Cylon, then you will be BORED and dissatisfied halfway through when you realize that there is no substance here.And the dialogue is atrocious. Brother Cavil is the lead and some of his one-liners are abominably bad. Yes, he actually says, \\"Let's get this genocide started.\\" Wow."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Love BSG...Skip The Plan","review":"It gives me no pleasure to report that The Plan is simply awful. Yes, you'll learn some back story elements - but mostly you'll find yourself in a mire of bad writing, impenetrable structure and hammy acting. I'm an enormous BSG fan, and not once in the run the series (well, maybe that episode with all the boxing) did I have that clammy moment when I said to myself, \\"This is terrible.\\" It happened with The Plan.

I had kind of guessed that after the mini-series. So the plan fails when a fleet of humans escape and the rest of the show is Cavil bumbling around trying to finish the job, and still failing. Then Caprica Cavil shows up, and tells Fleet Cavil they were wrong because they forgot to factor in \\"love\\" and the show ends.And I just wasted 20 dollars to learn what I already knew at the beginning of the whole mess. They promised that the end would be so mind blowing that it would make you re-think the entire series and be forced to re-watch it from the start with your newly unveiled eyes. They (the writers) failed.So lets make a 2 hour time sink and blame it all on Cavil!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BSG- The Plan","review":"I could never write anything negative about BSG because it's an all-around fantastic show, but of all the BSG DVDs this was not at the top of my list... it gives great background info, but can also be a bit redundant at times.

It provided perspective about Cylon motivations and why certain events of \\"The Plan\\" succeeded (or not). Prospective buyers should know that the movie assumes the viewer has rather thorough and intimate knowledge of the broadcast series. If you were a casual BSG viewer, you may quickly get lost. Footage from the series is combined with new footage but there are no reminders (except for periodic \\"x days after the attack\\" splashes) of the context.

Necessarily, it's full of a lot of the same scenes as the traditional BSG as it's telling some of the same story, just from a different angle, but it has plenty of additional information and scenes as well. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem long enough to actually tell the full story. Still, it does a good job of reinforcing the central themes of Battlestar Galactica: the interference of a 'higher power' in the design of what happens and love causing changes and having unexpected influences on people, Cylon and human alike. After all, they're both the same in the end, right? All in all a good end cap to the BSG series for fans. If you haven't seen the series, you probably won't get or like this movie as it's definitely for 'insiders.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great.

For this performance he has taken the \\"twang\\" out of the sound of the banjo and replaced it with a rich tonal quality that can only be described as the pure, untainted sound of the instrument itself. The Master of the Banjo plays with music masters of the far east and together they have created one of my favorite cd's.

Wow, how I'm sorry I used this!Although it's not too hard to apply and it initially looks very good in less time that it would take to apply regular caulk, this caulk strip has an absolutely wonderful ability to slowly peel away (on the reverse) from the space it's supposed to seal. It's practically a guarantee that you'll have a leak below your bathtub, behind tile or water anywhere else you didn't want water to go.I don't care how many times Red Devil claims that this has no \\"messy cleanup;\\" it's just not true. Oh sure, there's no messy cleanup the day you apply this caulk strip--but just wait until it starts to peel away on the reverse (where you might not be able to notice it peeling right away) and let water through--THEN you'll have a REALLY messy cleanup!Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth even a penny.","review":"I bought it thinking the idea looks great.

It looked great but shortly I discovered a serious water leak under the tub. The cause? The caulk strip adhesive had failed along the top and was actually causing water to get over the tub lip and behind the tile during showers. After removing the caulk strip, this tub had no leak problems.It's also very difficult to tell if the adhesive has failed from looking at it. You may have water going behind it and not even know.Overall, I'd say you're safer just sticking with regular caulk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mold factory. Good Earwig Trap","review":"Bought this item because I thought that it would look nice in our tub. It was not difficult to apply and I followed all of the directions. First I noticed that the tape was not very stickly. One would have assumed that something that is meant to keep water out would be very sticky. I applied the product properly and not too long after, maybe one month I noticed that it would separate from the tub wall. The strip that I had applied to the bottom of the tub on the floor also separated eventhough there wasn't much water to hasten the seperation process. Then I noticed that there was BLACK MOLD as the strips had seperated from the wall and allowed and trapped water behind it. There were also EARWIGS that were trapped behind it which was gross but at least the strip did some good. I went back to simple white caulk and that is what I will continue to use. I would not recommend this for a substiution for regular caulk but I would recommend this for an effective Earwig trap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same happened to me","review":"Applied it. Looked good at first, but about a month in it started to come away in the corners then flatten out and unseal along the top.

Neverteless, two other water-web squirting spidermans offered on Amazon hold relatively much more water. The first review does accurately portray the right hand--it falls off, and a younger child might easily lose it, as my little nephew has from time to time.

It's not exactly \\"street prose\\" as one reviewer put it, but just shockingly to the point. The writer says in one sentence what most would take paragraphs to convey. It doesn't seem to matter to the writer whether he is writing in first/second person etc, he just conveys his message - beautifully.Whether you believe in Mumia's innocence or not, this book is a good start to look into the complicated issue. For those reviewers who don't even review the book and simply blast Mumia or his followers, you have missed the point. I personally believe in Mumia's innocence and the system's failure to give him a fair trial (I'm a law studend and have read his trial transcripts, the opinions, etc). But that isn't the point. This is a good book, thoroughly gripping - I read it in 5 hours or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Fudges Some Major Facts","review":"This book is interestingly written in 'street' prose, with certain lines and bits emphasized and then re-emphasized to hit home. This story will help a reader looking to find a first hand perspective into the Black Panther movement of the sixties and into the Philadelphia police nightmare of the seventies. As long as you approach this book knowing that Mumia is NOT a political prisoner (he is a murderer) and was NEVER silenced for writing the truth (he spread vicious libel throughout his career as a journalist), and you look into those facts for yourself, then this book can be for you what it is for me... a dishonest biography of a man set against an honest background of the turbulant and nightmarish time for African- Americans in the years following the Civil Rights Movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"profound in every sense","review":"This is the CD you need to test your new hi fi.

This battle was commenced around September of 1942, and ended in January of 1943, really it was fought at the same time as Guadacanal.

And wouldn't you expect to hear a lot of bodhran on an album named for this instument?It appears to be a collection of cuts on which Murphy contributed his talents to other musicians which were thrown together from a variety of sources. That wouldn't be so bad, except you can hardly make out any bodhran on most of them. Granted, it's a background instrument, but if the album is titled \\"An Bodhran\\" you'd expect to be able to hear the drum featured pretty promimently. But if you did expect that, you'd be disappointed, as I was.If you want another CD of pretty decent Irish folk music, this is not bad.

This may be a good album of Irish music; I am not commenting on that one way or another. The liner notes say: \\"...[the accompanist] wishes to contribute significantly to the music without taking over from the melody player.\\" The bodhran is so much in the background that it is indistinguishable from spoons in the majority of cuts. It is more evident in a couple of cuts where it is accompanying a flute. For me, the price is not worth just those cuts. I wanted the bodhran to take over from the melody!!!

Installing the software takes well over an hour even though my computer has a 2.6GHz processor.The software even causes problems when I'm not trying to print. I sometimes got error messages from the software when I was doing tasks totally unrelated to printing. In summary, the specifications are great, but the software is so bad, that the specifications advertised are irrelevant for someone really using the printer.

If you have a ten page form or document that you need to scan into PDF so you can email it off to your lawyer or broker or whatever, you end up with ten PDF files, one for each page. Ridiculous. The response from HP was that since the product does not have a document feeder, it can only scan one page to one file. That makes no sense whatsoever. It could easily be the case that you need to scan pages from a book or other material that will not go through a document feeder anyway. Besides, flatbed scanners of all ilks (including HP) can be used to scan many pages into a single file.

I tapped every resource I could find and nothing helped. When I forced the install with a USB cable the software installed but then crashed more times than not. I am so completely disatisfied with the entire ordeal that I will not even consider buying another HP product for myself or for my company.

Rick Lotter on drums provides subtle and tactful accents, while Bootza's bass lines are fluidly independent and melodically expressive. Buehler's style is assured yet mildly unpredictable--his runs go off on improvisational tangents that never stray too far from the thematic structure. Despite its calming properties, there is no shortage of technically impressive work on Acoustic Impressions. Each member of the trio has plenty of room to stretch out and display exceptional chops on standards by Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock, Bill Evans, and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everlife is AWESOME!!!","review":"I love this cd, even more than their first cd!

I finally could't take it anymore and decided to come up with the solution. Doing research I read people suggestions to add a thick tile detail behind my current spout or add an extention piece. Those ideas might have worked, but they would have looked like an after thought. I found this spout and it was just what I needed to solve this on going problem. Good qulity (many others are plastic, but not this one), easy to install. Price was good and shipping was on time. No complaints from me. (Just wished I didn't let my old spout bother me for 3 years before purchasing this and easily fixing the issue.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality & Good Looks","review":"Extended tub spouts are hard to find in stores and when you do they are usually cheaply made basic builder special junk.

The optional trim piece is a nice touch as well. Just make sure you have 2 1/2\\" - 3\\" of pipe coming out of the wall, I didn't and had to get a longer threaded pipe."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Ideal Choice for any Toddler!","review":"We purchased this item for our daughter's second birthday. I knew going in it would be quite an assembly, but with a lot of patience and only about 5 hours (a breeze, compared with some of the other reviewers) the kitchen ended up beautiful! I feel compared with the plastic alternatives available, this kitchen is an ideal choice. There is lots of storage, for all of the \\"things\\" my daughter has now claimed as her own and the endless meals and snacks she is now preparing for us has made for lots of discussion about food preparation and nutrition. I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made of MDF - NOT WOOD - BUYER BEWARE","review":"We bought this item per the information on Amazon - that it is made of solid wood. We have been using it for a while and it still has a smell to it, especially when the doors are left open. I called Melissa and Doug today and was told that it is MDF, not solid wood, hence the smell (I'm very sensitive to MDF/Particle Board). Amazon WILL NOT stand by it's information and help me since it's past the return policy. It really stinks that a company as big as Amazon will not stand by the information it provides on it's products... who knows what you're really getting, especially when it's painted over and not apparent to the naked eye!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Product","review":"First, this kitchen comes in two boxes...not one. My first shipment was just one box. Amazon got me a replacement in just two days. It took me less than 3 hours to get it together working by myself. The instructions were easy to follow and all the parts and hardware logically labeled. There are even extra screws, bolts, etc. in case you lose one in the assembly process (you won't have to run to Home Depot on Christmas Eve). I like this better than the plastic kitchen sets available...I hope it lasts a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to follow directions, Great Quality","review":"Melissa & Doug Classic Deluxe KitchenI was a little worried about putting this kitchen together after reading the reviews, but my husband had no problems. All previous reviews are from a year ago. This kitchen (according to the description) has a newly redesigned engineering for easy assembly. Yes, there are a lot of pieces but each one is labeled by number. All the hardware is labeled by letter. The instructions were very easy to follow. My husband had the kitchen assembled in about 2 hours from opening box to finish product.We originally bought a Step 2 plastic kitchen for about $10 less and took it back due to poor quality. I am very pleased with the Melissa and Doug wooden kitchen for the price that we paid. It is well worth double what we paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product :) My daughter loves it!","review":"I am so very pleased with this product. My 1 /12 yr old loves it. It really isn't difficult to put together. My husband and 10 yr old put it together in about 1 hour 45 minutes. The directions were very clear. It is very sturdy, the doors all work properly and the knobs all move as they are ment to.One thing we did discover though when we went to put it together was that the product does come in 2 boxes. We received one box and didn't realize until the week of Christmas. We called Amazon and they took care of shipping out a replacement and sending us a return label to send back the one we had. Very good customer service!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, Excellant, Very sturdy, Easy Assembly and adorable","review":"My husband put this kitchen together in 2 hours total. The kitchen came in 2 easily managable boxes. All the pieces are numbered and color coded. The people who gave bad reviews about the assembly must have got the old design. This one is pretty easy. The kitchen is so adorable. I am waiting to see my kids reaction tomorrow. It is worth every penny. This kitchen is good for boys and girls. The size of the kitchen is perfect. Not too tiny nor too big. It's good for 2 kids to play at the same time. We absolutely love this kitchen. Awesome product. We are so glad we purchased this instead of plastic ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Assembly","review":"My husband completely assembled the kitchen in 90 minutes. You only need two tools, an allen-wrench and screwdriver, to complete this project. And all the pieces have color coded dots that align to ensure the piece is orientated in the correct direction. The directions are straight forward and have great pictures, even a step-by-step picture of what the kitchen looks like at the end of each step. If you can turn a screw-driver and an allen-wrench this kitchen rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good size kitchen, reasonable assembly","review":"This kitchen does have a lot of pieces. Assembly required. :) But, the instructions are very clear and the little colored dots help with the correct orientation of the parts. It took my husband and I maybe 2 hours to put the kitchen together.This kitchen is very sturdy. We love the rounded edges. The clear door inserts on the oven and microwave give a realistic look. And the overall size of the kitchen is good, ~3-and-a-half feet tall. Not as small as so many others that we've seen.I can't wait for my kids to see the kitchen at Christmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I could give it 10 stars","review":"I had very high expectations for this kitchen and it met or exceeded all of them. Putting it together only took 1 person with a cordless drill/screwdriver about 45 minutes. There are no rough edges anywhere on this product. The hinges are solid and the latches are well designed to protect small fingers.It is as cute as can be and has drawn wonderful reactions from all who have seen it. This was bought for a grandson's 2nd birthday and he and his 10 month old twin brother and sister will have years of fun cooking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for the first week, but then...","review":"This is an excellent idea for a toy, and my three kids (ages 7-4) loved it. Too bad it's built more shoddily than the average dollhouse. The hinges bend, the screws are too short, what few pieces are actually put together for you are sloppily assembled and fall apart with light use. Remember also that you need several hours to assemble the thing yourself.I understand it's a toy, but for $160, you can sure do better. No one would accept something this shoddily built even in a much cheaper piece of furniture. It's only because this is a toy that the manufacturers can get away with bad quality for a huge price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely takes skills to put together","review":"I bought this product to be used at work in play therapy w/ children. It definitely does the job, but it was a real pain to put together. We actually probably would have sent it back, but since it was already all the way out of the packaging, and we're on a tight budget and couldn't afford to send it back and look for another as cheap as this one, we decided to keep going. My husband, who fortunately makes furniture for a living, was kind enough to come in and fix it. It was missing some of the pre-drilled holes and some of the holes that were there were drilled poorly and had to be fixed. One of the bolts also broke on us. The materials used are really shoddy -- some of the wood actually cracked when the screws were tightened. I love most Melissa and Doug products (and this one looks so cute!), but I definitely would not recommend this one to anyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, fun, fun","review":"This isn't a cheap kitchen, its obvious in its construction. It's obvious in the price too,lol. That being said, its well worth it. If you have lil monkeys like I do, this is the kitchen for you. Both my 7 year old and my two year old have climbed on the kitchen (despite my attempts to keep them off of it) and it hasnt budged. The rounded edges on the kitchen, are a good thing too. It does take a while to put it together so plan on 3 + hours of time to assemble.It's been a blast to watch my children's imaginative play with this product. It's got plenty of space in the oven, fridge, etc. to put food in. No lights and sounds mean your kids will be able to engage with it. Having two children with Autism, creative, pretending is defiinetely something we encourage. It's got a great educational component and it's super fun too. We are completely satasfied with this product. Hope this helps :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"Bought this for my 2yo for Christmas.

The assembly was so easy, with EVERY part labeled and instructions that a child could follow, we had it all together in an hour and a half with no stress AT ALL!!! All the parts are made from solid wood, not particle board and the attention to detail with the design is impressive. The knobs of the stove even tilt up slightly like on a real stove. There are so many cute details. It was worth every single penny!!! It has provided hours and hours of fun for my kids :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"whoo boy","review":"Very good value for money. Paint was a bit off, looked like it had been touched up in places and didn't use the same color, but probably wouldn't notice it unless you were looking for that sort of thing like we were when we unpacked it.

This kitchen set is not \\"wood\\" and sturdy like you expect from Melissa and Doug. I must have spent 6-7 hours researching kitchen sets for my daughter. My husband had to use gorilla glue, scothch tape and power tools and a drummel to make this thing work. Assembly took 5-6 hours and much patience. To top it all off, we didn't receive the two shelves for the bottom oven andsink unit. What a waste of money! Please take our advice and don't purchase this kitchen. Sure do wish we could return this kitchen for one that is worth the price. This is not our style to complain so take that into consideration. I have one more thought, wouldn't it be nice if Melissa and Doug made it right with their customers? Money for them is no object I'm sure!

They were not included in the box. The manufacturer sent me the diretions but when we began putting it together, we found all the doors hung crooked. Further, the sink does not fit between the two supports it is supposed to screw into. The sink is either manufactured to wide or the supports were screwed to the underside of the counter incorrectly. I was very disapointed because I like the other items I purchased from this manufacturer. But they were smaller, less complicated items and I think they overeached on this one. Very upset and I am really hoping either the seller or amazon comes through on processig a full refund for this. BEWARE! I wish I could give it negative stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality and easy to assemble","review":"This is a wonderful play kitchen -- solid, taller than average, not pink -- and contrary to some of the reviews here, very easy to assemble. (Yes, it took a couple of hours, not unlike a bookshelf or chest of drawers from Ikea, but it really is as durable and well put together as a piece of nice ready-to-assemble furniture.) My two year old son has enjoyed cooking with it and my six year old daughter has enjoyed playing restaurant. Unfortunately, we had a house fire and must replace all our toys, but we are re-buying this again as one of the first things we are replacing. If you have tall kids like we do, you will see that there is no contest between this and the other kitchens -- this is more than six inches higher than most. Yet another high quality toy from Melissa and Doug -- if you haven't checked out their insanely durable plastic fruits and vegetables, definitely do -- along with their fun and creative wooden pizza kitchen set and birthday cake set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Kitchen!!!","review":"We gave this kitchen to our 2 little boys---yes boys--age 1 and 2 years old for Christmas.

You can find also find younger versions of Natural Elements, O.C., and Pharoahe Monch on this album, and even the interludes with Primo talking to Mr. Dave are entertaining. I knocked a star off my rating because \\"Too Complex\\" has skips in it, and it's not the CD itself, it's the actual song that skips. Also, the interlude after that song feels like it should have followed \\"Head Over Wheels\\" because Mr. Dave is talking about that song in this interlude. Otherwise, all of the songs on here are classics. When is Reality Check 202, like Primo advertised, gonna drop?"},{"rating":"2","title":"ThE StReeTS heAT!","review":"One of the dopest compilations ever, mixed by the illest producer in hip hop.

The only reason this review is a 4 not a 5 is I am a wireless engineer and I was interested in learning more about digital wireless. This book has a very good explanation of analog cellular, which laid the foundation for wireless as we know it today. I feel that there is not enough correlation between analog and digital, (GSM, CDMA, TDMA), systems and protocols. The book has a section late in the book giving an overview of various digital technologies. I think the differences of analog and digital protocols is needed from the beginning through the end of the book. The author does an great job explaining some very technical topics in an easy to read, easy to understand way. Definitely worth your time. This is a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Tubes but they Work","review":"These are the thickest tubes I have ever seen, but they do what they say- they are thorn and puncture resistant.

I even ran over some glass with them once and cut the sidewall of my tire, but not the actual tube, so I would recommend these if you don't care about weight and just care that your tube stays intact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive for a toy, very poor as an instrument","review":"I purchased this guitar for my young boys.

I thought this was like a $20 gift considering how bad it is, but I searched it online and was amazed to find that it goes for $70!

Saul Hernandez once again creates what is known as the best Mexican rock out there today. This time however he designs this album with string ensembles, giving his music the ultimate touch. If you are a Caifanes fan, then you have to own this album, because not only is there a live CD with old Caifanes songs, but also a whole new studio CD as well. Check out the last song \\"No me Culpes\\", and you will also agree. And if you still haven't seen them in concert yet, you are missing a beautiful performance. They rocked at the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim on February 19, 2000, this is one memory I will never forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acuardate que Jaguares no son Caifanes","review":"Aunque sigue Saul Hernandez como lider de una banda que ha tenido una larga trayectoria en la industria de el rock en espanol no es de esperar que haya cambiado el estilo un poco despues de formar a Jaguares y con nuevos musicos. Pero todavia queda las imagenes de el misterio similar a Caifanes en este nuevo trabajo de Jaguares. No hay otra banda en espanol que en este momento experimente con temas tan oscuros y misteriosos como Jaguares. Saul es como un guru de guia en canciones nuevas como \\"Fin\\", \\"Hoy\\", \\"Parpadea\\" y el disco en vivo revive todas las alusiones de lo que era Caifanes y anade la experiencia de los musicos, es mas para que \\"Vampiro\\" use la guitarra como se debe usar lla ha dado un gran paso.

All those who continue to diss Jaguares saying they arent the same as when they were Caifanes...GET OVER IT. A musician cannot and will not create the same music on every CD. If that person did, we should question his/her talent and creativity as an artist. \\"Bajo el azul de tu misterio\\" demonstrates the continued evolution of Saul's skills as a songwriter and musician. The live CD included in \\"Bajo el azul de tu misterio\\" is great. Some of the songs sound better in their live version than they do originally. If you like superficial, uncomplicated music don't buy this CD. But if you are looking for some stellar song writing and creative musicianship buy it! For all those bitter people out there: GET OVER IT. Saul has evolved and so has his music. \\"Bajo el azul de tu misterio\\" is a reflection of this evolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Not What We Call Rock In The USA","review":"I heard a great mexican station on the radio here in the NW. Had to track down that music. Killer stuff with guitar better than Beck/Page Yardbirds. Searched for the \\"best\\" Mexican bands. Bought all Caifanes and Jaguares stuff hoping that would be part of what I'd heard. Internet info said these must be the ones - they were the premier rock band in Mexico...maybe the world. Big disappointment. Caifanes/Jaguares are not actually \\"rock\\" as we would call it in the USA. They are a \\"soft rock-pop\\" band. No power...no energy...monotone vocals by the supposedly great Sol Hernandez. It does nothing for me and rates as one of the biggest traps I've ever fallen into in my search for real music. Buy at your own risk. Dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jaguares has developed their own sound","review":"Jaguares delivers a live CD that will get your attention. The lead guitar player is as good as any out there today. These guys put the rock back into the music and they also deliver a poetic message with the lyrics of their songs.

It contains plenty of original quotes from ormon sources that speak for themselves, and that's the ONLY reason this book gets two stars. But there is little in the way of depth of research beyond primary LDS material. And then there is something that would make a smaller book completely unusable: The veneer of sensationalism. Perhaps LDS ceremonies are derived from occult practices, perhaps not; but if they are, Ankerberg and Weldon could have come up with much more rational ways to say so. Two evangelical scholars, Mosser and Owen, years ago decried the inadequacies of counter-Mormon apologetics and rightly castigated these authors for producing too much of a diatribe and not enough of substance in their work; I would not recommend this book at all were it not for the wealth of original source material it references.

The love story between Cary and Stone in this novel is one of the most unrealistic, ridiculous ones I have ever read. Right before the rather dull and predictable climax, Stone dreams of marrying this woman and having kids with her. WHY???? Other than her apparent physical attributes and sexual prowess she offers nothing of substance. By the end of the novel, even before the incredibly predictable revelation of who pushed Sasha, she was an immensely unlikable person. Yet we are to believe that our handsome, intelligent protagonist is in love with this woman. COME ON!!!The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because there were one or two plot twists early on that I found interesting. Even though I have a couple of Woods paperbacks on my shelf, I am not sure I will read him again. If so, I hope the next one is better than this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first Woods, but also my last","review":"To be honest, I'm surprised by all the 4- and 5-star ratings. Despite the stray twist here and there, this book was extremely predictable. The dialogue did not ring true, and I also had the sense of the author pulling the characters around by the nose in order to facilitate his plot. This was especially noticable in the actions of Dino and the other cops -- occasionally they would do something that seemed to come out of left field. Later, a plot point would develop and I would say, \\"Ah, that's why the author had them doing that.\\" The last thing you want is to see the author pulling the strings, so to speak, behind a work of fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"New York Dead.","review":"Great Book .

Plenty of colorful characters abound as well, most of which are flawed..some more than others. But I find that more interesting than the formulaic black and white of good vs. bad.Stone has crises of conscience in this book. Torn between what's right and what could make his life better.

It's a horrible shave bowl. Too big and the walls are too straight up and down for a lathering purposes. But that is not what this bowl was intended for. So this is completely my own fault... for being cheap and not wanting to spend $20+ for a proper bowl. I decided to keep it as a traveling dog bowl to simply keep in the car. It's very light and easy to store. As a primary dog bowl?... not so much. It's light weight makes it very easy to tip over. I prefer a heavier ceramic type bowl for my dogs at home. But for travel... this one is perfect. And you cannot complain about the price. One other thing.... there is no rubber padding under the bowl to protect whatever surface you may put it on. More weight and a protected bottom would have earned this piece of steel 5 stars. Just don't get this as a shaving bowl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it would be","review":"This rug's color was the only thing that I liked about it.

A little weaker than I had hoped, but that was not wholly unexpected, since the script suggested multiple lights.I did, however, expect it to work more than 5 minutes. That's how long we had it going on the test run the day before the party. The next day at the party, the steady strobe failed completely. We could only get it to work with the sound activated function, and that only worked with the speakers literally pressed against the sides of the light.

There is some well written erotica in this book with good characters, but there are some plot elements that are plain silly. Now this is fantasy so realism should not be expected; but the idea of oral se4x as a form of payment is silly enough to disturb the willful suspension of disbelief. Overall I find the book a little below average for the genre. The attack by a devolved mental case is OK but not as well written as I would expect from this author and his disposal (he decides Giselle is the goddess because of her freckles and commits suicide) is weak overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN--read this if you like lots of simpleminded sex scenes","review":"There was so little plot in this book that I almost stopped reading it.

I enjoyed the slice-of-life feeling of this book. It is a bit dismal at times, but wasn't life in a mining town mid-1940's a bit dismal anyway?I didn't grasp the inaccuracies many other reviewers have noted, which could mean I was either too engrossed in the story to really notice, or I just don't know my history so well. Though I will add: The first \\"marker\\" was probably the felt tip marker, created in the 1940's, used mainly for labeling and artistic applications. The \\"Magic Marker\\" was first marketed in 1952. The author should have said \\"felt tip\\" I suppose, rather than \\"magic.\\"Had I disliked the story, I'm sure these inaccuracies would have really bugged me, but in this case, I don't mind enough to really notice.The book is worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me back the life I wasted reading this!","review":"How can a book that garnered such good reviews prove to be such a disappointment? I picked up the book expecting more candy than steak but if I am going to knowingly indulge in empty calories, I'd at least like to enjoy the experience. This book doesn't even rise to the level of beach-reading.It's not just that it was boring, but it was also historically sloppy (Magic Markers, the Watergate in the 40's...puh-leeze) and intellectually dishonest. No character development, no motivation, no reasons to care about any of the characters because all their lives were dismal. At least the ones we were told about...what was with Sandy?The only good thing I can say about it is that because so much of what should have been included to make this a good book wasn't there, it was a very quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must-read!!","review":"Jennifer Haigh's new novel is one of the best I've read this year - the characters are well written, and the setting of a mining town over a number of years is vivid and draws the reader in with wonderful details.This is a book that will stay with you for a long time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed......","review":"This was not the book I was expecting. I enjoyed the first half of the book, then it was downhill from there....I didn't know where the story was taking us and got frustrated and READ fast, it was not worth the price of the hardcover. Sorry I did try and like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baker Towers","review":"I liked this book. It was a wonderful \\"slice of life\\" piece. Set in a small mining town, in the 40's, you get to know the members of one family very well. It's a realistic portrait, but doesn't have gratuitous violence or language. I would read another of Jennifer Haigh's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing, bad editing","review":"This book was not only poorly written with insipid characters, but it was full ofridiculous errors. Examples:- Sandy was described as \\"aboriginal\\" because he was tan with blue eyes and white hair.- in the 1940s Dorothy moves to Washington, goes on a walking tour past the Watergate Hotel, which was designed in the 1960s by Italian architect Luuigi Moretti.- During the war, because of the shortage of stockings, a character says she drew a line down the back of her legs with Magic Marker (introduced in 1952 by Sidney Rosenthal).- Same character uses hairspray in the 1940s, which was not introduced until 1955.I could go on and on. Don't waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I grew up in Bakerton and I don't recognize it from this book!","review":"Her details are really, really incorrect. There was never a \\"fire queen\\" contest in Bakerton. Namely because Bakerton does not have (and never had) its own fire department!Bakerton is really small and does not contain (nor ever did) have a section called \\"Polish Hill.\\" There is a Polish Hill area in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania but not Bakerton.There isn't (or ever was) anything called the \\"Two Towers\\" in Bakerton. (She must be thinking of Tolkein!) There used to be a single mining tower that was built in the seventies and was torn down a few years ago.Plus someone else mentioned that she puts the Susquehanna River in the wrong place!Personally, I think that she pulled out a map and looked over Central PA and just chose a place at random."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific followup to a great first novel","review":"I absolutely loved Mrs. Kimble, so I couldn't wait to read Jennifer Haigh's new novel, Baker Towers. She didn't disappoint. While I usually have trouble following authors when they change voices and try to tell the story from multiple viewpoints, Ms. Haigh does it effortlessly. There is no doubt that she has switched to a new voice and a new character is telling his/her own story. My only problem with this novel is that it focused on the female characters and didn't elaborate so much on the male figures, but it didn't bother me so much that I would hesitate to recommend this book. My book club is reading Baker Towers and all 11 of us absolutely love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a true depiction","review":"I enjoyed reading this, my grandparents are Slavish and were raised in a coal mining town and the depiction of even the minor details is on cue. It reminds me of my Grandfather's stories. I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful story","review":"This is a beautifully told story of a family, plain and simple. No intricate plot twists or suspenseful intrigue, just a slice of life story of the Novak family and the small Pennsylvania mining town that defines them. Both the characters and the town are described superbly. The author's ability to make these characters come to life is amazing. I was able to get a great sense of each family member' fears, hopes and desires. I truly enjoyed the author's writing style as I did in her previous novel, MRS. KIMBLE, which I also highly recommend. I can't wait to read more from this exceptional writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"long winded","review":"The book is boring because it moves so slowly and gives to much detail.

I thought her characters were well defined, and had some depth. I ordered the rest of her books and look forward to reading them.Having grown up in the midwest I could relate to some of her characters and the personalities ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing....","review":"As her other novel, \\"Faith\\", was fantastic I was very disappointed in this offering. I found the story boring and disjointed; it left one character as if falling off a cliff, and started another with the same result, and so on. Did not finish after reading 42%. Had to leave it for a day, and could not bring myself to go back to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the 50's I Remember","review":"When first deciding to write my thoughts, I scan other customer reviews to see how my feelings stack up against the majority. In this case, I am definitely in the minority. While I loved Mrs. Kimble for its originality and strong characterizations, I found the characters in this book to be pretty much cookie cutter. I love books that return me to that comparatively innocent time of the 50s, but this one did not. It felt forced and incompletely researched."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much hype, too little payoff","review":"It may be that I expected too much, but I wanted more than character studies set back in a \\"nostalgic\\" time. This novel did not deliver. I recommend Cynthia Ozick's Heir to the Glimmering World as a better investment of your reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I was born in western Pennsylvania in a town much like the one Jennifer Haigh attempts to describe. She does a very poor job. I've also taken the train from Altoona to Pittsburgh and never once crossed the Susquehanna River. I had a sister who put pancake make-up in her legs in lieu of nylon stockings, but she used an eyeliner pencil to draw a simulated seam down the back. Ms. Haigh's women used Magic Markers; there were no Magic Markers at that time. Ms. Haigh makes a 1950's reference to Washington DC's Watergate Hotel which was built in the mid-1960's. These inexcusable errors (there are others, too) irritated me so much that I made it only to page 78. I doubt that I'll return to finish. This may seem petty of me, but the characters, also, are one-dimensional."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a slow and boring downer","review":"Having received this book as a gift, I felt obligated to keep reading it, even though it never captured my interest. Every character had such unhappy things in their life, and many events, such as what happened to Dorothy during her Washington episode, were never explained. I kept waiting for something happy. Instead, it got to where I could predict the next bad thing to befall these people. The author also lost me when she described using Magic Marker to draw a fake hosiery line down the back of legs. Where would one find a Magic Marker in the 40's? I wish I had not wasted my time reading this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Baker Towers","review":"This was an interesting book about the coal mining years in Pa.The author did a good job with character development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired by the Counting Crows","review":"Very good Dutch band.

The current VAI reissue is very well done as far as video is concerned, however, the sound is not as clear or expansive. Carlo Bergonzi sings with a young powerful tenor voice and his usual diction.

The acting is superb, the recreation of the period spot on,the unfolding of the plot keeps you watching for the next twist. Underneath the characters all seem to have their resonancein ones from the movie Broadcast News. The responsible cynical guy is Freddy, the bloodless network execs, the freneticcareerist Belle who falls for the slick anchor man Madden and subsidiary characters who all rush around as if the worldwas entirely focused on them. But through it all, the quality shows through and The Hour overcomes the temptation of beachinga pale Broadcast News clone and becomes something far more original and meaty. Great viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"British Mad Men meets Rubicon....sorta","review":"This show is great. Is it a little silly and by-the-book with dialogue & character types? Sure. Is it an absolute blast from start to finish? YES. Charming, entertaining, compelling, and beautifully shot, the BBC has really hit it out of the park with this one. The cast is great: Dominic West is superb, Juliet Stevenson, and Julian Rhind-Tutt are the real scene-stealers but that's not to say the two \\"leads\\" Ben Whishaw & Romola Garai are just spinning their wheels.

The jokes were rarely creative, instead relying on blatant offensiveness or sexuality. Whether this was an artistic choice or lazy writing, it failed to amuse me more than once or twice.A few additional complaints: the soap opera drama that goes on in the office; the lack of any character with redeeming traits; and the unimportance of the show's setting to the majority of the show's jokes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it","review":"This show is great but shows only survive if they are viewed on tv and the dvd's are bought so buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it don't buy buy it buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged Case","review":"The DVD's seem to play fine and the arrival date was correct but the DVD case itself is heavily damaged to the point where it can't hold the DVD's in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Frisky Dingo fans...maybe","review":"Ratings are a guesstimate, usually on the \\"safe side\\".Genre: Comedy, spy-dramaSituations: Probably RLanguage: RNudity: PG+Violence: RSpecial Features: Disc 1: Unaired Pilot episode (a parody actually, with the main character being replaced in ep. 1 by a velociraptor), Pilot episode for the live action series \\"the League\\".Disc 2: Unaired Network Promo (commercial ad), The Making of Archer (subsections for different aspects of production), Deleted Scenes (always one of my preferred extras), and a pilot episode of the live action series \\"Louie\\"This is very reminiscent of Cartoon Network's Frisky Dingo, Stroker and Hoop, or Assy McGee.

Featuring several members of the AD cast, Archer should not be overlooked simply because it is animated. Starring famed voice actor H.

The series took tremendous steps in the second season, becoming one of the best known secrets in comedy. The third promises to be even better.The humor is blunt only on the surface. Sure, puns and sexual humor abound in Archer, yet do not discount the series' subtle mastery of wordplay and situational comedy. I would definitely recommend Archer, with the caveat that it definitely satisfies a very specific type of comedy fan.

This show combines the unbelievable \\"Yeah, right!\\" moments of James Bond with the \\"I probably shouldn't be laughing at this, but I can't stop myself!\\" - type humor of Tucker Max."},{"rating":"2","title":"Archer: season 1","review":"Archer is amazingly hilarious and raunchy, I highly recommend the show to those of you who appreciate sarcasm and low-brow comedy.I was excited to see the \\"Original Unaired Pilot\\" and deleted scenes, and was sorely disappointed. They are funny, but I really expected more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thirty minutes of television.","review":"Series is unmatched by any other. Witty comedy. Snappy comebacks. I have introduced this to many of my co-workers and the reviews are the same. More Archer."},{"rating":"2","title":"episodes = 5 stars / bonus content = 3 stars","review":"The cartoon itself is brilliant, demented, twisted, and hysterical. My problem w/ the dvd release is that it is marketed as having an \\"unaired episode\\" of archer. Guess what it is? It's a screaming Dinosaur in place of Archer. Not cool to do to the die hard fans who shell out good money to support physical copies in this day and age. No commentaries either? And the Archersaurus is screaming over a previously aired episode, btw. In a nutshell - buy it for the cartoon , not the extra content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-Paced Animation with Decent Attention to Detail","review":"I grew to like Archer over the last few months and the engrossing backstories that helps explain why the characaters are as horribly selfish as they are.The episodes DO bounce around quite a bit--a little too much for my liking: the story spends 40 seconds in Europe, then a minute in New York, then 30 seconds in Moscow, then two minutes in Miami, then back in a BLIMP above Europe--okay, back in a RIGID AIRSHIP above Europe.Before you know it, 30 minutes (22 actually) have flown by.The attention to detail is surprisingly high for a cartoon; so it is appealling to those of us who prefer storylines with minor plot holes.For $15--$16 dollars, it was worth price for the entertainment. I will likely by the next season's DVD set when it becomes available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plain uproarious fun","review":"Archer is a very irreverent, politically incorrect, rude animated series that's just plain nonsensical fun. It is greatly acted and sexily drawn and had us laughing for hours. Don't take it too seriously and enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this show - wanted more extra features","review":"I love this show. It's hilarious. I won't get into the plot or humor since you can read about that elsewhere, but I will say that I was disappointed that this 2 disc set contained very little in the way of extra/bonus material. No new episodes and the bonus scenes were simply 20 second scenes with slightly different wording than what was broadcast. I'm very happy to own the show on DVD and will watch it many times, but don't get fooled into thinking you are getting extra, unaired material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I hate to make assumptions, but I'm guessing that anyone considering purchasing this DVD is already familiar with this amazing show. If that is the case, then I say congrats good sir...well done. This show is among THE FUNNIEST I've seen. The others that stand even close to Archer being Family Guy, Superjail, Metalacolypse and Boondocks, IMHO. For those not familiar with Archer, I would suggest you immediately watch it.As far as the product itself, Season 1 comes with two discs, ten episodes and some extras. The extras include the original unaired Archer pilot, The Making of Archer and deleted scenes. I consider this a must-own, because I still laugh after watching this show over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"PowerMadd speed clip.","review":"So far so good.

The good news is that this is comfortable when installed and seems well-made. Bottom line: would I buy another? Yes...well, no, I'm buying two more!Cons: Installation. Do you see that little piece on the left? It is good, but nothing is said about it in the instructions. Run the strap through BOTH sides, install the male piece, adjust length, then force the strap end under center part and it is clean. The biggest issue was getting the strap through the male end (with teeth). If your strap isn't thin, you'll need needle-nose pliers and some strength. I trimmed my end and singed it. Then I got a bit through and grunted it through.In the end, I'm very happy with it. It seems secure, just be prepared to wrestle a bit. Otherwise it would be 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and easy","review":"They installed easily and quickly. Best of all, it works great.

I dont and will never buy this clip again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than others in the market, highly recommend it.","review":"This buckle is easy to install and is very easy to handle, even with (thin) gloves on. I have had other buckles on my helmets as well (the ones with metal parts) but this one is much better to handle, and is sturdy enough. I am sure it can match the strength of other buckles out there with metal parts for the situations that you may encounter. Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use It, Trust It","review":"D-Ring helmet fastners are a pain in the ____s to use. I sent away for three different speed clip devices and the Powermadd Speed Clip was the easiest to install, the one that needed the least re-adjustment once installed, and, having used two of them on two different helmets over the last three years, I can truthfully say they've never come undone on their own and I've never had a malfunction. A lot of motorcycle store Neanderthals say that the speed clips will come loose in a crash. Bull__t. I'm a strong, healthy guy and I can't pull the Powermadd clip apart once latched. And if clip or latch strap fasteners aren't safe, why would a premier motorcycle helmet manufacturer like Nolan use one? It was the latch on my full-face modular Nolan helmet that led me to finding and using the Powermadd device on my other helmets."},{"rating":"2","title":"works as advertised","review":"Works as advertised.It is a simple product so no room for failure I guess.Only complaint.

I live in Kansas and have angled for flatheads, blue cats, channel cats, wipers, and walleye using this line almost exclusively.Berkley line is amazingly reliable; I almost never re-spool and I only recently switched over to Berkley nano-fil just to see what all the fuss was about. I would definitely recommend this line to anyone looking for an ultra-tough, low-visibility line. You can beat the crap out of this stuff on rocks or brush and never really get it worn down too bad.Bottom Line: Great product. Get some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Walleye","review":"I use Berkley Trilene Big Game Monofilament (20lb. test) when fishing for walleye from shore on the Missouri river in North Dakota. Conditions are very tough on fishing line because you have to drag through various obstacles such as rocks, weeds, willow trees, etc. This line does the job as well as can be expected under these conditions and it will take a lot of damage without snapping. It does get more \\"memory\\" than some other monofilament lines I've used, but nothing so bad as to prevent me from continuing to use it. I use this line on spinning and spincasting reels without any problems. The last walleye I caught in 2010 was just over 10 lbs. and I was glad I had Big Game on my reel.Update: 2011-09-25******************I like this line so well I bought two more spools."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"This is my favorite line for catfishing.

It seems to me that it is a little stronger than its rated 15 pound test. I tested it by tying it to a 15 lb. dumbbell and using it to lift the dumbbell. While the line was holding the weight of the dumbbell, I added two 4 oz. sinkers to the load, bringing the weight to 15.5 lbs. and the line didn't break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong and easy to handle","review":"I used this line on four salmon trips in September out of Westport, Wa. The charter skippers were great at finding salmon, and when I hooked fish, this line just did its job and never gave me a concern. I used the 20 lb. clear line. It easily handled the 8-12 lb. Coho we were lucky to find and catch. It's rather nicely limp and smooth in the reel, and it cooperates when you tie knots. If you need monofilament, this is a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for crafting!","review":"Absolutely wonderful as a crafting tool and for hanging Christmas ornaments since it is strong and almost invisible.

I thought I would spend the extra $ on Avery, they've been making shipping labels since the Puritans shipped their stuff to the New World. They have some good features - easy to peel from the backing, they cover well and the ink dries instantly - BTW these work perfectly with either laser or inkjet printers. I've had no problems with the printing aspect. It's the adhesion aspect that is a problem - these guys like to peel at the edges. No matter how much I rub and burnish them, they usually peel at least a little, sometimes a lot. They're better on coated cardboard like the USPS Priority Mail boxes, worse on regular cardboard boxes. The smoother the surface, the better they stick. That's true with most adhesives, but these labels are designed to be used on boxes, and should stick perfectly to all types, especially at this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avery labels are the best","review":"Avery labels are the best\\".

I applied 16 labels on 8 cardboard boxes. After 2 hours, all 16 label curled up and started falling off from the boxes. I was scared. Fortuantely I caught the problem before UPS came to pick the boxes. I tried hard to press the label to make them stick but it did not help too much. Eventually I had to tape them down. Very frustrating!I used to use Uline labels, which are thinner but stick to boxes much better. I switch to Avery Internet labels this time to save some money. A big mistake.

Other tea tree oils I have used almost burn my skin if applied directly to it. This one doesn't. It doesn't say it is diluated with other oils but I think it has to be. I use it on my face to prevent breakouts and I find it doesn't work as well as other brands I have used.

I finally made an appointment to have them removed for the low price of $180.00. (I just could not bring myself to pay that much money because I do not have that many skin tags). I finally read an article that stated tea tree oil removes skin tags. Well I decided to try removing them one more time before my appointment. Tea tree oil definitely removes skin tags. I already have one gone and several more drying up and flaking off. The smell is strong and it does slightly sting when applying but that goes away in about 2 maybe 3 minutes. Nothing unbearable. If you have skin tags that you would like to remove, try this first method first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Watered Down...100% Pure","review":"Purchased this several weeks ago and yes was concerned about its consistency...it just didn't look and feel like any other oils I've used before. However, the strong scent seemed very legit. After some further research, I found that the consistency of tea tree oil is not a thick oil but a very light oil, almost watery looking, but is very strong. After using it and trying several solutions with diluting it with other oils and water I can tell you that this stuff is 100% pure and potent. I had to work with it to find a solution that was not too strong for my skin (it can burn or irritate the skin if used undiluted or not diluted enough). I am currently using a solution for a mild case of athlete's foot and it is clearing it right up without the hassle of those thick counteractive store bought creams. It also works great for scalp issues like dandruff and other irritations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different use for this product","review":"My granddaughter had a very bad case of head lice.

This time I decided to save money and get the cheaper TTO--not a good idea. It smelled horrible. I know TTO doesn't smell like roses, but this was worse than most. Also, it felt different on my skin. I ended up throwing it away, only to buy the more expensive kind. Take my advice--this TTO is cheaper for a reason!"},{"rating":"2","title":"tea tree oil","review":"This is a good antiseptic to have on hand. Soothes, itching burning.

And that someone is gonna be me.I heard this CD only because I borrowed it from my library. And it was a waste of my time. There are a few nice sounds in here but for the most part it is unmemorable, meaningless, and boring. It's no wonder this band got forgotten, especially when this CD's considered their best. If you really need some whiney feminine alternative rock, try Hole. (No, I'm not a Hole fan, but after hearing Throwing Muses, Hole sounds great.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Smart, So Good","review":"I'm a late-comer to Throwing Muses, but theirs is the type of music that will last a long, long time. University is the best of the lot, combining Hersh's intellect with some amazing melodies and beats. The funny thing is that when I first listened to this cd, I was rather unimpressed. It wasn't until I took another listen a couple of months later that I realized that while I had been passively acknowledging their musical skill, I had also been ignoring the power of Hersh's words. That is where the true beauty of the Muses' music is found. Once you actually \\"listen\\", their mixture of music and message is so unique (and yes, at times, weird) that it immerses you. This cd is a great experience. I may have arrived late to the scene, but I plan to stay around for quite a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"A masterwork of the supeficial","review":"Stephen Kern read a lot, writing his book. His study is a conglomerate of the most important authors, sociologists and philosophers focusing on the shift of time and space concepts in modern Europe. The broadness of his knowledge is the lack of his book, because it is nothing else than a masterwork of the superficial. Combine a little bit of time-philosophy in the novels of Proust, a little bit of brainstorming (Molly Bloom) in Joyce, combined with Einstein, James, Husserl (!), Bergson, Ibsen, etc. and you have a good pseudo-cultural-philosophic consomm��.

It would have been a number one single, no bother. The spoof Garvey tracks were so funny, especially the Night Club Sammy Davis take off. Country Dancing was also very catchy and would have made an excellent single, rather than the abysmal Ha Ha Said the Clown. Imagine the Yardbirds recorded this...what were they all on?

The performance is lifeless compared to any of the originals. Wynton Marsalis's latest effort to score a historical piece for an orchestra again fails. As with Coltrane's A Love Supreme, the original small group performance set the bar very high. That is not to say that any attempt to score these works is a guarenteed failure (see many recordings by the Mingus Big Band). The reason these works fail along with many other of Marsalis's are due to a lact of emotional fire, and originality (the artist must at least attempt to provide some personal statement to the piece, or all you can to is compare it to the original)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This just doesn't work","review":"This is just another bland recording from Wynton Marsalis. AS compared to the recordings of the Mingus Big Band, these tracks are unemotional and poorly executed, despite the talented band personnel. It is more about \\"big band\\" than it is about Mingus and as such this CD lacks character, emotion and doesn't reflect much understanding of Mingus' music. Pass this one by and try the Mingus Big Band recordings if you want to hear another take on Mingus' composing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great strings","review":"I LOVE these strings.

I eat them when I don't want to pig out, because in this world, being fat is considered bad, and for good reason. Rather than eating more than my fair share, I skip desserts and go for a power bar instead. Obesity is a serious health problem that too many people don't take seriously enough, they don't have the will power to resist their hunger cravings. Performance power bar offers another tool in the fight against unsightly obesity, not to mention the serious health risks, joint and feet problem that being too fat brings. I use the power bars as a way to control my weight so I don't get too heavy. I take responsibility for my own diet, and I need snacks like these to keep those hunger cravings at bay. They are a little harder than I would like, but still they do the job. The protein takes away the sugar cravings, which are a death knell to any diet and well being. I look forward to trying the other flavors and formulas."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuk","review":"I received a free sample power bar through the Vine Program and looked forward to trying it; when it arrived I was babysitting two preteens, so we each had a portion and all of us agreed -- yuk!

The problem with this bar is the texture -- it is VERY gummy, and even stretched a bit when we cut it into portions. As one chews, it becomes rubbery; in the interest of this review I had to force myself to finish my one-third portion because it was so unpleasant.

I like that they have fun while investigating and still maintain a professional image. I like their style where they try to dismiss a haunting, but if they can't, you are left with some pretty good evidence.

It fails as a vampire novel because the characters are shoddily recycled from Anne Rice, Michael Moorcock, and the shows/movies mentioned in the other reviews. The pompous and overwrought writing is painful to read. Please don't buy this thinking that it is some kind of urban gothic manifesto. It isn't.Was this someone's idea of a joke??

First, to be picky, the amount of typos in this book are astoundong. Now I realise this has nothing to do with the author but come on. Give it a proof read or something. The story itself was pretty poorly written. While the pace is quick as I have read in other reviews, the reason it is quick is the author does a poor job of giving details, somtimes extremely important to the plot, that are needed to further the story. I am not saying it is a horrible piece of garbage but definitely a below average novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I met the authors.

I have given up using any other salad dressing a long time ago and I buy this one by the case at Amazon so I will always have it available for the next party potluck I go to as no one ever asks me to bring anything else but my green salad but what they are really asking for is my Garlic & Herb Salad Dressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Dressing","review":"My wife and I started on a low carb, high veggie - fish/chicken/beef - diet - this dressing is fantastic over our salad -- the mixture is great for a healthy body -- and love the taste -- will order again -- Gratitude, Bob"},{"rating":"2","title":"soooo good!

There is really no blood and gore and for Bruce being on the cover he had very little screen time.David Carradine tries and (for the short amount of time he spends on screen) so does Bruce Campbell, but the story is weak, the acting is poor and it leaves a lot to be desired. It does have a lot of pretty cool special features including some interviews with Bruce Campbell and some behind the scenes stuff.I'm not saying don't give it a shot, I'm just saying don't get your hopes up like I did!

This little gem is quite good because it has many things going on. It has focus on the family relationships after they arrive at Purgatory, Van Helsing's inept grandchild (Bruce Campbell) and war with two kinds of vampires. Cast was great. David Carradine showed charm in the role of the leading vampire. Bruce Campbell was hilarious as usual. John Ireland was similiar villain as David Warner in the Waxwork. Nice movie for evening in little town."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"The film is slow from beginning to end.

Love the cast, with everyone from Carol Burnett to Lillian Gish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed character development, Looser feel than previously","review":"David Weber and John Ringo have worked together to produce an enjoyable tale about the transformation of a spoiled aristocrat into a seasoned and even cynical combat commander. Over the series of books, however the style has become noticeably looser and much less formal, almost to the point of parady.Also available under very liberal ebook policies from Baen.com. Overall, an enjoyable read and continuation in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"March To The Stars","review":"Great book, although not as good as the first two. I only rate it low because the authors fragged us. The ending was SOOOO anticlimactic that I hereby call the authors to task. Hey guys, how about a little pocking closure? Did you have to kill off Captain Parner, and then leave us in the lurch to boot? We have lost too many friendly characters already. We sci-fi fans read for escape, not for unnecessary sadness. You have been unfair to the loyal readers who followed you through the ostensible trilogy. I fear that this Mardok batch is going to turn into something like Hubbard's boring-to-tears ten-volume \\"Mission Earth\\" series, as opposed to the wonderful \\"Mutineers' Moon\\" series. Shame on you authors for leaving us hanging like that! Shame again."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to Make Money Through Recycling","review":"The planet in this book should have been called Remagen, because this is definitely a \\"book too far\\". John Ringo seems to be taking lessons from Weber on how to stretch a plot on, and on, and on, and on. The characters in this installment go from scenario to scenario, repeating what has gone on several times before. There is no logic, no suspense, or even much enthusiasm to be drummed up. Then, when they finally get to make the assault that all three volumes have been leading up to, it turns out to be a complete anti-climax. To make it worse, Ringo and Weber use it to set up what looks to be an entirely new set of entries in the series, to be continued ad nauseum.Science fiction is supposed to explore _new_ frontiers. But unless you plan to just turn of your brain and any crtical faculties, there is absolutely nothing new here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book to bridge to the stars","review":"Webe had to get him to the stars to get him home... so he did. No, it is not the book the others were, but it was OK. The next book, whatever it is called, should be better. I would give it a 3.5, but gave it a 4 since I cannot use partial points.The relationship with Desperaux has its problems, but overall well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"The first two books in the series were good escapist literature told with humor and good military scenes. They did have a tendency to kill off some likable characters, but not too many and could be forgiven. The third book seems to betray what went on in the first two. The characters were not quite true to form. The book felt rushed and done just to get it in print for a deadline. The ending was very disappointing. How could the authors kill off some of the best characters and leave the situation hanging? Science fiction authors are getting into a bad habit of dragging a series out for all that it is worth, resulting in boredom and aggravation on the part of the readers after a while. I hope the authors reconsider where they are going with this series. Right now, I am not looking forward to book 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"A is for Arches... the REAL Utah symbol!","review":"What a nice book! Becky Hall maintains the standard in the Discover America State by State series with her descriptions of Utah history, geography, geology, and culture. Katherine Larson's illustrations are very detailed and nicely done. If you recognize a place or location (Hardware Ranch for me), you can't help notice the fine details she includes in her paintings.Nine species of wildlife occur in the illustrations.Brigham Young is mentioned 4 times.The Utah Jazz is mentioned once.Under \\"H is for Handcarts,\\" Hall writes \\"The pioneers' success proved that using handcarts was an efficient and inexpensive way to move large numbers of people westward.\\" Inexpensive, yes. Efficient... the journal entries describing the deaths and hardships lead to an alternative interpretation.Nevertheless, this is a very nice book to give to anyone who would like o learn more about Utah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Maligned Classic","review":"This CD is out-of-print in the U.S. It showcases a unique band at their peak and blows the roof off of similiar live albums of the time --no overdubs, lots of comedic interplay between bandmates. The horn section could \\"...turn goat milk into gasoline\\" as the Blues Brothers once commented, and Peter Wolf belts with the best. DO NOT be fooled by its anonymity -- this is a true-collector's classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Showtime!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The J.Geils Band's 1982 live album Showtime captures of the band at the height of its popularity.Showtime was recorded during the supporting tour for The J.Geils Band's 1981 breakthrough Freeze Frame.This probably works to the albums advantage,since the band is captured during the heigh of their popularity,and while they were still playing good.The one disadvantage of the album is that many fans know The J.Geils Band used to be a bluesier rock band,until the 1980's rolled around,so those who are looking for hits like Musta Got Lost, won't find any early material here.It's all from their years at EMI,so most selections are drawn from Sanctuary,Love Stinks and Freeze Frame with a few other songs thrown into the mix.Highlights include:Just Can't Wait,Love Stinks,I Do,the massage radio hit maybe their best known song Centerfold, and the closer Land of a Thousand Dances.A great live album,that captures an awesome band at the top of their game."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best rockin' live album i've ever heard","review":"I have owned \\"SHOWTIME\\" for at least ten years, and never get tired of it. When the announcer shouts \\"Are you ready...please welcome to the stage...The J. Geils Baaaaaand!\\", I know it's time to boogie. A previous reviewer, who went to one of these shows, says this is about a third of the concert. My only regret is JGB didn't put this performance on a double album. My other regret is Peter Wolf's later firing. Didn't you know you had the best frontman since Jagger? If you can't get enough pile-driving, boogie-woogie, ROCK AND ROLL, go for \\"SHOWTIME\\" and turn it up LOUD. Never mind the neighbors, they're probably jamming too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best detailed chucky doll out there!","review":"This has to be the best horror toy i ever owned! It does not come with any weapons which has to be my only complaint. The sculpt is superb and is totally accurate to bride of chuckys look for chucky. The clothing is also very nicely done and accurate. It has some cool rips and such. The articulation is common to that of a baby doll of some sort. It has some cool elbow joints that swivel but swivel in a way where they can look bend too. The paint job is also excellent the scars on his face look glossy and shiny. It also includes a cool display stand that has padding on the bottom which prevents scratches on chuckys sneakers.Chuckys box kinda resembles the good guys box in the movies. Over all this is a sweet doll and worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Only to Limited Audience","review":"The information is interesting, yet the book is very difficult to read. Any captive audience for this book is probably limited to those who have lived on North Carolina's Outer Banks; around Elizabeth City; and know some or all of the characters. Anyone else will likely lose interest early on due to the cumbersome presentation.I was constantly distracted by bad punctuation, bad grammar and bad formatting. The book jumps between first person and third person. Apparently the publisher, AuthorHouse, merely provided basic printing facilities without editorial expertise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A distinctive blend of romantic and political intrigue.","review":"Of all the books I've read in recent years that address the coming-out process, the finest is Ulster Alien. Beyond the issue of sexual self-discovery, which the novel explores admirably, the book also offers a glimpse into Ireland's turbulent, convoluted political situation. In a very real sense, then, it provides an unadorned lesson in modern Irish history, and for this reason was especially valuable to a non-Irish reader like myself having only limited knowledge of that nation's political state of affairs. The novel's characters are also true to life, as well as likeable, and the pace, brisk. In all, Ulster Alien is a warm, absorbing, and edifying book, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the coming-out process or in Northern Ireland politics during the latter half of the twentieth century."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful surprise!","review":"As a coming out story, this is one of the best I've read. What it captures so well is that period when you know you like guys but 'gay' and 'homosexual' hasn't attached itself to your view of yourself. The gradual evolution of Matt's self-awareness is beautifully presented as he interacts with his world. The author draws you into Matt's struggles; you identify and feel with him...and it's psychologically authentic, especially in the closing chapter. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely book","review":"This book is beautiful in its design and illustrations. More, it shows how the natural, semi-random, form of cowries can be modeled by, and generated from, mathematical equations (which are included in the book.)

In these days of the Internet, that's not necessary, but I'm absolutely certain (though without knowing) that you can download that material from Springer Verlag's website.

By far the most interesting computer book I've read in the last 5 years.It doesn't just take a \\"point there, click here\\" approach to showing you how to perform specific acts, nor does it try to be a reference volume. Instead, Linenberger takes a more philosophical and theoretical approach to time management (drawing from sources that include Franklin Covey and David Allen) and shows you how to apply these best practices using the Tablet PC.One of my favorite aspects of the book is how it demonstrates the tablet's ability to increase your productivity in meetings not just by taking excellent (and more useable) notes, but by allowing you to multitask and organize the data captured while it's being captured.What a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book!","review":"Do not buy this book!

Richmond Hill is still a wonderful place. The old neighbors are now gone, but that spirit of community is still there and a new history is being created!If you've ever had connections to Richmond Hill, this book will take you back to the old days.

I was a tad worried at first because the bag didn't seem like it was going to stand up very well but after encasing the maker for a few weeks I took out the maker and the case held its shape beautifully and didn't collapse. It is well made and well padded. It is sturdy and strong. The handles do not feel flimsy. I put the recipe books in the exterior pocket so they are close at hand. Great investment for our margarita maker! Very highly recommended. These machines are not easy to move around because they are heavy and the pitcher is glass and you don't want that to break. The bag eliminates all that worry and makes moving and carrying a cinch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Margaritaville is wherever you want it to be","review":"Cool accessory. Well made.

Had the authour noted the title has already been used in a 1985 Chuck Norris Movie? What will his next title be...\\"All Quiet on the Western Front?\\". Aside from ripping off the title from another \\"artistic\\" work, this book is filled with cliches. Cartoonish in character development, boring in subject matter, one must ask \\"Why I am reading this?\\". I kept reading it as I could not beleive it was so bad. Zero original thought, zero style - was it written by someone in grade 9? The author should consider taking a night class at a community college on creative writing, and then perhaps realize he can't write, and then consider becoming a janitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vic from Atlanta GA","review":"I have seen Delta Moon many times at Blind Willie's.

It didn't quite happen all the way, but I still like the product. It makes my skin look younger and my pores smaller. Just be really careful!!! I burned my face a couple of times for leaving it on too long. The burns weren't noticeable and scabbed away quickly, but it's still better to use precaution. I don't recommend doing your entire face on the first try because if you are too sensitive to it you'll be really screwed.Overall, I like it. Once the bottle runs out I will buy a higher concentration."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good!","review":"First of all my order arrived very quickly and in perfect condition so I was pleased about that. I have only used one time so far because you have to wait every 5-7 days to use again. It was my first time using any kind of acid peel so I was a little nervous. I left it on for 1 minute and there was a slight tingling sensation, but nothing too bad. Immediately after rinsing off product, I noticed how smooth and soft my face was. I'm very excited to use next week to see more results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Product","review":"I have had professional chemical peels and have done some at home peel/exfoliate products in the past. This product is dangerous to use and I am still suffering the results 6 days after I used it. It burned my skin (left it on the 4 minutes suggested)....not discomfort while doing it. I did not go near my eyes with the product. Hours later, both eyes were puffy, one was actually quite swollen underneath and bruised with reds and light purples. The redness and puffiness has finally begun to subside (6 days later) The worst part is that the swelling accentuates the creases and lines around my eyes and the skin around my left eye looks about 20 years older than I am (I am 47). I highly recommend NOT buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just ok, no big deal...","review":"I am a brown complexion african american female. I purchased this product with the intent that it would lighten the dark marks on my legs. I only used it in my face once and it burned like hell. Ultimately, I did a series of four treatments over four weeks. There is absolutely no difference in my dark marks except that they are a little lighter...just by maybe one shade. If I were to purchase another peel, I would definitely get a higher strength. This one doesn't peel at all. It was my first time, and now I know what to expect.

In short, it is simply a product of amazing quality. Glyco-Lac/60 gives you all of the benefits of improved skin clarity and a quality healthy glow, without any of the downtime associated with peels. Afterwards, my face felt so tight, I simply love this stuff! As for post peel moisturizing try: a 100% Hyaluronic Acid Serum and/or emu oil {If you are prone to breakouts like me, try mixing a tiny drop of either or both into your moisturizer and adjust the size of the drop to suit you skin. i.e., a full drop breaks me out, but half a drop mixed into enough moisturizer for my whole face and neck, leaves my skin is so moist, dewy and unbelievably supple}.

Apply with a brush, and I use it once a week. It tingles/stings a bit. I was afraid to leave it on too long, but this last week I removed my \\"peach fuzz\\" - then used the product. It really stung quite a bit, and my face turned red like a mild sunburn. I was a bit concerned, but in fact this was the best week yet - very mild flaking and now my skin looks MUCH improved - smoother, and fading of a sun/age spot is noticed.

He analyzes a range of topics, and my favorite essays deal with tall tales and narratives told by coon-hunters in Texas. The work is solid scholarship, and he provides empirical ways of researching and interpreting various forms of verbal expression. The collection may be most useful as models for additional studies, and there is a great variety of research topics evoked what Bauman discusses. At times, however, the conclusions are less-than earth-shattering, and the theoretical apparatus tends to get in the way of developing important conclusions and offering insight into why these conclusions are significant.

This one was soooo bad that we (literally) turned it off at about the 20 minute mark and finished it 2 days later. This movie has it all: horrible dialogue, atrocious animation, stupid fart jokes, random/unrelated scenes, WORSE song ever, and (being targeted to kids) it's absolutely a movie to avoid showing your children. It has scary sequences, inappropriate scenes like eating coins, and downright idiotic jokes and pranks that even made me cringe. Watch this movie if you're looking for a laugh with a couple of friends but do not... DO NOT let your children watch this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD MOVIE","review":"Plese don't show this movie to your children. I don't know how my daughter became acquainted with this awful movie, I think it was a free movie on Netflix my husband thought would be cute for her as she LOVES Nemo. Anyway, our Netflix kept skipping and I never watched beyond the opening scene so I had no idea what it was. My well-intentioned brother bought this for my daughter so she could actually watch it. TERRIBLE idea! About 10 min into it I wanted to stab my eyes out. I couldn't believe how scary the characters were (Even Nemo has a shark eating fish scene) but it was downright frightning. I now have to find a way to \\"misplace\\" this movie and hope my daughter forgets about it shortly."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful movie","review":"This is absolutely awful.

From the moment the first character opened it's mouth... my husband and I were giving each other looks asking each other why we were watching this? It wasn't until the kids starting making fun of the movie that we all began mocking it! If a 4 year old can recognize how bad this movie really is... it should have never been made! The acting is terrible, the storyline was choppy, the voices of some of the characters were like fingernails on a chalkboard and the bottom line is that whoever funded this project should have his head professionally examined! I will say, however, that the colors were very pretty on a HD television... that's the ONLY positive thing I can say!

He says _Various Positions: A Life of Leonard Cohen_ is for \\"besotted\\" Cohenites, whereas _Leonard Cohen: Prophet of the Heart_ is for the more \\"literary\\" minded. Turn this observation around and it makes sense, but as it stands it's the comment of a moron. Ira Nadel's biography is kind to Cohen, to be sure, (he had Cohen's full cooperation, after all), but it is not the fawning piece of dreck that is _Prophet of the Heart_. Nadel, in fact, uses _Prophet of the Heart_ as a source, for factual details and for some of Cohen's comments in it, but Nadel manages not to incorporate the syrupy crud that the folks who wrote _Prophet_ poured onto every page. Sheppard needs to learn what excessive deference is before his writing will inspire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rumford Fireplaces and How They are Made","review":"I'd still like to read this book.

It lacks detailed information on techniques and substitutes what is generally a \\"go out and buy\\" attitude. It encourages the purchase of materials such as premade scrapbooking items rather than giving ideas for an individual to make and incorporate in the creative act.Altering books is one of the crafts that affords the integration of everyday materials in a way that is fun and INEXPENSIVE. This book should have a shopping list in the back and get it over with.Showing examples of other artist's work is fine but if that is all there is the author could just put together a book of \\"other people's ideas\\".There are numerous other books on altered books and journals and I would encourage anyone interested in engaging in this craft look to those instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job","review":"The book at time can be a bit choppy but it gives a great birds eye view of how the riot actually transpired.

I found it really worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A well written but often slow moving story.","review":"\\"The Devil's Butcher Shop\\" by Roger Morris seems less a description of the Santa Fe prison uprising than an indictment of New Mexico's prison system. While the author writes solid,factual accounts of inexcusable corruption within New Mexico's corrections department,he dwells on it so long the reader tends to forget there ever was a riot."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Startlingly Poor Book by a Good Author","review":"Roger Morris must be ashamed of this book. Morris can write quite well as seen in his excellent book \\"Partners in Power \\".But 'The Devil's Butcher Shop' reads like a bunch of disjointed newspaper articles taped together. How anyone, especially a talent writer like Morris, could take such a horrific incident as the New Mexico prison riot and make it boring is hard to fathom.I'm embarrassed for Morris if he's not, this book is really bad. If you want to read about prison life try \\"Men Behind Bars\\" by Wooden & Parker, it will scare you to death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative; but misdirected.","review":"The author includes many interesting details of the riot, but seems to use most of the book to describe alleged corruption in New Mexico. He gives the feeling that the alleged corruption contributed to the start of the riot. He then takes the reader on long detours that have little or nothing to do with the riot itself. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Well, this is probably the most violent romance book I have ever read. I totally read the reviews and knew what I was in for. Still, after a certain point, I didn't know how many more beatings and rapes I could stomach. However, this book is defintely a page turner and I could not stop reading it until the happy ending.It was very intense and many times painful to read but it did involve my emotions. I felt sadness and pity for both of them even when Sean was a jerk. So, this book was written in the early 80's and most of todays romances are totally different. I couldn't help thinking that even modern romances have the \\"heros\\" as dark, dangerous and ruthless men. Yet, Sean is truly and sometimes disgustingly all of those things yet people are turned off by the reality of that description."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was an exciting and scintillating romance.","review":"Let me start by saying that Christine Monson is one of the lesser-known, but excellent romance novelists. The heroine of this story is Catherine Enderly, or Kit, as she is called by her lover, Sean Culhane. She is kidnapped by him as a means of revenge against her father. Her father had killed Sean's mother, and Sean decided to rape Catherine to avenge his mother's death...Catherine then marries her half brother, though she does not know he is such. Eventually, the two lovers reunite in a touching love scene that will touch and break your heart. This book made me cry, that is how intense it is. At first, I thought I would not like it for the raping, but it is one of the boundaries they overcome in their love. The emotional scenes are so deep, they will make you feel as if Sean and Catherine are real characters, not fiction. Buy this book-I can promise that you will not be sorry!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And this is a love story because........Huh?","review":"I painfully read the entire book hoping that this so called \\"love story\\" between Catherine and Sean would somehow rear it's \\"fluffy\\" head, however, It did not. This is a type of read that you will love or simply hate and all I could do was nod my head and say, \\"what the hell was the author thinking\\"? There were many times when I actually felt guilty reading this book and hoped it was all a bad dream for poor Catherine. I swear after reading this book I was so depressed that I needed a glass of wine to unwind. I won't even bother getting in to the details about the book because there are no words to explain the negativity and cruelty of this story.

Maybe he wanted to explore more emotionally orientated music but with his songwriting talent he could have made it sound much better than this, he was trying far too hard to be Mr. Sensitive.As a fan of the band from their debut album even seeing the band live a few times this album is an extreme let down.As another review mentioned there is a band called The Wildhearts who they are highly connected with (3CR's guitarist Chris McCormack is brother to Wildhearts ex-bassist Danny McCormack).

It also describes, sometimes directly, other times by nuances, what an extraordinary group the Jewish people are. Take any area of human endeavor, creation of knowledge or advance of Western Civilization and with all their foibles or fallibilities, Jews are and have been in the forefront of human growth.

His wife and daughter are in Cyprus at the US embassy and are taken hostage by a group of Islamic terrorists. Poyer takes the reader through Lenson's time at sea by reaching out from the ink and paper and pulling the reader into the heavy seas, the port calls, cramped compartments below deck, and the horror of a mob storming the American embassy and taking a man's family hostage along with several dozen others. It starts off a little slow, but turns into one helluvan epic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as his later stuff","review":"This is bit different from many of Poyer's other works. The center of the action is the USS Guam (a helicopter assault carrier). This is a different perspective and he carries it off well. Having read his later works first, I can see the impending disaster of Dan Lenson's marriage. The ending is bittersweet. You can see Poyer developing as a writer and his attention to detail is second to none.

Take metaphors and similes for example they play would die without them. They help just about every character express the depth of their feeling. Then comes Puns, this play thrives off Puns. Puns are used as a form of comic relief throughout out the play. Just like puns, Oxymorons help in expressing the confused feelings of the characters to the audience and other characters, and are essential to the flow of the play. Last and one of the most important types of figurative language in the play is Imagery. How could Romeo compare Juliet to all these wonderful things without imagery? Without Imagery, this play could not have been such a success to the original audience, because there were not many props to suggest the scene!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont watch this","review":"if you have academic knowledge about socities the video is BS!!,the author does not cover / know reality, all existing cults, economics and acutal issues.It is an individual's video, it a waste of time I will ask for refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst ever","review":"This was and I do not hesitate in saying the most boring ,uniformative film I ever wasted time (and I waste alot of time )on ,I wouldn't waste another nickel on this guys' movies"},{"rating":"2","title":"marvellous paintings","review":"I really love the artwork in this book.

I finally started putting dates on the batteries and found that they only last 2 months (1 month in a cold basement). I'm guessing I spent about $70 in batteries. The batteries are only there to kick in when the AC power fails, which it rarely does and never for very long. However, my tests indicate that the batteries are being drained while the AC power is properly working.I contacted the company for warranty replacements and was told I would have to pay $20 for shipping & HANDLING to get my \\"FREE\\" warranty replacements.

The most interesting bits were in the last 10%, like, the last 5 pages. The rest read more like a little kid's idea of \\"scary\\" pornography. Seriously. \\"Oh my god, maybe she's a lusty lesbian in denial!\\" Oooo, scary. Which, I must say - if you are disturbed by sexual violence, this book might likely bother you.It seemed like he meant it to have a psychological \\"fear of the true self\\" element but it was soooo shallow it was truly comical. And there's more interesting attempts at scientific phenomena in Pullman's His Dark Materials. MAYBE if I believed in ghosts I would have been more entertained, but I seriously doubt it. It maybe would work better as a graphic novel. A total yawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic horror tale","review":"This book has it all: A haunted house, a group of people who wish to dispel the evil that resides in it and a sinister presence behind the haunting.

I haven't read a \\"horror\\" book since 2001 when I read the dreadful \\"Dreamcatcher\\" which really put me off but this has made me want to read more again.The characters in Hell House can be a bit irritating - the sceptical doctor who gets hit on the head by a ghost but still won't believe in them, his pathetic mouse of a wife, the \\"loony\\" medium, and the do-nothing loner who....does nothing. But all together they make for a good read.I would have given this book 5 stars if it wasn't for the silly ending, but aside from that this book is well worth reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Have Been Brilliant","review":"Though I think this book failed to live up to its potential, I still believe it to be one of the three truly great haunted house novels out there. Shirley Jackson's _The_Haunting_of_Hill_House_ ranks at the top of that list, with Stephen King's _The_Shining_ close on its heels. Matheson's _Hell_House_ rounds out the top three. The parapsychology gets a bit hokey, and the characters aren't quite as well-rounded as I'd like, but I was impressed with this novel overall. Some readers are also going to be offended by sexuality and a depiction of a satanic chapel, although I have to say I didn't consider either to be gratuitous in any way. As several other reviewers have mentioned, it doesn't quite compare with Matheson's masterpiece _I_Am_Legend_, but it is an intelligent, well-written, incredibly fast-moving haunted house novel. If you like haunted house novels or if you're a fan of Matheson's other work, you won't be disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"An over-rated read","review":"I read this book hoping to be scared and amused. Unfortunately, I was amused, but for all the wrong reasons. This book is a collection of flat characters, and cliches which actually had me rolling my eyes at certain parts. The ending, which i will not disclose for those who haven't read \\"Hell House\\", was too convinient and neatly packaged, as well as ridiculous. I recommend \\"I am Ledgend\\" to readers who will better appreciate a scientific explanation of the supernatural that is suspenseful as well as entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many typos","review":"The story itself is great. The characters are interesting and the atmosphere is spooky. But this is ruined for me by all the typos. There are many cases of random punctuation and odd misspellings such Fie instead of He. There are typos on about every fourth page or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent book....Terrible proofreading in Kindle Edition","review":"This book filled my need for a nice horror story while on vacation. Not terrific, not highly original, but a decent version of the Haunted House genre. My biggest complaint was the terribly inadequate proof reading in the Kindle version. It appears to have been scanned and converted with OCR software with only a cursory proof read. \\"He\\" often shows up as \\"Fie\\", exclamation points appear as ! or ] and places in the scanned text that were hyphenated at ends of lines keep the hyphen. I'm guessing these showed up roughly every 5 pages (on my settings), more often in certain sections. If this sort of sloppiness bothers you, stay away.Hopefully, they can fix these errors and let us who bought the flawed version update....but I'm not holding my breath!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor imitation of Hill House","review":"Richard Matheson is undoubtedly one of the greatest writers of the horror genre, but this novel goes no further than being a very feeble imitation of Shirley Jackson' \\"Haunting of the Hill House\\". The characters are shallow, the setting is too exagerrated, and the climax is really, really poor. If you are a fan of haunted house novels, then Hell House may interest you, but I'd definitely suggest other books of haunting than this loss of time. Try Jackson's masterpiece, Marasco's \\"Burnt Offerings\\" or King's \\"Shining\\", they all are far better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but I liked the movie a little better...","review":"Although someone mentioned that the movie \\"The Legend of Hell House\\" was written word for word from the book, I would say that is only partially true. The book does give a bit more insight, but I would have to say that I was more impressed with the film version. To me, Belasco house was more suited to a bleak English countryside than...Maine? Also I liked the character of Florence Tanner in the film much better; she wasn't very young or virginal in the book, and I thought that aspect of the film gave her more depth. A good read, though, and scary, even after viewing the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good...","review":"I felt this story was really lacking. The characters were really shallow. It relied too heavily on the shock value of the profane of religion and sexuality. I didn't find it scary at all.

Sound familiar? That's because Shirley Jackson already did it in the masterpiece \\"The Haunting of Hill House,\\" which I recommend 100% more than this book. \\"Hell House\\" is not scary. The storyline is choppy and the writing isn't good. Richard Matheson is a wonderful writer, but dropped the ball with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read!","review":"I purchased Hell House to read since I like horror stories and Ghosts. I can say this book keeps your intrest from begining to end, not a dull moment.Richard Matheson is pretty talented and imaginative in his books, bringing it to life and plus you should have a vivid imagination to boot, that is what makes the book so interesting, that.., and the writer.

A very good read, engaging story, very hard to put down, because you want to find out WHAT. HAPPENS. NEXT. But the excessive gore described, and unabashed variations of sexuality depicted, are not for the weak of stomach. I actually felt queasy at some scenes, they were so vividly written. I can see how this would be groundbreaking writing for the early 1970's .. it just WENT FOR IT! and it works, It all fits into the story. But, it was quite a shock when a lot of 70's horror novels are pretty tame by comparison. This Makes Stephen King's Carrie, look like Twilight. This is a masterpiece of horror fiction, and I enjoyed most of the story. but be warned. this is not a book for a bedtime story, and definitely not one for the kiddies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and predictable","review":"There are better works by Richard Matheson, don't waste money and time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found the characters irritating and the plot devices worn and overly contrived. I couldn't finish the book. It felt like a knock off of Shirley Jackson and not nearly so well done. I really expected more from such a respected author. Maybe if I'd read it back in the 70's I'd be less critical. As I thought about this book over the last week I was repeatedly reminded of the cliched image of a volumptous blond in a negligee holding a candle as she descended the cellar stairs to investigate a noise. I thought the characters behaved stupidly. I routinely enjoy horror fiction and don't raise the bar too high. So many people appear to have enjoyed this book; I feel a bit cheated that I didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will get you!","review":"One of the scariest books ever written.

It took me back to a time when cell phones weren't a norm, where a book was the only means for passing time (no mp3 player nor Ipad, nor an e-reader.) I loved the book. It was to the point yet with enough vivid imagery to keep the reader glued to it because he/she is with the characters in the book... in Hell House.If you're planning to read this book, just remember; every word counts. You'll get my meaning by the end of the book :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short, Hard Hitting, and Tense","review":"This little work is hard hitting and extremely tense throughout most of the book. I am glad it is not a very long book as the suspense would probably have been too much to sustain over a long period.I started reading this book knowing nothing of its plot and nothing about the movie based on it. I feel that was probably the best way. Knowing anything about what happens in the book other than the basic premise would probably ruin it.This is the only book I've ever read that was actually scary. The setting is amazingly dark.

Thus the reason I only give 4/5 stars.Now, the good stuff:Despite the a for mentioned \\"mental pornography\\", this was a really well written book. At no time was I thinking \\"Okay, get on with it!!\\" or \\"Hmm, I wonder what's on tv.\\" I think the background story was smashing.

Took me awhile to get around to Hell House, but once I started I couldn't put it down. Had to finish as soon as possible because the book sucked me in from the very beginning. I loved the description of Belasco - his teeth, his face, his house - this character rewrote the definition of evil. The great thing about Matheson's writing is that he holds back nothing. No sunny Hollywood endings, which is how I like my horror. The way he beat down the 4 main characters and the various \\"spooks\\" that took place within the house was brilliant. If I could write a haunted house story half as good as Hell House I'd be a happy man! I highly recommend this book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boo!","review":"This book scared the heck out of me years ago when I read it... I found it used here and re-read it... man, still scary stuff!

Be forwarned... there is some disturbing sexual imagery, if you're okay with that... it's a spooky read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Japanese Voice","review":"I was already familiar with Miyoshi Umeki's performances in movies such as \\"Sayonara,\\" and \\"Flower Drum Song\\"; but when I read that she had a singing career before appearing in movies, I got curious. I was happy to find two of her 1960(?) LPs that recently became available as CDs. I bought her \\"Miyoshi\\" CD and was charmed by her sweet voice. On this CD, my personal favorites are \\"Gone with the Wind,\\" \\"You Make Me Feel So Young,\\" and \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me.\\" This CD grew on me: The more I heard it, the more I liked it. I am just minutes away from ordering her other CD. By the way, through a bit of internet research on her before I bought her CD, I discovered that she lives in Hawaii and is 73 years old. I hope she's doing well because she made my day."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME GHOST HUNT","review":"This was an awesome paranormal investigation and they added captured moments from the previous investigation of the Stanley Hotel in this 3 hour ghost hunt. Wrestler CM Punk was along for the 3 hour tour....which only enhanced the investigation. This was a live event and callers could text or call to give history of the hotel, of paranormal events people had witnessed while at the hotel and they could ask the investigators to check out areas of the hotel to look for paranormal evidence.I have watched this event several times and I'm at awe with paranormal investigations."},{"rating":"2","title":"TAPS IS THE BEST","review":"The Ghost Hunters return to the Shining Hotel to discover another ghostly paranormal of a ghost saying \\"hello\\" to them and repeats it several times. There is even a funny seen of someone trying to prank the team by ringing the telephones in the hotel."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Ghost Hunters","review":"I been collecting anything on ghost hunters since the show comes out, its not the hole 6 hours but i love it anyways & they r funny as hell...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Not too impressed. Lost intrest when Ghost Hunters brought in a celebrity to help them investigate the hotel and also had it as a live broadcast with viewers imput via text messages during the show. I still haven't finish the dvd yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not enough of the stuff","review":"My big complaint with Ghosthunters as a whole is that they focus on the two most uninteresting personalities (Uncle Fester Jason and Grant the mouse) and the characters who have some energy and something to say (example Dustin and Steve) don't get enough showtime. Dustin is the stuff, Curly & Shemp should recognize."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],C={key:0},H={key:1};function M(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",C,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(O,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-990d19ab"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/62.md","filePath":"people/62.md"}'),R={name:"people/62.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
