United Camera and Binocular Repair, Kodak's nonwarranty repair center, wanted $193 to repair it.. Of coarse I'm not going to pay that much since the camera didnt cost much more than that anyway.

Now that I've had this camera for almost a year, it's been nothing but a huge headache. It sucks batteries like anything else. The rechargeable Ni-MH batteries I got from Kodak barely work at all (camera only takes 2-3 pictures before flashing a low battery sign) even after repeated chargings. Alkaline batteries are also completely useless. Be prepared to buy a lot of expensive lithium batteries. Just yesterday, the lens cover stopped closing, even with a brand new lithium battery. I've had it sent back to Kodak for repair a couple of months ago, and am now sending it back for repair a second time. Wish I'd never bought this camera!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Software Comes With This Camera","review":"I love the Kodak EasyShare cameras but I'm very unhappy with the software that comes with it. Kodak forces you into using their software as it's the only way to get the pictures out of the camera unless you use a drive for your SD card. Once inside the software, you can't rename picture files or save them to another folder. Neither can you select a group of pictures and copy or drag and drop them to another program. You can't even see the name of the picture file unless go to properties and then parse it out of an unfriendly name. The software was made to lock you into using ofoto to share/print your pictures. This software is extremely basic and suitable only for the beginning digital photo user or someone who only wants to print with the Kodak Camera dock. If you want to do anything more complex, buy another brand that doesn't lock you into their software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this camera and printer dock only to find the software and other components are difficult to use. I ended up purchasing a new computer thinking maybe my computer was getting out dated and still with a brand new state of the art system it is still not working properly. Also the pictures are not clear when printed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes good pictures, but you can't download to PC","review":"As far as digital cameras go, this is a nice one from the picture taking perspective. However, given that it's very difficult to configure this camera for use with a Windows XP laptop computer, this camera should be avoided by the shopping public. The instructions are not clear, there is no support person to speak with (Kodak tells you it's a problem with Microsoft and thus not their issue), and now I've got a camera with 200+ pictures on it that I can't get transferred to a PC of any kind (what a waste!). OVERALL RATING: DON'T BUY THIS! Get some other vendor's camera (Fuji, Panasonic, Sony, anybody)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family camera","review":"My first digital camera and it suits my needs for family photos, vacations, etc. I purchased both the Kodak LS440 with 4mp and DX6340 and instantly knew I liked the DX6340 better. But I was concerned about the quality of prints of the 4mp over the newer features of the 6340. While I was at Best Buy I was able to talk to a Kodak rep. For features the DX6340 has much more and the flash is good to 19ft compared to 10ft. for the LS440. A major selling point for me. Overall quality of print was minor, he showed me 8 x 10's from the DX and LS. Battery life for the LS is better but I haven't had any issues with the DX. You could wait until the fall when kodak releases the upgrade to the 6340 with 4mp then you'd really have a good camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lens problem & non-reponsive customer service","review":"After a week of use, the lens stopped retracting, rendering the camera nonfunctional. Kodak customer service insists that I must have dropped it (I didn't) and refuses to fix the camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good pictures, weak body, weak software","review":"The DX6340 does take excellent pictures. As with most digital cameras there is an annoying delay between pressing the shutter release and the actual picture \\"event\\", but unless you spend a lot more money, it's something you live with when you go digital. Plenty of options for the price. Again, no qualms with the photo quality.The body of the camera, however, is not reliable. The automatic lens \\"door\\" that opens when you turn on the camera frequently gets stuck and the battery door broke after a year and a half. To replace that part you'd have to replace the entire body of the camera. This also happened to a family member who has a Kodak. If this happens, buy silver duct tape...at least it matches the camera color.The software is very touchy and locks up frequently and will sometimes require an entire PC reboot.I would not buy Kodak Easyshare again unless those three problems are resolved."},{"rating":"1","title":"only works for a year","review":"I was quite happy with this camera for about a year. Then, had similar problems as others-- battery door broke so the camera constantly shuts itself off (I've been trying to keep it shut with tape) and the shutter doesn't completely open or close, sometimes staying shut even when turned on. Basically, it's useless after a year, so not worth the money at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great - but only when it works","review":"When I first bought the DX6340 last summer, I found the camera easy to use and I was pleased with the picture quality. But as time went by, I have found that actually taking pictures with this camera hasn't been easy. Its been in for repairs two times - and had two CPU's and circuit boards replaced. Its heading in for its third repair this week. Within days of it arriving home from the repair shop, it has stopped working again. Its incredibly infuriating because I've lost holiday and birthday photos which I can't replace. They look great on the LCD, but after they're downloaded its evident that the photos are horribly distorted. Alternatively, the camera stops allowing me to download pictures entirely. Its a shame since I've had great success with Kodak products in the past. Recommendation - avoid this camera like the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pictures but night time shots need improvement","review":"I got this camera as a gift. It takes pictures with very rich colors and sharpness if you do the focus right. I am not happy with the night time shots but some have said they will come out good if a tripod is used or the camera remains steady for sometime after taking pictures. Also the well known issue is the battery case cover which is flimsy.I purchased a 256 mb card to store the pictures. Also am pleased with the video mode which comes out fine.All in all a good camera for a first time digital camera buyer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mac's camera","review":"I inserted batteries and took four pictures.

I had this camera for just about year when the door cracked. It worked for a little while after that with duct tape, but that doesn't even work anymore. Then shortly after it happened to the other model. I think it is a shame that Kodak made these wrong and will not repair them for free. May I recommend the Canon A550 or A560.

The 4x zoom is awesome and so much better than you get on most 3mp cameras BUT you should know the camera is very big... I bought it online and it's much bigger and bulkier than I expected. It's like the size of a normal 35mm camera. It's not one you'll throw in your pocket or purse and forget about. Just something to consider. I was deciding between this and the Canon SD100 and had I seen them side by side, I probably would have chosen the Canon just based on size and portability."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 stars! Good camera for its class.","review":"I compared this camera to a Canon A70, and though I liked the physical design of the Canon more, the Kodak had the better image quality. I think this is due to the 4x optical zoom Schneider lens. Supposedly, Schneider is one of the best lens makers in the world. The features are pretty nice too, and the camera is easy to use. I didn't give it the full five stars because it is still only 3MP (but it's a very good 3MP camera), and because it does not feel as good in your hands as some other cameras. It's also not that small, which may or may not be important to you.

However after 3 years of use at the normal setting with the fan on low, it has completely stopped working and won't even light up. There is a 5 year warranty on the compressor, but it costs $150 - $250 to replace a compressor according to the service people that Haier referred us to, and who knows if the compressor is the problem. In fairness we had forgotten there was a removable filter to clean, but the two previous dehumidifiers that lasted about 15 years each in the same situation didn't even have filters.

It's in the basement and we have not had a dehumidifier down there for maybe 3 months. This Haier pulled moisture out the the air very well!! For the first week I had to empty the bucket 2 times a day! I had my husband hook up the hose thingy so we don't have to keep doing that. The fan does run a lot and it is a bit noisy, but it's in an unfinished basement so I don't care. I don't know how much electric it uses but I could not find a dehumidifier that was 'green' and cheap. So, bottom line- works well, kinda noisy, and the hose thingy has not leaked yet and we have had it for 4 months or so now. ps. don't forget to clean the filter once in a while!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lotsa water in the air","review":"We put this dehumidifier in a finished basement that had a damp smell.

This product is supposed to be used directly on the tool for cutting metal; whether that is steel, stainless steel, aluminum, etc. It worked okay but you really do have to apply after every cut, regardless of the process.

I love morals and Christian lessons but sometimes enough is enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive Angst","review":"The idea behind this book was good and held promise. However, the writing was absolutely pretty bad. The author should win a medal for saying, \\"I've loved him for 10 years; what do I do now that he has returned?\\" 100 different ways. That was, basically, the first half of the book. The second half was the guy saying, \\"I've loved her for 10 years and I'm not going to lose her.\\" 100 different ways. Throw in the same sermon said 100 different ways and you have this book in a nutshell. The angst, worry, and drama emoted by each character would make a 14 year old proud. There wasn't even redemption in the ending. The author had a good idea here, but her delivery needs a lot of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"I picked up this book, excited to find another christian romance series from an author I had never read before. About halfway into the book, I realized why. The writing in this book is probably something similar to the books I wrote when I was thirteen. The plot was rushed and pointless, the \\"christian\\" characters were fake and unrealistic, and the romance? I can't stand stories of unrequited love when suddenly a light bulb clicks - \\"Oh, she's so pretty and smart and wonderful. Why didn't I see it before? I must be in love!\\" THAT is the epitome of forced, and I'm not exaggerating one bit. I did finish reading the book, but at the expense of a wasted afternoon.

I now have another author I know to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly below average","review":"I found the setting of the Alaskan village very interesting. Descriptions of the dwelling(inne), food, and clothing also interesting. However, the first few chapters that I suffered through were poorly written and lacked emotional depth.

I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't realize this was a series of books","review":"I am only glad that it was a free download, but just the time that it took to read it was painful.

It sat comfortably. Then I put the footrest out and although took a little effort to get in position I floated with confort and in a good position to get a tan. My legs were out of the water and although the seat is mesh I was held up out of the water adequately. I would suggest this product to anyone looking at this type of float. I would note I was standing on pool steps to get on the float."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help. I'm sinking","review":"Bought two of these as they looked pretty much like a great floater Sevylor used to make, but discontinued. These are very difficult to fill with air, unless you have a very special pump and adapter - which is not provided and not mentioned when you purchase. The main air fill hole is over an inch in diameter, thus making it difficult to fill with a regular air hose hooked up to an air compressor. I jury rigged a device and was able to get it blown up without the special adapter. The problem now is that they both leak air and must be blown up on a daily basis. Other than that, the design is great and it is the best pool floater design I have ever come across. If only they didn't leak air! BTW, the Sevylor floaters are still in use and work GREAT. I just wanted to add to my fleet - but I wasn't looking for submarines!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for rafting multiple together! High Quality canvas.","review":"Have used this at our beachhouse and purchased it because several neighbors had same model. I have had sportstuff floats in the past which lasted 3 years (that's good for constant use on salt water and dragging over a beach). But for some reason, bought a less expensive blue model this year (still not cheap) so mine wouldn't be exact. Learned quickly - if it ain't broke, dont fix it! We're on salt water, have kids dragging over oyster shells and over bulkheads. It is comfortable, sturdy canvas protects the vinyl, has two drink holders (important for us) and the best part it is the only one I found that has hands on both arm rests which are essential for rafting multiple together. Totally worth the money - would not pay more for it though. Wish it would go on sale from time to time but so far have always had to pay full price!

Getting it to backup/sync with my main computer was a chore. Entering data was not easy. It was slow, even with added RAM. Then I got a Casio E-10. Faster. It easily synced with MS Outlook. The IR feature worked great with my portable. Just turn both on, point the IRs at each other and, seconds later, all done. No cradle needed (although one was included). Easy to enter data using virtual keyboard or hand printing (no special characters like Palm's Jot). But visibility in bright daylight was bad.

And that said, I must point out that this is not intended to be like the other Rocky films.

Rocky's only possession is Mick's old gym, and it is outside that gym that Rocky meets Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison - I think is his real name).

Though I hear a fifth sequel is in production, I won't judge until I see it, but assuming this is indeed the final Rocky film I think it was a good return to the elements that made the first film so memorable. Also, the director and cast of the original film return here. I was disappointed at first about the main characters' losses at the beginning of the film, but they became closer as a femily and returned to a neighborhood where they are loved. I appreciate the film's emphasis on family and the importance of sharing wisdom with the right people. Though the fight at the climax of the film takes a detour from the typical boxing finales of the previous films, I personally enjoyed it.

The only thing I liked about this was the return to the familiar Philadelphia inner-city setting. This film was shot on the same location as the exellent ROCKY I and its as if they are trodding on sacred ground. The sequels of II, III, and IV were at least watchable and entertaining with II being the best of the sequels, but this one is not worth the time. There is an interesting sequence as the ending credits roll and the Elton John song \\"Measure of a Man\\" plays on the soundtrack(we are treated to a series of B&W photos of all 5 films in a chronological order) while assuring us that this is, indeed, THE END."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK for a Rocky fan to say this movie stunk","review":"Heck, the Director said it stunk and he is the same director that directed the original Rocky. John Alvidsen said he was not interested in doing Rocky V, but then he was told by Rocky that in it, Rocky would die. So Alvidsen felt an obligation to do it, since he gave birth to the series. HOWEVER, the studio informed Sly and Alvidsen that Rocky could not die. Without that major development, the movie was doomed. There is very little boxing in this movie and it just might be Sly's worst performance ever. This series seemed to follow a regressive pattern.

Rocky is retired and Mick and Apollo are both dead. Tommy Gunn, a real life pro boxer becomes the new face of boxing and Rocky is passe.

Not worth seeing unless you were really moved like myself by the first film. Rocky and Tommy Gunn duke it out in a street fight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie but Rocky doesn't fight much in this!","review":"It's just about Rocky retiring from boxing and he helps his son become a streetfighter to protect himself from bullies at school. What's interesting about this movie is that Sylvestor Stallone's son Sage Stallone appears in this and the character he plays is Rocky's son also. Rocky also helps this guy fights but this movie doesn't get exciting till the end. It's still a good movie just not exciting as the others.

When people went to see the Rocky movies, they expected to see prizefights. Not a street fight. At the beginning of each Rocky movie (except for the first and sixth one) it showed the ending of the fight he had in the previous movie. Why wasn't the ending of the street fight shown in Rocky Balboa? It was obviously not shown because the street fight was pathetic.Another thing that hurt this movie was that Rocky lost all of his money. Many fans hated this.

I wanted to write reviews for the individual films. This review is for the film and the older release DVD.I have to give Stallone credit for trying to go somewhere new with the series, but this film just has too many clichés to keep it from being very good. Stallone's real life son is a terrible actor and is one of the reasons this film is the worst in the series. Overall the formula keeps you watching and the film is entertaining if you don't think about it too long.The DVD transfer on my edition is OK, but there is room for improvement.*** ADDED NOTE ***The worst film in this series is kind of unclear, as part's 4 or 5 could be viewed as the worst installment. While both films are entertaining, they are the least in the Rocky franchise. This point was brought to my attention by an Amazon buddy!Thank You Stan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"QUIT WHILE YOUR ON TOP.","review":"I loved Rocky 1, but why ruin a classic.

He loses all his money, goes back to the streets of Philly, and gets into a street fight with Tommy Morrison...A boxing match? Nah, I think we'll skip that.\\"By the end, Rocky is still broke, Tommy is still the champion, and Rocky has a lawsuit on his hands because he punched the promoter. Oh, I almost forgot! There's a \\"subplot\\" involving Rocky's son, who now owns an earring. Wow - what a great storyline!As sad as it is to say, a Stallone DVD collection of \\"Spy Kids 3,\\" \\"Get Carter,\\" and \\"An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn\\" would be a marginal improvement over this bomb."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story of every fighting man!","review":"The last thing to go on any fighting man is his pride.

Allthough Rocky is a fictional character he inbodys the fighting spirit of all men who are involved in combat sports. Once you have won a title you are forever changed even as age takes its toll and your body fails you can never take away the heart that mayed your achievement possible.

At least, writing style of this book made A and P easier to learn. The material is presented in organized fashion. However, if you really want to know the type of questions asked on college Anatomy and Physiology Exams get the following which is on amazon: Anatomy and Physiology Study Guide: Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations Volume 1(ISBN: 0971999619) and Volume 2 (ISBN: 0971999627). These two helped me to get A's on my exams. The textbook and the two study guides are well worth the money since they helped me to pass with high grades the first time.

I believe they officially changed thier name to Magnolia Electric Co. after this disc. This was the first disc I heard from this group. I instantly liked the disc. I sought out older discs by Songs:Ohia and found more great music, but they seemed to be paving the way for this record. The music has sort of a country/alt rock type sound that is hard to classify. Jason Molina lead vocals have a unique sound with great lyrics. There is a sense of sadness to most of the tracks, but the album is not a downer as most songs also seem to have a few lines expressing some type of hope or longing.Simply put, I really like this disc and I always will wonder why a group with such a great sound goes somewhat unknown"},{"rating":"2","title":"Post Script to Songs: Ohia's \\"MEC\\" review","review":"READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY THIS ALBUM!!

Because it has a bonus track titled \\"The Big Game Is Every Night.\\" As with the other eight tracks that are on the US release, it is incredible. ALSO FIND AND PURCHASE THE VINYL. Why again you ask? Because the vinyl or lp version includes a bonus CD of Jason Molina's acoustic versions of the the of the entire album, even the bonus track. Even if you don't have a turn table, the fourteen or so bucks you spend on it will be worth the nine track CD you get. After roughly two months of continuous listening, I firmly believe that this is a landmark album in music. If there was any justice in today's world of musical mediocrity, this artist and album would without a doubt be the recipient's of numerous Grammy's.***UPDATE***02/17/07I am still loving this album.

The elastic was stretched out within an hour from taking it off and putting it back on repeatedly. The plastic shoes also cracked and eventually broke to the point where they were no longer wearable.

She sometimes wears just the skirt overlay and headband, sometimes just the fairy wings and sometimes she wears it all. She receives numerous complements every day. We paid twenty-two and feel that it was really worth the price. One more thing, she is a tall girl and wears a size 5-6 dress and size 1 shoe and there is plenty of room for growth.

It varies from place to place in the recording and is too soft in places, too loud in others.3) There is no translation of Japanese text in the english version without the subtitles.

The Comte however deserves the shame - I didn't however expect him to respond as he did as a result of this shame being exposed. That was a shock. There is a huge age gap between our hero and heroine but the chemistry works. I loved Leonie's spunk and fire. It was kind of a challenge for me to keep the characters straight...at times their first names are used and at times their rank and at times their last names. Just so many men to recall. smiles.

Instead of England,it is set in France and the hero walks around in high heels, waving a fan, and pinching snuff with a heart which has been untouched for a long time. His acquiring the ward Leo (soon to become Leonie) is a unsettling role for this jaded rake. Although never unkind, he seems to be unfeeling toward Leo (Leonie) and always is moving toward vengance.

I checked the bag at the airport twice and noticed minor wear and tear, but nothing too major."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product--perfect size","review":"I was worried that this travel bag would not be big enough to hold an infant rear facing seat. I was worried it was designed for a toddler size one piece seat. I shouldn't have worried. This bag fit the infant seat PLUS its base. In addition we were able to put our coats into the bag along with the seat at the airport so we didn't have to drag the coats on the plane. I would recommend this bag to anyone who travels with an infant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Made travel easier","review":"I was very happy with the travel bag.

Not only did it easily accommodate the seat, there was room to spare. (I also have an Eddie Bauer seat that it will probably be used for eventually, too.)Like I've seen in other people's reviews around the web, I tossed in some extra diapers and wipes and other things that I didn't mind getting thrown around in luggage.The cover held up beautifully, even under United's rough handling. This is what I was looking for - something durable with a heavier gauge than the red seat covers you see that look like they are made from a thin nylon.The cover was excellent and I can see it lasting through other trips as well. If you run across one, I recommend that you grab it up immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get seat in","review":"We had this for a little while in the quest for one good bag that would meet our needs. There is only one zipper down the center so it opens like a clam shell, which makes it really tough to get the seat in and out. It naturally wants to close as you push something in or pull it out, so it just made it a frustrating experience. The single strap is pretty useless, too, because there is no way to effectively carry it despite what the smiling people in the pictures look like. It hurts your back and is off balance so you need to hold the seat, which means it really doesn't make it hand(s)-freeThe only reason it doesn't get one star is that there are worse ones on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"great size but not durable","review":"We used this product once which was wonderful while the strap lasted. On our way back home from vacation the strap broke in the airport before we even made it to check our luggage. The size is great, but the one over the shoulder or across the chest strap is a loss. Two shoulder straps would probably have made this bag much more efficient and durable. Maybe they will come out with a new and improved bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"carseat and more","review":"I had bought this right before we moved 1/2 ways across the world. It was perfect. We were able to fit out Chicco Keyfit and teh Graco Turbo booster in this bag. It turned out that we needed an extra bag, so I took the carseat out and replaced it with the First Years reclining booster seat (for eating), a boppy and some clothes and had a ton of room. For the price it did exactly what it was supposed to do. The only thing that would make this product better is to have wheels and a handle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this bag!","review":"We bought this bag to protect our Evenflo Triumph car seat on our first flight with all the baby equipment. I had seen people check their car seats in garbage bags before, but wanted the car seat to be protected. The car seat fit in easily with plenty of room to spare. We packed my son's clothes for a week in the bag too. The straps are a little awkward, but we were able to get everything checked in OK. The bag still looks brand new after our trip! We had a total of 4 different flights. There will be room to add a booster seat in the same bag when baby #2 comes along. I know we will get a ton of use from this bag in the years to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect travel bag","review":"In the past I always used a heavy trash bag to put my carseat into.

The bag also held up well through the entire trip!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too bulky","review":"I was hoping that I would be able to use this like a backpack, but it only had one trap( It would have worked much better if you could carry it like a backback). It was impossible to push a stroller with two hands and keep the car seat from fall off my shoulder. If I tried to hook it on the stroller it would drag on the ground. It just made the car seat that much more bulker. Granted, if you have others to help you, it is nice to be able to pack other things in with the car seat,as there is ample space. I will be traveling alot this summer, and I won't use this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't live without it","review":"I recently purchased this item to travel to visit family for two weeks. I was able to place so many of my daughters toys, in addition to the car seat, in the travel bag that her two week stay in unfamiliar territory was easy on her. The only problem I had with the bag is that two small holes were rubbed into it by the carseat base during the return flight. I believe this was due to my overpacking, (you cannot imagine how much this holds) and not due to any problem with the canvas that makes up the bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Travel","review":"We loved this car seat travel bag. It doesn't provide the best protection since it's thin material, but my car seat hasn't been damaged and we have used it for 2 years now. I would practice putting your seat in it at home so you aren't struggling with it at the airport. Don't lose the straps it becomes a pain to carry. My husband has to lug this around, he wishes it was more of a back pack then a duffle bag, but this really is a great item. Even our huge Wizard Convertible car seat fits in this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bag, but a little uncomfortable to carry","review":"This bag is great! It performs as advertised and there's a lot of room within the bag and in the side pockets to carry those extra baby essentials. This bag fit our Eddie Bauer Car Seat perfectly!Being the daddy and having to tote this around the airport, the one design feature that I think could be better designed was the shoulder strap. It's a standard nylon shoulder strap which tends to get a little uncomfortable after walking around the airport for more than 10 minutes. I believe that a padded strap would do the trick or even better if they designed the bag with two shoulder straps so the bag could be carried like a backpack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit Britax","review":"I see reviews that the bag fits the Marathon and reviews that say it doesn't. We bought the travel bag last August and it does NOT fit our Marathon without pulling down the material on the seat and literally forcing the bag to close. We make it work but it is a pain. It is great to have the carrying strap. We have used it on three trips and only have had to check it once. However it is already showing signs of wear with holes in the bag.

I've used it to cover three different seats (all various sizes and shapes and brands) and the seat always fits inside. Its also stood up to rough handling from the airlines with minimal damage (a little scuffing on the fabric). When not in use it doesn't fold perfectly flat, however, the seams are a bit stiff, as is the fabric - just a note if storage is an issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!!!","review":"We purchased 2 of these for transporting our car seats when flying with the twins...They are thick, durable, and have *plenty* of space in the bags.

The idea of a \\"Great Western Series\\" in the sixties was logical but sadly missing in detail and depth.

Obviously, the more Farsi you know the easier it is to use. What I like about this dictionary the most is that it has Farsi to English and English to Farsi in one volume. Furthermore, definitions for common words are usually followed by synonyms, related words and contextual examples, sometimes sentences utilizing the word being defined, sometimes common phrases.

A. Jay Cristol investigated this accident for 14 years and even viewed the plane's gun camera film which showed smoke rising from the Liberty, proving that that the flag would have been impossible to see.Neither of the authors here spent $75,000 of their own money. Neither of these propagandists interviewed the CIA's then station chief at the Tel Aviv embassy. Neither of these bogus authors talked with the 3 living IDF pilots who strafedthe Lberty.In short the information here is mostly based on hearsay that cannot be affirmed by anyone i.e. it's a book based on lies.Don't waste your time with these venomous opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"More conspiracy nonsense","review":"This book is so far fetched its still hard to believe that someone would publish this. The theory's are so out of space, does one even think before accepting them at face value. The author states that Lyndon Johnson had Israel attack the ship and to make it look like Egypt did it so that we could drop a nuclear weapon on Egypt. If this were so, no country in the world would have tolerated the US using a nuclear weapon as retaliation for attacking a US ship. I note that many footnotes used unnamed sources. Of course when using former intelligence authors as sources requires the lack of use of the sources name, it makes it impossible to check out the sources. Lets not kid ourselves, conspiracy theorists all have the same M.O. They believe everything in life is a conspiracy without even checking the common sense test.

The verbal pyrotechnics may irritate at first, especially the Whitmanesque, over-whimsical vocabulary (which had me gritting my teeth initially), but once you clear the first few 'episodes' (and the recommended reading method does help ease you into the style) it's easy to become hooked, and ultimately it becomes clear that it really couldn't have been written any other way. Sam and Hailey's enthusiasm for each other and for their ultimately doomed voyage is undeniably contagious.

It's simply incomprehensible. Or is it that it seems the payoff simply isn't worth the effort involved? Regardless, it went back to the library mostly unread. I just can't devote the time.I applaud any artist who pushes the envelope of their media, but stuff like this just obliterates its audience, and it becomes a would-be avant writer's House Of Games.

Not suited to GURU's style of flow at all. I'm only going to listen to it one more time to make sure I didn't miss anything and then to the used CD store. GURU was a hero for rap music on his crusade against wackness, but this album will sit in the pile of wackness that is rap music of this era. It's such a shame. DON'T GO OUT OUT LIKE THIS GURU!

The Ownerz and Jazzmatazz 3 had there moments, but other than that it's been garbage. Do yourself a favor and listen to the first two jazmatazz albums, No More Mr. Nice Guy, Step In The Arena, Daily Operation, and especially Hard to Earn and Moment Of Truth if you want to hear the best of Guru & Gang Starr.

First, off.... the first video of \\"Please Mr. Postman\\" by the Marvelettes carries HORRIFIC film faults running down BOTH SIDES of the picture throughout the entire performance. The sad part is that Universal released this sad quality version on DVD when the same footage on YOUTUBE doesn't carry that fault (Only has minor fault on one side, intermittently)a rank amateur obviously did the transfers for this DVD, as color balance if off many times, and some clips have been artificially sharpened, and the result is VERY grainy footage. Universal was also very cheap in that they did no digital correction of any film or video tape faults. The clip of \\"Tears Of A Clown\\" looks great, until the color flickers in a couple of places, something that could have easliy been corrected with today's technology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"With the thousands of hours of video that must be available of these fabulous Motown stars, I can't believe this is the best they can come up with.

Typical horror monster movie. Eye-candy actors, mixed ethnicity, group of researchers, killed off one by one, fight amongst the actors, etc, etc. This movie is like Anacondas 2. The creatures didn't have enought air time. And when they did, u couldn't really see them in the dark on top of being fake looking CGI creatures. There wasn't any gore or elaborate death scenes. And the ending was so stupid and corny. And i thought Anacondas 2 was bad. Plus, there was dark light/photograpy so the movie was hard to see once it took place in the cave. At least Anacondas had a lot character development. This year has been nothing but really really bad horror movies and crappy PG-13 Disney horror movies.

Naturally they somehow get stuck while in the system and not only have to find their way out, but also deal with a pesky new species of deadly creatures living there. Cliches and predictability run rampant throughout the film, but a couple things kept the story somewhat intresting (mostly what happens to our lead.) Sadly, the film is full of flaws, lack of scares, and too much studio handy work. A decent renter if you're not looking to use your brain four an hour-and-a-half. Otherwise, if you're looking for a good story with lots of scares, I suggest checking The Descent. Also the flick pretty much plays out as I expected, predictable story, cheesy lines and a pretty cast that does'nt fit the characters they play.

Thus these explorers are really just chasing explorers from 30 years ago, who perhaps wanted the transformation.The movie fails is every way imaginable.

The ending was a little too abrupt, and trails off so as to keep it open for a sequel. You have to pay attention to the beginning of the movie to catch the gist of the threat and plot, and figure out the food chain in the Cave-- it's not terribly subtle but some people seem to miss that point.It's not really scary, mature, or and it won't keep you up at night, but it was incredibly fun to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cave","review":"The movie itself was fine.

Instead of some unknown planet that gets real dark, and creepy crawlers come out, you're underground in a cave and in underground river-systems. Its a really bad movie on its own as it is, but even more so when you realize that it is a rip-off.

The majority of the symbolic interpretations seemed forced and mundane, at best. And like another reviewer pointed out: the more I read, the more I couldn't shake the feeling that this may have been done on purpose, as if to divert people's attention from the real, deeper meanings behind the symbolism.

Everyone is is fighting to outduel the other, including the British Intelligence, the Russians, the East Germans, the Libyans and the Irish Republican Army."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I expected and more.","review":"When I was looking for this item, I thought I might have some difficulty because it is not a very common item. Then I found the website, looked at the sweatshirt, liked it and ordered it. Again, since it was from a private seller I wondered if I would in fact get it.

I spend about two days to go over this book, and are quite disappointed with the depth of the book. If you just want to know the very basic application of 8051, it's probably ok although there are quite a few typos.There are three major flaws with this book:1. Most of the serious topics are touched very lightly; it's almost useless for a firware/hardware engineer. For example, the memory map and the handshaking application of 8255.2. Lots of trivial questions after each section, and each section is very short(again, nothing is really covered in details).3. Very weak index, try to find memory-map!I don't think the book deserves the price they ask for. I actually learned more from the 8051.com tutorial than from this book. The search for a good 8051 book is continued!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful for real project!","review":"If you need to use 8051 in a work project, this is not the book for you.

This was supposed to have a love story but the focus wasn't there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A vapid, boring trifle. Skip it!","review":"The dazzling city of Barcelona is wasted on this cinematic geegaw with a microscopic plot and silly dialogue. What little substance there is revolves around two twentysomething cousins who pursue romantic free-and-easies around the city, one taking the pursuits in stride while the other suffers supposed religious qualms, Bible in hand, while dancing to Glenn Miller tunes. The picture's saving grace is the backdrop of the Catalonian cityscape, lovingly photographed and at once taken in both broadly and in small detail by the camera. But this considerable virtue is offset by an hour and a half of stock characters who, but for occasional sweet moments of language misunderstanding and girlish loveliness, have little to nothing to tell us about human nature. If you rent it -- don't buy -- for the scenery of the first half hour, and then skip the rest, you'll have gotten your money's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"torture","review":"I never knew a movie could be as painful as this one. The characters were spoiled and vapid. The only purpose of their inane dialogue in the first half of the movie(which only consisted of \\"Do you ever wonder if...?) was to set up the pathetic punch lines at the end of the film when everything they wondered happens to be true. These character if they were real are the type of substanceless self-centered jerks that would incite a pacifist to violence. Save your money. If you must see it, rent it.

As a person born and raised in Barcelona, I think it is a a very inaccurate portrayal of my city and its society. Like most commercial US films, it provides a romatized and false view of society. In some parts, the film looks like a tourist brochure of the latter Francoist years: flamenco, wine, bulls and macho men. May be this is how Mr. Stillman sees us Catalans. My impression is that \\"Tha Last Days of Disco\\" is a much better movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst movies ever seen","review":"totallly clueless and unfocused. aimless and purposeless script. wasted lot of talented actors. going-nowhere directing. bar-hoppings, disco dancings, bedrooms with boring naked backs, endless blahblahblah small talks. .. , trying very hard to be a decent movie is that nato navy officer, does not look like an navy officer a bit but an annoying, whinning, eye-sore, always talking, never grown up, too much opinioned nuisance. the person who played this role is a total failure. don't think this a comedy or whatever it should be or would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witt Stillman","review":"I rented Barcelona from Netflix after I was amazed by the hilarity and originality of Metropolitan. I figured if Whit Stillman did half as good a job on Barcelona it would be worth it. My expectations were exceeded. Right after I finished watching it, I sat down at my computer and ordered it from Amazon. Whit Stillman is so smart and his script is so hilarious. Chris Eigeman is an absolute genius. Taylor Nichols is superb as well. I am astonished by Stillman's talent, yet nobody I talk to knows about him. I can't understand how he can fly under the radar. His humor is so literate. The performances he gets from his actors are so deadpan, each joke is like a punch to the face. I laugh in amazement. This is a fantasticly creative film. It's not mainstream, but if you do end up liking it, you will be so happy to have found it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a funny laid back romantic beautiful talk fest of a movie","review":"The comparisons to woody allen and kevin smith are valid, everyone likes to talk in this movie. Or at least the guys do. And that's the point. Two young, neurotic americans in laid back barcelona in the seventies. The spanish girls listen and nod and look at the guys like they're from another planet. This is a very sweet and very funny movie. Chris Eigeman has to be the most un-stereotypical military man ever presented in film. And Mira Sorvino never looked so beautiful. The scene where the guy spys on Mira and the other women learning a dance step is one of the most beautiful in all of film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flick","review":"I saw this movie immediately after returning from my first trip to Barcelona.

I found the book a little more interesting than the average reader probably will because he was born in my hometown, I lived in B'ham and I was also vacationing in Murphy in the summer of 98 when the fbi had helicopters and officers searching the entire nantahala area.The only complaint I have about the book (and it's minimal) is that I thought that they spent too much time on details about his family in the middle of the book and it kind of slowed down the pace. Having said that, the pace is still as good as any fiction novel/mystery novel i've ever read. If you enjoy a fast paced, puzzle solving-type story, this book is right up your alley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stranger than fiction","review":"A great read about Eric Rudolph, serial bomber and fugitive. The authors use an energetic narrative style and an acute sense of the absurd as they recount the circumstances of the bombings, delve into the bizarre background of Rudolph, and expose the monumental fumbling of the case by the feds. Touching portrayals of the victims of the bombings remind us that years after the events, those involved still suffer."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is so FUN!!!","review":"Hey i know yugioh card game is better than this but this is just about as fun as the game.

Up to now, I didn't think that most people understood what I was going through as someone who had just turned forty, is recently unemployed and possesses no real desire to go back to the same old grind. Until reading this book, I thought any chance of having a life and doing work that I really enjoyed had passed me by. Now, I know different. Though the book is really a collection of articles, the exercises and real-life accounts of people who have found the courage to leave the monetary security of their old jobs to live their lives persuing their dreams are thought provoking as well as inspiring.

The book is an interesting read with contributions from many authors who followed their dreams. It also incorporates career counseling/lifestyle activities that focus on what you love to do OR what you love in life and then helps you transform these loves into alternative job ideas.

It also felt like a \\"reference\\" book, more than a book you can just pick up and read.It was well put together, but for me, I felt it was way more than I needed.

But the buyer should definitely beware. Fans of Corman know how beutifully atmospheric his films are, but here the colors are faded out and blurry. The other B&W film are covered with spots and are very blurry,which is a shame because I don't know where to find these elsewhere. They looked like they would be a real treat for vintage horror lovers(especially with horror diva Barbara Steele)but the quality was so terrible I couldn't get through them. It's not just that they're not digitally remastered, but many scenes have a an ugly digital look(i.e. little squares every where.) My reccomedation is to buy Corman's classic Poe films on MGM's \\"Midnight Movies,\\" which are an excellant value and their gorgeous transfers do justice to the films."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Deal","review":"I love Dominick Dunne's writing and getting three novels for the price of one is terrific.

I've had food processors since they came on the market and this one has lasted the longest, and it gets used here. When I bought this thing I had no idea I'd have it more than a year or two, because I really use a processor; but, I'm thinking this one has lasted at least five years. I am a from scratch cooker and it's used all the time and I've even given it as wedding presents. Sauce prep is a snap, but my favorite is the way it handles bread. It was the first processor I had that let me mix a standard big loaf without having to knead in half the remaining dough, and it's fast. The only reason I'm looking to buy another now is this one came up under sale items and my bowl is not as pretty as it once was and it would be nice to have a back up just in case it broke.

The first usage surprised me because all of the liquid inside splashed up and began to run down the outside of the container. I have decided to add liquids last, but there are several other downsides to this food processor. The splashing of what is being chopped in the bowl sends food up into the upper lid, where it lodges and is hard to remove. Chopping is uneven and there seems to be no way to get all things chopped evenly, whether layered on top or the bottom. Although this is called \\"Big Mouth\\", it is hard to add large things through the food chute since the opening to the chute is smaller than the chute itself. In order to load the 'big mouth' you have to open the top, which automatically shuts off the food processor.

This will make some readers bristle, bewilder others and for most create a tension between their image of themselves and the truth of themselves. McAfee resolves this tension gently and delicately in the final chapters. The resolution lies in the unvarnished observation of ourselves as we relate to his words and images.Seldom does a book elicit potential lasting change in a person's life in an inward, transcending direction. This book is one of those and should be required reading for all yoga students, and yes, teachers alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Life is difinitely not a bowl of cherries'","review":"But when uou decide to look at each of them, it is amazing how beautiful some are and others just have to be thrown out.'Into the Heart of Truth', you will wish to read several times.Looking into that mirror is not easy,but the more you do,the more life presents itself as one of adventure and beauty.The a's and b's continually manifest themselves.Enjoy this book, as I have done.Thankyou, John."},{"rating":"2","title":"Playmobil Chicken Coop","review":"Ordered this for my grandson's 5th birthday.

It reminds me of some Dark green hip hop singer butchering the national anthem. They took recon traditional songs and changed, moved and added verses that don't fit or ryme or make sense. Some of the songs are insulting to a true recon marine. The worst part is these are to motovate not depress you and the cadence don't even keep in step. Sounds like H&S; company and Charlie company office pogs bragging about how bad they aren't. I tried to run to this and had to keep changing step in the middle of the songs. And listening to it just made me mad at the crappy cadence. I am ashamed to have the Recon name attatched to this and I appologize to the true Quiet Operators.

If you even look at this game you might as well crumple up a fifty and take a leak on it, so if you have half a brain don't purchase this game, and if you choose not to listen to this review and go ahead and buy it anyway, you'll kick yourself in the rear later, and another thing, I wish i didn't have to give it a 1 star rating because its not even 0 worthy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent, but didn't live up to expectations","review":"I loved the first Getaway and was very skeptical of all the bad reviews I'd been seeing. Unfortunately, many of them are correct. I just got Black Monday a few days ago and its already quickly losing much of my interest. While the first Getaway was gritty and griping, the sequel is comparably bland. The story in the first was simple and made sense without getting too complicated, but in Black Monday I often don't know or don't care why the characters are being asked to do certain missions (much of this has to do with the fact that the interlude movies are annoyingly long). There are a few upgrades - you can ride a motorcycle, etc - but these really seem like minor issues. The game is also too easy. Its too bad - I was looking forward to Black Monday. My advice: if you really want to play it wait a few wait a few months until you can buy a cheap used version.

It's a silly romp for over 2 hours, then suddenly becomes a dark comedy.If it weren't for Alistair Sim's brilliance, I'd have turned this off several times. Every scene with Sim is magical and original.Putting aside all the weird 70s crumminess, it's hard to warm up to characters with awful wigs spewing Shakespearean-like nonsense from the get-go. We don't even meet our \\"beloved\\" lead character until about 25 minutes into the \\"story.\\"The murder that happens is not only out of place in this film, but it's AFTER the entire movie should end! It should climax & paste \\"THE END\\" on the screen about 10 minutes before it turns murderous.If you like psychedelic 70s nonsense & over-the-top performances by great actors stooping to unfunny stupidity, you'll love this.

There isn't a moment of truth, humor, or subtlety in this overlong, airless film. Nothing elicits a laugh or even a smile (not even the esteemed Alastair Sim stuttering away during the heavy-handed marriage scene). One might have expected some sense of satiric humor from the country that gave us \\"Kind Hearts and Coronets\\", \\"The Ladykillers\\", \\"A Shot in the Dark\\", and \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", but \\"The Ruling Class\\" just lays a big, self-important egg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"This movie is described as a black comedy. While it is certainly very \\"black\\", over the top in my estimation, I found little humor in it. The movie makes its point that the Britsh upper class is an arrogant, witless, self-serving, immoral group in the first ten minutes and continues to heavy-handedly beat us over the head with this for the next two plus hours. In the meantime, Peter O'Toole chews up the scenery as the schizophrenic black sheep heir of the family estate who initially believes he is Jesus Christ and is then \\"cured\\" and believes he is Jack the Ripper.In order to be funny there should be some shred of connection of reality that you can relate to the situation portrayed in the film.I found this film to be absurd and humorless."},{"rating":"2","title":"BETTER JESUS THAN JACK - WWJD?","review":"Jack may be an English Lord, but he's clearly nuts: he thinks he's Jesus Christ. And then he's \\"cured\\" and comes to believe that he is in fact Jack the Ripper. Peter Medak directs and Peter O'Toole stars in \\"THE RULING CLASS,\\" an irreverent and hysterical black comedy from 1972 based on the notorious play by Peter Barnes. A truly outrageous film of ideas both caustic and urbane. The three brilliant Peters share the incredibly funny and insightful commentary track. This is the 154 minute director's cut. Cool extras include Medak's home movies shot during production. An esteemed cult classic that still delivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Production","review":"I bought this CD hoping the production was better than the amazon samples.But no, This CD has horrible production, sounds muddy and cheap.

It's about being genuine, giving compelling presentations, building relationships, and resisting the natural tendencies to be a corporate drone with no personality in the office. It's not a cheesy self-help book, but if you read it you'll probably be helped by the experience. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough material for a good article","review":"I wanted to like this book, but:It's a very simplistic idea - Speak like a human not a jargon-addled automaton and people will like you and understand you better. Basically, if you read the first chapter, you've read the book.I had hoped that there would be some actual research or references to research that supports a lot of the opinions the authors put forward. I was disappointed. Their own research sounds really thin and designed to prove a foregone conclusion rather than really shed light on the subject. And there was little in terms of linking to meaningful, objective research.The examples they gave of what they consider good communication versus idiotic business-speak weren't very clear, fair or convincing.I also felt like the tone of the writing and the read were pretty vindictive and self-righteous rather than helpful. I actually started to feel sorry for the \\"idiots\\" they are ripping on.Conclusion: \\"truthy\\" ramblings galore, but no real news here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious coverage of an important topic","review":"Certainly a topic that needs to be addressed.

Twenty pages is probably all that was needed to convey the thoughts in this book, especially if you've read any communication books previously. Also, the authors seem kind of arrogant and general. (P.S. I don't think they are quite as funny as they apparently do.) So I would suggest that you go to the library and leaf through it, rather than buying it and reading the whole thing.

My favorite communications author is Deborah Tannen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Votes are in--it's a WINNER!","review":"Don't even think about giving your next presentation or writing that next proposal before you read this book! Refreshing, candid, hilarious and sometimes irreverent describe this book. You will laugh out loud (I did), especially if you've been the victim of boring presentations, droning voicemails, or rambling emails.I can hardly think of someone who wouldn't benefit from reading this book--from high school valedictorians to attorneys to professors, and even pastors! We all need to bring sincerity and just plain 'ole fun back into how we communicate, and the authors give us practical tips for how to get there.If you can't remember the last time you truly enjoyed a presentation from your organization's leaders or the last time you felt that you truly connected with your audience, then don't miss this book.

I thought it was an odd topic, and was slightly offended. Getting a book called \\"Why Business People Speak Like Idiots\\" is a lot like getting a diet book. It's both a gift and a diagnosis.Anyway, it was a quick read and a lot of fun. Ever since I finished, I've been more careful with my jargon, shunning empty terms like \\"mission critical\\" and \\"synergize.\\" I've given the book to several co-workers.

One month later (and a couple of good books in the middle to break up the boredom) and I was at the end. It just never got good. The only reason I bothered finishing it, is that I kept waiting for something to happen. Without a doubt one of the most boring books I have ever read.

Wizards of the Coast is destroying what TSR built!A note on this book in particular. The author shows little imagination in the plot of this novel.

This may be a passable novel on its own; however it is far from a good Forgotten Realms fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical FR book.","review":"Although not quite as polished as his Greyhawk trilogy, I still found this book to be quite enjoyable. It's not your typical FR novel, but considering how formulaic the line has become, this is a good thing. Kidd's stories include unusual characters, and the dialogue sparkles with wit. If you're looking for a standard fantasy novel look elsewhere. If you're looking for something engaging and different, read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book doesn't deserve the Forgotten Realms Logo on it.","review":"This book felt like it was written as a generic fantasy book, not set in any known world, and then a few minor things were changed so that they could publish under the FR Logo. BIG MISTAKE. This is a book that ties in spell misuse, lasers, and far too much of our real world, than it does of the Forgotten Realms.If you don't read this from the standpoint of it being a book set in the Realms, its a marginally amusing book. However most of the nifty cool parts are all ruined by the author using LASERS and explosives as the main weapons in the book.Pass on this one unless your bookstore doesn't have soemthing else on it's shelves. And if you HAVE to read it, don't read it assuming it's a Forgotten Realms book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yech! What was that and what did it leave in my mouth?","review":"Ugh! What a waste of time. My usual 2 day read was elongated into a 3 weeker. I left this book in the bathroom to skim through during my daily constitutionals. It wasn't worth being in any other room. Boring story, boring characters, almost invisible cast of thousands, with no face and no name supporting an equally invisable storyline. It was almost as if these cities were all bubbled up and kept away from the rest of Forgotten Realms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I ever read","review":"I read all of the Realms novels. I now wish I didn't. This was without a doubt the worst book I have ever opened. Where most books take me one or two days to read, I was reading this one for over a month. It almost made me wish I was illiterate by the end of it. The plot (if you can call it that) is slow to get moving, and the characters are more boring than watching grass grow.

After the footage of a tai chi class, the instructor tells a series of stories, which you can barely hear because of the audio, and then the tape finishes. It's not worth your money. I have no doubt that they're excellent martial artists, and would certainly go to them for personal, face-to-face instruction, but they're just not very good at making instructional videos... :) if you live in their area, just sign up for the class, you'd get much more out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a brite idea","review":"Looked like a good product and it charged up OK.

But I figured it would probably be out of print eventually and I would regret not picking it up. Just last week I listened to the entire thing, and now I can't stop playing it. The discs are divided really well. You get one disc of the more popular stuff, one of the early Memphis recordings, etc. It's incredible how consistant the entire box is. BB's guitar playing is great throughout and his singing is superb. The bands are always very tight. Great arrangements that will keep your foot patting the entire time.So go ahead and indulge yourself. There are other single CD collections from this era.

There are a couple of more upbeat songs to provide a change of pace, just to keep things interesting.Many of these songs are old, but none of them have been covered to death. Some of these songs have previously been recorded by such outstanding ladies as Ella Fitzgerald, Jeri Southern, Sarah Vaughan and Lena Horne. Claire has chosen the songs very well.While the outstanding feature of all Claire's albums is her own singing, she allows her top-quality musicians opportunities to show what they can do.

I hope they correct this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, poor execution.","review":"For the price, I was happy with the quality of construction.No where in the product specifications does Creative claim that it'll work with Windows Vista or MacOS X, and it certainly doesn't work with either; but it's almost 2009! They need to get their act together and write drivers for modern operating systems. (Most PC manufacturers aren't even shipping computers with XP anymore!)If you've got XP, it's a fun device, and it works well with the software provided by Creative. It's been a little flaky for me when I try to use it as a MIDI device in more advanced, third-party software (likeReason), but that's usually cured with a reboot.If Creative wrote MacOS X drivers, this thing would be fantastic with GarageBand... but alas, they do not (and as far as I can tell, based on the forums on their website, they do not intend to)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prodikeys are..... special =)","review":"The product works fine , The sound delay between actually pressing the keys and what actually plays is a bit off, but you get use to it quickly. The Keys are also not full length keys and have a plastic feel to them , so it feels a bit like a toy at first as well. But overall It is a pretty fun keyboard, I am glad I bought it.On the flip side of thisTHIS IS IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!The Music portion of the Prodikeys is NOT supported with VISTA. I searched for hours upon hours to find a way to make it work with my vista computer and I never succeeded. So if you are not running a computer with XP(or an earlier OS) or have a computer with XP this product isn't good for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"No VISTA support","review":"Gosh this would be a really cool product -- except that it doesn't work with the Vista operating system and, guess what, Microsoft considers XP to be \\"end of life\\"!

The SAD news is that it's not compatible with Windows Vista, something everyone should know before purchasing this awesome dual functionality keyboard.

Dries a little slow but has incredible hold. I patched over all the previous repairs and patched the new hole. We pounded the tube all day at a summer camp and it held together with no seapage. Only negtive is there is more glue than patches. The two patches in the kit could be bigger.

I was employed in the pest control industry for 16 years. We used to find cockroaches living in such devices all the time (it's usually nice toasty warm in there). Sanitation, exclusion, and very careful application of pesticides is what you need.Rodents are sometimes repelled for a brief time, but quickly adapt (adapting to environmental conditions is one of the things rats do best).

I've been using this unit for approximately 2 months, and I've not seen a mouse or chipmunk since placing this in the garage. I've even tested it's effectiveness by placing a couple of mousetraps loaded with peanut butter, and trust me.. if there were to be a mouse around, they'd have set those off, and they are still undisturbed.

About two days later I saw another roach not far from the ultrasonic pest repeller; in fact it was right on TOP of the repeller as if it was doing an inspection!

My 5 year old and 2 year old have both played with this and do not understand why the drill keeps \\"messing up\\" before they can finish putting in/taking out the screw. The buttons and switches do not seem to reset the drill or make it work \\"normally\\". My kids both end up very frustrated so this toy has not been played with much in our house. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Screwy - Another POOR Fisher Price Design","review":"I have yet to be happy with a Fisher Price toy in the last 3 years. (See my reviews of the Little People Garage, Discovery City, and train).Screwy Looey looks like a great concept, however, the drill is WAY too screwy. The switch that supposedly switches him from Screwy to Normal operation does not work at all, it is always screwy. My son can't understand why it won't drill right, and it is highly frustrating even for an adult. I can't stand touching the darn thing, because it will never do what I want it to, and the reset button doesn't help much, and is too small, as others have pointed out. In my opinion, it is time for some consumer advocate to do a report on Fisher Price, and what happened to their quality, and their fun.This is the worst designed toy ever, and the worst constructed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept but disappointing","review":"I recently bought this toy for my 2 1/2 year old son. While it's a great concept, the finished product is definitely disappointing. The main problem is that the drill becomes idle too quickly. There is a reset button on the back of the drill but it's too small for a young child to push. So before he can finish drilling a peg into the hole the drill stops and he's forced to wait for it to reset itself. Unfortunately, by that time, he's become very frustrated with the toy.Despite this, he does seem to like the toy and enjoys playing with it. However, every time he plays with it, I am forced to reset the drill every few seconds for him. Independent play time is definitely out with this toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This toy is SUPER annoying...","review":"My son picked this toy out on a trip with his aunt. She bought it for him for Christmas last year. He tried so hard to get the drill to work properly. He would get mad and cry because it wouldn't screw the screws in. My son has a workshop with tools that he can really use, so this one was confusing to him. This is not for a child that can already use a toy screwdriver. It will only frustrate the child and you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big waste of money","review":"Bought this for my \\"old-for-his-age\\" two-year-old who loves drills, so I thought he'd love it. To my surprise, it succeeded only in freaking him out and making him cry. The drill has a very annoying, kind of creepy laugh that is guaranteed to drive you crazy. The drill is supposed to have two modes: game (Screwy) and normal (Looey). The game mode is rather stupid, requiring kids to pick up on the drill's \\"mood,\\" to succeed. I think the nuances of this mode are easily lost, since the drill never seemed to budge from acting chronically insane. The drill's normal \\"drive\\" mode (Looey), is supposed to function as solely as a drill, but it doesn't - the drill stops working and starts laughing half way through, and at this point you pretty much want to chuck the thing hard. BIG waste of money, and I bought at $10. Luckily I was able to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Christmas toy","review":"Quite a lame game!

He is a total tool guy and loves to be by my side with his tools and fix things. This toy is REALLY [bad]. Our screwdriver gets stuck on the same phrase for a very long time and the only way to stop it is to turn the drill off and turn it back on. He definately did not get why the drill turns off while he is trying to drill. It might be ok as a toy (if it worked), but the concept of the game totally does not work. If I were you I would not bother spending money on this one. Buy him some toy tools that he can just play with instead. I thought this was going to be one of his favorites and we have to return it to the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stays a sleep too long but still fun","review":"I just bought this toy yesterday.

I've been a professor at a Michigan university for 30 years and have never seen anyone capture the absurdities of academic life so well. Not only that,the mystery is intelligent, the writing is sure-footed and witty,and every character is engaging. There's an almost Dickensian feel to this book that makes me determined to follow Raphael's series,and I don't usually enjoy mystery series that much, but prefer stand-alones.

The premise has potential, but the author lacks the writing skills necessary to go beyond the mundane. The dialogue, in particular, was irritating because the characters constantly spoke in what was supposed to be witty quips, but came off as catty.

All the facts, he says, were taken from old automotive magazines and news articles but he failed to list each specific reference in a footnote on what he was stating as fact. A careful reader will see opinion is laced within the facts. The six truisms he lists about why we think, as car guys, the cars from the musclecar era are the best, is interesting. I've often thought how the \\"good ole days\\" never really existed, but his tone is that cars made in that era up untill today's SUV age are ridiculous, unneccesary, and wasteful.

But something goes wrong and now they want the man best suited to the task to find out what! It's a fun, rollicking adventure that is still uplifting each time I read it. It makes a nice light read with a satisfying ending (although it has a sequel).

To be able to step out of this world, even for a short time, and experience the world of knights and wizards we read about in other fantasy novels would be a treat. Mr. Simmons has given us a way to at least imagine exactly that to be possible. The mix of the silly/familiar characters found here and there through out adds a perfect humor to keep you guessing from page to page. In short; of the dozens of books I read while trying to stay cool in 130 degree heat (in the shade), dodging sand storms, and hoping a SCUD wasn't about to land on my head, THIS book was the only one I brought home with me.

If you want to know about poetry, Ireland, the occult, or Yeats himself, this is the book you need. Not for sustained argument, or surgical analysis; but for the breath and cadence of reminiscence, deep-drawn thought, agonizing self-criticism and a well of images that seep into his poems. Sometimes the pleasure of a phrase obscures accuracy, as he himself admits; but if you can write like this it doesn't matter. Includes the three pivotal essays of the three parts of his life: 'Symbolism and Poetry', 'J.M.Synge and the Ireland of his Time' and 'A General Introduction for my Work' written as preface to a deluxe collected edition of his work that never appeared.

So painful. One of the most meandering and futile series I've ever read. Utterly, utterly frustrating.One commenter takes umbrage with reading through to the end of the series if even the first book was a problem: to that, I take issue. I like Gregory Benford and with each novel I was hoping for some amazing new discovery. Sadly by the end I was laughing to myself as I flipped through pages of vague tensions and too-dense descriptions of things that I can barely imagine.I frankly could not possibly care less what happens to clan Bishop; I did like Nigel though & wish I could have seen more of him and what he did. Also the Myriapodia.As a few other reviewers have noted, this is really an epic tale, fantastic in its scope - but not in its execution.So, if you've read the first four, you might as well read the last one. It's not pretty, but: it at least is the end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many irrelevant characters. Too long. Too tedious.","review":"Gregory Benford is a smart guy. It shows. The problem is when he tries to show us just how smart he is. This book shouldnt be approached unless the reader is armed with a Ph.D in astro physics. Benford introduces the concept of an esty, and although central to the plot and events of the novel, Benford does a bad job of making the etsy (is it a time? place? neither?) comprehensible to the average reader.Also, the book isnt helped by the way Benford devotes entire chapters to events and characters, who are memorable only for the degree to which they turn out to be irrelevant. A very disapointing end to a very promising series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down","review":"SAILING BRIGHT ETERNITY by Gregory Benford is the conclusion of a series that failed to live up to its jacket blurb. Reading 50 or so pages in, I stopped because of boredom. Initially, I thought the series might be like Robert Heinlein Lazarus Long books, which I enjoyed back in the '60's and '70's. No way. The jacket praises the \\"hard science,\\" which I saw as totally speculative far futurism. The use of a chimera of hard science detracted so much from the action of what I read, I couldn't go on. The conversations were minimal and hard to follow. My suggestion is that if you haven't read Heinlein's STRANGER IN A STRANGELAND, read it first. Then go to the first of Benford's series. To be somewhat fair, it is possible that had I done that, I would have been drawn in and at least read the whole first novel of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good, but the only thing out there","review":"This book, like most of the other nutshells I've read, is not particularly helpful. The organization is confusing, and not enough attention is devoted to major topics, as the format is primarily just a recitation of cases. A study guide is supposed to provide a concise synopsis of the law, not merely throw a bunch of conflicting cases at the reader. Steven Emanuel has the market for law school study aides cornered, with the Examples & Explanations series a distant second. Unfortunately, this is the only major study guide that exists for employment law. Thanks to Rothstein's worthless and maddening casebook, learning employment law is neither interesting nor fun.

It takes a great premise and goes nowhere with it. There are a few chills, but they're all dissipated by the poor direction, writing, and cast. Nothing makes sense, and when it does, it just seems stupid. Poor Roddy McDowell is stuck in a role no one could play believably, and that goes for the whole cast, all of whom appear to be sleep walking. Horror fans, don't be fooled. This is not a scary movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"low camera angles and dry ice fog do not a movie make","review":"Wow, what a glorious disaster of a movie. I couldn't discern a motivation from any of the four characters. Stupid people doing stupid things and being either stuffy or melodramatic about it. Cringe-inducing performances linked by adequately artful cinematography and some easy-on-the-eye set design. But neither the paranormal nor the \\"scientific\\" explanations of what's going on have a leg to stand on. There are a few effective sequences, especially the bit with the ectoplasm, but, they're hamstrung by the simple fact that MONEY (let alone convictions about the paranormal) doesn't seem a believable enough motivation for supposedly intellgent characters to allow themselves to be repeatedly assaulted and maimed (and WORSE). I'm all for sustained mood in this type of film but for crying out loud- SOMEBODY tell a JOKE... make a funny remark... ANYTHING that might make the scares in between just THAT much more effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"no classic movie!","review":"Sorry but to me this is absolutely no classic movie at all, just plain horror movie exactly like \\"the lady in black\\" which is an awful movie as well and will prevent you from sleeping.Now if you're really looking for a classic all time horror or spooky movie then go for \\"the haunting\\" or \\"the house on the haunted hill\\" (first versions of course!!!!!) and forget this one which is not worth buying at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not scary--- no ghosts, nothing spooky","review":"I bought this movie because it had so many high-star ratings. So, I was very surprised when I watched it and found there were no, meaning zero, ghosts, skeletons and scary scenes. The movie takes place in an old, dark house with cob webs all over. There are some strange sounds that are supposed to represent haunted spirits. The scariest scene is when a black cat chases the \\"mental-medium\\" character and scratches her.The 4 characters in the movie went to the haunted house with the task of finding out if people survive after death i.e. determine if the owner of the house who was supposed to be dead but no body was ever found is still living in the house \\"in spirit\\". In the end of the movie, 2 of them leave the house alive. The other 2 had died from things falling on them. Overall, the movie was disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT! Still Scary","review":"Of all the haunted house flicks I know, this one still is scary as hell. And you gotta love the greatness that is Roddy McDowell. I believe the story is by the great Richard Matheson (I am Legend, others) and that alone makes this worth it. Definitely made in the 70's, but still holds up. The music is creepy as heck! This one gave me nightmares as a kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"CREEPY !","review":"If you like a good ghost story that will creep you out, this is it. Saw it when it first came out.

I may have to check that out.The story starts out promising, in fact it was a bit chilling. It just fell flat toward the middle and then lost me.The premise is the oldest one in horror, the haunted house. A group of mediums and a scientist stake out the house in promise of money if they unlock the hauntings.I never connected with the film. Perhaps it was the pacing or the over the top acting, but I just didn't feel it scary at all. If you want to see a truly scary haunted house story, I'd pick up Insidious. Or if you want vintage horror, go w/ the Amityville Horror (og, of course!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh... just didn't age well.","review":"I am sure that back in the day when this film was released it was something that surely frightened the average viewer, but unfortunately this film has not aged well. I am sure that the \\"PG\\" rating that the filmmaker had to settle for probably can be blamed for 90% of the poor staying power that this film has. At best it is a cliche' haunted house filck with a fair amount of very dry but competent British acting. Watch it if you have nothing better to do but do not expect a four star film. Take the $7 or $8 and buy a Richard Matheson short story collection book instead. This movie just isn't very good. You might like it if you are a \\"Hammer\\" fan - but probably not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Middle road taken","review":"I did not enjoy the movie as much as I thought I would. They left out alot of the parts in the book where your mind could just picture it so clear and vivid. I did this as a read aloud, slightly modified with my students. I was really excited when I found a movie to go with it, and showed the class it. It's rated PG, which for the material of the book is really a clue as to them leaving out alot of stuff. My class enjoyed most of the book and felt the movie didn't do it justice. I agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"A haunting and suspenseful ghost story.","review":"Although short on special effects, the story is unique. The atmosphere is amplified by the excellent backround music. Roddy McDowell's character provides the past history of Hell House to it's eerie fullest."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but not as good as the book","review":"The book goes into way more detail about everything and needs to be read before you see the movie. The movie is good and the house is spooky, but it lacks the depth that the book has. The only scene that was really creepy was the shadowy figure behind the shower curtain. Good, but not as creepy as the reviews say. I hope the Haunting (1963), which has terrific reviews, is better because I just ordered it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legend of Hell House","review":"Hell House is a very suspenseful classic horror film without any gore. The viewer does not know what comes next. The film is full of sensual texture which futher adds to the mystery and suspense. The texture is the most important part: the Victorian decore, a haunted mansion. The scene where the Doctor/scientist wife descinds dark, thick-wooded stairway bannister is probably the most erotic I've seen in any film, yet there is barely a hint of nudity -- clearly nothing like today's film. The film is not perfect; some of the plot is a little disjointed towards, but that is a minor flaw. I reccomend this movie; it can be enjoyed for more than just a single viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best horror/supernatural films ever made","review":"This film is a classic in every sense of the word. It has every element of supernatural and even some psychological horror. It has the spooky house, and a superb cast of characters. It is extrenmely well-written, and the direction and cinematography are truly excellent.This film marked one of the late Roddy McDowall's best screen performances, and I'm not the only one who says that. It was even mentioned by several members of the Motion Picture Academy at memorials after his death a few years ago.If you are looking for a genuinely good fright movie, you cannot go wrong with this film.

JAD's and Trojan's releases are legal, and the sound quality is often much better on their albums.

I would not recommend it for small children because the lights are small. Sometimes they are hard for my daughter to handle. It comes with many different templates to make all sorts of things, all you have to do is punch the lights through the black template. However, this toy is different than the ones we remember because the lights do not stay in well if used without the templates (making your own design). Also if you use it this way, it is not as easily seen since the background is white."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed toy...","review":"So disappointing. Received for Christmas, we were all excited to play with this fun new toy. However, the pegs are very hard to push through the black template paper (virtually impossible actually) and once they are in they don't stay. We tried to create our own designs w/out using paper but the pegs are even less stable that way and fall out immediately. The toy does not function properly at all and is useless!

He absolutely loves it and has no problem following the stencils. I however have a few complaints. The black papers don't stay up well until quite a few pegs have been put on the board. There is no place to store the black papers so be prepared to get a plastic bag on large envelope to keep them in. The electrical cord folds up into the bottom of the cube for storage, but it takes a few tries to get it in. Speaking of electrical cords - I don't know about the designers at Hasbro, but I don't allow my 4 year old to go near the outlets never mind plug things in. As for assembling the cube - if you have a small long phillips head screw driver, it only takes a minute or two to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little dissapointed...","review":"we love the new \\"light bright cube\\"...i grew up with \\"light bright\\" and really wanted my own children to have one! what a great idea...however; the people [the store] informed me that i could get the re-fills on-line, which i obviously can't! ...one happy \\"cube\\" owner..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saddened by Cube","review":"My sister and I had the original Lite Brite (triangle) when we were kids...and loved it. Cleaning up the pegs was a pain...but we loved it. When we'd complete a picture; we'd use it as a nightlight and admire it til we drifted off. When Santa brought my two children the Lite Brite Cube I was thrilled for them!!! They were mesmerized, delighted, and totally focused on this wonderful toy for a total of 20 minutes. Why for only 20 minutes, you ask??? Because that's all the time it takes to use up the measly set of 8 \\"classic pictures\\" included with the Lite Brite Cube starter set. I have searched for Lite Brite Cube picture refill packs at my neighborhood [stores] and have learned such things don't exist. This toy (Santa has told me) was somewhat expensive and has proven to be quite a disappointment!!! Someone at Hasbro needs to rectify this situation at once. I'm hoping to see Lite Brite Cube picture refill packs on store shelves in the very near future!!! Thank you in advance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"What a waste of money this was! I bought this for my daughter, based on happy memories of Lite Brite from decades past, but she can't play with it, because it's unusable. Every aspect of this toy is terrible. One can scarcely differentiate between green and yellow pegs, and between pink and orange pegs. The pegs only go in with extreme effort, and then proceed to fall right back out, especially when one is pushing in more pegs. This toy is designed so terribly, I can't believe it's an actual Hasbro toy. It seems like a chintzy no-name knock-off. I cannot stress enough how NOT worth anyone's money this toy is. Absolute hunk of garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely will captivate your little artists!","review":"I loved this as a kid in the 70's so bought it for my 4&6 year olds. The pros: cube design is great! Kids can work on separate pix simultaneously! Plenty of pegs are included! The cons:Pegs are smaller and can easily fall out of screen during a creation. Only 8 pre-printed pages included (spurring arguments over the butterfly design) Not as sturdy as I remember! Maybe Playskool can work on this! I can tell you that my girls were anxious to start new designs-- instead of turning on the tube and watching cartoons!

Maybe if I weren't comparing it to the older one I would think it was ok but even then I am not sure. I loved my lite-brite as a kid and wanted to get my daughter one so she could have as much fun as I did with mine.This has not left the box since the first day. First all of the screens where you stick the pegs are white not black like the old one so without the refill sheets it is useless.Also without the refill sheets the pegs are too big and they do not stay in.This was very frustrating! Even with the sheets sometimes they still fall out! I am really unhappy with this purchase and I can usually find something about a toy I like but not this one.

But thank the spirit of words that Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon have written this great book which explains clearly the types of crptic clues in an entertaining and informative fashion. With plain language the authors point out the types of cryptic clues (anagrams, homophones, containers, charades, deletions, hidden, reversals, etc.) which are cleverly disguised to trick you away from the answer. I highly recommend this book to all those who are curious about cryptic crosswords.

Except Pentax do not want to put their name on it.It was easy to see why. It was heavy, heavier than all my binoculars ( I have 7 of them), the necklace was a joke, the case a cheap piece of cloth vinyl. Everything about it was cheap. So we do get what we pay for. Frankly because I had to cut the plastic to access the binocular, I did not want to return it to Amazon.On the plus side, the optics were OK but not great.

Also, my wife liked the small package. Where does Brother get an 8,000 page lifespan for the drum?

Both times I got intense black lines on the pages I faxed, not knowing until a customer told me and caused embarassment on my end. Nothing could be done to repair it. I was told it was more than likely the drum which sold for more than the fax. End result both in the garbage.Avoid all brother products at all costs.

Although Brother was willing to replace it twice, they were not willing to acknowledge there are engineering problems with the model itself.

At least during the first months. We are a small business and use the machine only a few times a day. But after a few months we had a problem with ink lines being spread out on each page we printed out. The Brother people (help line) were very helpful but couldn't find a solution. I eventually came up with the idea to replace the Drum Unit. The problem was solved but two weeks later, we had the same problem all over again. Now I wouldn't mind that this Drum Unit was just a few bucks...the problem is that one of these Drum Units costs you A LOT MORE than the purchase price of the Brother MFC-4800. ............In a perfect world, you can take it to a service center that Brother suggests. But who can live without a fax, telephone and copier for a week? Not a normal business! !!

If you have paper jamb inside the machine (as opposed to in the feeder), you will inevitably have random black marks on every page thereafter. It has been a continuing problem and since Brother doesn't have a fix for it, they tell you to replace, you guessed it, the $160 drum unit!

Detailing the bloody war between two factions of vampires, one of which is merely cruel, manipulative, bloodthirsty (in both the literal and figurative meanings of the word) and soulless, the other of which is actually the bad guys, the story also suffers from a lack of beginning or end, being as it is merely the second in a thirteen-novel storyarc.

Twain travels with his brother to California and Nevada during the time of the Gold Rush.Twain looks for silver, has run-ins with bad guys, and observes the West in its early days with humor and cleverness. Lots of politically incorrectness that probably struck the readers of the day as hilariously funny. Pretty funny to me, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROUGHING IT (MISSION AUDIO) BY MARK TWAIN, READ BY ROBIN FIELD","review":"Actor Robin Field reads Mark Twain's second full-length work, published 'in 1872, describing his actual and imaginary adventures in the American 'West in the 1860s. According to Guy Cardwell (editor of the Library of 'America edition), \\"His accounts of stagecoach travel, Indians, Western 'dress, food and customs, frontier society, the Mormons, the Chinese . . '. are intermingled with his own experiences as a prospector, miner, 'journalist, boon companion and lecturer as he traveled through Nevada, 'Utah, California and even to the Hawaiian Islands. . . . The plot is 'relaxed enough to accommodate some immensely funny and quite random 'character sketches, animal fables, tall tales and dramatic monologues.\\" ' The reading is approximately 20 hours long on 18 Audio CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Edition","review":"The book - that is to say the text by Mark Twain is wonderful. The kindle version not so much. First of all there are typos, quite a few of them for a published work. Second, there are no pictures. The real book has pictures, so I think I am going to buy a copy of the book and re-read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and dirty","review":"I saw little of the wit Twain is known for in this book. It's filled with long dull passages about his dirty travels from one place to another. My least favorite Twain book."},{"rating":"1","title":"hm...","review":"i've been reading the reviews for this book, and I wanted to offer up my own opinion. I first read this book as part of my high school 11th grade english cirriculum. And as a warning to others, I just wanted to say that reading this book was like watching paint dry. There is no structure, and after a while it seems like your just reading page after page but are retaining nothing. Though there are some very interesting funny parts in the books, the overall dullness of it all overpowers the good. At some points, I wanted to claw my eyes out in despair.I admit, I do love Mark Tawin, but this is in Noo sense, his best work.Ones again, this is just my opinion. Read it and see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"I purchased this since it was the only cup holder/snack tray I could find for a car seat.

I was actually going to buy a tray to attach to my son's car seat and saw this item and tried it. Big Mistake! My son can take it off of his car seat, it doesn't attach tightly enough. He also knocks it off if he's reading a large book or playing with his Leap Pad. Love the idea, but wish I would have read the reviews first. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"We all seem to agree.","review":"This cup holder was a total impulse buy in the store since my son has a cup holder on his car seat, and I thought my daughter would enjoy having one too. Unfortunately I did not have the opportunity to read everyone else's reviews, or I would have not bought it. It also does not fit on our Evenflo car seat. The actual tray part is off center when it attaches to the hook making it seem poorly balanced. I think we'd be better off with the old fashioned cup holder that hooks over the car door at the base of the window! I will definitely be returning this item to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"I assumed it would work as described...Wrong!","review":"I purchased this to fit onto our Graco car seat.

Our Nuby and Gerber sippy cups don't fit in the small holes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, poor execution","review":"I wish I'd read others' reviews first. In the box, this looked like a great product: Fisher-Price branding, adapters to make it fit a variety of car seats and strollers.Sadly, I had the same experiences as many of the other reviewers: I managed to mount the holder on my stroller, but the only place it would fit was out of my son's reach far below seat level and at an angle that made it look like a ship in danger of capsizing. The easy-to-install mount was also a bit flimsy, wobbling if I so much as looked at it the wrong way.\\"That's not so bad,\\" I lied to myself, \\"after all, sippy cups are designed to not leak if they're at an angle.\\" Unfortunately, there wasn't a single sippy cup in the household that would fit in the cup holder.I'm darned if I'm going to buy another set of sippy cups just to fit in a wobbly tray that my son can't reach.

It doesn't tighten enough to be secure. As I tried to tighten it and I let go I could actually see the plastic screw slowly unscrewing itself. The tray wobbles back and forth. And then the plastic screw was stripped from trying to tighten it multiple times. It's going back to the store tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I bought this product and was so frustrated at the fact that it just doesn't tighten enough to be secure.

It would be a negative 5 - for waste of a busy mom's time!!!!I couldn't return this item because we waited too long to try & use it. I know why they don't want them back...because they don't WORK! I own 3 different car seats & this \\"tray\\" doesn't work on any of them. It doesn't work on any of the strollers I own or any of my friends! I also tested it on several of my friends car seats to see if they could use it, so at least someone could use it...and it did not work on those car seats as well.

The Council itself warned against this, cautioning Catholics to avoid \\"a false conciliatory approach.\\"Catholics seeking a more balanced guide to the differences and similarities between their faith and Islam are advised to purchase \\"Inside Islam: A Guide for Catholics\\" by Robert Spencer and Daniel Ali, an Iraqi convert to Christianity from Islam.

It's May now. The player was awesome at the beginning. I loved the resume funtion, how light it was, the AM/FM, etc. Sometime between then and February, through no fault of mine, the volume stopped working. The player was jammed on a neutral volume which would not change. Later, around March, I lost the sound in my right headphone except when I twisted the cord a certain way. This was also for no apparent reason. By now I have completely lost the sound in it. This all happened in a little more than half a year. It would be more expensive to fix the Discman than to buy a new one. So here I am searching for a new one.Trust me on this: Maybe it was my fault, but for me this Discman definitely did not work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good with only minor complaints","review":"This player is really good. The display is lighted, and it's bright enough that you can see the function keys in the dark. It includes a handy carrying case for when you run or skate.A couple of minor complaints: 1. When the player is inside the case, the only keys that can be reached are the play, stop, fast forward, and rewind. That's slightly annoying. 2. The display does not remain lighted if the power source is from the batteries. 3. The slide latch can be difficult to operate, especially if you already have a CD in one hand.Other than that, this is a really good buy, and the skip protection is just excellent. I have ridden my bike down a very rough dirt raod and I never heard it skip that whole time I was on that road."},{"rating":"1","title":"go easy on it","review":"I managed to break the thing inside of 3 months. In fairness to the product, I did treat it a bit rough- hiking, camping, ect. Here's the deal, this model has a wheel for volume control instead of buttons. At some point I either set my bag down too hard or just packed everything too tight and both the volume wheel and the headphone jack sort of collapsed into the unit. It still works but the sound quality is VERY poor and of course the volume stays at one level only. Just a warning to people who treat thier stuff like I do! Some good points: Before it broke the thing sounded great (not with the original headphones of course), it NEVER skipped, it is very small and light, and the battery life is very long- around 30 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"never had a problem","review":"I don't know what some of you are talking about, this is an excellent cd player. And its been through some rough times with me too! I think some of you may confuse this player with another one, b/c it does have buttons for volume control, not a wheel. And with the supplied leatherlike (its not leather, but its good enough), small drops won't harm it. Obviously is you viciously throw it up against a wall, 1/8 inch of leatherette won't do anything. But it certainly prevents it from getting scratched damaged when it falls on its side.Overall- I give it high marks. Obviously I don't use the standard headphones, they always stink. To the person that compains of the right speaker not working, thats a common problem with any set of standard headphones. I spent 10 bucks for a pair of sony ear buds. Its a great investment, if you're going to spend 140 bucks (shop around though, I got it for 100), you might as well spend the extra 10 for a decent pair of headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so electric","review":"Bought this for our 6-year-old son - the microphones are okay & work.

Rubin sounds more like a mellow Dakota Staton, but a lot less interesting, more along the lines of the blase and very dull Nancy Wilson... However I give her more credit then Natalie Cole, at least Rubin didn't try to do some tacky duet with Ms McRae, the way Cole did with her father. We'll have to wait for someone like Anita O'Day to do a tribute album effectively to Ms McRae. Also the great jazz singer Carol Sloane did a wonderful tribute CD to Carmen McRae called \\"The Songs Carmen Sang\\" which is really spectacular, especially since Sloane was a personal friend of McRae's."},{"rating":"2","title":"An embedded developer point of view","review":"Who does \\"classic shell scripting\\" nowadays?Maybe some IT geek, hackers, linux distribution developers... and embedded engineers!If you develop embedded system based on linux, you will have to do with sh scripts & friends.You can do a lot of things with a good script, better than writing your-own-cross-compiled-c-code.This book can help you in going deep and use the power you have immediately available even on the smallest linux busybox installation.I liked it, I enjoyed reading it, and it helped (and helps) me in my work.I found the awk chapter a bit less good, but this is not a book on awk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super reference","review":"I use this book almost every day at work.

His music is perhaps an acquired taste - to appreciate it, some knowledge of the French language is helpful. This album is one of his best - certainly one of the most listenable. His other albums can start to seem somewhat repetitive due to the short, simple phrases used in their composition. His music is always creative and this album, his second, exemplifies his debonair style."},{"rating":"2","title":"All these labels are fluorescent, but some are more fluorescent than others...","review":"Colors are green, yellow and pink.

Thank God, but unfortunately he persisted and now we have The Great Escape. If anything, Hot Karl doesn't front: he sounds and raps like the white nerd he is, or appears to be on the cover art. His lyrics touch on beat topics like why is rap so materialistic and commercial, reminiscent songs (\\"Kerk Gybson\\") and how the suburbs are a hard place to live (\\"Home Sweet Home\\").

In one moment there is love, happiness, and serenity then moments later the reality of war flips the story! The story line is so messed up on so many levels. There is a fine line between the truth of the matter and O'Briens imagination.This book has so much pain and heartache. With a mix of passion for other men at war. Even through all the deaths and destruction, these soldiers seem to taunt life with life and death games. If you were at war wouldn't you think that you would be making sure you wouldn't die!For war this book sure seems to let you know how it really was. The most important thing was that it had a historical value. At least he was there to be able to tell about it.At the beginging this book did not start at all right.

It faxes and copies OK but some of the electronic functions are not acurate, having just installed a new toner cartridge it still reads change drum soon, indicating it is low on toner. I would highly recommend Brother IntelliFAX but, in the same light, highly recommend not buying from the seller this machine came from.

It is the most common ring pattern and the programming is correct, but it still doesn't work.When I called Brother's Technical Support, they explained that distinctive ring will not work if the phone line is longer than the 4.5 foot cord they supplied. In fact they require that you use their phone cord. This seems bogus in view of the fact that my old Canon faxphone worked fine with distinctive ring for the last three years. When I hooked up the 2800 directly to my wall jack using their cord, it still didn't work.

Not a biggie??? Guess again! A drum cartridge for this questionable quality machine costs $175.00.

The sticks break easily and they are hard to put and and very time consuming to do also. She was bored with it before we could get the sticks in. It is to difficult for her to set up by herself.SAVE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Kerplunk updated game of old","review":"Executive summary is that this game is very much like the kerplunk of old, and a lot of fun. For those of you who have never played any kerplunk the simple theme is to place plastic sticks across the game in a web, dump a bunch of marbles on top of the web, and then start removing the sticks one at a time. Obviously, the person with the fewest marbles that fall, wins.This newer version of kerplunk adds a 2nd level for placing the plastic sticks into yet another web. This adds some to the game, however in practice, most marbles do not fall until you begin pulling the sticks from this 2nd level.One comment related to my kids. My kids are both 5, and they can place most of the sticks in the holes and make the web, however as the web is filled, it gets harder and harder to push them in (the plastic sticks need to bend if you want all the sticks in) - needs big kid help :-)Overall, this is simply a fun game at an inexpensive price."},{"rating":"1","title":"pass on the kerplunk","review":"My children of 4 and 7 almost immediately got bored with this toy. The problem is in the set up. Neither of them wanted to stick all those sticks in the holes. It was a total bomb and waste of money. It takes 2 minutes to play it and 10 minutes to set it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T buy this!","review":"I bought this toy for my five year-old because I saw it recommended in one of the parenting magazines. It is loud and obnoxious. Sometimes it just makes noise for no reason. It falls apart easily. Save your money for something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst quality ever","review":"I paid $20 for pennies worth of thin, pliable, breakable, embarassingly poor quality plastic worth about 3 cents. I predict it will break in 3.5 uses. This is certainly not anywhere near a 'classic' game and is a big disappointment. I'd hoped my 5 year old would enjoy it.(bought in Canada as \\"KerPlunk\\")(I could not enter zero as a star on the rating scale otherwise I would have)"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"\\"The Little Corset Book: A Workbook on Period Underwear\\" was a bit disappointing for me as I expected something more informative. The book was very simple and resembled a children's book. I would recommend it only to those who have never made a corset before. Even then it lacks information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what it says on the label","review":"A cute and adorable little book with lots and lots of useful info.

The songs are traditional without being stale, the choir sings with energy, the band is awesome without being overpowering, and the sound quality is excellent! Not a weak cut on this album that gets better with every listen, and a worthy addition to any gospel collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to read & takes no responsibility","review":"I found this book almost impossible to read. The author tries to tell us that although drinking almost ruined her life she is in no way physically addicted to booze so therefore not an alcoholic. This is beyond disturbing. Does she have any idea what bull she is selling other twenty-somethings? Basically she is saying \\"It's fine to drink from 14-24 and then don't worry you can get your stuff together then.\\" Again, I believe this is total bull. She can't remember having sex and blacks out repeatedly but isn't a drunk? Yeah right. Maybe she should look up the definition. The most disturbing thing was her complete lack of personal responsibility.Shame on her publisher for thinking this was ok to print.If you want to read a book on drinking read: Drinking- A Love Story by Carolyn Knapp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing!","review":"I bought this book, because I saw it recommended in a magazine. I thought the idea behind this book was pretty cool. Boy little did I know that it was about to change my life. Koren is so insightful. She is careful to not put blame on anyone, but just write her story. It was very refreshing to see someone my age writing about this \\"rite of life\\" young girls go through. This book is a must for any girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lessons for moms/dads with daughters","review":"\\"Smashed\\" follows a troubled young alcoholic (yes, she is even though she says she's not) from young girl through mid-twenties. Since Koren claims alcohol is \\"her one true love\\", I think she had a serious problem. The book reads fast and I couldn't put it down because I wanted to know how much worse it could get. Koren deftly takes the reader through her many ordeals with alcohol - stomach pump, vomiting (a lot), raped while intoxicated, and more horrors.I couldn't help wondering-- why didn't her parents try to help her? At least her mother was aware of the binge drinking but seemed not to care too much. As a mother of 2 young girls, I will use the lessons in this book to talk to my girls about drinking. The book is really a how-to on NOT to raise a kid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Open your mind, open your heart....","review":"Reviewers who are troubled by this book appear to be troubled by the fact that author doesn't fit the stereotype that we usually ascribe to drinking women and young drinkers. They may be troubled to learn that not (surprise!) not all students need to be failing out of school in order to have problems with alcohol. They may be shocked to discover that (wow!) the twelve steps aren't the only support system that works for addicts. Female drinkers (oh my god!) aren't always the godless sluts that society tells us they are.... Smashed makes us rexamine the stereotypes. We need it desperately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an Alchoholic? Are you kidding me?","review":"I have a serious problem with this book. Ms Zailckas refuses to declare that she's an alcholic. Are you kidding me? If it looks like a fish, drinks like a fish, then it must be...The book is well written and interesting, but I think it could be more honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad...very, very bad!","review":"\\"Smashed\\" is a poorly written account of author Koren Zailckas' experiences with alcohol during her teenage years. I must say, I was not moved by this book at all. I think Zailckas' writing style is incredibly sophomoric, as is her whole \\"I am not an alcoholic\\" mantra. I agree with the previous Amazon reviewer that Zailckas attempted to make herself seem artsy and prophetic, which she is so NOT. This book was excruciatingly painful to read and I almost gave up on it several times because it dragged and dragged and DRAGGED...and it never got any better!If you want to read a personal account about women and alcoholism, check out Caroline Knapp's \\"Drinking: A Love Story,\\" which blows \\"Smashed\\" out of the water.How this book became a \\"New York Times\\" bestseller is beyond me...the publisher must be making that up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"drunk on metaphors","review":"This is a book about excess. Excess alcohol, excess metaphors. It's hard to decide which is more repelling-- the author's repeated debauchery in the cistern of alcoholism or her over-metaphored writing style. I found both equally hard to take. As a father of daughters, I hoped to gain some insight into peer pressures girls and young women face so I perservered to the end of this too-long tome. Big mistake. Read any chapter in the middle of the book and you have \\"the take home message\\". I could sacrifice wading through an unappealing writing style for the sake of knowledge but it was a struggle that was singularly unrewarding. I wish the author well in her stuggle to remain sober and to eke out a living with her writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story; Poor Writing","review":"I've been reading a lot of memoirs lately and this was frankly, my most disappointing read in a long time. The author has a great story to tell, and she weaves in statistics in an interesting way, but I found it hard to get past the very poor writing.There is never an opening hook to draw one in, and the lackluster writing leaves the book feeling more like a bland catalogue of events than artful storytelling. The author has a lot of trouble with tenses, and at times she attempts metaphors using cultural references that wouldn't have been known at the time (and in the tense) she is making them. It was very distracting and I actually gave myself a headache as I struggled to finish this book.If you're looking for a similar story with better writing I'd suggest Caroline Knapp's engaging \\"Drinking: A Love Story,\\" which, like this book, hits on issues of gender and alcolohism/addiction in the form of personal memoir - but in a much more readable way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very True","review":"This book hit me harder than any book I have read recently, not because of the writing, but because this was me. This was my college experience, ast least what I can remember of it :) and I can identify with many of the authors statements and feelings to be accurate. The scary part is that it is normal to use alchol like this in collage and early adulthood in america. Drinkomg untill you pass out is not abnormal but expected in many young adult settings and those that do not are not cool. This book is scary and true, and made me look at the way I drink."},{"rating":"2","title":"shockingly hit home","review":"When I first picked up the book I thought it was fiction. I got into bed and at first was disappointed to find out it was not. However I decided to give it a chance. I was hooked right away. My breath was stolen while I connected to the writer. At my age now I look at my adolescence and young adulthood as if it was someone else but while reading that book it brought back so much emotion. I encouraged my friends and sister to read it because I felt we all could relate and everyone has loved this book. The stories may be shocking, sad, and/or appalling but it happens. It is very real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Though it was a story about Koren and her struggle it forces the reader to evaluate their own alcohol usage. For me it speaks about awarness and personal responsibility but also about how quickly things can get away from you.The honesty of this book is powerful and I can see how people would want to dismiss it because they might be afraid. Personally I think its brave.I'm not sure if she meant to but my only issue was I kept losing characters in the story. I wasn't sure if she was trying to portray the real friendship (that it just disappeared) but for me that was a little tought. I wanted to get a little invested and started to get to know characters (mom, dad, Tess etc) but then they just left."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, done that.","review":"This would have been an interesting read, had it not already been written...by Caroline Knapp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Young people party too much? Shocking...","review":"I wish she had never quit drinking, probably would have spared us this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make it stop!!!","review":"Ugh. Despite Zailckas's messages and warnings and statistics and stories upon stories (filled, might I add, with absolutely HORRENDOUS metaphors at every turn) about drinking, I was almost forced to crack open a bottle of Jack just to make it through this book! Sure, I felt a litle something for Zailckas what with crippling self-esteem problems and all, and even related to most of her drinking experiences, but this book is anything from fresh news. Not to mention that it reads like a story you're forced to workshop in a bad freshman year creative writing workshop. I feel like I - or really any of my friends - could not only have written this book, but written it better. So why didn't we? Because we're too busy binge dirnking!!! Hooray!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A LOT OF RAMBLING","review":"I HAVE NEVER READ A BOOK WHERE THERE IS SO MUCH SIDE TRACKING. THE AUTHOR DOES SO MUCH RAMBLING THAT I FORGOT WHERE SHE WAS GOING WITH THE STORY."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOO!","review":"One of the worst books I've read in a long time...not sure what this author's other books are like."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's a whiner, as well as a wino.","review":"Zailckas spends most of her time whining about her horribly lonely childhood and her lack of self-esteem. She never really takes responsibility for becoming an alcoholic (even though she never admits she IS one) - instead she blames it on having no friends, meeting pushy \\"friends\\", and getting involved in the Greek system. I must have rolled my eyes a million times reading this book. Zailckas needs to realize that even though she has low self-esteem, it doesn't mean it's OK to become a substance abuser. Not worth reading, at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book On Addiction Ever!","review":"I borrowed this book and it's the most shallow and hollow and selfishly denying book on addiction that I've ever read. If I could have given it no stars I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOOK AT ME IM A DRUNK","review":"Self-promoting, narcissistic dribble. Author brags about not being an alcoholic yet then writes about how much of a drunk she was for a few years. How pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Go Away","review":"Can someone please stop this trend of rich-white-sorority-girl-bares-her-soul stories? Please. Am I supposed to feel sorry for this girl? Does our youth culture drink too much? Yes. Is her book an accurate account of excess in the youth community? Yes. But when she veers off into her oh-so-pained soul I want to speyack all over the cute cover. Honey, when I was 18, I was working two jobs and worrying about my working-class mother's deteriorating health and lack of health insurance. Did I get drunk with my girlfriend's? Hell yes. Did I write a book about it boo-hooing to the world that I'm not \\"really\\" that girl. Uh no. This girl had a safety net at every point and chose to continue being destructive and ridiculous despite loving parents, plenty of money and the opportunity to have a college education. I have a lot of resentment towards her and women like her."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Book","review":"When my book club selected this book, I thought, \\"Oh boy, here we go. Another college girl gone wild.\\" But then I couldn't stop reading. This book has a remarkable message of love, self-acceptance, and female empowerment and it's author has a sharp wit and a lovely poetic quality. I'd highly recommend it for mothers, their teenagers, community libraries and book clubs. Go on and get Smashed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a moralizing, rambling yawn of a tale","review":"As a fan of memoirs, I was intrigued by this book. But once I got 3/4 of the way through it I almost was wishing for James Frey to come along and slip in a few words of entertaining writing or at least an exciting anecdote or two.The book starts out as a diary of virtually any woman who's been to college since the mid-80s, and then ends on a schoolmarmish, prohibitionist note. Worst of all, there's no insight as to how the author got from one end of the spectrum to the other. For a better written and more insightful book, look for \\"Drinking: A love story\\" by Caroline Knapp."},{"rating":"1","title":"You lost me at \\"I am not an alcoholic\\"","review":"This book is in dangerous territory. It goes through a textbook case, but the writer refuses to see that she is indeed, an alcoholic, and is afraid to embrace that reality. There is alot of glorification of drinking, along with the bad. She states that she is not an alcoholic, but the remainder of the book begs to differ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read? Write? Drink?","review":"Zailckas needs to start drinking again so that she can get a true understanding of alcoholism. I found her book difficult to read; not because of content rather her perspective of alcoholism. Her assertion that she's not an alcoholic just an alcohol abuser that doesn't drink anymore is absurd. Alcohol abuser = alcoholic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Interesting as You Would Think","review":"The good thing about this book is that it showed me that if Ms. Zalickas can get published, I can probably get published one day. It has a juicy title, but it is not too interesting of a read. I kept waiting for something to happen. Nothing really did. She gets drunk in high school. She gets drunk in college. Ummmm....join the club. Granted, her drinking is excessive but she really doesn't have anything creative to say about it. I found her writing subpar. At times, I felt like I was reading half of a college essay and half of a novel. She also repeats herself over and over and over again. \\"I got drunk because I hated myself. I got drunk because I couldn't be close to someone.\\" Yeah yeah yeah. I GET IT. She also goes on these diatribes about drinking and masculinity/femininity that are these random generalizations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-absorbed and not well written","review":"I read this in conjunction with 'Blackout Girl'. Both books suffer from the same disease...that the authors think the facts of their life story are interesting in and of themselves. But they are not. Tales of dysfunctional parents and wild debauchery may make for a good hour on the Jerry Springer Show, they do not necessarily make interesting reading.The other issue is that most of the writing is cliched and trite to the point of exhaustion. It did get to the point where I could not finish this book....it no longer seemed worth the investment of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it less stars...","review":"This book starts off good and giving you a back story..but by the middle, I was ready to pull my hair out. Being in my early 20's, I can not relate to this girl what so ever! I mean, you would think if she was in that poor state and going on rampages, that someone would have had a talk with her, shipped her to rehab or something. It really makes me wonder how much is true. I wouldn't recommend this book, not only because of that, but because by the middle of it, it's REAL slow. I mean, I hardly could finish it. I had to skim pages to get through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh...my...","review":"god. this book... is a disappointment. no, disappointment is an understatement. one star was just me being GENEROUS. I didn't believe the reviews, so I went out and rented it. I love memoirs. but this book, the way it was written, flip flops from past tense to present back to past then to present tense again in JUST a paragraph. It was horrid. Even the prologue had me antsy. I couldn't bear to read one more sentence that I literally threw it on the floor. Its going right back to the library tomorrow. Save your money. I don't write reviews so I went out of my way to write one for this book just to say IT SUCKED. Read it if you dare."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"I had been looking forward to reading this book. Man am I disappointed! I feel like all she is is a whiny privledged white girl from the burbs whose life is so rough she has to drink it away. Every other thing she describes is full of references that no 18 year old girl would ever use. No 18 year old girl thinks like that. Overwritten to the max! And really if you were that drunk you wouldn't remember it, would you? I really had high hopes for this book as a testament to younger girls who have alcohol problems, but this is rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I thought this book was boring. It was a waste of my time to read it, and I wish I never read it. She just moans and wails and moans and wails. She is a low self-esteemed alcholic and an annoying one at that. Then all of a sudden, she starts preaching about crap in the last 20 pages of the book. The last few pages of the book made my stomach turn. If I could give this book zero stars I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Valuable Teaching Tool","review":"I do not entirely disagree with reviewers who have questioned Miss Zailckas' assertion that she is \\"not an alcoholic.\\" I, too, have a great deal of knowledge (personal and otherwise) on the subject of alcoholism. However, I am also a high school teacher. I have loaned my copy of Smashed to students who have had problems with substance abuse, and they have come back to me deeply moved, sometimes changed. I don't know that those students would have been as affected had Miss Zailckas labeled herself an alcoholic. Miss Zailckas, after all, is a kid. And she certainly knows how to speak to her generation. I would recommend this book to any and all high school educators."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying and pretentious","review":"I wanted to like this book and went into it with an open mind. Yes, Koren approaches the topic of \\"drinking\\" in an honest way but she is not honest about herself. She refuses to call herself an alcoholic and casts judgement about alcoholics and AA and addiction counselors, while at the same time describing her own obvious alcoholic behaviour. I was thoroughly annoyed with her personality, she came off as a snobbish know-it-all and constantly reminded readers that she was, in fact, a literary scholar. Judging by her choppy writing, I disagree.It was difficult to keep a clear timeline of events as she merely jumped from one story about blackouts to the next. I walked away from \\"Smashed\\" thoroughly disapointed and $14 poorer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tediously narcissistic","review":"I became attracted to this book by a Readers Digest exerpt. The exerpted part was about Koren's \\"almost death\\" in high school. I was fascinated and raced to the library to get it. I was deeply disappointed. Koren takes no responsibility for her own actions, she blames everything and everyone but herself for her drinking. I do blame her parents, they seem to have ignored her issues which were clearly so evident. Where the heck were they? I don't really care if she's an alcohol abuser or an alcoholic, but she isn't dealing with her issues and is probably going to fall back either into drinking or some other self-destructive habit. It's not a particularly well-written book, content aside. The four-letter words are annoying. I personally think that people use them as filler when they don't have much of substance to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"I binge read this book!","review":"I read this book in one day, without stopping to eat or bathroom break! I found it to be well written and thought provoking. It has this great sarcastic tone in some places and it's heartbreakingly familiar in others... It got me re-evaluating my relationship with alcohol, and everything else, and everything in between."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic read","review":"I bought this book because after reading the opening paragraph i was hooked. In a sense, it gave me a different perspective to view alcoholics/alcohol-dependent people/binge drinkers, and while I used to wonder whether it was something about the 'cool' factor that made people drink non-stop, Zailckas' brutally honest writing style has made me think differently.Highly recommended not just for drinkers or people with family members that binge drink, but for everyone. I'm pretty sure some time in our lives, most, if not all, of us have passed certain unfair judgements on people we see passed out at bars or places like this, and this book offers a refreshingly different viewpoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat","review":"I really wanted to love this book. As a gal who was a teenage alcoholic, I thought that it would hit home. In a way it did, but Koren lost me along the way. She didn't dive right in and she didn't plunge right out. Her story reminded me of a beer that's gone flat. I suppose it's her personality in general, but I was dissapointed in general. She chickened out. She didn't get to the heart, which I believe would have made this story a hell of a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressing and Uplifting","review":"I don't know what I expected when I picked up this book--a funny story of a \\"smashed\\" girl learing how to hold her alcohol, or a poignant story of how to move on after spending a girlhood dependent on alcohol. What I did find was a well-written combination of the two. As a fellow female, I can relate to the reasons why she took that first drink, but can't relate to the excessive extremes she went to after drinking it. It seemed to me that this was a girl so unhappy and unfulfilled with her life, that the only thing that made her feel good and worthy both to herself and others was alcohol. I was glad to read at the end that she is turning her life around and experiencing life as a sober person.I definitely recommend this book, but not as a \\"read this to see what could happen to you\\" book. Instead, read it for its uplifting ending, knowing that there is no less smashed girl living amongst--she is no longer a victim but a survivor."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't like the book.","review":"I just was not impressed with it. I'm sorry if you do like this book. I am a guy and maybe that is why I did not like it that much. This book just was not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of Painful Cliches","review":"I'm still trying to figure out what this book is supposed to be about. The message I got was that the author is simply not worth being around until she's got a few drinks poured down her throat. Certainly that's the only way she'd be remotely tollerable. She whines for page after page and uses the word verdant way too many times. It's too easy to blame substance abuse for your problems when you need to get some professional help and admit that you've got some issues.One of my favorite sayings from my college days was \\"I'm a drunk, alcoholics go to meetings.\\" The author needs to get over herself, go to treatment, and quit spewing her \\"Poor Me\\" story on unsuspecting readers.I'm not ashamed to say that I took this book back to the store and returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smashing","review":"This book goes so far beyond the reviews I've read for it. It is sad, it is extremely funny, and once you start it you cannot put it down. The reviews are focusing on the alcohol, and while it surely is the theme, it is the writing the makes this book great."},{"rating":"1","title":"14? Really?","review":"As much as I admire Koren for telling her story, I have to look back to when I was 14 and try to remember if I felt anything remotely like she did. And I came to the conclusion that I didn't have any of those feelings or thoughts that she claims to have had at that age. It just seems a little too deep for someone who was 14 at the time. At her current age, sure, or even late teens, but at 14? It just makes the book hard to accept at face value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care for certain apects","review":"I think her descriptions of events are very realistic - but I think the auther has no realistic handle on herself or her situation. I read it all, but walked away annoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I'm not a fan of memoirs, but I thought to give this one a shot. Boy, was that a mistake. As most memoirs I have read, this is way too self-indulgent and self-pitying to my liking. It claims to be honest, but I highly doubt it is. The writing is bad. Some characters and events are mentioned for seemingly no reason. It appears Ms. Zailckas confused writing a memoir with writing a diary."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Generation Y thinks they invented partying?","review":"Zailckas's college experience and high school experience are pretty tame compared to mine and many I grew up with. I can't help but laugh when I read a 43 year old mom's review about how shocked she was to discover what really happens at college and in high school. This behavior has been going on since I was in high school in the late 80's-we just kept quiet about it. This book became pretty boring half way through and I feel sorry that such a pretty, talented young woman lacked so much self esteem.Seriously though, I'm glad she sobered up, but nothing this girl did was really shocking. Yeah, I'm definitely going to write a memoir about my teens and early 20's-MUCH more riveting I assure you..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cat Dish","review":"My cat was scooping his food and making somewhat of a mess with his smaller dish.

The first part, which deals with a stereotypical drunken Southern father (please! can we get any more banal?) and his family, is mildly interesting. The second part focuses on the surviving daughter, Dalia, left penniless, who determines to marry for money and of course, ends up well-off but with an abusive husband. The third part highlights Dalia's daughter, who turns into a rebellious \\"flapper\\" and outrages her mother completely.

Absolutely dreadful. I should have known when I saw the jacket: a woman's figure from the wrong era pasted onto a pine farm.The book is overwritten and under-imagined. The characters are cardboard and impossible to view with empathy or even affection--apathy is more like it. (Why must novels about my native South be peopled by bizarre, perfervid gothic types?) Unimportant action is minutely detailed, while major movements are left unrealized. The dialogue is artificial, imperfectly accented, and stagy; in fact, the entire book is stagy, as if it were written with film in mind. (God help the director.)

There are maybe 8 different moves in this video, that are simply done over and over again. On top of that, the cuing could be better, and the moves could be detailed a bit more. She kind of just jumps into them.I will say, she seems lovely, and some of the moves can be fun. However, this video is simply too repetitive, and too easy (I hardly broke a sweat, I may as well have gone on a walk outside) to be worth the $15. I gave it two chances, both times I could hardly get through the first portion before putting in a different dvd. While I would love to add hip hop into my routine, unfortunately, this isn't the video to do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fun","review":"I ordered this video for myself and my daughter to work out- we thought it would be fun. The music was lame- not anything that got us wanting to get up and go- more like boring background music. The video only features the same girl working out, and it feels like a traditional work out- not like a dance routine. We were hoping to dance, have fun, and get our heart rates going- instead we turned it off after about 20 minutes and were sad we had wasted our money on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic music","review":"The music on this video is generic hiphop beats---no familiar songs on it so the workout quickly becomes monotonous.

The sound quality, rhythm, and motivation are all top-notch.As a few of the other reviewers have pointed out, sometimes one track to another does not keep the same footing, so you may have to do minor adjustments in your run, but I haven't found this to be annoying enough to detract from the overall value.What probably bothers me the most about it, is the the person singing the cadence switches every 4-5 tracks. (but again, it doesn't bother me enough to subtract from the overall value)I will still probably buy another CD of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"OOHRAH!","review":"Got these for our son, who was on leave after boot camp.

But for those who do, you will find that the pace is perfect for a good, steady run. Out of the series, I found that the USMC one was, though repetitive, the most oustanding. There is a good mix of humor, motivation, and good ol' Marine violence. Some of the others, especially the Army ones, are dated back to Vietnam or the Cold War when they talk about commies, UH-1s, etc.I wish they had a rated R version as well. These are rather tame compared to the reality. Still, its a great inspiration to anyone who was, wants to be, or wishes they were running with the Corps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motivating","review":"I can't run without this CD.

She was given the choice of any book in the store and picked this one because of the photographic layout. This particular book provides a fun method to learn about a historic figure without becoming bored with the material. My daughter is a visual learning. So this particular style of writing, encouraged her to keep turning the page. Overall, a very informative story that entertains even young readers. Very appropriate also for completing homework assignments. What I also enjoyed about the book was the \\"bubbles\\" of information that defined terms for younger readers. For example, page 10 uses the word plantation in the text and the page provides a description of the meaning of the word plantation. These type of additions truly help the young reader learn something new."},{"rating":"1","title":"For correct and crummy","review":"To expect anything from this publication other than shallow and misleading would be correct.

The Grimer/Magnemite episode is just kinda there...nothing too major aside from Ash catching a Muk. The third episode is better than it sounds, featuring the Diglett and Dugtrio, as well as Team Rocket's Pokemon meeting their evolution.I have most of the released Pokemon DVDs...like I said, I wouldn't reccomend this as the first choice, but you won't be dissapointed in it either way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vol. 10 of the Pokemon series and it rocks","review":"This Video includes -The Punchy Pokemon -Sparks fly for Magnemite -Dig those Digletts"},{"rating":"2","title":"shoes that fit","review":"I have very wide feet , these shoes fit just right.

What is it with people's obsession's with Anne Frank anyway? Her diary is one of the most BORING stories I have ever read. There is nothing appealing about Anne's story.

It is as fresh today as it was when I read it the first time about 30 years ago.I am always struck by those who use Anne's quote about people really being good at heart. . . According to Anne's friend, Lies Gosslar, Anne certainly didn't think people were good at heart after being imprisoned at Aushwitz and Bergen-Belsen. Trying to put a happy face on the Holocaust or give it a positive spin is really more than I can stomach."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING! Not the novel.

It's just so simple and poignant, and you're truly touched by it. It doesn't have a lot of action, but you fall in love with the characters. What's also incredible is that it shows the nice side of Zeon, and even an EF fan like myself can sympathize with the Zeeks.If you can't get past the fact that the animation isn't shiny and mecha aren't constantly blowing each other up, then it's your own loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great anime, but it is a side story :(","review":"I strongly reccomend to anyone who has seen any of the UC gundam to get this DVD set. It has a great story and adds to the develpment of the One Year War. Showing things from the Zeon perspective and from a neutral point also. After viewing this dvd you will learn that in war there are no winners and that both sides were no better than the other, they both had good people and they both had corrupt people. If you know little or nothing about the original Gundam, this title may not be for you. The main draw back has to be the price for the few episodes and the fact that it is a side story to 0079."},{"rating":"1","title":"holy crap this show sucked nuts","review":"man this was the worst gundam EVER boring as hell whiney little kid that cries for 6 episodes and the zakus are cooler than the gundam is what the hell? that shouldn't be that way and the story made zeon seem like innocent people fighting for freedom when they are trying to kill millions by droppig a space colony on earth. i really hated this show and there was hardly any battles and it's a friekin gundam show! don't but this get 0083 or wing or any other kinda of gundam avoid this show at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"this show sucked nuts","review":"man this was the worst gundam EVER boring as hell whiney little kid that cries for 6 episodes and the zakus are cooler than the gundam is what the hell? that shouldn't be that way and the story made zeon seem like innocent people fighting for freedom when they are trying to kill millions by droppig a space colony on earth. i really hated this show and there was hardly any battles and it's a friekin gundam show! don't but this get 0083 or wing or any other kinda of gundam avoid this show at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I've ridden Valley of Fire SP and this video really makes me feel like I am back again.

I love the scenery and like the music a lot. How about the bands Sevenaya and the Rastaman Music... I usually make the degree of suggested exertion about two levels higher than what's suggested: So if it says a 6, I usually run about an 8. Also I usually stand about a minute or so past what they suggest. And through in a few additional one minute sprints when they are at recovery for \\"far\\" too long. With these additions, I think it's a VERY chalenging and affective workout.BTW- I've seen other DVD's from Endurance Films and was dissappointed because they are not near as thought out as this tape was...Kudo's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Later videos in this series are much better","review":"I purchased this video because I already owned two others in the series- North Carolina and Southern California (both are great). It's clear that they hadn't quite worked out the bugs yet on this one. The music tempo, heart rate target, RPE target, and the actions of the riders on the screen are not coordinated. at all. Whiny alternative ballads, with the riders on screen lightly spinning- but you're supposed to be pegged at 90% MHR? 85% MHR = RPE of 6?There's also no indication of what's coming up in the workout for the first half of the movie. So when a short interval flashes on the screen, it takes a good portion of the time to find the correct gearing. They seemed to realize this problem halfway through.If anybody wants a free copy, you can have mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one, but first is best","review":"Part two of the Rides series lacks a little realism. How can this be in a simulated ride you ask? Take for instance the fact that while the on screen dashboard tells you to do a cadence of 80 it is clear the riders are doing 50 or less. This was not the case in the first RIDES. I find myself having a hard time keeping \\"pace\\" with these glaring abnormalities. It is still a good workout but only if you can ignore the fact you are spinning like crazy while the others pound it out nice and slow. JUST THE FACTS: Buy this one only after you have become bored of the first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, but I don't like the distractions","review":"This was the first one of this type I've gotten because of reviews I read on Amazon.

Her new series, To Protect and Defend' comes nowhere near the sizzle in Codename: Danger. It's a pity as Lovelace is so talented and leaves you wanting more after each title. I found A Question of Intent mediocre, there was no suspense neither did the romance between Jill and Cody sparkle. No fireworks, no witty repartees and nothing in the plot to make this book worth reading. I have Full Throttle to be read and if it's no different from Question of Intent, I'm going to have to give Lovelace a miss until she comes out with a single title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early","review":"You just can't beat 3 PPV for $19.99.

It sent me through a whirlwind of emotion, discovery, and affirmation. I cried through the whole book, sobbed even. The messages of human value, compassion, love, and hope are so inspiring and real.

The story of Oliver and Christopher de Vinck helped me to find hope for my child and the deep impact that he would have on my life, and the lives of others.My son is now 3 years old, and all of those warnings from my doctor came true. My dear son cannot walk or talk, and he is severely impaired; however, just like Oliver, he is touching lives, stirring emotions, and bringing meaning to the lives of those who are willing to see the power of the powerless."},{"rating":"2","title":"These work just fine","review":"When told by the boss we were going to start wearing ID badges I turned to trusty Amazon for the necessary products.

It accounts for the journey day-by-day and fills in the gaps left from video editing and government restrictions (there were many areas the camera crew was either not allowed to film or weren't allowed to enter). It also gives a little of the behind-the-scenes to the series, which I always appreciate. Along with all this information, the journal is written much as you'd expect from Michael Palin and is, in itself, an enjoyable travel book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Full of Michael Palin's signature wit and odd perspective on life, be prepared for a more in depth and exciting view of his journey.Garunteed to make you chuckle every now and then and well known to bring about sudden and obnoxious laughter!

It shows you how you can check the power steering fluid level, but does not cover how you can change the fluid nor shows you how to replace the filter inside(yes, there is one. you will see it after sucking all the fluid out). Just about the only useful information you will get out of this book is how you can make a fan clutch special tool by taking the 12 point wrench and grinding it to make it smaller. The most important tune up step - rebuilding diesel injectors is not covered. It does have 5 steps to remove injectors from injector block.

There was not one kiss in the entire movie, and the only crotch shot there was, was the bonus footage of one of the actresses taking a non-seductive bath by herself, and yes, it's as stupid that it sounds. Until now, Leprachaun 4 took the cake as the worst movie ever. Move over, little green guy, SPACEAGE LESBIAN VAMPIRES have sunken to depths you just could not reach. Avoid at all costs.

And when one reads from someone elses opinion often it is slanted to one side and does not share the full picture in the correct light. This is usual.

While I will agree that a very few people place great importance on her interpretations and writings, to assert that a majority of SDA members do this is an outright lie.Second, God, Ellen White, and hopefully your local pastor have stated that the BIBLE is the Word of God and the final authority.

After the fall, humanity needs a fourth characteristic to get back to the ideal, so to speak: deliverance/salvation. This motif--deliverance, community, knowledge of God, and blessing/land--recurs throughout Israel's history and is the essence of Marten's OT theology. He describes God, then, not with traditional categories like omnipotence or omniscience, but rather with categories based on what God does. So, God is a warrior, a deliverer, etc.Excellent, excellent little theology that most people don't know about.

For those interested primarily in Waltz, Fox Trot, and Tango, \\"Gotta Ballroom\\" is a better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"The professionals who have been reviewing this may love it, but the book is definitely not for beginners. It devotes pages and pages to posture, breathing technique, history and other such topics but precious little on the basics of what steps to dance. When, after 14 chapters he finally starts teaching you how to dance, it's almost incomprehensible. This guy does not know how to give simple instructions that most people will understand. If you are new to ballroom dancing, don't buy this book. It will be of little help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I normally love the \\"Idiot\\" books. I've used them for years and love the straight forward approach. I was very dissapointed in this book. The writting is convoluted. Even with careful reading, sometimes as many as 10 times, I am not sure what he is describing or what I should do. I suspect people that are decent dancers may find useful information here. If you're learning to dance- skip this one! You don't get to any of the dance steps until almost halfway through the book, and are very poorly described. He refers constantly to the dvd that comes with it- he should have just made a video, maybe then we could have figured out what he meant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"What I wanted were easy step by step lessons but what I found were verbose and complex explanations.

A DVD that demonstrates the actual foot moves is by far more helpful. I have found the Vicki Regan DVD's to bet the best because they show you the steps many times over with and without music. Trust me, I am a pure amatuer on the dance floor, but watching Vicki and her partner show every move in stages, I can duplicate them. I'm still no Fred Astaire, but I guarantee you that watching the Regan DVD's will put you on the dance floor. I have Fox Trot, Waltz, Rhumba, Swing and niteclub DVD's. I'm still not brave enough to venture into Tango, Mambo or any of the extreme Latin dances...YET."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Very Best \\"Dancing\\" Book That Exists","review":"If you want to merely shuffle your feet and do the bunny-hop, this is not the book for you...get something else.

To learn, you have to read the appropriate chapter of his book, watch the appropriate section of the DVD and practice again and again.Nobody can take something that is inherently complex and difficult and spoon feed it to you in five minutes. But everything you need is right there. Jeff Allen takes his craft seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misleading title?","review":"This book was different from what I was led to believe: it is a \\"detailed, sophisticated, and comprehensive\\" - not \\"idiot's\\" guide to ballroom dancing. I am enjoying the book, but the history and background, and then the technical foundation the book lays in finally getting to the actual dance steps, are more for the serious student who is NOT an idiot. This is clearly a serious book written by a serious dance teacher for serious students who are not idiots!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much guff","review":"This book has some great material, and its history bits are good, but if you just want some hints on learning to dance there is way too much 'stuff' you have to wade through before you get to anything about dancing ... you're half way through the book before you get to the actual dance steps - and too much stuff you have to wade through around each dance.If you want LOTS of history and detail, this is the book for you. If you want to get down to dancing ... it has some good info in it, but it takes a lot of work to find it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even an non-idiot might have difficulty wading through this","review":"I've had this book for 3 years now, and at the same time I've been taking weekly ballroom dance classes. I thought that as I got more hands-on instruction, I would feel more comfortable with the instructional part of the book. I never did. Now that I am far more advanced than what is taught in the book, I still feel a bit confused trying to figure out what the author trying to teach. OK, some maybe I'm an idiot, but if I am, then this book should be geared to me.

Being of a different culture, this timepiece still works today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brazilian Delight","review":"Marcel Camus's film recreates the Orpheus tragedy with an all black cast. Set in Rio de Janiero, the film captures the beauty of Brazilian culture. Whether it is the sambadromes or the rythmns of Brazil's Afro-Lusitanian music, the beautiful score written by Antonio Jobim and Luis Bonfa has become legendary and it help led a bossa nova explosion during the 1960's (similar to our present-day Latin explosion). While everything looks fine and dandy in this film, Brazil's society, especially in Rio, is a bit more grittier, and being a Frenchman, Camus ignored the realities faced my millions of \\"cariocas\\". Interested viewers should watch the films \\"Pixote,\\" and \\"Central Station,\\" to get more of a feeling for life in this city, but nevertheless, Black Orpheus remmains a classic in international cinema for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"I love this movie. I am from Pittsburgh, PA, and would love to know more about Marpessa Dawn. I read somewhere that she was once a dancer with Katherine Dunham's group. I was wondering if she did speak Portuguese. Too bad there was not much work for a beautiful actress such as she at that time. The movie is haunting and much like poetry in motion. A true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it for the music","review":"This is one of the best movies (for it's music) of all time. The samba and the dance bring the watcher into a place we would all love to enter. Of course it's not all good, with death stalking pretty girls and other pretty girls being jelous, but I think given the chance, we'd all step into this mostly idyllic Carnival world. I just wish they could have done something with the volume inconsistencies on this DVD. The songs (especially Orfeo's song) are much softer than the samba drumming and dancing scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"film not in original format","review":"Another wonderful film has been altered for the wide screen.

TIME April 21, 2008 p.38), fell in love with this movie when I first saw it in 1960. A colorful cinematic feast for the eyes filmed in Rio at Carnival time, presents a well crafted classic myth that penetrates the deepest depths of your soul and gives you an experience you've never had before. This strange, beautiful tale of native life, love and death had just as powerful an impact on me nearly 50 years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life and death, day and night, this movie hits for the cycle","review":"Retelling of Greek Myth, set in 1958 Rio. Orpheus,a legend in the poverty stricken hills above the beautiful city, prepares for Carnival. Music and Carnival provide a respite from the spirit crushing life of the poor-but even amid this mirage of anticipation, for Carnival, essential truths of life will manifest themselves. As the masses prepare for carnival, Orpheus persues Eurydice, a woman he has just met. She is persued by death, and Orpheus and Eurydice are both persued by Orpheus' vengeful fiance. Powerful message of the nature of life and the fact that, in the end, the cycle of life is beyond man's ability to change or affect it. Timeless, this film is as true today in it's relevance as when it was released in 1959. It will always be one of the finer films for those that want to think about what life means."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will be ordering the anniversary dvd soon","review":"I loved this movie, made way before my time.

When we found which player would play it without skipping we had an extreemly enjoyable time. Some scenes were a bit sensual even though it has a PG rating. The rating is close though. It didn't seem like the movie was as long as it says. It goes by quickly. It does have an \\"intermission\\" in the middle which is good.

This seems like some clueless record executive trying to make something like Koyaanisqatsi.Somewhere towards the end, there's kind of cheesy romantic melody and the video turns Into a kind of soft-core porn. It's all so comically bad. It's so bad I'll probably hold onto it because it's so messed up a creation."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Sanborn plays a wonderfull concert","review":"I bought this DVD last month, David Sanborn play concert for Saxophone?, I did have not idea that this video was a great adquisition for my collection.

It is inspirational and reflective. It just takes you to ANOTHER place than where you are physically.The track \\"El Shaddai\\" is my favorite (although I have NO dislike tracks on this cd). The inspiration and beauty of the piece actually sends chills through me.I can't say nearly enough in the praise for the group Eden's Bridge.

I would love to be fortunate sometime in life to see them perform live.I know there are some Eden's Bridge fans out there as I reviewed another one of their cd's and have read your reviews.

Arthur's New Puppy is the eighteenth book in the best-selling series. It follows the misadventures of the lovable aardvark as he attempts to housebreak his bouncy puppy Pal.Children seem to identify with Arthur as he struggles with everyday problems with the help of his loving parents (and no help from his pesky little sister, D.W.) and friends.If you have an Arthur fan in the house, or if you have a new puppy in the house, you'll want to check out this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't like the story","review":"I've read this to a number of 4 year olds - and they all get bored.

My fave song is \\"More Faithful\\" although that's a very tough choice to make. They're all so good! The only song I don't really like is \\"Pour\\". It's a great song, but they shouldn't have stuck it between \\"More Faithful\\" and \\"Suspended In You\\", the two best songs on the album. More often than not, I skip over it. I also really love \\"Whirlwind\\". What powerful lyrics! I find \\"Scarecrow\\" to be the story of my life, and it is challenging me to change. Basically, this CD is a winner, because not only does it have powerful, God-centered lyrics, they are driven by equally powerful musical passion. I was also really impressed by all the band members humility as they were on stage. They didn't want people to worship them. All our worship went to God that evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before Invincible, there was Hey You.","review":"Hey You I Love Your Soul came out in 1998. I love this album because you can see the evolution of the band combining Rock, Techno and a Ballad all within one song. With HYILYS they are almost there. The effect they create makes a non-techno fan go from Huh? to Wow! No sound bit can give you a hint of what the song is really about, because each song is a journey through sounds, feelings and verses that grab you. I like this album because you see where were going in the Album before their monster INVINCIBLE.Invincible gets it absolutely right for me. The mix of a subtler techno with rock, its time changes combined with the entire structure of the album makes for one of the best albums I have ever heard in any genre. Invincible is the must have album but if you like a little more techno (some say a lot more) mixed with rock, you will enjoy Hey You.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This book seems hopelessly out of touch with Black culture and US culture in general.

The packaging indicates it's suitable for 3 years and up. I tried playing this with a four and a half year old and he couldn't follow the instructions. Tried playing it with an adult later, and again, the instructions are unclear to all but the designers of the game.2. The board folds into fourths, not one half - I have to wonder how long it will last when a child tried folding it their way.3. Again, no directional arrows or clear modes of travel across the board - the squares are numbered up to 68 - know any three year olds who can count that high?Overall, this game is a cheap ploy to grab the money of anyone who is trying to make a fan of the Rescue Heroes happy.

And the Snowball Run game will not let her play the advanced levels (they won't unlock) even though she has mastered the beginning and intermediate levels repeatedly and the screen says now you can go on to the advanced level (but then it won't unlock the levels).

It was not. Firstly, it is very short. Just over 50 minutes. It did not point out specific sites or the best places to go (someone had stated it was an \\"insiders view\\", I would disagree). It did feature the \\"Conch Train\\" which was sort of interesting. But it was mainly a historical/cultural look at Key West. In doing so, it was far too brief to be particularly effective.Also, it came in a cheap cardboard container. Not the typical size or construction of a DVD container. For the price, I expect better.Bottom line, if you are looking for a vacation guide try something else. If you just want to see what Key West \\"looks like\\", you may enjoy this DVD. Even then, it is far to brief to justify the cost ... Not particularly well done either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring & Outdated","review":"This DVD is one of the most boring I ever seen.

I won't spoil the rest, but by the end I was so disgusted with the husband, the wife, and their situation, that I wanted my money back. I'm so glad I bought this used instead of new.Also, maybe this shows the male point of view on infertility well, but not the female one. There's so little detail on what the woman actually goes through in a trying to conceive cycle--it's laughable.If you get it, enjoy the beginning, and don't feel bad about skimming the second half.

Story is scarce, sound is almost indecipherable, but if you watch the actors, (locals hired for the film,) they wade waist deep into the icy Atlantic breakers without even flinching, it's an every day thing for them to risk their lives to gather a torn net or pull a boat through the huge waves, just to glean enough to keep their stomach full.

I set the pest switch to insects/rodents and the volume to medium initially for about a week and left it on 24/7. The squirrels were not deterred. I changed the settings to rodents and loud and even installed it on a timer so that it would only come on at night since the loud setting can be heard in the living room and adjacent kitchen. After several weeks of use the squirrels are still there. I wish I could return it as it doesn't work for the squirrels in my attic. I am past the 30 days return period.

The only two reasons to see this would be to watch the range that Ben Foster and Ginnifer Goodwin have. I liked Foster in 3:10 to Yuma and I think this role helped show his variety, as with Goodwin.This is not a film to grab if you think Hillary Swank, Perry or Graham do anything special. Swank has 5 scenes, Perry spends half the film on a toilet (toilet humor does not work for me anymore) and Graham just seemed to miss it. Watching Perry scoop dog crap up well over ten times didn't work for me either. I like the films from First Look, but this one doesn't meet the grade of competency, except for Foster building a solid foundation - and when I think about it he actually had more screen time than anyone, so maybe they should change the cover art to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"overbearing and not the best dysfunctional family drama","review":"Spanning 1 hour at 20 minutes this movie feels much longer and not necessarily in a pleasant way.

Reading it is like making the long, exciting, slow climb up a roller coaster -- you want to cover your eyes, but you just can't. The author is obviously passionate about his research, and his findings go far beyond any other book on this subject. I'll be flying through the Bermuda Triangle in April, 2004, and now am armed with many landmarks, curiosities, etc., to look for from my (hopefully) safe vantage point! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you believe in alien abductions you will like this book","review":"One more pseudo-scientific analysis of the \\"mysteries\\" of the Bermuda Triangle. The writer, like those before him tends to leave out details from the official reports that make disappearances less mysterious. He also demonstrates a lack of maritime knowledge as well as expertise in aviation, navigation and geography of the region.This book like the others of the genre, turns any disappearance without hard evidence of the reason into a mysterious event. In an area that is subject to hurricanes and winter storms, covered with thousands of square miles of poorly charted, unmarked, unlit reefs and traversed by tens of thousands of boats and planes yearly the biggest mystery is that there are not more disappearances."},{"rating":"2","title":"tough gloves","review":"I grew up in the construction industry so gloves are a must ... from the get go ironclad gloves were excellent, they fit nicely and they stand under pressure.

There are several quirky characters in this film that speak hilarious dialogue. Just don't rent or purchase this movie expecting a scary movie, because it's more a comedy than anything else. None of the death scenes are pulled off as good as they could have been, but I'm sure that has to do with the budget. For example, there's a scene at a rave that could have been a massacre, but it didn't happen. Paul Bailey is great as The Cowboy. Cowboy Killer isn't a great movie, but if you want to be entertained for an hour and twenty minutes, then you're in for a dang treat!

I find that most people do not understand what all the Y2K fuss is about. This book is written from a viewpoint that only someone with experience in the computer field would have. It was not written by a writer looking to make a quick buck on the Y2K paranoia. The book gives the worst case, best case and in between possibilities and the reasons they may or may not come to be. This allows the readers to decide for themselves how extensively they want to prepare for Y2K. Information in this book is presented from the Christian viewpoint, but is of the value to all people interested in preparing properly for Y2K. I highly suggest you buy a copy and decide for yourself what level of preparedness you want to be at when you know the facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing, intelligent look at Y2K, and beyond.","review":"I found \\"The Christian's Y2K Preparedness Handbook\\" to be a wonderful, and sane approach to dealing with all the issues that have been related to Y2K. The writers take a reasoned, thoughtful look at all aspects of life, and offer sound advice for dealing with investments, family, community and the church. They offer clear challenges we can all relate too...'being prepared' for everything from food shortages to opportunities to express and enhance your faith. This book should be read by everyone, Christian or not, who is concerned about the Y2K problems and especially if you are uncertain about the actions you should be taking to protect your family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped me understand a confusing issue- I loved it!","review":"I loved the first part of the book that dealt with the possible scenarios.

They take a very loving and practical approach to how Christians should react to all of this, and how they should minister to their neighbors. My wife liked the middle part of the book with all of the really practical advice on preparing for possible shortages. She says that these are all things we can actually do! We are going to start preparing now. We loved the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE STRUCK A BERG. PUN INTENDED.","review":"From a casting viewpoint, this TV movie has a lot to offer. Great cast. From a plot viewpoint, this movie went down with the ship. I absolutely agree with other reviewers that the rape scene was totally unnecessary. I guess with so many versions of the Titanic story already told, the film makers needed something to make this version stand out. Unfortunately, the brutal rape of a young immigrant girl was a very bad choice as a plot variant. This production makes one realize that there already exist quite a sufficient number of movies on this subject. I mean, in the end, the ship sinks and people die. Tragic, yes, but I think we all get it by now. Enough already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get your hopes up","review":"If you've already seen James Cameron's Titanic, skip this one or you're in for a big disappointment. First of all the acting is atrocious!! They added a few well known names but even they can't carry this movie. Second of all, the creators of this film paid little attention to detail and accuracy. Most of the historical characters, such as Molly Brown are nothing more than characatures of themselves and badly done at that. The script could have been written by a Junior High school student. The effects are slightly higher than your average TV series but that's not saying much. The film realy stunk in my book. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasently surprised","review":"I had no idea this version of the Titanic existed until this year. I now own 4 movies about the Titanic, including \\"A Night to Remember - 1958\\", \\"Titanic - 1953\\", \\"The Titanic - 1996\\", and of course \\"Titanic - 1997 with Leonardo DeCaprio\\".I rate all 4 movies with a 5. They are all done remarkably well and each brings it's own interpritation to this trajic story. For this version, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Peter Gallagher, Merilu Henner, George C. Scott, their acting is fantastic. as always they deliver a stunning performance. If you liked any one of the Titanic Movies, I recommend getting them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Molly Brown show!!!","review":"The story is one that we all have heard several times over. Titanic goes into the North Atlantic Ocean, hits an iceberg, and sinks with over 1500 people on board. To me, the thing that makes this show worth a watch is the portrayal of Molly Brown. For all true titanic aficionados, there hasn't been a true depiction of Mrs. Brown yet. Jim Cameron's Molly was good but fell during the scene in the lifeboat. Marilu Henner did a great job in showing Molly's spunk, especially when she tells the person in charge of the lifeboat that she would dump him overboard. Now if we can only get both Cameron's and Marilu Henners' Molly's together then you will have one great show. After all, what happened to the ship dose need to be known. But it is the stories of the passengers that are the most important. Don't you agree?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-see for Titanic buffs","review":"-This is a two-part mini-series made for TV, for the most part I really enjoyed it. I am a big Titanic buff and I'm fascinated by the true event. The only two problems I saw with this film was that the real-life character of Thomas Andrews(the ships builder)was for some reason left out of the film. The other problem was that I couldn't stand the actress who played Alice Cleaver(another real-life character),for the most part she was annoying and I can't understand why anybody would trust her with their children. I'll admit that some of the other characters might make this film seem like a soap-opera, but understand thats how it was for those people. One character who standed out was Tim Curry(although that rape scene should not have been so Graphic). Bottom line its a good movie but if your're looking for something else on the subject try the 1958 movie A NIGHT TOO REMEMBER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I am a huge historical Titanic buff, and this movie was truly dissapointing to me. The plot was thin at best, the cast, though superb, turned in a rather blase performance.

This movie has pretty good special effects (for TV), but it lacks the power of good Titanic films. It runs like a long (often BORING) soap opera with stick-figure characters that resemble Cameron's characters way too much (somebody steal an early script??).

One utterly despicable, unforgivable, pointless scene.The purser *r@pes* a young, innocent immigrant girl at the same time the ship hits the iceberg. Apart from being unhistorical, it's completely gratuitous, and worst of all it's irrelevant to the plot. The only reason I can think of for its inclusion was to appeal to people who sexually enjoy seeing young girls viciously raped.Whoever thought that scene up should be barred from screenwriting for life, and perhaps given counselling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie about the Titanic disaster","review":"I didn't see the Titanic movie that starred Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet but I saw this one that starred George C. Scott, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Peter Gallagher and I like it though I could have done without the nasty character played by Tim Curry and what he did to the young immigrant girl and for that reason I can't give this movie 5 stars, I like Tim Curry but I just didn't like the character he played, but there really were some great scenes in this movie especially the scene when the ship was sinking and they showed all the people who didn't make it off and that was really sad especially the children who didn't make it off and It just made me think of the real people who actually lost their lives during the real Titanic disaster that's how powerful that scene was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good telling","review":"Very good telling of the Titanic story from a different perspective.

There is no romance in this book. The heroine is a plaything for all kinds of kink for the hero, but it is written as merely an exchange of fluids, not emotion. I found I didn't care whether the couple lived happily ever after because Whiteside didn't give me any reason to. Very little depth to the characters, but the villain was a bit more fleshed out than the leads and that is why I gave it two stars instead of one.

Richard Dreyfuss often refers to Whose Life Is It Anyway? A popular debate about the ethics of euthanasia and one person's right to choose whether to live or die. Dreyfuss plays a sculptor who, after a car accident, is left a paraplegic. Appalled at the prospect of a life in which he has no control of anything, he pleads with hospital authorities to help him die. When they refuse, he takes them to court. A great drama with a sad ending but I feel this is one of my fafavorite Drufuss movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent and emotional","review":"Richard Dreyfuss plays a young man who is paralyzed in a car accident, but with his mind fully intact; he wants to be discharged from the hospital in order to die. His chief nemesis, of course, is his doctor, played by John Cassavetes. Dreyfuss is such an animated actor that not even being confined to a bed as quadriplegic can take that quality of acting away from him. Just in talking and using his brain he exudes more energy than most actors do in a screen performance.He hires a lawyer to fight his case in court, and he wins. At movie's end he leaves the hospital, and we don't know how to feel: good because he got what he fought for or bad because he's going to die now. Some scenes go straight for the heartstrings, but most of the movie is thought-provoking and intelligently done. Dreyfuss is too good here to completely believe him when he says he can't remember making the movie because of his drug habit at the time. Deserves a DVD release, and soon.

For those concerned about his ability to write without Rich, your fears are over. There are great songs on this cd! My faves include Sunday Sound (very Grateful Dead-esque), Ride (a funky fave), Untangle My Mind (Van Morrison sounding) and the opener, Safe in The Arms of Love. My complaints would be that there are a few too many ballad type tunes that really slow it down, and the lack of balls out rockers, but maybe the guy will make another cd with those types of tunes on it. On the otherhand, a song like Could You Really Love Me is a good direction for Chris, showing his command of the R&B funk of Prince/Sly & the Family Stone.Crowes fans will miss the freewheeling rock out that was the last few Crowes cds, but hey, this is a different beast. Its definitely got a solo vibe to it, but Chris works well with his new guitarist/producer, (the very underrated) Paul Stacey."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"I really wish I could say I liked this CD. But I liked only three songs out of the twelve presented here. Things were really looking up with \\"Safe In The Arms Of Love\\" and \\"Silver Car\\"-the two songs which kick off NEW EARTH MUD. Then we hit a morass of confused sound until \\"She's On Her Way\\"-a great song but unfortunately the last on this album.I was a big fan of the Black Crowes. I even liked the albums most critics panned such as THREE SNAKES & ONE CHARM and AMORICA. So I was really ready to root for Robinson's new project. Maybe in the future, things will pick up. But in the meantime I would advise others to take a pass on this one.NEW EARTH MUD comes with a companion DVD contained a documentary and live accostic performances the band. A lot of people eat this kind of thing up and would buy this album just to get the DVD. I was unimpressed and bored. The DVD didn't change my attitude toward NEW EARTH MUD in the least.Sorry, Chris. I'm on your side but I can't recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice solo effort","review":"Much like Lions, this CD takes more than one listen to grow on you. I have to say that my favorite song from the album by far is \\"Ride\\"; it is just a cool funky soul song. The album as a whole is a slight departure from the typical Black Crowes sound; those expecting a retread of the Black Crowes (as I initially did, I'll admit) will find a differance. But it is a good difference, trust me. I like it more and more each time I listen to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An average album","review":"Let's be honest for potential buyers who are not extreme Black Crowes fans. This is a Chris Robinson solo effort. It is average. Black Crowes together is much better, and much more listenable. For the pop/folksy sound Robinson is trying to convey, so many more artists are so much better.Not to say this is not a decent album. It is. It just isn't that good. The accompanying music is great. Crisp and clean and good sounding. Robinson's vocals alone just aren't really what would be expected for a big label production effort.This disc is good for one, perhaps a second mercy listen. Then it will likely go into the bottom of the pile to be not listened to. Sorry. If you are a HUGE Chris Robinson fan....maybe..... If not, well, perhaps best to try something else or listen to a couple of tracks first."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Robinson brothers need each other!","review":"I am a tremendous fan of the Black Crowes, and I welcome any solo effort from the members. The problem is, however, that the songs on this album are very boring and never really take off. There's just no kick, no jive. Such a shame, because the album's artwork is extraordinary and Chris's vocals and talents as a rock star are prodigious (as are his brother/guitarist Rich). I still love ya' but the fact is, that God meant for the Brother's Robinson to be together.

And more horrible.","review":"When the Crowes decided to take a break, I knew what to expect from a possible Chris Robinson solo album, or so I thought. I expected things to be slowed down, probably more acoustic songs than electric, kind of a folky, blues-type album. What I didn't expect was an album of boring, trite, self-indulgent songs. This album is so incredibly bad...I don't even know where to begin. He tries to incorporate soul aspects into songs with boring progressions that go NOWHERE, and I could never say enough horrible things about the lyrics. This album is awful, I was mortified.

No lie. They were so bad I had had to make them go away. There are lots of \\"neo-folk\\" folks making great music out there, non-neo-folk, too. Some of them even have funny voices.

The DVD is very brief and the 'so called' acoustics on it are AUDIO ONLY I thought we were going to be able to see him play those acoustics! But the documentry is viewable, trouble is, its shot in such a way you really can't see Chris's face that clear so if I was rating the bonus DVD alone it would get MINUS one star. The cd is fair. There are some pretty decent songs. But overall I doubt I'll play it a long time. I like his vocals. The songs are the trouble, I read someone else say they're easy to get into, I disagree they are kinda slow & long. Not popish or catchy at all. I wasn't expecting The Black Crowes but I would like it to be a tad bit faster & catchy.

It's an exercise in formula-based, self-indulgent 4-chord progression repugnance. Listening, one can just picture Robinson sitting in his dressing room kissing the mirror as he \\"composes\\" his next song, identical to all the rest. Worst of all are his TRITE lyrics, guaranteed to induce emotional rigor mortis. How anyone can possibly live with themselves after writing such garbage is beyond me. But by all means, buy this cd.

The age on the box is 3+, and is probably perfect only for kids who are just learning to play board games. But there is nothing for the older set - it's not challenging and the game is very quick - over in about 3 minutes. Candy Land and Chutes and Ladders have held my daughter's attention for much longer.

The pieces are really big which adds to the fun. My 2 year old likes to just hold the backpack and a character piece while we play. After spinning you have to figure out which path you want to take and when you land on a certain part of the map you have to figure out what you need, you also have to figure out which is more advantageous for you when you spin--to use the color or number; so there is a lot of thinking involved in this game and can be adapted for many age levels. The only drawback is that the plastic board is so big that it had to be folded many times to fit in the box. This created permanent bumpy lines so that when you move your pieces around the board, they don't even stay up and the board does not lie flat. This was solved by rolling the board and securing with a rubber band and keeping it outside of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"into buying this for your Dora afficianado.

Originally had the radio shack one, which was absolutely terrible. I also have a hard wired extender which cost over $100 and works fine, but required running cables etc. The Next Generation Remote Extender took less than 5 minutes to set up and works amazingly. We have the newer Verizon FIOS DVR in a closet about 50 feet from the tv. The remote works every time. I've had it for about a week and a half and no signs of the battery losing any life, not that it matters since it comes with 2 rechargable batteries. While one is in use, the other is being charged. You definitely get the most for your money here.

My experience withthe product didn't match most of the purchasers.My Direct Tv remote normally uses 2 AA batteries.

I went through 3 recharging cycles without anyimprovement in life span.I suspect that if your remote uses 4 batteries, the battery life will be extended to acceptablelevels, then too the Direct TV remote might be more demanding on the battery.At least one of the reviews that gave a low rating to the product mentioned low battery life.(The Next Generation was tried in two DirectTV remotes with same results).hilcntry"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad service","review":"work for about 5 months, now that I have a problem of the remote extender not registering my commands, I have tried to fix it myself but to no success. tried to call the manufacturer for warranty, but their phone goes straight to answering machine. left a message but no reply. tried to contact them through email, but they only have sales email but no reply from that too. so I'm sure I am not the only one who have trouble getting them to pick up their phone call or even reply back please tell me so I know that I am not the only one who is getting screwed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for condos","review":"I live in a high rise, and I think there are too many other signals floating around.

The receiver unit would pick up signals from the transmitter (which goes into the battery case of your remote in place of one of your batteries, regardless of whether your remote takes AA or AAA batteries). But it evidently wouldn't re-transmit properly to our satellite box. It's supposed to transmit from the front of the unit, as well as through one of those electric eye extenders that sticks directly in front of the eye of your satellite box (which, in theory, allows you to easily control at least two units, by placing the receiver in front of one and the eye extender in front of another).

Great idea to have the transmitter in the battery casing. No issues with delay. The range is excellent - I went to the 2nd floor to test it and it worked. One last note - the flying saucer doesn't have to have a direct line-of-sight with my DVR in the closet to work.

The kit comes with pieces-parts for one remote - for every extra remote you want to throw into the mix, you need their special battery adapter.2. The kit comes with pieces-parts to control (basically) only one device. The manufacturing cost between sending out a \\"one-eye\\" wire versus a \\"three-eye\\" wire is negligible; it should have been thrown in.However, with that said, I am sticking with it. I'm ordering the extra parts, and honestly, now, for a total of maybe $100, I have what would cost $350 easily if bought in an audio specialty store.It gets a 10/10 for cleverness / originality, 7/10 for \\"pre-sales product disclosure\\" and 8/10 for performance.

I talked with the distributer of this thing trying all their suggestions for making the thing work and nothing helped. The instructions say you can use the emitter from 15' but mine had to be less than 4 inches and usually pushed right up to the IR receiver of my box.Buy this repeater if you don't mind having to press a remote button several times to get it to work OR you don't mind the channels changing even when you did not press anything.

It's room-to-room, so I don't have line-of-sight, and the RF transmitter/receiver works perfectly, repeatably, and accurately.I've used other \\"remote extenders\\" with poor results, and a lot of frustration. In short, for $50, the value can't be beat - it's well worth the price. I highly recommend it.

With this product I can control the cable box and the DVD player with their two remote controls while having the actual devices hidden away and out of sight.I eneded up ordering two of these units becaue it was about the same price as ordering one unit plus the three-way eye and the additional battery (transmitter). So one unit controls the cable box and the other controls the Blue-Ray DVD player.One minor issue is with the Comcast Scientific Atlanta DVR Cable Box.

It finally died and am I glad it did. I researched the Next Generation Wireless RF Remote Control Extender and decided to purchase it. WOW is all I can say. This product is the best we have had and now I have recommended it to a friend and she is thrilled with it also. Both of our receivers are in a different part of our house and this remote extender works well with the receiver one floor up and at the other end of the house and also at my friends house the receiver is in another building next to her house.

I tried replacing the RF battery from the charger but no luck. THE SOLUTION: a fresh set of AAA batteries plus the units RF/battery unit. Even though the AAA cells were working they were showing \\"Replace or Re-charge\\" when I checked them with my battery checker. A fresh set of AAA cells brought the Next Gen unit back to full operation. It apparently needs a complete set of strong batteries in the Logitech Remote to generate a sufficient RF signal to the base unit. The Next Gen unit now is working as well as it did initially."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great with Comcast","review":"Love, love, love this product. Hook up was easy and now I can watch my Comcast dvr and set up new recordings from the tv room, kitchen and bedroom. This just works the remote control so you still need cabling from the dvr to all tvs and use the same remote control in all rooms. It seems to work better when I don't point it directly at the tv. Maybe the dvr gets confused when it gets signal from the remote control extender and the regular way at the same time so don't point it at the tv for best results. The only drawback is the space ship is so cute I'm afraid young children will want to play with it.Update: I have used it for over a year now and am still happy with product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed...","review":"I purchased this RF remote extender and an extra battery transmitter.In either of the two locations, I have very limited success.

Location #2 has a block wall between the two... in either case, this product should work a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery doesn't last","review":"Gave this product a shot. I was surprised by two things. First, it worked as advertised. Second, the batteries would not last one evening. This was a killer for me. I let the batteries charge over 24 hours before use.

The other ones require the remote to be aimed directly at the receiver but this Next Generation model does not...in fact, I tested it by stepping out of the room where the television is located into the hallway and it still changed the channels. There is no delay in the response as well. My only gripe is that you need to recharge the battery about once per month, but it is always charged in the RF extender, so it really is a minor inconvenience. When I received the product, the battery adapter sleeve was defective and I couldn't insert the battery. I called customer service and they sent a new sleeve out to me immediately.

This item solves that problem beautifully. I put the receiver in the living room entertainment console, and then ran an HDMI cable from that receiver, behind the wall and through the attic, and down to the television in the bedroom. Now I can control the TV from the bedroom and not have to worry about having an ugly receiver sitting on the floor or on top of the TV.I live in an old house with shiplap siding behind both sides of every wall, and the signal strength is not a problem at all.I suggest buying an extra battery though. Keep the extra inside the flying saucer base (which doubles as the charger). When the special battery runs out of juice, just switch it with your spare and you are rocking and rolling. Battery lasts a few weeks with heavy use before needing to be recharged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfectly even 3 floors away","review":"I keep a cable box in the basement and now I can control it from the kitchen (hwere the tv is located) one floor up.

Set up was as easy as charging the battery for a day and putting it in the remote. This is one of the best and simplest experiences I have ever had with an electronic device. It works as promised.

I had to use the lowest or \\"C\\" setting on the saucer receiver. However the remote operation was inconsistent and then stopped altogether. Even standing in front of the saucer receiver, the satellite would not change channels.I'll be buying a regular IR extender elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!!!!","review":"Very easy to use. I had to charge the batteries/transmitter for a day before you could use it, but other than that it is great. I split my cable coming out of the cable box and ran that to all my other TV's.

I have 3 tvs hooked up to the same satelite receiver and it was the best solution, until one of the batteries went dead. At that point I tried to charge them in the selected slot. All was well until I tried to use the remote with the same regular batteries it originally was intended for. It does not work at all without the extender set up, even with new batteries and the extender unit completely unpluged.

I can see the radio lights on the saucer blink when I push the remote, but either the direct, nor IR cable can get this to work everytime. The A/B switch positions both work, and they don't, neither is any better than the other. I though that perhaps the re-emmiter was too close, but moving it out to ten feet away makes no difference.

The IR I guess bounces inside the cabinet and is strong enough to work with all my equipment. You will need extra RF Transmitter batteries for multiple remotes.

I charged both 2/3 batteries for 36 hours, but when I put one in the transmitter, and then the transmitter into the AA sleeve, the remote doesn't do anything - not even turn on the lights, so it's as if it's out of batteries. I used a voltage tester and it turns out the batteries are only charging up to 1 volt (instead of 1.5 v) but when I insert them in the transmitter the voltage drops to 0, as if the transmitter was shorted.I called NextGen and they basically said I had to return it and there's nothing they could do about it ... well that sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor performance","review":"I mounted my tv on the wall and decided to put all of my other stuff in the closet about 3 feet away from the tv.

Sometimes the time time frame would be 15 mins, other times it would freeze up and not work till the next morning.

Only negative I have experienced in the 3 weeks that I have owned it is the rechargeable battery life. I use this remote in our bedroom and therefore it is only occasionally used, but I have already had to switch out the recharged battery. The good thing is that it comes with 2 rechargeable batteries, but it's just the small inconvenience of switching it out.

The unit worked on a Cox DVR from the bedroom just as advertised.Cons:It stopped functioning two weeks later at 11:00pm, causing a middle of the night call out. The batteries and transceiver appear fine, I believe the main unit's power supply has failed as there are no lights and no response from it.Now I have to refund the clients money and try to get my money back, as well as try to find another unit to do the same job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under priced for what it does","review":"I am using the Next Generation Remote Extender (plus extra battery/transmitter)to control a Directv remote and Pioneer Elite DVD player located in a bedroom closet.

It would just stop responding to remote commands. I would have to go to the base unit and remove the battery and then either replace the battery or just put it back into the unit for it to start working again. This started happening every day until I got tired of it and ordered a TiVo Slide Remote which works extremely well. I will never buy another NextGen product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor performance","review":"Purchased this unit to run my Directv receiver from the bedroom of my motorcoach with the receiver in the front of the coach 30' away. The performance was very sporadic and undependable. The unit would work for one or two remote inputs, then stop. Switching channels on the IR receiver would result in one or two more inputs working as it should, then it would stop. Changing the position of the IR emmitter or receiver base had no impact. Changing the position of the transmitter battery in the Directv remote had no impact. Overall, I was very disappointed in the performance (or lack thereof) of this device.

Before installing this remote, my other system was ROCK SOLID. Every command went through every time. After plugging this receiver in, I immediately started having problems with missed commands on my other system. I was able to prove to myself that the Next Gen remote was the issue because when I unplugged it, all of my other problems went away.I really wanted the remote to work for me - it's a great concept.

It is great. Awesome price, easy to set up, great battery power, everything.This review is to make sure all of you know that if you have two cable boxes, you CANNOT get this same extender (433Mhz) for each one. I bought two, one for each box and although they are in completely separate areas of the house, one remote will change both TVs. In looking at the packaging, there is a tiny note that says Next Generation makes a 418Mhz extender if you intend to use an extender on a similar unit, i.e. cable box, but it is not clear here. I am calling the company to talk about it now, but I am not expecting much help.------UPDATE: I called this morning and talked to \\"Bob\\" there and he invited me to send in one of my 433 MHZ units and he would exchange it for the 418.

I hung my tv up in my living room and fed all of the wires into a closet behind the wall in the dining room. My DVR and remote are already RF capable so I just needed something that would convert my DVD player to receive the RF frequency thru the wall. Great system, great invention, great problem solver for having all of your electronics in a completely separate room. Having the transmitter as the battery even allowed me to use the same control as my DVR so I can control everything with 1 control. Love it.

Works perfect with our comcast DVR receiver. Was a little tricky to set up, as the directions are very vague. Once I went online to the NextGen website and the DVR website, we figured it out. The directions instructed us to use a flashlight to find the infared receiver on the dvr box. When we couldn't find it, we went to the DVR website and looked at the product diagram. Once we found the right place to stick the little transmitter, we could point the remote away and it still works. No problems with lag times as other reviewers reported.Our DVR box required the extender to be on the \\"b\\" channel.The one thing that wasn't clear online is that there is a wire with a signal transmitter that is stuck over the infared receiver on the DVR box.

I was trying to use it for my Tivo systems, which are very sensitive to direct line-of-site remote pointing, where the slightest angle prevented the Tivo from responding to the remote. Placing the Extender's IR blaster module in front of the Tivo did not work, so, removing the tape, I stuck the blaster right on the front of the Tivo, next to the IR sensor. It worked sometimes but most of the time was very slow or not at all responsive. If it did not work, I'd try to point the remote directly at the Tivo, but because of the battery replacement, even what used to work no longer worked. I thought that, since the Tivo remote used only two batteries, I'd move the unit to my other system (where the programmable remote has 4 batteries) and that, too, did not work well. I could not get the IR blaster to work with my other Tivo and other remote. Do not buy this.

It will work maybe every third time you hit the button. This becomes particularly annoying when, for example, you are watching a recorded show and cannot get your DVR to stop fast-forwarding because the remote won't register. The device receiver is in a cabinet less than 10 feet from the box, so distance is not the issue.

Not in the box (actually, blister wrap) I got-- all it had was a single emitter. But, I decided to go ahead and try it with my Direct TV HR34. Charged up the battery for 48 hours, placed and plugged all the pieces as appropriate, all the proper lights light up when the remote button is pressed-- but it won't control the HR34, either via the emitter or by placing the flying saucer in front of the receiver.So, I tried to take the battery/transmitter out of my remote so I could return it, but the transmitter is actually slightly larger than a AAA battery, and it wouldn't come out of the battery compartment without the help of needlenose pliers. I ended up damaging the casing, so now the piece of crap isn't even returnable.

The remote control I am using with this device is the universal remote that came with the Cox Communications (Phoenix, AZ) set top HD / DVR box.

Once I got this sorted out it worked great ... for a while.Update Dec 2011 - ultimately this item had no range or staying power.

I particularly like the many cases covered in this book. It appears that they got promising results in helping families with schizophrenic children. There is also a chapter where Dr. Bowen talks about his own efforts at differentiating within his family of origin. It's one thing to talk theory--another to apply it to yourself and then write about it. Fantastic.There is something very compelling about Bowen's approach, and his insistence on being able to link it with scientific techniques. If you've given up on the more accepted \\"30 years and a couch\\" approaches, take a look at Bowen theory.If you can't find the book here, try the website of the new publisher, \\"Roman & Littlefield\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"seminal work","review":"This book is gripping. I am reading it as I would a novel--cover to cover. Bowen was the first to look at schizophrenia as a family disease. Then, he applied the family therapy concept to mood disorders as well.

Instead, I chose to purchase an Eveready Energizer replacement, ER-D150 from Accessory Genie for about $15. It was worth it to me to pay the extra money to get the Energizer brand.

On my packing list, it states that they shipped \\"1 ER-D150 Energizer for Canon NB-4L\\". But that is a lie. They shipped a generic battery made by Pro Power.

I first saw quite a few years ago and was thoroughly impressed by the super atmosphere of it! It is sooo creepy. The old crone/witch out in the woods was stereotypical but the best I have seen. Who doesn't love Lance Henrikson - this is his best format. The story is probably told a thousand times before in many different ways but the special effects and the overall \\"spookiness\\" make up for any shortcomings. I highly recommend it to any \\"die-hard\\" horror fans - trust me, you will love it. The \\"Alien\\"-like creature looks a bit familiar (due to the Stan Winston factor) - but he brings a bit of a new \\"deep-woods boogeyman/creature\\" element.

You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Overlooked Gem Of A Movie","review":"Here's a great example of what can be done on a low budget. Most low budget horror flicks usually can't cut it do to bad acting and schlock. Most just go the camp route, but Pumpkinhead is a GOOD movie. No, it's not gonna win any awards, but it's a very solid effort on Stan Winston's part. If the Brothers Grimm were alive today and dabbled in film, this is probably the movie they would have made; It has that whole Grimm fairy tale-like story and look to it, not to mention a great looking monster. Lance Henriksen(another fantastic underrated actor) does a wonderful job playing Ed. The scene where his son dies is actually very sad, and in a movie like Pumpkinhead you wouldn't expect anything that emotional. But like I said, this film stands out amongst other films in the low budget horror category. This film may seem kinda silly when you compare it to Citizen Kane or Vertigo, but in it's own class it rivals the best of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENTERTAINING,STORY PLOT, GREAT INTENSITY!!

I was at the very least expecting some decent scares and overall a somewhat entertaining movie. Instead, Pumpkinhead is a fairly limp addition in the genre. What does it have going for it? Well, Lance Henriksen delivers a decent performance and the Pumpkinhead design is good. However, what the movie has going against it is bad acting from the actors who played the teenagers, a very fake looking setting (it really should have set the tone but it doesn't), and a just plain unscary center.

A couple of hours later this movie went damn near to the top of my 'finest-movies-ever-made' list. It has it all, a great story, based on old hillbilly folklore, it's got atmosphere, swamps, revenge, a witch, and one of the coolest, mischievous creatures ever conjured up. For a killer, it's intelligent, with a subtle heart, and a wry sense of humor. There's some blood, but it's needed to tell the story, it's not gushed up to quench the masses. Splatterfest?

Also, the number of selections is only 12. I expect more for that amount of money. The packaging is Japanese, so the information on the songs is slight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old and dry","review":"I ordered this as a gift for my mother who uses the product on a regular basis and thought it would be the same.

Lesson learned to always buy cosmetics from a department store!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who like to go further","review":"For anyone unfamiliar with the Jazz-rock trio, Give could be a poor starting point next to their textbook debut dazzler. Yet I am surprised by some fans and critics who dismissed the harder-pushing sophomore major as a primarily atonal indulgence. For sure the disc pushes a little too stubbornly at times, building showy heaps of cryptic melody and time signatures into epic posturing without the slightest hesitation- but for every masturbatory musical off-ramp we are privy to, the boys flaunt double in the way of sheer triumphant virtuoso synergy. Listen, and listen again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give or take it or leave it","review":"Apparently this is what Columbia Records calls \\"jazz\\" in the post-Marsalis era. These three guys play \\"acoustic\\" instruments (piano, bass and drums) but they are more inspired by Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Liberace, and Iron Maiden than they are by, say, the Bill Evans Trio or Keith Jarrett. They are bombastic, melodramatic, overblown and sometimes entertaining in a theatrical sort of way. It's very difficult to take them seriously as jazz artists, which is where you will find this in your neighborhood record store if you even have one anymore, or go to one. I guess I'd put it in the Classical section, under \\"Percussion\\". Approach with caution, and be on the lookout for flying shrapnel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does this \\"Bad Plus\\" c.d. sound compressed, flat and uninvolving?","review":"I do kinow how why, I can only speculate, but the quality of the recording is sub par. The music is great, the recording is horrible. It sounds compressed, flat and uninvolving."},{"rating":"2","title":"a few nice gems","review":"I wasn't knocked out by this release as much as Vistas. Maybe because Vistas was a new sound for me and this one is made in much the same style. The only gripe I have with this album is that Dave King is a tad too heavy in places, akin to his style with Happy Apple. This is not a bad thing in itself but it doesn't quite fit this style of music. I would love to hear a copy of this material without the drums and a less aggresive mix on the double bass. Not knocking Dave King again because he is one of the greatest drummers alive. His style on the Vistas album had a feel that he was holding back just a little. This mix puts him constantly in your face. I like Dave's compositions more than the others, including the covers. Track one and especially track five. Iverson seems to play with a sense of wonder on these two that really bring out a melancholy feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Banging","review":"A while back I waxed enthusiastic over the Bad Plus's debut Columbia CD, These Are the Vistas; about this one, my enthusiasm is subdued. The aggressive attitude manifest in that earlier recording seems to have become a caricature of itself in this recording. There just seems to be just too much banging going on this time, and the bass-heavy tonal balance does not help. I seem to recall a 70s rock album titled \\"What Once Were Vices Now Are Habits\\" (I think it was by the Doobie Brothers), a title that would be appropriate for this release--but maybe in reverse: \\"What Once Were Habits Now Are Vices.\\"In any event, I hope this recording is simply a sophomore slump, and that in their next outing, the Bad Plus will overcome some of their bad habits. If they (and we) are really lucky, they will also find an engineer who is less intent on hitting the listener over the head or kicking him or her in the gut."},{"rating":"2","title":"nicely done","review":"I agree with the others that this is perhaps the best written book in the series so far. We get to see very intimately how Kindred interact with mortals. Hesha, the Setite that the story revolves around, is constantly referred to as a \\"monster\\" and yet acts so very gentlemanly... we find out in the end what he truly is, just as Liz, our hero, finds out.This story does in fact stand alone but it does tie into the larger story, adding some rather frightening details that seem to be almost glossed over. Keep your eyes open."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not all that bad a book.","review":"Clan Novel: Setite has been the only book that I've read of the Clan Novel series, and I must say that, all in all, it wasn't all that terrible a book. It wasn't an outstanding piece of literature, and as far as both quality and quantity, it had its share of weak spots. I doubt that a reader uninitiated to White Wolf would like it very much, and only if you're one of the fans of the World of Darkness will you feel the need to read this book. And it won't compel you to turn the pages rapidly; it didn't for me. Still, it satisfied my taste for the Vampire: the Masquerade storyline, and although it didn't tempt me to read any other of Ryan's books, it did an excellent job as far as catering to a White Wolf fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Work of Fiction I've Read In A Long Time.","review":"\\"Ports and Happy Havens\\" reads like a landmark piece of contemporary literature.

I finished reading it because I was taken in by the characters and the writing style. Tim's book thrusts you into early America and the character of the people who were brave enough to step into the unknown of the frontier. These were ordinary people living extraordinary adventures. As you read of their adventures, you think to yourself, \\"Yeah, it could have happened just like that.\\" Tim sprinkles the story with people you have heard of ( Aaron Burr, Col. Travis and other heros of early Texas) and mythical characters like Prince Madoc. There are episodes of high adventure and the durdgery of day to day living at the edge of civilization. The style is fast paced and not over dramatized.

But this is a highly entertaining read, even if (like me) you can barely tell the difference between a crow and a cardinal. There's something about the human psyche that looks for challenges that might otherwise seem absurd, just because they are there. Climbing all the 8000-meter peaks. Reaching the highest points of all 50 states. Hiking the entire Appalachian Trail (this one was my own obsession, completed a few years ago). Seeing the most birds ever seen in one year in North America... Obmascik perfectly captures the thrill of the chase, and had me eagerly turning the pages, waiting to discover who was going to come out on top. Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good!","review":"I first heard about this book on NPR several years ago, and finally got around to reading it when I heard about the film release. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the \\"Big Year\\", and it made me think perhaps I should get my own 'life list' started. It was fascinating to read about the three men who essentially put their lives on hold for a year to chase a dream, though I was a bit disappointed that a Big Year is really just a number's game--it's all about spotting (or hearing) a bird and moving on, not watching and enjoying them. Still though, it was a fun read, and it was truly enjoyable to learn that there are birders out there who are so devoted, and so competitive, that jumping on a plane any time of the year to chase a rarity is considered standard routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I recently got into birding and had just finished this book when I heard it had been made into a movie and would be out soon. Granted, it's \\"inspired by\\" the book, but it should be fun nevertheless.The book is hard to put down. But, if you're like me and read 3-5 pages and come back later, it's very easy to do that, too.Obmascick does a really good job of presenting competitive birding from different perspectives. There's a lot of inside information to get you wrapped up in.

This is a book about people, and their obsessions, rather than birds. I can just imagine me in a roomful of people, and then trying to figure out who is the avid, obsessed, birder. Try it. I dare you to. To be honest, I picked this book up, and layed it back down at least three times before I really got past the intoduction. I had a narrow minded view about the book going into it, and I knew I could not possibly be interested in a book about bird watching. But, once I got into the characters, I was hooked.

Unfortunately they did not make the opening for the fan itself circular, like they do when they make attic fans. That would have made it 2-3 times better at pulling air out of a room. Hunter used to make great window fans, that would pull cool air into the whole house, because they had shielding for the fan so that there was a circular opening - once the air was pushed out of the house, it wouldn't circle back through the open part of the fan and get back in.

Heigl was pretty bad, however. I'm happy they didnt make her a huge part of the movie, and \\"Penn\\" did a pretty poor job of living up to Tommy Lee as the insane bad guy. The Dane character was pretty good, however. And the action is constant, and actually impressive throughout the movie. The only dissapointment would be the very end, which was indeed a bit of a let down. But the movie's worth it just because it does keep you attached, and it had some nice visuals, not to mention some pretty bad ones.

I was disappointed to discover the author's religious beliefs woven throughout the text. To my knowledge, the book was not advertised in any way as a religious take on the topic. Further, the author advocates 'breaking the spirit' of children and suggests that one way to do so is to slap their thighs as a show of who is boss.Quite a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is an excellent book for new parents.","review":"This book is very interesting to read. It also gives very specific steps on how to discipline children from young age to entering adolescence.

It is excellent in terms of setting up the basic principles in teaching children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some helpful info with alot of religion","review":"There is some helpful information in this book if you are dealing with a very difficult child.

We have moved the swing to several different areas in the living room, currently we have an extension cord running under the couch to have the swing where we want it.The print design could definitely be better, there was only 1 at the time we bought ours and it's a muted color but that's ok.Highly recommend a plug in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not Perfect","review":"I have enjoyed this swing. I bought it because it was the only one at the time that plugged in-truly a must-have option when your baby won't sleep anywhere else. The neutral colors are great. There are two flaws: you have to remove the tray to get the baby out. The second is that it does not recline enough for a newborn. Her head kept flopping over even with a head support roll!

Some things don't like: the pattern wish had differnt colors etc. to choose from, and I have had opposite of that other reviewer. My swing goes a little on the slow side. Seems slow even when on high. My son is 2 months and 14.6 lbs so it should still swing him pretty good on the high setting but seems slow. Other than that I love it!

It is disappointing because the study games do not require a user to spell the words only to recognize them among incorrectly spelled words or to add a missing letter.

With this HP the toner cartridges go in no time. The scanning is slightly askew, and there is some color distortion. Also, the scanner utility is pretty inept.

Katha Pollitt, the Nation writer, also thinks the fact that babies are exceedingly interested in their mothers' breasts (for the milk contained therein, 'naturally'!) is not natural, but rather a mere (one hesitates to repeat the mantra) social construction (see her list of other book reviews).

My bad- I made the mistake in ordering and although a sports fan---usually do not read books on sports. Roy \\"Uper\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Given Day","review":"Dennis Lehane is a master storyteller even when he used serial detective as his genre and when he turned to pedophilia in Mystic River or fantasy in Shutter Island. In The Given Day he tackles the animosity that existed in the city, between members of the police department, and between the races.Since he appears to relish every word he writes, readers need to read carefully for hidden possibilities and any twists and turns in the plot. If someone wants a quick read, this book is not it as it requires close attention to characters and the wait for back story between some characters. He does an excellent job with his portrayal of Babe Ruth at the beginning in a racially tense scene.He has expanded so that he cannot be pigeon holed as mystery, fantasy. He is about capturing relationships and showing the twists and turns. He performs this task well and with realism"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Shocked by all the 4 Stars","review":"This book was put together in a hurry. Most likely to sell the rights for the next movie. It was a real disappointment. I love historical fiction and I'd only heard good things about the author. He had the makings of a really good historical novel. The richness of what was going on in Boston or anywhere else in 1918 was certainly enough to create that novel. Throughout my reading I kept thinking where was his editor? It should have been neatly interwoven, but it was not. I've read Young Adult historical ficition that was much better written that this. I'm not kidding and I've read thousands. I cannot get over the fact that no one has said that already. After reading 600+ pages, I asked myself, do I really care how this ends? Well, I kept going and it was hokey. It will make a good movie, but don't read the book. It's a waste your time. Try reading one of the nonfiction books on the subjects he covers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"Weak plot and characters.

For that fact and reason alone, I refused to read anything written by Mr. Lehane. Well, what a fool I've been. From page one of this novel I was hooked and could not put the book down. The historical events were well researched and the mystery and thrill factor kept you guessing to the end. I am now a true follower of Mr. Lehane's works. I've ordered and received 4 more of his novels and have yet to be disappointed in one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but I expected more","review":"I am a fan of Dennis LeHane, and looked forward to this book with anticipation. It is a good book, but after reading critics' reviews, I expected a great book. The charactors are compelling, but the dismal lives they endure, unrelieved by humor, was depressing. The family interaction was sad, and the relationships were undeniably burdensome. I was happy that at least one person made it though, but not without life-long scars.The relationships, like the actions, although interesting, plodded along from day to day. I expected more action, or at least some suspense to carry the story from page to page.It is a sucessful book, but personally, 'Gone Baby Gone' and 'Mystic River' were far and away more enthralling stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novel captured my imagination.","review":"Imagination the nay-Sayers lack. If you want a read that's impossible to put down, then give this one a go. Too many critics that turn Lehane's work into a cult rather than enjoy the new path he has taken. Get over it or better yet, write your own novel. I'm willing to bet it'll be as drab as your reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Given Day","review":"This book is the ultimate politically correct read.

I liked the main character, and the ending was very satisfying, but I got extremely tired of reading about all the union situation and the riots. Too, too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copping out....","review":"This book was a watershed for me. Lehane is an icon, whose works have been SO stand-out, with his earlier works absolutely brilliant, especially Shutter Island (in my opinion his Kafka-esque masterpiece). Now this.... It can only be called a cop-out, an escape from the widespread criticism Shutter Island received (from doltheads); what he's done here, in this evocation of early 20th-c. Boston, is sort of an evasive action, it seems to me. Much as I've loved every one of Lehane's earlier works, this one was beyond me -- uninteresting period and place, and very uninteresting characters (with the possible exception of an imagined Babe Ruth in the first chapter). Hard as I tried, I had to give up on page 169. This kind of historical thing from someone like Lehane is like Hemingway doing a Barbara Cartland.................... Please, Dennis, no more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good historical fiction","review":"I went back and forth on giving this book 3 or 4 stars. I think the book was a bit too long but I very much enjoy the writing of Dennis Lehane."},{"rating":"2","title":"The making of Americans: Boston blue","review":"This is the first installment in the saga of the Coughlin, an Irish family who makes its mark in Boston in the first half of the 20th century. The Given Day is the story of the eldest son, a policeman on his father's tracks, Danny, while Live by Night tells what happens to the youngest, Joe. There is a beautiful complexity to the novel, due to its firm anchorage in history. Babe Ruth and baseball have a part in the book. The main action is political, but all the other components, the love story, between Nora, a new immigrant and Danny, as well as the friendship between Danny and Luther Lawrence, a black baseball player illuminate the period."},{"rating":"2","title":"compelling story, outstanding audio CD","review":"The Given Day is a compelling story, well-told. The fictional story lines are engaging because of the excellent character development. The historical story lines are fascinating as a window into the early 20th century in many different ways - labor unrest, social unrest, racial tension, cultural turmoil. The story has many similarities with modern day.I listened to the Given Day on audio CD narrated by Michael Boatman. He is outstanding. For regular audio book listeners, his performance succeeds not so much by force of will and conviction (as with George Guidall, for example), but instead with an exceptional ability to paint a wide variety of characters with vocal tone and spot-on dramatic content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling Historical Fiction","review":"All you really need to know is that if you enjoy historical fiction, and the idea of reading about 1919 Boston Irish, radical anarchists, police strike, governmental perfidy, all joined together by a tightly plotted tale of intriguing and absorbing characters, with the requisite amount of romance and family dysfunction, you will enjoy the heck out of this book. The rest is better saved for your own reading, rather than getting plot synopsyses like the ones that so often appear here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lehane Is Tops In Richly Drawn Characters","review":"I love Dennis Lehane's outstanding Boston P.I. mysteries so much that I was slightly reluctant to start something so vastly different from him. However, after diving in, I should've remembered what a sterling writer this man is, who fills his book with such exceptional character development, you get completely engrossed and invested in these people's lives. For those who say they're not historical fiction fans, I can only say, you will be after this. The book runs parallel narratives of the Coughlin's,a dynamic police family and their shining son Danny, and Luther Laurence, a young black man who ends up in Boston after fleeing a violent murder. Between the central story of the Boston Police strike, and influenza ravishing the nation, the story feels eerily current. This is a fantastic,engrossing, and hard to put down book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Given Day wonderful read","review":"It took me a while to \\"get into\\" the book, but once I did I really loved it. It takes place in Boston in the early part of the 1900's, way before unions exist. I am neither pro or anti union, but this book certainly shows WHY they were needed. THe story is good and the facts are historically correct."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"Although it doesn't quite measure up to \\"Mystic River,\\" it's an easy 5 stars and one of the best books I've read in years -- a true epic. I thought the Babe Ruth angle was particularly effective and the chapters about the Boston police strike were fascinating and exciting. The only drawback in my mind -- and it is minor -- is the ending. There were too many convenient coincidences and an overdose of melodrama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book","review":"I am really enjoying this book, very hard to put down. Best book I have read in a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic and beautifully written","review":"I resisted reading The Given Day because I have so loved Lehane's crime writing, but when TGD became available on Kindle at a bargain price, I could no longer resist. Two ways to look at it: either the wait was well worth it, or BOY, did I wait too long. TGD is a rich, rich story set in a historical context relevant to the struggles we face today, and characters we grow to care deeply about. What else can you ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping Historical Fiction","review":"Dennis Lehane's new novel, \\"The Given Day\\" is an historical novel set in Boston in the closing days of WW I. It's main character is Danny Coughlin, a flatfoot with the Boston Police Dept. who is torn between his upright Irish family and Nora, an Irish servant in the family's employ. The novel takes in some of the great historical events of the period, the Spanish Flu pandemic, the Great Boston Molasses Flood and the Boston Police Strike. Lehane also weaves real characters such as Babe Ruth, Jack Reed, Eugene O'Neil and J Edgar Hoover seamlessly in with his fictional ones. The book is superply written and hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very educational book, well written","review":"I knew nothing about the Boston Police Strike so this book was very educational. It had two especially interesting characters in Danny and Luther and is a reminder how unfairly workers and blacks were treated back in that time. There were times in the book where I thought Lehane was making a comparison to today's politics regarding the persecution of various minorities and the total disregard for our Constitution. It took awhile to get into the book and if I had one criticism it would be the insertion of Babe Ruth into the narrative. I found those parts to be almost completely disassociated with the larger narrative. Also, the Babe didn't seem like a very interesting person. But other than that, it was a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Heavy Given Day","review":"This is a very well-written book. At times, I thought the history really overwhelmed the story and so much of it was dreary. Even legitimate dreariness can make the words drag. That said, I really found that the quality writing, the history lesson and the story combined to make this an engaging, entertaining and informative read that delivered a bright and hopeful conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Given Day","review":"This is an enormously readable, hard to put down historical novel. Dennis Lehane pulls the reader in on page one and never lets go. His characters - including Babe Ruth and J. Edgar Hoover - spring to life, and several separate story lines converge seamlessly at a pace that never lags. Historically, it's a compelling look at a period that would bring drastic changes in the way life is lived in America . Individual characters are, for the most part, well-drawn, although considerably stronger on the male side than the female. Lehane's prose is sure-handed, skilled, evocative and edgy."},{"rating":"2","title":"hard to put down","review":"I took this book on vacation and found I could read it for hours and not want to put it down. The story reinforces the fact that 100 years later the issues have not changed just the methods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate historical along with a good story","review":"A little long, but great historical fiction. Story was about a family who had policemen in the family line and the Boston Police Strike took place during the book...murder too and some mysteries"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown Given Day","review":"The first Dennis Lehane book I have disliked. Extremely overwrought, unbelievable characters, a lot of stereotypes. A fascinating time in Boston history that deserves a better treatment. Too many story lines and too many coincidences of characters meeting historical figures (Babe Ruth, Dubois, etc.) create a level of implausibility in this novel. Perhaps the author would have been better served if he had scaled back and concentrated on certain aspects of that time, but influenza, WWI, baseball, molasses, police corruption, political anarchy, unionization all get the short shrift when spread out in one novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Bloated and Boring","review":"Ugh. His earlier books have been so full of tight pacing and spirit and relevance. But this one invites the flip-through of -- no exaggeration -- half the pages as totally irrelevant to what is meaningful in the book. Dialog is slack. Context is beaten over the head until you are numb with it. And what is the context supposed to be? It feels like a historical novel he wrote because he felt he had to, not because it was meaningful to the present day.The only salvation is the main characters, who are well drawn and complex.But that is dim salvation in a grossly overwritten book like this one. Buy all of his previous books, but save yourself on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment!!","review":"I was reading a review on a different book/author and the reviewer suggested several 5 star authors....one was Dennis Lehane.....thought I would try him, especially since this book received 5 star ratings and at a discounted price of $1.99....thought i couldn't go wrong with that and certainly did not want to pay big dollars not being familiar with the author........very confusing ~ 5 star ratings with a very reduced price....what a bargain!! Wrong.... Still trying to figure out why the author put the \\"Babe Ruth\\" story in here....Yegads!! one thing if the story was a bit believable...but give me a break...Have to say, this is the very first time that I did not finish a book....the writing was so disjointed that I remained totally frustrated trying to keep up with the storyline & the characters.... after finally reaching 9% of this book, decided to just delete it from my Kindle....as the saying goes \\"always a first time\\"....."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little boring...","review":"I agree with the reviewers that said the book was boring and could have been shorter. After I read it I was surprised at how many good reviews it received. I am not hard to please. Give me a good story that keeps my interest and I am happy. I love historical fiction but I was so close to giving up on this one after about 150 pages. Literally, nothing was happening! It took about 200 pages for the lives of the 2 main characters to intertwine! Ridiculous! I got through the book but I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part one","review":"I found this book an entertaining, enlightening read. It is family saga set in Boston during the period at the end of WWI. It follows the Coughlin family and one of their African employees, Luther (a man with a past). Mr. Lehane , in the fashion of true historical fiction, creates the scene using the Boston Police Riots and Babe Ruth as a backdrop. My only complaint is Mr. Lehane leaves me with the impression that this is Part 1 of a multi part series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic Proportions","review":"Boston, 1918, Babe Ruth, slimy police, racism, the flu epidemic, all in one giant economy package. My 93 year-old father loved it as much as I did. Neither of us could put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling story, but what's with Babe Ruth?","review":"Great story overall. I normally don't like period pieces, but this book fully engrosses the reader in the world of post WWI New England. There are several stories in the book, all of which intertwine with each other. But I did not understand at all why the author spent a hundred pages on a story involving Babe Ruth...I couldn't see the point. Very glad I read this book; it's the 2nd Lehane book I've read, after I enjoyed Shutter Island so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE!","review":"If you read the dust jacket and figure this book to be pretty good (like I did) then you just read the best part of the entire book! This was probably THE worst book I've ever read by a \\"best-selling\\" author. It was SO boring. Page after page of drivel. Most nights I went to bed angry because the book NEVER picked up. Never. And why did the author feel obligated to put Babe Ruth in the story? What? Really? From this logic, he should have put the 1919 Black Sox in it. Or wrote about Eisenhower as a little boy. If the author made money from this book, then he is just as guilty as Corporate America from cheating the American System.If you want to read a really GOOD book for a change, then read The Religion, by Viktor Wolfe. It'll make up for reading THIS mess!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"This is not Dennis Lehane's best work, but it tells a great story based in historical events. I love this author and would recommend him to anyone that likes a well-written novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boston has its own ghosts to overcome","review":"While not a fan of historical fiction, I am a fan of Lehane. This book may change my perspective. The question I asked continually during the read was how we can, as a society, forget what evils we wrought and felt righteous as the condemned took the bullet. Lehane has written a work of fiction based on fact that shocks and entertains. The characters are well thought out and light up the pages like good malt whiskey. A good read for a long trip because it will keep bringing you back to its pages.Ron LealosAuthor of Don't Mean Nuthin'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book","review":"Every once in awhile I run across a novel that engrossesme. This book did just that. I consider the ability to fullyvisualize a novel as it unfolds the mark of a great author.Lehane did just that for me with this exceptional authoring."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just doesn't hang together.","review":"If you look at any scene individually in this book, each and every one would be a masterpiece. The style is brilliant, the period history informed and fascinating, the plot gripping.The problem is that each and every scene jangles separately like a set of keys. A bright set of keys yes it is, but each seems to open a separate door.The problem is that the characterization is a bit cliched, and therefore one never gets quite a handle on the whole book. I felt after reading it that I hadn't even quite read a whole book. Mr. Lehane (whose other books I liked better)apparently felt that the history of the times would be enough to hold \\"A Given Day\\" together.But the history, as fascinating as it is, could not substitute for characters that one could really dig into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing that tries way too hard","review":"Being from Boston, I really wanted to like this book but I couldn't get through the first 3 chapters. Couldn't suspend disbelief enough about Babe Ruth's supposed conversations - I admit, I hate mixing historical people into fiction. Also, this book falls into the \\"macho blue collar\\" character narrative. The dialogue and all it's trying too hard \\"toughness\\" I just found over the top. Does anyone really talk like a tough guy all the time; the Danny character was just too much of the Irish tough guy Cop stereotype. I felt like I was watching an over-dramatic movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awake..now that it's over","review":"I'm not a huge fan of the mystery genre. Always leaves me disappointed. That being said Lehane's one of its more talented practitioners especially \\"Gone Baby...\\" and \\"Mystic River\\". But this was flat out awful. Nothing compelling in the characters or story and just too damn long. And given the limp noodle ending I think even Lehane lost interest by the end. I sure did."},{"rating":"1","title":"disjointed and unpleasant","review":"I have read and enjoyed other Dennis Lehane books and after reading the glowing reviews I was looking forward to this one. It was painful to read and I had to force myself to finish it.The Babe Ruth story line was simply stuck into the rest and I could NOT figure out why it was there. This could have been a great story if he had chosen one storyline and developed those characters more. I see that the Kindle edition is now $1.99. Still a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging, well written book","review":"I was very impressed with the quality of the writing , in this book.

But for the sake of space and time I'll say this about the outlast...1) there is almost no suction. I stood over a small pile of sawdust for about 60 seconds and less than 1/4 of it was actually picked up. I could go over a same spot on my carpet a dozen times and it would still only pick up maybe 30%...if I'm lucky. 2) It constantly spits debris out the back, on carpet and on bare surfaces. Actually kinda painful if you're in shorts or a skirt. 3) The Hepa filter is a joke - it was plugged within the first week. 4) Very difficult to vaccum stairs with. There are no hand holds and the attached hose has less suction than a turkey baster. Really - don't buy this vaccum."},{"rating":"1","title":"REVIEW","review":"Siuzdak has written a useful book for the novice or a student without a background in biological mass spectrometry. The book's small size and concise treatise, however, gives rise to many trite and overly simplistic explanations of aspects of the field and some errors. Consider, for example, page 37 that describes that a limitation of magnetic mass analyzers is their relatively \\"low\\" resolution. This is contradicted in Table 2.1 where a correct representation of the resolution is made. Also on page, Siuzdak describes the \\"physics behind\\" ion trap and conventional quadrupole analyzers as being \\"similar\\" when ion motion and dynamics in each analyzer is quite different.

I loved his passion for mazes and the symbolism they stood for."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most disappointing book I've read in a long time.","review":"This book came highly recommended. I heard not one discouraging word, so what a letdown to read a boring story about a boring ordinary guy with a boring job. I read a lot, so I knew better than to judge a book from the first few chapters. I kept waiting for the yeast that would add life to this bland dough, but in vain. Then I realized what was happening. Revered, Canadian, Pulitzer Prize winning author writes another book and nobody wants to offend. The newspaper and magazine reviews speak volumes with their verbal gymnastics; variations of the old food reviewers \\"succulent\\".Then follows a synopsis of the story; an effort to fill space. The writing style was engaging enough to keep me reading, waiting for the payoff, but it doesn't climax so much as drift off to sleep. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greenpeace should protest the waste of trees to print this.","review":"When my brother asked me to read this, he had a look of really wanting my opinion. After I did read this, I told him that this was obvoiusly a literary hoax and I asked him who was in on it. It appears to be an outline given to a Grade 9 English class to take home and make it into a real story. There are no characters worth the effort to identify. Larry is just, well, nothing. I don't know why Shields put in the device of a maze. Larry would take 6 tries to find his way out of a phone booth with an open door. Any Shield's cocktail party dialog is so grating it reminded me of when I was playing road hockey and I ran out of the icy surface and scraped my skates along the frozen concrete, bringing me to a sudden and spaky halt. Ugh! What a pathetic book. Shame on the publishing industry for letting this one get by just because of Shield's track record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant insight to a regular guy growing into the 90's","review":"This is a beautifully written novel about a man, Larry Weller, and his friends and family through the years 1977-1997. Everyone knows a Larry; maybe they are your husband, brother, or father. Shields spins her usual magic buy making the ordinary extraordinary. With chapters like \\"Larry's Penis\\" and \\"Larry's Threads\\", you'll be entranced from start to end. The final chapter, \\"Larry's Party\\", was the most memorable and touching end I've read for years. The minute I finshed this book, I wanted to pass it on to someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"not her best","review":"very disapointing. pretty much a strange story about a man who goes through life completly lost.his fascination towards mazes emphasize his mere existence in the world.his two failed marriages are a joke. not really a very good book, considering the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intersting in a voyeursitic manner","review":"The Larry in question is a man whose entire adult life is studied minutely in this novel, and this is what is fasinating about it. It has certainly held my attention, even though there is no real adventure or substance in the plot - it is all about Larry. Having said this it is certainly an entertaining book, and the sub plot of his obsession with hedges is different, but all in all I think Larry is a guy we can all identify with, and Ms Shields does a very good job of making us care what happens to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly unique book with lots of depth","review":"This book amazed me at how well a woman (Carol Shields) captured so many essences of the male psyche. This truly fascinating book chronicles the life of Larry, and has many brilliant moments of prose that make the read worthwhile. As other reviewers noted, it doesn't really 'go anywhere', however had far more direction than a lot of 'modern literature' does these days.

In simpler terms, characters were alive and fully fleshed, plot was good, lots of interesting info on all aspects of hedge mazes, great interior monologue, BUT ... chapters started having the feel of short stories because so much information was repeated as if you, the reader, couldn't keep the facts straight.This said, please read Carol Shields. She is wise beyond belief and writes honestly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Outstanding Carol Shields' Novel","review":"If you prefer character development, Carol Shields is the modern author of choice. If you prefer plot, look somewhere else. This novel employs the literary devices that she has used before and that familiar clean and light writing style. Perfect for me! This novel, though, attempts something few female authors try (successfully): a leading male character. It's interesting to see what she believed Larry would and would not think about. The only reason for a \\"9\\" rating instead of a \\"10\\" was the ending -- it was a surprise and seemed rushed, like she had to make a printer deadline. Otherwise, it was a \\"typical\\" novel for Ms. Shields -- outstanding, and the best modern character development author out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Larry just stood there and let life happen to him","review":"John Lennon once wrote \\"Life is what happens while you're making other plans.\\" Lennon never met Larry Weller, a man drifting down the river of life with no rudder and no destination in mind.Larry Weller is a male character dreamed up by a female author, and save for one passage on genital slang, Larry's interior monologues are about as interesting as two-day old Wonder Bread. Good thing men aren't really as dull as Shields makes out; I'd have to give up and move to Mars.Only the final scenes -- Larry's Party -- give a glimmer of the talent this woman holds in reserve.Like so many other people, I was annoyed and frustrated by the gimmicky structure of the book. There was no need to continually reintroduce background material. I wondered if the chapters were not in fact intended to be short stories. Certainly the Larry's Party chapter could stand on its own as a story.A disappointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"the end of the maze","review":"I love this book. This is the second time I have read it. It's an odd book, the maze like structure can get repetitive but it is beautifully written. My one objection is the end of the maze -- the goal, the fountain or wishing well or statue, that which we have been moving toward. This is the reunion of Larry and Dorrie which did not ring true to me at all. Life typically wanders on but the structure of the book demanded an endpoint and I guess this is the best the author could come up with. A reunion with Beth would seem just as false.P.S. I wonder what Larry would think of the recent popularity of corn mazes. My sister lives in the midwest and in the fall, farmers make mazes out of standing corn stalks and charge entry fees and invite people to come and walk through the mazes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book . . .","review":". . . unless you began using email yesterday. It is a classic example of unhelpful, non-writing. My heart sank when I turned the first page and noticed the font size - about 14 points, with 1.5 line spaces. This is a magazine article, inflated to book-length. On the plus side, you won't need a separate, large print edition. If you want the only useful suggestion in this book, here it is: send less email, and maybe you'll receive less. You'll only reach this pearl of wisdom after enduring over 100 pages of drivel, such as, \\"The sent folder contains copies of all the email messages you compose and send.\\" Really? Eureka!

I was looking for solid strategies to help me use this tool more efficiently and effectively. Instead, I got an eye-glazing management analysis, pitifully short on solutions. Directed at managers and employees of large corporations, the book is all but useless for anyone else. The so-called solutions were just short of insulting. A few standout examples: \\"Don't send unnecessary e-mails\\"; \\"Don't read every e-mail you get\\"; \\"Pick up the phone instead of sending an e-mail.\\" Ya think?

North's return to modernism is by far the most appreciable aspect of his novel. The character descriptions are obviously well thought out believable. My main qualm about this book is North's Russian, in general, and Dostoyevskian, in particular, approach to the ending. This concerns me on the basis of innovation, not quality.

This is also the funniest City Hunter of the first four released here. The end scene with Joe and Falcon is hilarious. The dubbing is fine save for the fake accents and Kaori's annoying voice.

They were taped and labeled with \\"Not for individual sale - boxed sets\\" or something like that and the tape and the label ruined the boxes. I am very disappointed - it ruins the whole presentation. I will now have to spend more time than necessary to wrap both sections of the box to cover the tape - I tried to remove it and it takes off the top layer of the box. While trying to finish a job with short Christmas deadlines this has caused me to use more time than I wanted.

I agree with the other reviews that state things are very hard to steer and click on effectively. My sons have ample experience with our PC, yet couldn't click on things the way a normal game works--very frustrating for them!Then, when they finally were able to master it and complete the three levels, they realized that was it. It is a one-time game, with no randomization for repeat play and no educational skills to make repitition valuable. They played it once for the challenge, twice just for the sake of playing it again and then they were done with it. For this price, I would have expected more of this game.Stick with the toys. FP gets top marks from me for those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I bought this game for my 5 year old son. I ended up playing for him. The movement of the heroes is very sporadic. I even had a hard time getting the men to slow down so I could get to the hotspots to click on them.

To my knowledge, there are three Charles Trenet albums bearing the title \\"La mer\\" with different song selections.This is the one I most love because it shows Charles Trenet is not just one smooth chantor, but a comic who giddily imitates barnyard animals.The bouncy hilarity of \\"La Poule Zazou\\" and \\"Chascun Son Reve\\" make this my pick for premiere \\"La Mer\\" album. Also, if you have young children, you will find that this is highly appealing music to them. To my mind, it bears endless repetition much better than one of those utterly charming collections of nursery rhymes sung by shrill-voiced ankle-biters which are hawked on daytime TV.And the cover art of a grinning, wide-eyed Trenet histrionically pointing to the great wide ocean is real winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute but sooooo uncomfortable","review":"They are really cute, but they are so uncomfortable that I never wear them.

I saw this ACME Thunderer on Amazon, and, though a little pricey, figured I would splurge.I don't regret it. This is clearly a good whistle.

Furthermore, some of the material related to the involvement of Sybil Stockdale is in error or taken out of context. Regarding VADM Stockdale: after in \\"Love and War\\" he wrote additonal books, which are not used as sources to address the development of his thought post 1973.

That's certainly the standard nowadays for recordings of this vintage. It would have been easy to do. The same label has just released three other 1970s Warwick albums on CD.At the very least, bonus tracks should have been added. The CD booklet mentions three other Warwick-Bacharach songs from 1974, but says the trio \\"remains in the Warner vaults, hopefully for a future release.\\" Why weren't they added to this one, which is barely 37 minutes long?I suspect, after Spy has squeezed every dollar from the single CDs, it will combine them in the future.

The acting was horrendous, the actors couldn't speak their lines above a whisper, and there were some ridiculous inconsistencies in this movie. There is one scene where a hooker goes missing, and her pimp breaks into her apartment looking for her. Idiotic. The pimp is followed by a hot blond brandishing two guns in all the rooms (who was she? unknown. why a pair of guns?). The pimp discovers her camcorder (sitting on the coffee table, of all places!) and discovers that she recorded her own abduction (the table it's on is nowhere near a window, let alone tall enough to see outside, and she'd been abducted in a car).Utter garbage. No motivation is given for the killer. The actress playing his wife sees him walk thru the house on numerous occasions, covered in blood, and only asks him about it once.Unmitigated trash.

So, for her birthday I got one for her. It is a great camera for everyday, close snaps. It is fun and easy to upload to the computer. I like the Easyshare Software that comes with it, too.One downside is that it is not very good with far-away shots. It has a zoom feature, but will only zoom just so far before you start losing resolution. So if you are not planning to take zoomed pictures that are more than about 15 - 20 feet away, then it is a GREAT little camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was riveted!","review":"This book had me turning page after page wanting to know what happened next.

Perhaps my expectations were a little too high after reading Girl with a Pearl Earring (I loved that one!)but I found this one disappointing. Stylistically, I found the Ella parts more well-written. Isabelle's passages were very severe, with these hyphens and the shifting. I never completely grasped her story because I was so put off by the style. On the other hand, I did not particularly like Ella as a person, and Isabelle's personality and her love were \\"warmer\\" to read about.As a side note, I loved the library/research parts of the book...I am a librarian and am always happy to see this in the books I read!I am glad that I read this book though, even if it was not all I hoped for.

Ella just seems to be angry at everyone, and deceiving. And I can put myself in Ella's place since I lived in Naples, Italy for almost 4 years with little knowledge of Italian.

Chevalier doesn't develop her characters, inserts plenty of coincidences that are never explained and are unbelieveable, and does not provide any eloquent details to keep the reader engaged. To top it off, halfway through the novel, Ella, the protagonist, does something totally out of character ... and it all goes down from there.I understand why this novel was so poorly written when I heard that this is actually Chevalier's first novel. However, there's something to be said for good writing, and editors shouldn't push drivel like this out the door just to make a buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing!","review":"I really enjoyed \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring\\", so I was very much looking forward to this earlier novel. Whereas \\"Girl\\" seems to focus around a young woman who is a strong, moral person caught in difficult and oppressive circumstances, \\"Virgin Blue\\" features less admirable, unlikable characters who make poor choices all around. So we have adultery, abortion, child sacrifice, and wife-beating, not to mention a historical backdrop of religious persecution and bloody repression. Add to this some miscarriages, rabies, deaths in childbirth, accusations of sorcery and witchcraft, men who are insensitive clods, loneliness and isolation, etc. I know people make bad choices in life, and that life in 16th Century France had hardships I couldn't begin to imagine. But what a depressing book to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not terrible, but not as good as her other work.","review":"I do not like to start a book and not finish it, but I thought seriously about doing that with this one, as well as \\"Burning Bright\\".

It's been a while since I read this but I remember thinking \\"what the heck this all that have to do with this?\\". And then wished I read something else. I was moderately entertained but it was utterly forgettable. Nothing gained. But still, better than \\"Burning Bright\\".

Even if you hate someplace and you're miserable in it, it becomes part of you and changes you. some people may think ella leaving her husband was cruel, and i guess it kind of was cuz he was so clueless, but you can't really go back to the way you were before if it doesn't feel right anymore, but you can't really stay the way you are if you're not very happy, you just have to find whats important to you...basically it [is tough].i thought this book was pretty good and i learned about a different period in time that i did not know much about.

Too bad about the execution...","review":"Tracy Chevalier had a terrific idea when she thought of the plot of this book. The concept of a modern woman who investigates an ancestress, and has her life forever changed by the mysterious story of that long-dead woman, is truly a brilliant and compelling one -- a plot that makes for an amazing, hauntingly well-written book which everyone should read. Unfortunately for Chevalier, that book is A.S. Byatt's _Possession_. Comparisons may be odious, but _The Virgin Blue_ tries to do something so similar to Possession, that its failures are painfully glaring next to Byatt's success.Nice story concept, not bad writing, creative twists - but the characters (particularly in the modern time) are ill-drawn, their motivations (particularly the narrator's) are murky, and the end leaves you with a stale taste in your mouth. Try Possession instead; you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was blue","review":"OK....I loved Girl with a Pearl Earing. I enjoyed the history, story and the herione. In this book I also loved the historical aspect of the book, but hated the whinning herione, Ella. Ella whines about: France, French people, her husband and on and on. She has a great life and then sleeps with a french man she hardly knows? Come on!! I want to whine that this book is not that good and the reader has no passion for Ella. I really didn't care what she did or didn't do. Isabelle is another story. Loved the story set in old France/Switzerland. Loved her heartache and her story. Tracy should have forgotton about Ella and spent her time on Isabelle, Marie and Jacob. Now that is a good story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid Reviews Well Deserved","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with the Publishers Weekly review cited on this page. The PW reviewer found the main character unsympathetic, due to her baffling dissatisfaction with her almost perfect husband, and her preference for a local Frenchman with about as much continental appeal as a manilla envelope. Chevalier used him as a writer's tool for helping unveil the \\"big mystery\\", but I don't think anyone could really call it a \\"mystery\\" because it was obvious from the earliest chapters of the book. For about a hundred pages I asked myself, \\"When are these dopes going to figure it out?\\" It was tedious slushing through the development of the romance, which took us even farther away from getting to the point. This book was my summer reading, and when I finished it,The Virgin Blue: A NovelI felt I had wasted my time. I don't know if I would have even bothered if I'd known it was a first novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Chevalier's usual Brilliance","review":"I enjoy novels that inspire me to be more than I am right now. Barring that, I enjoy novels that are vivid enough to let me live in another time and place for a while. But not all books are that noble, nor do they all need to be that noble. I also enjoy a good read, a book that holds my interest, that's funny or otherwise engaging. Unfortunately, The Virgin Blue was none of these for me. I disliked the historical character almost immediately. It took me about half the book to dislike the modern character. They have no emotional skills, no center, but are just buffeted about by the events in their lives. I got about three-quarters of the way through the book and realized I just didn't want to live with these two any more.Susan Lynn Petersonauthor of Clare, a novel of Irish immigration"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I loved Girl with a Pearl Earring and The Lady and the Unicorn; The Virgin Blue not so much. While the book was interesting enough to keep me going to the end, I can't say I actually liked it. I found almost all of the main characters unappealing, and couldn't see any reason for Ella's dissatisfaction with her marriage other than her inexplicable infatuation with Jean-Paul.Not exactly a waste of my time, but this book won't be a permanent addition to my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very compelling","review":"I found this book rather slow at the start. I kept putting it down and reading something else and then picking it up again. Once the story gets going, it's hard to put down the book. There are two separate stories which are told separately at first, but then intermingle at the end. The chapters separate the different stories, but at the end of the book, it's merely paragraphs.I enjoyed the mystery involved and the characters were well developed. I have to agree with other reviewers, the affair seemed an unnecessary addition to the story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preposterous","review":"This book fell flat on so many levels... I found my interest waning dramatically with each page and finally left it at the gym yesterday. Hopefully, someone else will find it a satisfying read. Without repeating the same problems listed in other reviews, I'll just say that I did not develop any emotional response to Ella or Isabelle and the psychic connection between the two women (i.e. dreams, crying spells over paintings) felt preposterous. I could not understand what motivated Isabelle to marry a man who repeatedly raped and abused her (she was not forced to do it and there was no apparent benefit to that decision). It was ridiculous that several people would all of a sudden help Ella search for her ancestors and would give her a 16th century Bible based on Ella's gut feeling that she was related to its original owners. Come on! Stupidity run amok! I am sure I would have found many more gaps if I kept on reading, but I could not waste my time further."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Downer","review":"I ususally love historical fiction. This could have been a great book,it had interesting thematic elements & plot but in it there was unecessary sexual violence and many things are never resolved in the story. It leaves the reader hanging. I read it in two days because I was really interested in the plot. The story kindof got out of control and then it abruptly ends. It left me a bit depressed. I don't think I will read any more of this author's books, if they are all like this, which is a shame because the plots seem like they would be very interesting. I guess I just don't like this author's style."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"I love Tracy Chevalier.

I love the story of Isabelle but Ella's story makes this book intolerable. I'm on page 170ish and just read that Ella is a midwife.

Ella's character lacks self-esteem to the point of it being annoying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent quick read","review":"I'm more used to Chevalier's heavier writing (like Fallen Angels), but this was an ok story. I did enjoy the medieval story line much more than the modern day counterpart. I did not like the heroin Ella very much, nor did I identify with her problems and choices. I was also a little disappointed that the end was so ambiguous, but overall the writing was good and so my breakdown is 5 stars for Isabella's story, 3 stars for Ella's, an average of 4 will have to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't deliver","review":"This book had a lot to offer in someplaces but ultimately did not come together. The protagonist in the modern world never won me over, and the autor did not reslove what became of the person I learned to love in the story, old world Isabelle.All in all, this book felt like a draft that was hastily ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue missing pages?","review":"I was completely engrossed in the intertwined stories in this novel, staying up late nights to finish it, and was completely floored when it ended abruptly with no resolution on either woman's part. While some readers may enjoy deciding their own endings, I am not one and feel the author should have provided a sense of relief for readers desparate to find out what happens. I also was completely unconvinced by Ella's dissatisfaction with Rick. Many of us feel our spouses don't completely understand or listen to us 100% of the time (and vice versa), but this doesn't mean we instantly fall out of love with them and sleep with the first guy we find. Readers who like resolution: Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived?","review":"Unlike other reviewers here, I have not read Girl With a Pearl Earring--not sure I want to, either. I found Virgin Blue to be somewhat contrived and unconvincing. Chevalier's characters suffer from underdevelopment, and I did not feel particularly invested in their (surprise!) intertwined lives. Actually, the only thing that kept me reading this book was my desire to learn if the plot was really as transparent and predictable as I took it to be (it was). Chevalier's intentions are admirable, but in this case her delivery is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good airplane read.","review":"A little \\"lite\\" in the character department, sugary and overly dramatic in places.

The main character, Ella, was a selfish and very unlikeable charachter. Really ruined the book for me because I really thought she was a poorly developed, shallow character, who was not well thought out at all. I couldn't really care less about her dreams or her life, I was really hoping she'd drop dead and her nice husband would find someone else.The historical aspect was interesting but the author tied the lives of these women together in a very halfhazard way. I felt the author was building to a climax that was supposed to be stimulating and exciting but was just confusing and fell very flat. A disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chevalier's success","review":"Ms Chevalier wrote a brilliant first novel: girl with pearl earings, and a second followed - Falling angels- which touched a different subject but was also a fantastic novel.However no author should rush to a third one as she did. I have the impression the commercial success pushed her to write a third one too quickly. The Virgin Blue has a good idea, a lot of research was done, but it goes so fast that the whole story quickly becomes fake, full of stupid coincidences that fall from the blue and make no sense at all. The end is sudden, uncomprehensible, \\"invraisemblable\\". A ridiculous finale! I am still rather angry with the end because it left lots of details unexplained, which is not Chevalier's style.Ms Chevalier, take an advice: slow down... and tell your publisher you have a name to preserve and that you will not be pushed to write \\"just another novel\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as Chevalier's others","review":"I felt this book was a bit predictable and cliche.

Well two versions of said alien actually - one is the original and one is him \\"posessing\\" a human thanks to his unusual mental skills. It's then time for a race to recover the missing telepathy amplifier helmet, as the alien works out that he has been in stasis for millions of years, and a collection of humans try and deduce the actual truth about what's going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute","review":"I got as a gift for my brother - he collects these. I was a little disappointed when it arrived and was plain. I wanted some buckeyes on the helmet like you see on the players helmets.

Analyze This - one of the most dramatically funny films of Deniro's carrer since Midnight Run. A Bronx Tale - which he directed and was also fine. Goodfellas - a very good true storie of the mafia. Heat - one of the last successfull action drama films of Deniro before Casino in 1995. And Wag the Dog-although different from his other films proves to be a winner with Dustin Hoffman as co-star and should be enjoyed by all fans of Deniro. If you are a Deniro fan then I definitely reccomend this collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love DeNiro, but bad selection of one of America's greatest!","review":"What about Once upon a time in America, The Untouchables,Cape Fear, Men of Honor, The Godfather, Taxi Driver and 15 Minutes? I would have purchased this collection in a heartbeat if it included his best work. The films in this collection are good, but does not reflect his all of DeNiro's most popular performances (with the exception of Goodfellas). This collection is like qualifying for the olympics. A little taste of what you can do before you collect the gold metal. Analyze This should have been in a comedy pack along with Meet the Parents and Raging Bull. Wag the dog, although ok, should have been left out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choices could have been better!","review":"I only agree with 2 movies on this set. \\"Analyze This\\" & \\"Goodfellows\\", it would have been better if \\"Once Upon A Time in America\\" were included.

This CD (and the last one, for the most part) sounds like they have been heavily sedated and/or hijacked by the band Luna (although without Luna's wit). The lightweight guitar strumming and breezy vocals on display here amounts to perhaps the most precipitious decline in any rock band since... well, since forever, as far as I can tell. Please, please, bring back the brilliant musicians who wrote Ride the Tiger, Painful, May I Sing With Me, and other stand-outs of intelligent rock music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired","review":"This CD is bland and unispired for the most part.

Hopefully they will return to the more uptempo stuff they used to make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing happens...","review":"What if you assembled a band and started to record them, but nothing happened. They played and played, but nothing musical happened. It just went on and on and on. And still, nothing happened. There is no musical development, no divergence from a deadly boring formula here. I don't get it. If this represents Yo La Tengo's musical abilities and creativity, I don't understand their stature in the music world.

But the performances and script are so great this drawback is turned into a virtue. Having just gunned another man in a barroom dispute, Gregory Peck is marooned in his friend marshall Millard Mitchell's village where Peck's estranged wife and son also live, perhaps under Mitchell's protection. The relatives of Peck's latest kill are also after him. It's a fascinating study of how reputation, good or bad, can trap a person in a life he may grow to detest. The climax is a little pat but the whole package is a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Although the visual quality was good, the story line was poor to non-existent at points.

There's a darker side to the Variable Geo tournaments... and our heroines end up running headlong into it.I thought 'Variable Geo' sounded like a hoot, so I picked up up. The first ten minutes are the tone I would have expected... but after that, the concept of warrior waitresses is started to be taken seriously not only by the story, but, the episodes assume, by the viewer as well. It's a flaw that turns what could have been a fun romp into a rather excrutiating 80 minutes.To make matters worse, the first three episodes end on a cliffhanger. I imagine this means there's a 'Variable Geo II' on the horizon. It's a sequel that I at least will be ignoring.On the techincal front, the animation was average and the voice acting (in the English dubbed version) was slightly above average."},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest description of life in the movies","review":"Stanley Kramer has been a lonely wolf in Hollywood. When he started at the end of 40's he was unique in his approach. He had many economical flops in a row, but then always had a real blockbuster. His strategy was to film controversial subjects with famous actors. Sometimes this worked very well. One must admire his courage. I have seen quite many of his pictures (Champion, Cyrano, High Noon, The Wild One, The Defiant Ones, Mad Mad Mad Mad World, Invitation to a Gunfighter) and liked them all. If you want to read about the making of films, this is for you. It does not tell much of personal life, which suits me well. Read and enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Rail Fence Corners","review":"This is a very special book for anyone interested in history, especially those who had ancestors who passed through Minnesota. It's a collection of stories collected by the Daughters of the Americal Revolution, who felt it was important to record the memories of those individuals who helped settle the state before it was too late. It was originally published in the early 1900's, and this edition should be a reprint of it. The stories are presented pretty much in the words of the storytellers with little editing. Reading them gives a person some perspective into the many aspects of frontier life and the types of people who formed our nation."},{"rating":"1","title":"EZGD is not selling TKO Mats as advertised","review":"EZGD is selling Lex USA Corp Eva Flooring.

I thought it had a great beginning and was completely enthralled with it....but then then movie just kept going and going. I particularly did not care for the last installment. I think that could have been summed at the end of the fifth installment with the narrator just telling people what happened. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie. The costumes are WONDERFUL, and I have to say that the did the makeup really well. The sisters really did seem to age even though played by the same characters (at least until the last installment). If you like period pieces, this is a must see. It is so much better than the Buccaneers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aristocrats -- the miniseries","review":"If costumes are all you're looking for in a costume drama, then go for it, because you won't find much drama. There was something anachronistic in the perspective of this period piece, which perhaps could be attributed to poorly adapted source material and some smug voice-overs. I could find little that was compelling in these upper class historical characters, all unlikeable in their various unremarkable hypocrisies. Particularly puzzling was the portrayal of Sarah by Jodhi May, a blank performance that might have aroused sympathy for the character had she suffered trauma or brain damage. Since there was nothing in the narrative to explain such strange affect, it was merely annoying. All in all, this was a long, boring film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a lover of alot of the BBC films By Austen and films by Dickens, I thought to give this film a try. Sadly, there are several things which put me off. One - they loop certain characters voices and it just doesn't work, especially the narrator's character who starts out as a young girl. Two - in the last part of the 4 part set, they literally changed all the actors!! I have never seen this before and it ruined the whole viewing experience. All they needed to do was to \\"age\\" the existing cast as usually done in these types of films- Instead they just replaced the actors for some odd reason. As they have taken the viewer through their entire lives, marriages, deaths in the family and changes in the world prior to the ending, to suddenly throw in new actors in all the main characters during the finale is really terrible. Also- I did not find much chemistry between any of the men and women who ended up married or even having romances. I would not recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty Characters, Strange Pacing","review":"Based on a true story, Aristocrats follows an English aristocratic family, who claims royal blood and status via Charles II bastard lineage. The convoluted timeline in fits and starts, takes place prior to the American Revolution on through to the Irish uprising of 1798.The story starts out interestingly enough, but at about part 3 of 6 you begin to wonder if there is a point to the story. The last 3 parts are simply depressing. More than anything, the timeline begins to rapidly fly by without any specific storyline accountability nor historical grounding. The casting is odd in general. In particular, as the characters age, the casting changes are really horrible choices that offer no consistency or context of character and plot.If you've nothing else, you may find this a mild diversion. But all in all, this doesn't measure up to the BBC's standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love BBC period pieces","review":"Very Good, done well, love the costumes. Been watching BBC series lately, USA TV regular programming does not show mini series anymore, BBCA does not air BBC mini series in my area, nor PBS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat Aristocrats","review":"Like many sagas, this series suffers from too many characters and too little development of characterization. Even the main characters are so dull and broadly drawn that it is impossible to feel either sympathy or revulsion for them. Like a soap opera, the plot merely rambles along, never seeming to progress toward any culmination other than the family's aging. Characters are sometimes introduced and killed off without any intervening significance to the action. There is practically no interaction between the master and servant classes, an element that usually adds interest to British period pieces. Those in service are treated as truly unseen, and the few Irish peasants presented are wooden props. If one turned off the sound and simply viewed the lavish, intricate costumes and settings, the series would probably be just as enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book is Better","review":"I watched this on Masterpiece Theater and was intrigued enough with the family story to buy the book.

The Author's conclusions are utterly ludicrous and are reached through no reasonable amount of logic whatsoever. He tries to explain away and pronounce dead wrong things that 2500 years of Indian scholars and Yogic Ascetics know to be fact. This is by far and away the most ignorant, westernized interpretation of any area of Yoga I have ever seen. I wouldn't be speaking so harshly if it weren't entirely warranted. Trust me.

Ms Davis spends considerable time exploring the growth in the unlikely relationship between Falco and his aristocratic girl friend, Helena Justina. The characters are well-drawn and the wry humour throughout the book makes it an easy read; however Ms Davis does gloss over the squalor and less savoury practices that prevailed in ancient Rome and its empire.Read the very latest Falco book 'Three Hands in the Fountain', a copy of which I have just received from Britain.

The Last Act At Palmyra is an entertaining read but don't expect any depth. I knew who done it halfway through the novel.

This album is really good. Maybe not as good as Neu, but it's still better than any rock music you'll hear on the radio here. Devo is a commonly cited reference point, but the band has the Devo thing down and goes over the top with it. Noisy with electronic beeps and stuff slathered over mathematical electric chaos. I like it. I think this album also features the first song by the Polysics to be sung fully in Japanese, rather than hilariously bad Engrish.

The book opens into a full-scale photograph of a beautiful Selena during a photo session early in her career. It is divided into three musical styles : Pop/English, Cumbia and Mariachi. Most of the songs featured on the \\"Pop/English\\" disc have been remixed, by her brother and producer A.B., of course. The second and third are mostly ballads with a few upbeat Cumbia tracks that add a bit of variety to the set.

She had an enchanting voice that awed us all. Her CD is just superb with the glowing success of \\"I Could Fall in Love\\" and the title track, \\"Dreaming of You\\" which is a favorite of mine. Long time ago, I told my parents about the movie \\"Selena\\" and so we rented it. We were shocked by the ending and couldn't help watching it another time. My parents immediately went to the store and grabbed her CD. She has since been their favorite pop artist. I still find my parents and myself sneaking the CD into the stereo because it is just so irrisistible! Selena touched so many people and it is a shame she died. She was a beautiful young lady with a one-of-a-kind voice. Her melody fills my living room with rich music and the Spanish songs are even more vibrant. We will never forget the one and only Selena."},{"rating":"2","title":"Selena's \\"Anthology\\" is incomplete","review":"...Gone from this set are the cuts that would've rounded it out, such as live tracks, some hits, some MORE English songs that didn't come from the crossover CD, et cetera. Also, the CDs themselves could stand to be a little longer. Each one is about 30 minutes long - not like the people who put this together were hurting for space to put some more songs into this set.Now, the good stuff: You can tell how old Selena was by the phrasing in her Spanish songs on this set. She sounds lovely as always, and this set is worth the money you'll spend. Some of the remixes on this set are worse than the originals; some are better. It's a mixed bag. However, I am not the typical Selena fan, so you won't get any gushy sentimentalism about how wonderful this set is simply because it's Selena.

Mel Gibson's directorial debut does just this. \\"Man Without\\" is a beautifully crafted film about friendship and acceptance, set to a superb musical score by James Horner. Gibson hews a powerful performance as a man given the chance to transcend his life of solitude and regret, when he agrees to tutor a troubled young boy. Nick Stahl does a fine job as the young boy who secretly studies literature with the town \\"freak\\", and comes to find in his teacher the father he never had and the friend he would always cherish. Long after the lights have come up and the credits have finished rolling, this film stays with you. More than just a commendable first effort, Mel Gibson's cinematic work of art is uncomparable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming-of-age tale.","review":"The Man Without a Face starring and directed by Mel Gibson is a superb drama with a little bit of comedy thrown in.

Jesus said it, the catholic church teaches it, and western civilization would be a lot better if we all practiced it. When we all walk by people everyday we must never presume to know what they are going through. This movie had a profound impact on my life, and taught me that nothing is ever as it seems. It also shows all of us what we could learn if we open up to the right people and let them bless us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book instead","review":"Isabelle Holland's The Man Without a Face is a strong, daring work that deserves wider attention than its placement in the ghetto of \\"young adult\\" fiction.

There is a summary at the beginning of each chapter telling how these quotes relate to a Zen concept but the relationships are simplistic and the majority of the quotes are worn thin (ie. \\"What you see is what you get\\"....Flip Wilson.)Quotes are a wonderful, quick way of seeing the world from a new perspective, but labelling this book \\"Zen Soup\\" (instead of perhaps, \\"Yet More Cool Quotes From Smart People\\") seems like a quick way to make a buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"Typical Jorge drivel.

That took a little twiddling but after a few power cycles of the phone and handset it worked fine.My biggest complaint is that the earpiece isn't as comfortable as it could be. The part that sticks in your ear is just a large knob-like thing that doesn't have any contours to fit your ear shape; it just kinda leans against your ear. Other Jabra products I've used in the past have nicely contoured jels and I was hoping to be able to use one of those on this piece. The piece is not entirely uncomfortable; I only use it on my commute to and from work and it doesn't bother me too much, but I can't vouch for those of you wanting to use this 8 hours a day.Overall though I like it and for the price it does everything I need it to do and is very reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"No hands, no wires, no complaints","review":"I got this for \\"free\\" bundled with new service and a Motorola E815.

I have been disappointed to discover that although the thing looks pretty and appears to be well-made, it is clumsy and awkward to operate. The safety button is in the wrong place to be comfortably depressed while striking the lighter. Compared to other devices of this type, the Zippo does not have much distance between the flame and your hand making it difficult to light wicks that are down inside jar-type candles.

Having liked what I read on the dvd's back cover and having paid $12.99 for it I really thought I was in for a treat. But after watching this demented effort at horror I felt ripped off, lol. This movie was boring cheese. The movie had bad casting and was very slow moving. The characters and the story line was completly pointless. I like horror and I like cheese but I wasnt expecting this movie to be so cheesy. This movie now sits in my DVD cheese section right next to movies like \\"Chopping Mall\\",\\"Trick or Treat\\", and \\"The Gate\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"MY OPINION,","review":"I picked this movie up at WAL MART for 19.79 plus tax. I wish I would of read Frank T Miller;s review on this movie before I opened it and watched it because I may have taken it back to get my money back. I watched this movie expecting it to be a knock-out horror flick. The mute so called psyco female in this moviedid nothing speechwise but give that giggling oF HE HE HE, HE HE HE, Like in the evil dead movies. It's a movie that if your a new watcher to horror flicks it might give you a BUZZ but all veteran horror fans forget it. It's a movie I would never waste my time to watch over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pat Troughton's Doctor a marvel in \\"The Ice Warriors\\"!!!","review":"It took several years, but Patrick Troughton's doctor has completely won me over. Not that I did not originally like Pat's performance. From the start,I enjoyed his Chaplin approach tothe character, his ability to use brain over brawn to defeat his enemies. The problem is that there are so few complete serials of his era (the number to-date is only six). This is why \\"The Ice Warriors\\" is a complete joy to watch! The very first Ice Warrior story is a good, filled with suspence, solid supoorting characters and quips of humor. Still, the reason to buy this is tape is Troughton. Well established as the doctor at this point, Pat does a remarkable job of mixing humor, believable fright and underestimated self-confidence into the doctor that it reminds us what a superb actor he truly was. A must for all Doctor Who fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasure...","review":"Until this video came out, there really were only 5 different adventures that represented Patrick Troughton's time as the Doctor, sadly they do not represent the best of his time. This adventure does. Although parts two and three are missing, the accompanying CD (located underneath the wraparound label along with a 48 booklet of neat facts) gives the complete soundtrack to the episode and since you do see episode, 1, your mind can easily \\"see\\" what's happening while listening to parts two and three, losing basically nothing. But even so, they cover all the bases, giving a pictorial recap/synopsis of the two missing epidoes. Truly a treat which I think we'll see more of. Sadly not every adventure has the luxury of missing only a few early parts, leaving the meat intact. Still, enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the real Patrick Troughton.","review":"\\"Tomb of the Cybermen\\" alone didn't convert me to the gospel of the Monster Season, but this one has me singing in the choir. \\"The Ice Warriors\\" is an outstanding low-budget production, with good set design, a terrific score, and great-looking monsters. And while the Ice Warriors are meanies, the script doesn't let the humans off either -- they're the architects of their misery, through their ecological carelessness and their willful enslavement to the whims of a Great Computer. Episodes 2 and 3 are missing, but the 15-minute reconstruction of those episodes is impressive. Recommended to any Who fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Still and Know that I AM","review":"Henri Nouwen examines his life after a near death accident in which he encounters the Living God.Facing the possibililty of dying he is able to let go and let God's unconditional love come to him and accept himself as God sees him.His recovery from the accident brings about many changes in his attitude towards his family, friends, acquaintances and yes even his enemies. The experience brought resolve and forgiveness for his sins and the sins of others.To come back to the living and take his daily cross was very difficult, since he had already prepared himself for the next life with Christ. To return to the former routine seemed impossible at that time but before long he had gone back to his former ways and was constantly trying to keep the peace that he had found during his illness.Another book that touches on going to the mountain top and coming back would be \\"Hind's Feet on High Places\\"Hinds' Feet on High Placesan allegory by Hannah Hurnard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"While this was an easy read and well written book, I felt like Nouwen kept repeating himself throughout. I don't doubt his experience and am happy for him that he found such peace and definition for his service in life. But as for myself, it did nothing to further my spirituality or make me feel comfortable or peaceful about death. This came highly recommended and I wound up speed-reading through the last third of the book to get through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comforting and Inspiring Writer","review":"Nouwen is one of my favorite spiritual writers.

It was okay at the beginning and then it just got weird with people floating in the air, dead whales on the beach, walking on water. It was just a little too weird as I said. I don't reccomend it. It wasn't very good. I would reccomend Charmed though if you like this sort of thing, now that is a cool witch show.Another note, I practice Paganism and I wasn't the least bit offended by this movie. It's all in good fun..."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"MAN CREATED GOD. THIS IS OLDER THAN THAT.\\"","review":"How I'd love to recommend a movie with that line in it, but The Craft is simply not that well crafted. It's your average bubblegum teen angst flick about three vexing high school girls with Like Whatever accents and disheveled hair. The DVD promised wiccan horror, and it is probably a gallant effort for its measly budget, but nothing here really for anyone but standpat Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Girl Power","review":"\\"The Craft\\" is a silly movie about four teenage girls who are into goth, darkness and witchcraft. They\`re mysterious, edgy and hip, know what they want and how to get there, so beware. As the story unfolds, the more childish and ridiculous it gets, presenting teen rebellion in an obvious and over-the-top way. It even has a dated soundtrack with some mid-90\`s alternative rock bands, and it\`s not very good either. The characters aren\`t menacing or interesting, so why should we care? Probably some 13 year old girls will like this, though. Otherwise, it\`s just a powerless craft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful","review":"This movie has as little to do with actual Witchcraft as the Lion king had to do with actual lion life on the Serengeti. This movie was not about Witches, it was about ignorant people using Magick towards selfish ends. Using magick does not make one a Witch. Following an incredibly ancient religious philosophy that precludes harming others does. I have personally known some very powerful Witches and if they or I could do half the things these children did in this film, we would not be persecuted as we have been for the past 2,000 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film, Decent Soundtrack","review":"amazing movie. When It hit the screen I smuggled myself and my friend into the movie (damn the rating system) we were blown away by it's awesome stellar opening song by Our Lady Peace and flash of graphics. Such a great movie for teen gal pals or a trio or 4 some of best friends. Again, great movie and the soundtrack is decent for the time of it's debut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite","review":"As a practicing witch/wiccan, I can say that this movie does a terrible job of portraying the Craft. As Hollywood drivel it does a fine job of stimulating the imaginations of 15-year-old girls. However, the extreme innaccuracies in this movie have only made ignorant people take my religion less seriously. If you are a witch, this ludicrous film will give you a chuckle, however, once you stop and think about it, you will be equally appalled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly \\"magic\\"","review":"This movie had a strong story line; it could've been good.But sadly its focus on darkness and death kept that from happening. It put true magick -the Craft- in a very bad light, in my view. And the ending showed the only really likable character (Sarha) turning dark & vengeful.True Wiccans will not be happy with this director's portrayal of their religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice entertainment, poor witchcraft portrayal!","review":"When this movie came out I was very excited! 'Finaly a nice portrait of witches!' I thought. But when I finaly saw it it came to be a deception in that matter. I study pagan religions and been into wicca for some time, and I can tell you wicca/paganism has got nothing to do with that mumbo jumbo the girls do! I only liked the occult store witch, she had something to do with the whole subject. Still, even if you know what wicca's all about, you should abstract from it and see this movie, because it's very entertaining, specialy if your a teenager in his/her wild years, but hey! don't go and fall into that misconception about witchcraft! If you're willing to go deeper into it read some good paganism books first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Possible Neve Campbell's best work.","review":"Partial to older witch movies, so this one was a surprise. Good cast, direction, and settings. Liked the soundtrack as well. Good buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but a bit unrealistic.","review":"I think this is one of my favorite films of all time, but I'm just getting into Paganism and I think this film goes against everything to do with the religion and they totally abuse their powers. Yet it's still a good movie, it's just a shame that so many people see this film as real witchcraft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr we are the weridos","review":"First off this movie isn't meant to be a true to life depiction of Witches. It is as real as Shanghi Noon is to the wild west. It is a fantsy movie nothing more and nothing less. If you go into it thinking that this is going to show alot about Wiccan beleifs then think again. It's a good story that uses the idea of four fantasy witches and events that shape their lives and the decisions that they make. It has a good tight story which makes a nice change. The acting is pretty good and has a nice soundtrack. All the right mix for a good film. The messege it sends isn't altogether a bad one. In the film it is what happens when anger and misuse of power can achieve. This film is well worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystick Realistick Teen Flick Fusion BD OK","review":"After repeated viewings, Craft retains power and interest. Two DVDs and the BD; I should be bored; but it plays to stay. Medium power film has roots and style a'plenty with weird ways mixed with mundane. Great Playlist and a ride. BD has DTS power and great pic (soft by nature)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun flick","review":"I have been Wiccan for several years now, and I have to agree that The Craft is not a very accurate example of the Pagan religion. However, it did not offend me in the least. It's a fun movie, no matter the accuracy of it, and the underlying story deals mostly with everyday teenage life, and what we have to go through. There is also an important moral included in the story, about not letting power and greed destroy you.Fairuza Balk, who plays Nancy, was and is a practicing Wiccan. While she, too agreed that the movie was not completely accurate, she had a fun time making it, and I see no reason why others shouldn't have a fun time watching it. This movie remains one of my favorites, and I never get tired of watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One accurate movie here!","review":"Oh, I have seen numerous movies involving witches and their talents. I must say, this is the most accurate yet, someone really did their research, some of it was a bit iffy, but overall, pretty good. It is also a funny and cute movie. If you want to know what it is like to be a witch, put your self in Sarah from the movies position, she comes over most as a witch, witch, a true witch, and she reacts to how it really feels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better researched than most \\"Witch Films\\".","review":"I found this movie to have the same fact to entertainment ratio concerning the \\"Old Religon,\\" as the film \\"HACKERS\\" did for the computer geek world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairuza's best work...","review":"This movie has to be one of the best movies out there and it's Fairuza's best work yet..."},{"rating":"2","title":"its a fun movie but not for wiccan seekers of the REAL THING","review":"great movie but it is entertainment, and other than the book shop, and a few tools shown in the movie nothing else is \\"TRUE\\" be ware witchwannabeeees bright blessings, WW"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED IT!","review":"It is my second favorite movie and Fear is my favorite movie.The Craft was awesome!The first time I watched it was Oct.97.Neve is very beautiful and I like the new girl.Skeet is very good-looking but he is only looking for sex I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Craft - Awesome!","review":"The Craft is a great movie. It's much better done than most other movies with a witchcraft theme because it's not a comedy, like \\"The Witches of Eastwick\\" or \\"Hokus Pokus.\\" The special effects are good.

What I will say is that this movie is GREAT! It's just dark and fun in an intriguing, supernatural way. Fairuza Balk without a doubt made the movie...she is an under rated INCREDIBLE actress. She just has that piercing presence/beauty that just fit all to perfectly. Robin Tunney I could take or leave...she kind of gives me a weird vibe. But to be honest, the more I watch the movie the more she does grow on me. Neve was dam good...thought she gave an excellent performance and fit in the movie very well. Rachel True I could take or leave also, her character wasn't developed right...they could have done a much better job with her. But overall this is a movie I can watch OVER and OVER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairuza Balk deserves more credit!","review":"Fairuza Balk made this movie great. If it wasn't for her, i probably wouldn't have liked it nearly as much. She's an amazing actress. And she was definitly perfect for this role. There is something about that beauty of hers that is kinda of dark and creepy, but in a good way. She is the only \\"witch\\" out of the group that sort of makes it look real.Overall the movie is good, definitly worth a watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This movie is very entertaining. It remains true, for the most part, to the basics of witchcraft. It illustrates very well the 3 fold law. Those who have been offended might want to consider the portrayal of Good Witches, not only Sarah but also the shopkeeper, who seems to be a true witch who follows closely Wiccan laws."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've rated this before as ONE STAR.

When I first saw it I just got scared but in the past few years I have come to reasearch Wicca and now this movie just irritates me.The cast is fine, the plot is fine, the special effects are fine. But...it promotes an idea which some people have been trying (very hard mind you) to get rid of for over 100 years.Wicca and Witchcraft in their original form are not like this at all. The closest this gets is right at the end where one of the girls sees that good is the only way.The rest of it is Hollywood junk being promoted and once again it is Wicca which sufers. This is the reason for my 2 star rating and the only reason it got 2 is becuase it is the storyline and not the actors or their work which I don't like. If you look at this movie completly on it's own then it is quite good and sometimes nicely scary.But I can't get past the terrible stereotypes which keep coming up so 2 out of 5 is what it gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I thought this movie was very good.

It's a religion, and this movie does not portray it right. And the thing with the crosses, yeah, the day I did a report on Wicca in a class i wore my cross. It's just something to wear, it has nothing to do with anything. Whatever. This movie is okay, aside from the fact that it spawned a billion little teeny boppers deciding that they thought they were witches. It does have a decent message though how not to mess with the powers. I'd rather watch Charmed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Customer Service","review":"I ordered this product at the beginning of March and have emailed them twice b/c I have not received it yet - no response.

Awful customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please!","review":"This *wasn't* a very good movie on it's own merits, and the only reason it got so much attention was because it was a well-promoted flick about a controversial topic. The acting is barely passable, the direction is lousy, and the only outstanding thing about the movie is the soundtrack!Furthermore, anyone with any sense can tell that this movie is NOT about Wicca or the Craft, but is Hollywood's concept of what will sell a movie. If you're in the mood for some fluffy mindless entertainment, this movie is for you. If you're interested in learning about the Craft as religion or magic, buy a few good books and remember that movies are pure fiction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Think twice before you watch this movie.

There is nothing fulfilling about this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a horrible piece of garbage.","review":"Ok, this movie S[tinks]. Let me break it down for you:1) These girls can't act.2) Witchcraft and magick and wicca and all that stuff is BOGUS. As in, NOT REAL. As in, PEOPLE CANNOT CAST SPELLS.3) The plot is retarded.4) Did I mention that witchcraft is stupid?There were some entertaining parts to the movie, like when they were performing their \\"rituals\\", which was so ridiculous as to make me poop my pants with laughter. I probably pooped myself 7 or 8 times while watching this movie. The only hope I had was that the 4 girls would have some sort of kinky orgy, but that never happened. Avoid at all costs if you have an ounce of brains."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is really good and is worth checking out!","review":"The Craft is supposed to be a horror movie but like some horror movies now it's not very scary. The story line's really good though, a girl called Sarah moves to her new school, Eastwick high,she runs into 3 girls, known as the bitches of Eastwick, who have a vast interest in witchcraft. The girls are really nice to her at first but then turn evil on her."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good little witchy movie!","review":"Although I've owned this movie for a few years now, it continues to be one of my favorites. Sure, it may be geared more towards teenagers, but I still love it. Basically, three teenage witches entice a new student into their circle and turn on her in the end, but I won't spoil the very ending for anybody who hasn't see this movie. Whether you are a teen, or a teen at heart, if you have even the slightest interest in Witchcraft, you will enjoy this film.

Some find it overly precious. But there are beauties abounding in his smaller works. This CD from Bridge Records features excellent recording standards, and it is the 9th in Bridge's series that focusses on Crumb's music -- currently Bridge is releasing a growing collection of similarly excellently performed and recorded works by Stefan Wolpe. The performances here are top-notch, but the recording itself is really fine -- one can hear all the little details in Crumb's scores. The surface of Crumb's music has never sounded so attractive.Ancient Voices and the four books of Madrigals are sets of magnificently imaginative modern music. Crumb has one foot in atonality, part of a foot ironically in a Bartokian folk-like idiom, with toes dipping into Elizabethan era consort music and the softer world of Morty Feldman.For listeners who don't know Crumb's music, this CD offers a superb introdcution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't get it at all","review":"Didn't get it at all. Had such high hopes because of all the good reviews. The premise sounded intersting enough. The movit was just strange. It was dark. I mean literally dark, a lot of shadow and dark and had to make out what was going on all the time. Nodded off about 30 min into it.. and didn't feel like I missed a thing. Thank goodness I rented, if I had bought it based on reviews I'd be kicking myself in the arse right about now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Year 2000 is coming and anarchy follows","review":"My favorite film of all time, Strange Days manages to capture everything possible in a 2-something hour movie. It is an action movie done with taste. Like other James Cameron movies, this one has is a very touchy, emotional story told in front of a backdrop of near-anarchistic streets of Los Angeles on December 31, 1999. The movie has a very dark -Nautral Born Killers- feeling but I could only be saying that because of Juliete Lewis who plays lead roles in both movies. The bottom line is that every person should see this movie and eveyr person will find something to like in it. It has beautiful romantic scenes as well as violent rape scenes, it has everything, yet it does not feel cluttered END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, bad matting!","review":"First off, I REALLY love this movie. I wish I could do two raitings, one for the movie, and one for the disc, but I can't, so this is only about the disc.My biggest dislike is that this movie was not put to disc using the anamorphic widescreen technology. Instead, it was matted with the black letter box bars, essentially hard-letterboxing the picture. This wasn't of much concern to me when I originally purchased the movie, because I was watching it on an SD 4:3 TV. Now that I am using a 16:9 HD TV, what I get is letter box bars, AND pillar box bars, essentially reducing my 32in TV to a 22in TV.I am hoping for a blu-ray version to be released so that I can see this film in all it's intended glory.Don't get me wrong, pillar box bars have their place when viewing 4:3 content on a 16:9 screen, but when the picture is supposed to be 16:9 or better (2.35:1, etc...) then having both pillar box bars and letter box bars together just makes me feel cheated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange Days indeed...","review":"I've been a fan of this film for years, way before I even knew what is was called (came across it many a late nights).\\"Strange Days\\" is an awesome movie, a thiller set in the not so distant future. (Well at the time it was filmed, now it's 5 years in the past.). What I love is that it's character driven, Angela Basset is amazing. She's a strong character, yet fragile at the same time.The soundtrack for this film is a keeper. It's totally in pace with the movie, and keeps things going.These characters have so much thrown at them because of a single event. It's kind of hard to ge lost in this film, but that's what makes is so good. You can feel what the characters are going through.Trust me, this is one hell of a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"See it more than once!","review":"First time i've seen this movie, I thought it was never going to end. But then again, I watched it a second time and I actually enjoyed it! It's based on a really unusual type of script. What is bad is that we can predict quite easily how the movie is going to end... But all things considered, it's worth to have if you like sci-fi merged with suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"entering the new year","review":"i rented this video because it was at the video store. and then becoming a great ralph fiennes fan, bought the video. james cameron is always creative (not having watched the titanic) i can only appreciate the terminator series and this movie - strange days. the performances are believable. ralph fiennes does an outstanding job of someone who is addicted to his discs, and a woman he loves and yes life too. angela bassett brings more to her role as a woman who is not afraid to be tough and vulnerable. either way the movie was/is timely. it shows the decisive moments that we are faced with in this new year and for that i give it a thumbs up! maybe after the new year people will look at this cleverly drawn interpretation at LA on the edge with a laissez-fair attitude. I felt it was timely."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of terrific actors","review":"As a longtime fan of the cult film \\"Blade Runner,\\" I had hoped this film would be in the same vein--and maybe it will, in time. But the convoluted plot is too much even for this great cast--Ralph Fiennes, Juliette Lewis, Angela Bassett, Tom Sizemore--hey, this should have been a great film. But the actors struggle bravely to not much avail. The one clip I enjoyed was Fiennes' and Bassett's sexy kiss at the end, but it was pretty unbelievable that two people who had just been almost beaten to death could have mustered up much erotic drive. Fiennes fans will enjoy seeing his usual brilliance, but don't expect another \\"Blade Runner.\\" END"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can find better sci-fi in Blade Runner & Dreamscape","review":"This was a sub-par bit of sci fi that recycles the 'future is desolate' idea of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and the 'wouldn't it be interesting to explore the thoughts and experiences of someone else?' idea of Dreamscape. People in a gloomy almost Y2K LA jack into other people's lives. A couple of the life experiences available for public consumption turn out to be killings. The talented actors waste a lot of time flailing around trying to figure out among other thing who the killer is.The voyeuristic... murder mystery portion of the plot is an interesting idea but so it's cluttered with a bunch of cheap false leads and worse Ray Fiennes character mooning over Juliette Lewis as to kill the story idea. The actors do their best and the special effects are little more than good film editing. Mostly it's a way to [spend] two hours but you can definitely get better science fiction for your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not that good","review":"There definitely is an audience for this film, though many of them might secretly like to see a snuff film, too. Some of the edgier scenes in this one - and there are plenty - come uncomfortably close.

Not worthless: Juliette Lewis is nude in several scenes. She does, however, sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast paced & morally gritty","review":"I liked this movie because it moved quickly and Ralph Fiennes was excellent in his portrayal.However, I've never seen such intentionally vulgar, full body displays (in an \\"R\\" rated movie) of a Rape in progress--which cinematically delights in the graphic humiliation of a woman; And which accepts as normal a somewhat gritty city.Moral dignity is not a theme in this movie. Fast action, wonderful camera work, and decent acting by all other supporting cast members is.I feel dirty after watching this movie and believe viewers should be so advised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slick Cyberpunk Noir for people who've seen it all (already)","review":"If it wasn't plagued by confusing and promiseless trailers, Strange Days could have elevated its breed of techno-underworld fiction to the popularity of, say, epic space adventures. Sadly, many didn't take the opportunity to see this complex and well-produced thriller in the theater.What makes Strange Days stand out amidst other early 90's cyberpunk movies (like Johnny Mneumonic) is its emphasis on the film noir roots its genre was founded on. Its characters are well-rendered, and the plot (though centered on technologies not yet available) is believable, if a little disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misogyny and lousy direction sink movie","review":"This film doesn't just pale in comparison to its cyberpunk cousins \\"Bladerunner\\" or \\"12 Monkeys,\\" it turns ghostly white and dies. The film misses the mark because it can't decide what it's aiming for, and so it resorts to tired old Hollywood formulas. For example, the film nominally decries misogyny while at the same time offering viewers voyeuristic scenes of women being murdered, raped, groped, and screwed. (And that's when they're not stripping and standing around 90-100% nude.) Bassett's strength gives the movie some female force, but only by putting her macho boots up the noses of the bad guys and gals. Interestingly, the film portends the LA police's CRASH unit--a murderous group of fascists which has come to public light since this film was made. But that real story of CRASH is far more horrifying than this weak drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"So very very bad...","review":"I'll admit it, it did have a great opening sequence in which you're looking through a criminals eyes. After seeing that, I had high hopes. About a hour later, I was so bored with the movie that I turned it off and watched reruns of Mork & Mindy. Probably the worst movie James Cameron has ever been involved in.

Boring. It has almost no plot and goes nowhere. The characters are unlikely and poorly developed. I turned this movie off 3/4 through it. I can only say that about maybe 5 movies in my life.What finally made me turn this off was a very sick scene involving rape, torture, and murder. I've seen movies that are rated X that were cleaner. I'm no prude, but this was a disgusting movie.Save yourself some time and watch a porn video."},{"rating":"2","title":"They may not like it, but I definitely do.","review":"Despite what a lot of critics have said about it, Strange Days ranks as one of my favorite films, simply for the immersive, anarchistic feel and the brief glimpse of what our future could look like. It perhaps might be more of a cult film than could be enjoyed by the mainstream audience, but if you're looking for an involving, gritty, not-so-futuristic action flick, check this out. Ralph Fiennes convinces, though Juliette Lewis could've been better. Tom Sizemore, however, is my quiet favorite in his role as Lenny's (Fiennes) pal. There's enough action to keep the plot interesting, and it's always fun the first time around to decide who's doing what."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film, Problematic DVD","review":"This is a great film, and perhaps Bigelow's best before she went on to win an Oscar for \\"Hurt Locker.\\" Unfortunately, I see no indication that this isn't the same disc that I have, which is also stated to be 2.35:1 widescreen. On my widescreen TV this displays the way widescreen releases did on not-so-widescreen TVs back in the day: letterboxed, with black bars above and below. But the extra width of the TV means black bars on the sides as well. Letterboxing on widescreen TVs is really annoying. It would be nice if this was re-released in a manner that does it justice, perhaps as a part of a \\"Bigelow Collection.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"This is what I call a good popcorn movie.

This is a very cool movie with a great cast and insane plot that was unheard of at the time. This was a peek into the future from back in the 1990's. The story revolves around the millennium party happening on New Year's eve in 1999. Plenty of action and shoot outs along with a deranged serial killer. This is a film that explores the scenery and characters from very odd and interesting perspective visually. Some of the things we see in this movie have actually come to fruition. Creepy! Fun movie to check out and I recommend this specifically for Blade Runner fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality bytes...","review":"Thin, amaizing, thrilling, a little scary movie.

Lots of great clothes on the chicks, kindy of kinky in parts. It's \`Brainwave\`+\`Out for Justice\` with a little \`Bladerunner\` tossed in. Strictly B-list actors, but this movie was made for eye-candy, not oscars. It's one of those that grows on ya', so if you like action, cyberpunkish techno, and see-thru tops, pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great picture and sound - lousey movie","review":"This was a huge let down as far as plots go.

My advise would be to rent it for the DVD aspects and keep the $ for a better title for the collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie","review":"This movie is absolutely horrid. There is constant violence including sexual assaults against women. I agree with another viewer that found it odd that a woman would choose to direct this type of film.

I wonder what James Cameron was thinking when he wrote this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous","review":"This is a masterpiece. Great characters, great plot, a lot of action and imput for a deep reflection about our future and our nature. And a marvelous love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"mind blowing","review":"Best sci-fi since blade runner. Ignore the bad reviews, its a film that needs to be seen in person before passing judgements. With its really original plot and hyper-kinetic style, Strange days begs to be watched, even though it crashed at the box office. The opening sequence alone is probably worth the cost of the dvd, so do yourself a favour a give it a try.

The author seemed to do an excellent and exhaustive job of finding parallels that, according to his conclusions, showed that the contemporary historical time charts were out of kilter by about 600 years.

HP informed me that a compatible driver would not be available until the beginning of the new year. So it sits and does nothing as I wait for the new driver to become available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor service","review":"The scanner arrived and appears to be of good quality, but shipped without the template needed to scan slides. Since my company bought this machine solely to scan our slide collection, this renders the scanner useless to us. Contacting the seller proved fruitless, as their policy is that if you do not notice missing or damaged items within two days of arrival, they will not solve the problem. I will never buy from this seller again, and I urge you to do likewise. There are better sellers out there that deserve our business.Update!

I do not recommend anyone to purchase this item. Its support service is also evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"As slow as it gets","review":"I ordered this scanner with high expectations generated by the good specifications and the quality brand name of HP. The device itself is sturdy and well manufactured as one would expect. However, I was more than disappointed by the extremely slow performance. It is nearly impossible to scan slides with higher resolution than 1200 bpi. The data amount prodcued and hours spent on scanning only one slide are risicolous. In addition, the software is completely counter-intuitive and buggy, overriding settings and behaving in an inconsistent manner.Conclusion: Sent the scanner back to the internet shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbo!","review":"I am so sick of HP products.

I have one computer, and their final solution was for me to install on another computer. I suggested they send me known good CD, but no comment from HP.

Then you just lay the slides in it- very easy! I have the default setting at a very low resolution to get many slides scanned quickly- I can't believe how true to color and clarity I'm getting!!

I am a very experienced computer user and engineer, and have always been able to get things to work. The scanner is mechanically impressive and I really liked the six color idea. But it just didn't work. Software installation took a long time on my XP machine, and, as written in other reviews, things take a very long time and use lots and lots of system resources. I got a very nice scan of an 8x10 print, but I could not get slide scans to work with digital ICE; the software crashed consistently. I am known for my patience, but it quickly became clear that this product was released before it was ready.

This would be sort of bad if the G4050 was an older product not found on stores shelves, but it is HP's current model being sold at my local Staples today!Also, the other issue I had with it, when I was still using Vista, was the area on the scanner where the scanner glass meets the plastic bevel. It isn't flat. The plastic is a good 1/8 of an inch higher than the glass. So when I scan a book page with a large photo that comes close to the edge, the plastic bevel lifts the rest of the book page off the glass, causing a noticeable shadow and distortion in the scan.If the surface was completely flat, then the book page would lay flat.Included software seems dated.

After several painful hours with tech support (which is only open during the day, weekdays, for scanners) I finally demanded a replacement unit. They only replaced the bottom half and although that seemed to fix the problem, a couple weeks later it started doing the same thing.Now to just make sure it was the scanner, the scanning software is installed on two different Vista machines and one XP Pro machine, same problem on all three.

The idea of being able to batch scan 16 slides is the reason I bought this scanner, unfortunately it does a very poor job even one at a time. The results were grainy, banded, and lacked detail depending on the settings I used. I tried technical support but received very poor support on HP chat, the rep even forgot what we were talking about and started asking about the documents I was scanning.So if you are looking for a decent slide scanner this is not one to even try unless you just want to make small prints (fair 4 x 6 or less prints could be done with some Photoshop work on them)."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck - cumbersome","review":"the scanner was purchased mainly to digitize boxes worth of 35mm photos. The picture quality is lousy - the dust removal option in the HP software helps a little, but I have to spend a ton of time in Photoshop cleaning up each image. Secondly, it's horrible at differentiating between a photo and blank space. When I put multiple photos on the scanner bed, it rarely gets it right. Again, I have to spend a lot of time manually selecting the photos. When I was shopping for scanners - I skipped over the $100 range and went to the $200 range because my family photos are important to me.

The product was advertised as being able to scan multiple slides/negatives, but the needed templates were not included. The software was also not included. I spoke with the seller and was very pleased with their quick response. They were extremely nice and told me to return the product for a full refund. I would have been willing to keep it if I could have obtained some templates for the slide/negative scans, but was unable to locate any.While it was very inconvenient for me I was very pleased with the seller's response to the problem and would shop with that seller again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Paper Weight","review":"This Scanner is a pile of #%$@!.

They are uniformly difficult to use, with very bad software. I've needed to reinstall the scanjet software over a dozen times. Every time I use the scanner, it is a different nightmare (software components missing that need to be reinstalled, interactions with other software, the scanner doesn't respond). My HP printers are also garbage. I would never buy anything from HP again. They make junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"scan","review":"WORKS GREAT. I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS. DOES EVERYTHING I WONTED IT TO.

Color rendition is excellent. I'm likely to upgrade to the Cannon 8800F since my main reason for getting this unit was to scan 1000+ slides and I'm not happy with the quality of the slide scans when compared to other options that I've tried. The best scans I've seen come from a Nikon film scanner, but, unfortunately it does not work under vista, takes only one slide at a time and takes over 5 minutes per scan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, sketchy slide performance","review":"I tried to install on my XP box, install went very wrong even though I followed the instruction explicitly. Tried to uninstall and it would not go away. Even when I booted into safe mode it would not uninstall. I was ready send this back. I finally did a clean install of Vista Ultimate and the install went as it should have. It scans slides OKAY only, nothing to hoot about, but I do recommend you scan to TIFF not JPEG, as the results are much better. The dust removal is worthless, get a good brush and a Q Tip. I'm scanning slides that are over 50 years old that my father took, and the good part is it does 16 at a time. It does remember the settings if you tell it too, and if you scan at over 600 DPI it is really slow and heaven forbid you try and use the 6 color option, start the scan and come back tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"G4050 Poor Vista Compatibility","review":"I bought this scanner for a local Historical Society so they could scan 16 slides at a time. I downloaded the \\"Full Feature\\" software for Vista and the scanner would not recognize the TMA adapter (the slide/negative scanner) no matter what I did. It did not even show up as a option in the Scanning features. I called the wonderful HP Tech Support number and got the infamous poor-English speaking Indian, that could only follow a checklist. After finally telling him to forget the checklist I asked him flat out if this was fully compatible with Vista, he said NO, but it will work sometimes on some systems. That was the end of my adventure with this scanner and got an RMA from Amazon to send it back. I'm off to buy Canon 8600 scanner WHICH is fully compatible with Vista. Do not buy this scanner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HP Scanjet","review":"I have just gone through one of the worst experiences with a product company ever, and that's saying a lot. After several months of trying to get the ScanJet to work with Vista the service rep announced .. \\"sorry you are out of warranty!\\" I reminded her that the manual said one year from date of purchase and that HP could repair or replace with comparable product and she said she would get back to me. Guess what HP has not responded since. The box the scanner came with clearly stated Vista compliant so I am of the opinion that their product is not only defective but that HP is utilizing deceptive advertising. Such a sad development for what I have always held as a quality company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk From The Get Go","review":"This scanner threw a lamp error right out the box. After a little coaxing, I managed to get it to make a single 600 dpi scan that lasted about 4 minutes, possibly longer. I loaded the next photos and it threw the error again and continued doing so until I jammed it back into the box for it's ride back to the store. Of course, included is the CD full of useless HP software that gets installed when you install the scan application. Who knows what you need and don't need? HP sucks and the only reason I bought it was because the store was out of the Canon scanner that I was looking for when I walked in. Look into the Epson or Canon line of scanners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill Baker's scanner review.","review":"The unit arrived in good time and condition.I intend to use it to digitize old photos and slides.I was pleased that it was able to handle lots of slides and 35mm negs at one time but surprised that a full scan took so long even at a modest pictel rate.I am still working to try to understand the software and cataloging procedures. It would have been nice to have had better guidance on how it should be used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Scanner","review":"The scanner meets my full needs. Scans and allows me to save the documents for later use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchased elsewhere after damaged shipment","review":"Unfortunately the HP 4050 purchased through Amazon was damaged in shipment. Processing of refund was smooth, but slow because of UPS intermediate process. Rather than try another shipment I went to a local source and found that they had the 4050 on closeout. So I got it for $50 less than it would have been through the Amazon source.The scanner itself seems to work as advertised. Instructions and manuals are very sketchy, but I have been able to muddle through. Sometimes cold restarts are required if false starts or changes are made during process. Processing of 16 slides at a time is slow, especially if multiple processes such as cleanup and color correction are requested. But the time it takes to catalog and add metadata for the images is similar to the processing time, so can go on concurrently for the previous set and no time is 'lost'.I didn't need the HP photo storage and organizing software automatically provided."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this scanner","review":"I bought this to scan artwork. I have been making high resolution scans of original art for 15 years and I think this scanner is amazing. It IS noisy and slow, but I could care less about that.

I have been scanning slides and it is extremely efficient at this task. The software is good and works very easily. Good buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, kept giving errors, big/heavy","review":"The main problem with this scanner was the fact that I was trying to scan old slides with it. However after about five minutes of scanning it would throw an error and tell me to restart the computer. The software included is not so great. The scanner itself is very slow and it wouldn't let me scan at full resolution because of a 2gb size limit. Bottom line...it's being returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"HP Scanner Problems","review":"I received the scanner in a timely manner, in good condition. The software was easy to use and hookup instructions simple and clear. Unfortunately, the scanner would not work. After following the \\"problem\\" guidelines, I finally called in a professional computer tech. After three hours, we gave up and the scanner was returned. The company was very helpful with the return. No idea why it didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not User Friendly","review":"The scanner was bought new from HP and is not user friendly. The directions tell you to take off a part of the scanner in order to scan slides - You take that part off and the scanner keeps telling you it is still on the scanner.You scan photos and have to keep rescanning since it decides what part of a picture to scan - I have tried to scan a photo but it picks only certain part of the photo to scan.I have had to keep rescanning some pics since the scanner does NOT use the entire bed of the scanner. It only uses a portion.If I could give the review a negative number I would - Now I am trying to get the box back together in order to return the scanner to HP."},{"rating":"1","title":"D.O.A. -returning ASAP.","review":"It scanned documents fine, but when scanning film, it made a mechanical clicking noise like it was grinding some plastic gears. It did this just after the preview scan, and also during the actual scan, a few times per scan.I chatted with an HP support guy who walked me through some diagnostics and a test of the lid, and we confirmed it had an issue.I'm using Windows XP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Document Scanning","review":"I bought the HP Scanjet G4050 as a replacement for my HP4370 Scanjet, which I had worn out after 2 years of heavy use scanning in books and documents. Most of the reviews did not relate to my primary application, which is scanning text into MS-Word documents.I have been using the G4050 now for about a month, and am extremely pleased with the results. The software works pretty much the same as what I was already used to. And so far as speed (something criticized by some of the other reviewers), I find the speed more than adequate, being two to four times faster than my old scanner.This is a quality product, and the few pictures that I have scanned also come out nicely. I recommend the HP-G4050 to any who have a need for high-volume photo or document scanning."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for scanning old slides","review":"My primary reason for purchasing this scanner was to scan 100s of old slides from slide shows to use in Powerpoint presentations. Many of the photos have been published. I had been using a Nikon CoolScan 4000, which is very slow and labor intensive and which has trouble getting the slides in focus. With the HP Scanjet G4050, using the template, I can scan 16 slides at a time with excellent results, having to rescan maybe 1 in 50 slides. I scanned the first 400 slides in 2 days, along with getting ready to leave for 3 weeks for the trip in which I planned to use them. I wish I had bought this product a long time ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok for scanning prints, terrible for slides","review":"I bought this scanner to scan slides. The 16 slide tray was great, but that is the only good thing I have to say about this scanner. The software is terrible, hard to use, doesn't remember settings, with some settings reverting back to default settings even while running. Scans of anything even slightly dark result in very visible noise. If you have the dust removal feature turned on, the noise gives it fits. Scanning bright colorful slides, or bright prints seems to work ok, but there's a lot cheaper printers that can do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disapoointed","review":"This scanner is OK for amateur photographers but does not provide the tools to scan negatives for fine photographic work, The software is sloppy and the HP on-line help is pathetic.

More absurdly, people now think of him as \\"the guy who opened Woodstock.\\"But back in their time, these were important for kids into folk rock, expecially African American one's who connected to the genre through Richie, and were regulars if not staples on early FM radio.There is no good reason all his albums from 1967-72 should not be in print."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful on the Wife","review":"I purchased this pendant, along with matching earings, several years ago.

It lacks any kind of insight or depth into the main character's thoughts and emotions; none of it rings true.

I love the plantronics, with a comfortable intuitive fit, that is well designed with acceptable sound quality. This, on the other hand, is a fumbled design. For the life of me, I don't understand how this is even remotely supposed to function as an earpiece.

I taped the ear piece back together but I can't hear a damn thing. I'm not sure if it is b/c of the ear piece being broken or if it is poor quality. I would not try this product again. I looked at newer versions from the same company but they all look poorly made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broken","review":"I received this headset on January 25th and was very pleased with it, as I have always liked Jabra products. Two days ago I went to put it on and the ear piece was broke in two. Before that, I noticed it felt odd when I was trying to get it around my ear. I have another (older) Jabra headset (which I have never had a problem with)and I noticed that the rubber around the ear piece on the older one is much softer than this one. I believe that is why it broke because it is so brittle. Not sure if it is old or what the case is. I am returning the item asap. Don't know if I will order another one from the seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too cheap to return","review":"I found the unit hard to position comfortably, but that didn't really matter since it broke in the first twenty minutes of use. Broke meaning that the earpiece stopped producing sound at all. Based on the 170+ reviews out there, most of them quite positive, this might well be a great product and I simply got a bad unit.

They're fine if you can reconcile yourself to having to replace them periodically.Last time I bought multiples and the last one just died. There don't appear to be any particularly high quality, over/under the ear wired cell phone headsets out there, but I decided it was time to try something else.The plantronics unit costs more and got generally more favorable reviews, although they seem to crap out periodically, too.

Jabra headsets are very comfortable and easy to wear all day. Reasonably easy to put on with one hand once you get the hang of it.

I was delighted when I first got it because it seemed to be able to pick up my voice even though the little microphone arm doesn't even reach halfway down my cheek, but apparently I was loud in my excitement, because every conversation that followed using this device went something like \\"What?\\" \\"What?\\" \\"I didn't hear you, what did you say?\\" \\"Huh?\\" It looks kinda cool, but it's actually sized for a rather large ear and gives me two headaches: one from having to force it into my ear canal and the other from the gentle buzzing hum that you hear whenever it's in.

Since I had trouble finding an earpiece that fit comfortably before, I decided to purchase the same model again as a replacement.Unfortunately the new Jabra C250 I received from Amazon about a week ago is not of the same quality. Even with the volume turned all the way up, I can barely hear the other person. The sound quality is also not as sharp.

After an inauspicous debut for Stephen Wyatt with \\"Paradise Towers\\", \\"Greatest...\\" is like Hamlet! One of the most psychadelic Who stories since \\"The Claws of Axos\\". Everyone involved is in fine form, even with the production nightmare. The last two seasons of Who are filled with layers of intrigue and mystery, something lacking in the program since the Hartnell and Troughton eras. Some might say that this adventure is a metaphor of the production, the fans and the program's adversaries(such as Star Trek, the executives of the BBC, ect).

The director, Peter Ubute took the brave step of including interprative dance routines in place of a normal narrative in certain scenes. Thus the Doctor and his companion tie each other up in black ribbons as a metaphor for their fear of the unknown, and all the villains that feature dress in white to symbolise deceit and cunning.

From the moment the rapping ringmaster cracks his whip and starts to gyrate to the corny rapping beat you know this is going to be a pretty bad episode. The character names are ridiculous... Pig Pen, Kingpin, and Flower Child. The particulars of the plot are annoying... people going out to perform for the Gods of Ragnorock. We've got a corny, nerdy fan boy, an effete English explorer, and a Werewolf with all the scariness of a member of ths cast of Cats. How could even the most talented actor do a good job pulling off a story with names, costumes, and dialogue like this! There's also a scene where the doctor performs vaudeville style which just doesn't work on TV. The decline of Dr. Who was not Sylvester Mckoy&#65533;s fault however.

A shame that many who had seen this and others by McCoy apparently didn't see the adventures of the first six Doctors and how it used to be done. Strangely enough, the actoing was alright but the plot was lame. If you want to buy or rent a McCoy adventure, I'd recommend \\"Remembrance of the Daleks or \\"The Happiness Patrol\\", the only two bright spots of the McCoy era which harken back to the days of the show when it was far more popular and had much higher ratings."},{"rating":"1","title":"not one of the better ones","review":"Sorry to say but this episode is certainly not one of the better Doctor Who stories, in fact I would place it in the bottom 10%.

If you know pretty much nothing about the subject, it's okay. But the author's schemata is not standard practice. One of the other reviewers noted that the book doesnt address the realities of the criminal justice system, and theyre correct. Criminal Justice is not CSI or LAW & ORDER. It's more like Kabuki Theatre, where the players act-out rigid roles and the truth be damned. I'm thinking of a local event where the victim phones 911 when a rapist comes into her home, the police refuse to even search the residence when they respond, and after she's raped the detective insists she made the whole thing up.

It introduced a whole era of cross dressers. You will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"And the Oscar for Best Actor *should have gone to*","review":"Although he has won plenty of acclaim--including two other Leading Actor Oscars and five Golden Globes--Dustin Hoffman was never better than he was as Michael Dorsey/Dorothy Michaels. (He was equally good in a very different role as Raymond Babbitt inRain Man.) Playing an actor (or actress!) who is playing another role is never easy, yet he handles the multiple layers brilliantly. The scenes between Hoffman and Sydney Pollack (who also directed) are the best part of the film, probably due in large part to their very real off-camera arguments. This film also boasts the right amount of Bill Murray (not too much!), allowing him to make the most of his scenes. Jessica Lange won Best Supporting Actress for what was in my opinion a fairly shallow role (Teri Garr deserved it more!), and yet Tootsie lost out on EVERY other Oscar that year, mostly to Ghandi and E.T.Minus one star for the soundtrack which was awful at the time and has aged no better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tootsie never gets old","review":"I saw this movie when it came out in the 80s and loved it.

Very few movies filmed in the 80's have ever appealed to me. So after watching Tootsie, I was glad that I had found one comedy made in the 80's that does not suck. In fact, it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Dustin Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey, an unemployed actor who pretends to be a woman in order to get a job on a soap opera, and raise enough money to produce his roomate's new play. Bill Murray plays his roomate, and is very funny in this role, one of the funniest I've seen him in actually.

In order to find work and fund his friend's play he dresses as a woman, Dorothy Michaels, and lands the part in a daytime drama. Dorsey loses himself in this woman role and essentially becomes Dorothy Michaels, captivating women all around the city and inspiring them to break free from the control of men and become more like Dorsey's initial identity. This newfound role, however, lands Dorsey in a hot spot between a female friend/lover, a female co-star he falls in love with, that co-star's father who falls in love with him, and a male co-star who yearns for his affection. Dustin Hoffman is pure genius in this movie. \\"Tootsie\\" is a small masterpiece of intelligent comedy, full of emotions, love and interesting observations about the relationship between women and men."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Best","review":"When I saw this movie for the first time, I was visitng my brother in Syracuse, NY.

I love how he grows and learns about himself and the opposite sex by becoming Dorothy.

So why is the DVD release a bare-bones one with only chapter selection, trailer and printed cast bios the only bonus features? Then again it's not now generally available, which probably means an anniversary edition is in the offing and I've wasted my money buying the currently almost-available version.

An excellent supporting cast helps as well, and in fact, all the elements came together for the production team on this project. If you missed it, make a point of remedying that gap in your knowledge of successful movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Classic!!!!!","review":"All I can say is Watch this movie!!!

I will buy as often as I can! Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal movie! One further correction to previous review.","review":"Very little to add. One of the funniest movies ever made. Moreover, the movie is far more than just funny - it also explores very worthwhile aspects of gender politics and taboos, and the script is extremely well written and believable (there are no false lines). Outstanding acting all around, although Dustin Hoffman (one of the premier actors of the 20th and 21st centuries, in the opinion of this reviewer) clearly steals the show in perhaps his greatest, least typical role. In almost any other year, Hoffman would have won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal, and the movie itself would have won the Best Picture Oscar. Unfortunately, it was 1982, and Hoffman and \\"Tootsie\\" were up against Ben Kingsley and \\"Gandhi\\".Also, one final correction to a previous review - Teri Garr actually played the confused (actually, misled) girlfriend of Dustin Hoffman's male character, not Jessica Lange."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, hilarious, that's what one reviewer is saying about this film!","review":"I rate \\"Tootsie\\" 5 stars because it's humorous, the music is uplifting and the acting is superb!\\"Tootsie\\" is about an out-of-work actor played by Dustin Hoffman, who decides that women have it easier when getting movie parts, so he concocts a scheme unbeknowst to his agent. The scheme consists of Dustin Hoffman dressing up as an older woman, who auditions for a soap. Fortunately, for him he gets the soap and that's just the beginning...I highly recommend this 80's film for anyone who is either a Dustin Hoffman fan, or who likes a light-hearted comedy with an interesting twist to it!Rent or buy it--you'll be glad you did, I was!*(Recommended for ages 18+ above due to adult themes)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still love Tootsie!","review":"Last saw this film many years ago. After I ordered it from Amazon it came quickly and was very well priced. Film is just as funny as the last time I watched it.

Now I can watch them over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic Series","review":"All Creatures are a great series of books, and the TV series was a fantastic adaptation. I first saw these on TV in England when I was a kid. Now with 3 kids of my own it has been great to introduce them to my own children. We bought series one and my 11 and 9 year olds were really eager to see series two. For those people who want great family entertainment which showcases lots of countryside, animals, unusual characters and situation comedy with no swearing, sex or innuendo, then you should view All Creatures.Series 2 is probably better than series 1 as the characters are all developed. The acting is superb, especially Robert Hardy, who is by far the most accomplished actor as Siegried. Peter Davison, as Tristan is the comedian of the group.If you haven't seen All Creatures, buy Series 1 first then get series 2. If you have seen series 1, then order series 2 now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Set My Friends Lined Up to Borrow","review":"This second set of All Creatures Great and Small videos is wonderful, just like the frist.

Building beautifully on the opener, James and Helen grow into the practice, Tristan comes of age, and Siegfried keeps everything humming with his feverish energy.

Please Amazon, where's #3?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Gift","review":"My wife fell in love with this series through an English friend. It evokes feelings of living the simple life by simple means, where relationships and life have meaning. Great family viewing with tradition, manners, and well-spoken English."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best !!","review":"It is hard to write a review of such an outstanding series. The usual accolades, funny,charming,heart warming, doesnt seem to do it justice. One of the things that impressed me most about this series is how authentic it seemed. No effort was spared to re-create the era before World War II. I was, however, deeply disappointed when Carol Drinkwater who played Helen, left the series later. Most reviews of this series fail to mention the characters of the dales, they are all outstanding. Although I have watched most all these episodes several times I am still entertained by these glorious stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Karen Fan of British Tv","review":"I remember watching this on public Tv and really enjoyed the series. I wonder if this is the same Robert Hardy who in the 1050's starred in the eposodes of the Tv show The Adventures of Lancelot? It must be unless unlike in the US actors can have the same first and last names. If not then it must be him. And of course Peter Davidson as so many of us know will be the Fifth Doctor in the Doctor Who Si-Fi show. Anyway I recommend this series to others. It's a nice cosy TV series. The way the brothers though of course have their differences really do like each other. So if you decide to buy this, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"For James Herriot fans","review":"After finally reading James Herriot's books, I was delighted to discover his stories on DVD. Watching these wonderful episodes transports me to the Scottish countryside and the life of a country vet. Beautiful scenery and unforgettable characters make for relaxing entertainment. The films are old so for those who prefer high def these might be a disappointment. Otherwise, enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite, all around, thumbs-up !","review":"Not enough good things can be said about the remarkable story lines, acting, or scenery. I always feel like I'm sitting in a comfy chair enjoying a good book, whenever I watch an episode. Not very easy trying to choose a favorite character from the series. All of them for sure, but I'd gladly \\"do lunch\\" any day at Skeldale House with that old, crusty, warm-hearted, housekeeper ... Mrs. Hall ! But still, there's Siegfried, James, Tris', Helen, & on & on & on to consider. Charming friends all !My rough guess would be at least 2009, before all the episodes have finally been made available ! Apparently, 1 full season is released every 2 years (1st season in '97, 2nd in '99}. Since there are 5 more seasons (60 episodes), PLUS 3, hour & 1/2 holiday-specials, it'll be a while till I can say I own all 90 episodes & specials."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Creatures Great & Small Series 1 & 2","review":"I have looked at both series over and over. Please, please hurry and produce the next volume of programmes. Definitely the best television series I have ever seen.

One never tires of seeing them, I will keep checking with Amazon.com for Series 3, 4 and so on until I have exhausted the programmes produced. Hurry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, does take a while to get the hang of it.","review":"I can not recommend this book highly enough. There are some shortcomings but they are minor. I started using this book a about four years ago after recovering from a Achilles tendon tear. By following the core stretches and those for the lower legs and ankles I have been able to run again basically injury free. (as much as any one in there late 40's can do). I do wish the illustrations were a bit better laid out as other reviewers have mentioned and the routines take longer than the authors admit in the book especially in the beginning. However the results make any shortcomings worth it. I recommend this book often to friends and fellow runners. This is a valuable resource and its only $12! You can pay more for a pair of fancy socks these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is always a but...","review":"I gave the book four stars because, for the price, it's got a lot of good information and stretches. The flexibility assessment, while long, is interesting to see where problems are. I always thought my hamstrings were too tight; turns out it's actually my calves.However, the stretches can be confusing, and I didn't realize at first that I was doing one of them completely wrong.Also, the book claims that you can do a complete routine in 20 minutes. I don't know how they do it, but it takes me over an hour to do all 59 stretches. 2 s (stretch) + 1 s (rest) * 10 reps * 59 exercises = ~30 minutes, plus some of the exercises are both sides, plus time to change position, etc...so maybe after I had all the exercises memorized I could get it down to 45 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"I tried Active Isolated stretching just for 2 weeks and I already noticed the difference. Just after two weeks (stretching every day) I was more flexible than ever before. I'll let the experts argue on what's the best way to stretch but I'm going to use AI stretching because 1) I enjoy doing it more than static stretching 2) It gives me better results than static stretching. The bottomline is that it works for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor diagrams and unrealistic time demands","review":"This book was a complete waste of money. About a third of the stretches I had to go over the instructions several times because of the poor directions and diagrams. I spent more time trying to figure out the stretches than doing them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bible of health and happiness","review":"I kid you not. I'm a pretty athelitic guy but have always suffered from excessive aches and pain. Now I'm 40 my lower back and left hip aches especially. I've tried streching before and the monotomy has never been worth while. Whartons' technique is different. Not only is intersting it actually works!!! BUY IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My body bible","review":"This book is so valuable to me, that I won't loan it out. It's place is right by my bed, along with my muscles flip chart that I got from massage therapy school. Between my very active self, family, and friends, these stretching techniques are priceless. I have turned the worst skeptics into stretching advocates.Complaints about the ilustrations and copy-cat techniques -- lame and lame. If you can't understand the movements from the pictures, enroll yourself into a class for hands-on lessons. And whether the techniques are copy-catted or not -- who cares? They work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift worth giving again and again","review":"I first purchased this book in the spring of 1998 a few weeks before I ran the Boston Marathon. Suffering from severe sciatica, part of problem was flexibility, but what I was trying was not helping. Saw chiropractors, doctors, physical therapists, no relief. A friend who was a podiatrist suggested this book, met the Whartons at the Boston expo. The programs in the book especially directed towards hamstrings, spine and legs generally helped me somewhat immediately, within 7 weeks, had extended my range of motion significantly and my sciatica was gone.Since then, I have been a strong evangelist for this book....because the information in it works. This most recent purchase was a gift for the daughters of a friend. They are active high school athletes and are at risk to injury from their many activities. This book was a way to help them and get the knowledge into younger minds. I have given many others this book as a gift.I still refer to my original copy regularly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wharton's Stretch Book","review":"This book was recommended to me by a professional massage therapist. I'm 65 and on statins, which have the side effect of muscle stiffness and soreness. This book provides an easy to understand and follow guideline for stretching, which although focused on athletes, works well for the average Joe or Jane. The underlying premise, that gentle, progressive stretches lasting no more than a few seconds don't activate muscle resistance, is spun out in detail for each muscle group. There are useful illustrations and clear descriptions. What's best, though, is that it works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Results May Vary...","review":"While I am very careful to avoid discomfort and injury when learning a physical activity from a book, this book was so difficult for me to follow that I ended up experiencing pain after my first session. Not only that, but this session was only meant to familiarize myself with the stretches and assess my flexibility!! Luckily I could sense the problems well enough to stop after about 8 of the stretches. The only way I will attempt this method in the future is with instruction and close supervision by a qualified person. As others have pointed out, maybe there are better AIS books to learn from, but after this experience, I am extremely skeptical to try with ANY book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend this book !","review":"I had lost some flexibility because of injury. I bought this book because of the recommendation of the other readers. I don't have very much time to stretch so I did the exercises for the trunk only twice a week. Within a couple of weeks, I had regained and surpassed my previous flexibility.This method gets better results than the traditional slow stretching exercises. It is also far easier when you don't struggle to maintain the stretch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of limited use","review":"Took a few exercises out of it for my core routine (I am a runner and need to do core exercises).But it is not a complete book of exercises you need to do as a runner; too narrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this book and buy the original by Aaron Mattes","review":"Skip this book and choose \\"Specific Stretching for Everyone\\" or \\"Active Isolated Stretching--The Mattes Method\\" by Aaron Mattes, the guy who first developed these techniques. His site at http://www.stretchingusa.com has more info on these stretches.The exercises and the narrative descriptions in the Wharton book are copied almost verbatim from Mattes' original book--nothing new or helpful is added other than some self-promoting anecdotes about athletic successes--and Mattes' original book has clear and helpful photographs, unlike the amateurish and confusing line drawings in the Wharton book. Mattes' book also includes detailed stretching routines for upper/lower body, neck/shoulders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desperately needs revision","review":"Here is what is wrong with this book:It needs about 4 times the amount of illustrations. There should be three or four of each stretch showing it from different angles. It would also be helpful to highlight which muscles one is supposed to be stretching, and which ones one is supposed to be contracting. Since I didn't major in anatomy, I had to use google to figure out what I was supposed to be doing. I'm betting most people who buy this book will not have as much perserverence as I had.After trying the stretches for about 2 weeks, I didn't see much improvement. Then I caught a Youtube of the Dana Torres DVD. I tried the stretch as shown. It was challenging, but the instruction was clear. And better yet, I immediately did the deepest forward bend I've ever done.I ordered the DVD and gave the Wharton book away. I only wish I hadn't squandered my time and money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for injuries","review":"Although the book provides some good ideas for stretching, I found the shortened stretching to be almost ballistic in nature. The exercises really aggravated some old sports injuries after several weeks of following the routine. Also, the routine is long; don't believe the authors when they tell you 20 minutes to complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good book.","review":"I thought this book was put together very poorly. I have been lifting weights for about 9 months and am looking to add some stretching to my routine. The thing that attracted me to this book was the quantity of stretches it presented. I also think that the program, in theory, makes sense. That brings me to the issues I have with this book.The stretches were poorly illustrated and described. Stretches that require any sort of 3d movement were especially difficult to decipher. The learning curve for this program, in my opinion, is to big for beginners. I also don't see how this program could be completed in 20 minutes. This book could have potential if the section describing the stretches was completely redone. Then at least it would be useful as an encyclopedia of stretches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor illustrations make book almost unusable","review":"The pencil drawings are terrible. In the pictures requiring you to bend your knees, it's almost impossible to tell whether to bend the knee toward the chest, at a right angle from the body, etc. The text doesn't help clarify matters in most cases, and besides, if I'm actually doing the stretches, I don't want to take the time to read the wordy descriptions.The \\"sports-specific\\" section is anything but. For the most part, they instruct you do to all the stretches, maybe in varying order. Far too time consuming for most people.Finally, I found it quite difficult in some cases to \\"contract the opposite muscle\\" to make the stretch effective. And in any case, I find that focusing on the opposite muscle contracting takes the enjoyment out of feeling the stretch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giving credit where credit is due","review":"Although I think the Wharton's are knowledgable and write a user friendly book, they did not invent Active Isolated Stretching. They studied with the man who did invent it, Aaron Mattes. I like their books and even their video, but there is no excuse for not giving credit where credit is due. Be honest guys and do the right thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannibalism has never been so tasty...","review":"I laughed, I screamed, I was enetertained. I really liked this movie. Didn't know what it was about when I rented it, but I figure I should watch it. The movie takes place in the 1800s after the american/mexican war, and it's about cannibals. That's all you need to know really. I'm afraid I may spoil some good plot points."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sure Classic!","review":"I first rented this film with a group of friends. The box described it as a cross between The Thing and another horror film. But, when after watching it, we were very disappointed. The music was very strange, the film a little gross, seemed that it was a straight to video release.Then, I managed to get hold of the soundtrack which I now think is very good, although weird too! (4 stars).So, seeing Ravenous for 12, I bought it (perhaps too much money to spend) but watching it the second time around I really began to appreciate the film.Definately not for everyone, but the film has a lot of good elements in it. Horror and comedy are just two. (Especially the naming of the stew!!)I'd certainly recommend this film to anyone with an eye for non-mainstream market.

I love gore, blood and anything left to the imagination. With a movie, such as \\"ravenous\\", I found it to be incredibly insane and stupid to base a movie on humans eating humans for supremacy and power. This movie is not based on humans eating humans for survivial, it is humans eating humans for the sheer pleasure of it. I am disgusted that any human being could direct and produce such a horrible movie. My advice, if you are a sicko, a real sicko, and love to watch humans eating their own species then this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"He Licked Me?","review":"What do you expect from a movie whose best line is \\"He licked me!\\"?

But sadly, bad acting and a stupid screenplay ruined what could have been a great horror movie. David Arquette also ruined it with his appearance as well.

The villain should've just been a vampire instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, haunting and funny","review":"A gem of a movie, as disturbing and gorgeous as it is sly and biting(ahem, excuse the pun). Wonderfully acted, it was a pleasure to see such a marvelous ensemble of little known but highly talented actors. I was particularly pleased to see Jeffery Jones in a different role, and Guy Pearce is good in anything. The writing is strong and intelligent and I was surprised to realize it was funny as well in a wry, dark sort of way. And the blood. Blood, blood and more blood, it's definately one of the more hardcore horror movies I've watched, and certainly the only directed by a women, Antonia Bird who does a magnificent job. Not for all tastes(pun again), but certainly worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie Destined to be a Cult Classic!","review":"How can anyone turn away from a movie about cannibalism gone awry? Ok, I guess a lot. But this isn't one of those typical of the genre. In fact I'd say that this movie defies being categorized into any specific genre. Funny, Gross, Disturbing, Thought Provoking. Every one of those terms comes to mind when I think of this movie. The cast is superb (especially Robert Carlisle) and the whole story line plays out like an excerpt from one of the old E.C. comics. Yeh, it's over the top. Sure, it's excessive in the depiction of gore. But come on, enjoy it! After all, it's just a movie. I mean no one ever really resorted to cannibalism out on America's western frontier. Also to note the films big mistake is that it compares the Native American legend of The Wendigo to vampires. Not so."},{"rating":"1","title":"The other red meat...","review":"Curious film. More different then entertainng. Passable direction, but not particullarly stylish or artful. Opportunities to make an audience tense, or shocked, were not taken advantage of. Things just happen, without the enjoyable rollercoaster ride of tension and release. Some good actors, doing a decent job. Scenery in the mountains during winter was enjoyable. Soundtrack is an example of inept composition, and didn't seem to fit what was occuring on the screen either. Composing music in general, and composing music to heighten the effect of a film story, are two different things. A one time watch curiosity, at best. If you enjoyed this film, may I suggest \\"Brotherhood of the Wolf\\"...a much superior French film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MASTERPIECE ? !","review":"Well, if this one is a master-piece, I'll start to write my own screenplays from now on ...

If you have a desire to see typical Hollywood wanna be horror/action with goofy subject matter, then this is for you. . . otherwise steer clear.

I had to force myself to sit through it. By the end of the film I felt really nauseous. I've have not been able to eat red meat since viewing this film.

But I never expected GUy Pearce being in this garbage. Carlyle has come to stay, he's really a great British actor. BUt this history is horrible, trivial, bad taste all over the place, unconvincing. I like horror movies, but this is so ridiculous it made me laugh. If it only had stayed with the characters acquiring the taste of human flesh and liking it, fine.

It is really a trap. One of the men escapes the mad man from in the mountains. He arrives and those who did not die are now cannibals.

It is still and very enjoyable and enteraining movie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ravenous is a Worthwhile Watch","review":"Ravenous is a film with a stupendous cast that does its' job, and does it well. Guy Pearce, Robert Carlyle, and Jeffrey Jones are all in top form here, bringing these characters to life. The score is excellent, a creepy mix brewed up by Michael Nyman and Damon Albarn. I've heard people say there are errors with the weendigo myth and how it is presented, but it's not covered in depth, just take it and run with it. Pearce plays the coward Capt. John Boyd, and he is excellent as usual. Carlyle as the cannibal Ives is creepy, and Jones offers up his usual humor with his character whose name slips me. I am writing this \\"review\\" many years after this film has been released. My suggestion: watch it. You won't forget it, no matter your opinion on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"TWISTED!!","review":"This movie was real interesting and different than anything i've ever seen in my life! The acting was great and I loved the score, the eerie music set the mood at all times, specially in the wilderness. I thought Carlyle did a great job along w/the other actors. The only thing that kept me from giving it a 5 was that it took too long to engage the viewer into the action but otherwise it's a good movie. Go rent it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Movie!!!

Oh yes, and blood and guts as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo to a little gem!","review":"Despite hating gory/violent movies (and boy did this movie push the limits), I was willing to see it - anything with Guy Pearce, a wonderful and understated actor who excels quirky and introspective roles. Dismiss the hype about the gore and what's still remaining is a great storyline with wonderful characters. This is a movie full of twists and turns. Was it comedy?

Just don't watch it at like 3am in the dark by yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious feast of a movie","review":"Laced with absurd moments and cheap thrills, ravenous is one of the most funny movies of recent times.. Not to be taken too seriously, this story of cannibalism is so very odd.. you can't help but enjoy it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here There Be Cannibals...","review":"Ravenous brings to the screen the story of a Mexican-American war hero who is transferred to Fort Spencer in a remote area of California. Things get a bit more complicated when a visitor arrives informing the small garrison of cannibals in the vicinity...In short, the acting is above average (but nothing great), the dialogues are rather poor, while the setting and the plot are pretty good!A cross between Hannibal Lector and Dances with Wolves, the film combines horror, drama, action, and adventure making it rather enjoyable, as long as you're in that kind of a mood. 3 1/2 Stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for Guy Pearce and 1 star for Robert Carlyle","review":"I am a big fan of both Pearce and Carlyle and thought they were both very good in this disgusting movie. I didn't even want to rent it. or see it in the theater...why would i want to watch a movie about cannibals? my husband was the one who picked this one.. i would never take that responsibility. The whole premise of this movie is disturbing, and i don't think that eating human flesh could make one anymore virile than chicken or steak. (robert carlyle said something like that). this was a sick film, althought the ending was a fitting one. better off watching l.a. confidential or Full monty if you want to see a good film with both these fine actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"UPCs and Cases heavily destroyed","review":"Don't buy this item from amazon.com. They are not brand new. The UPC bar code region (the plastic wrapping of the DVD case, the cover of the case, and the case itself) of BOTH DVDs are heavily destroyed by an inch long deep cut. Amazon.com is nice to send me a replacement by 1-day delivery, however the replacement still has the same problem. I wonder perhaps all Amazon.com's stock of this 2-disc package are like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raving Lunatics more like it...","review":"Ravenous plays like vampire movie, offering more supernatural guidelines than I expected. If Dances with Wolves crossed paths with Hannibal Lecter and Bela Lugosi, you would get this amusing, though rather convulted story involving the members of a remote mountain outpost in the Sierras. It was offbeat, bloody, and tasteless, somethings I generally admire in a film. But this movie falls short for some reason. I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe it just doesn't have enough bite."},{"rating":"1","title":"primitive cannabilistic vampires of 1846","review":"this movie has a good plot, but i recommend this film to older adults (ages:25 and up)the movie has alot of blood scenes. this movie is about a primitive cannabalistic vampire who is out to hunt for food(humans)the movie has okay action,it has suspense. Guy Pierce is the main guy in the movie and he plays a U.S. Army Captain. The movie could have used more fight and gun attack scenes, but it is good. The ending of the film is not the typical way a movie should end especially for the protagonist, but you have to get the big picture why it happens. Recommended it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Cult Classic","review":"A masterpiece that eludes classification. Its genre is a hodge-podge mixture of horror, western, period, comedy, thriller. It's a man's journey to find courage. It's a disection and exploration of humanity's darkest side. And it's shockingly funny in both dialogue and the unexpected. Its last scene is haunting, gruesome, and will leave a bad taste in your mouth, underscored by a hypnotic soundtrack that will only enhance the unwholesome atomsphere. You desperately want a bath after this thing is over and a plate of fresh vegetables ... and you won't know who to trust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychologically Thrilling","review":"I found Ravenous a great thriller. It really did not hype so much on the gore, but on the mental anguish of Boyd and his coming to terms with what was happening to his surroundings. Robert Carlyle gave me chills with his brilliant performance. Everytime he was on screen, a chill ran up my spine. Pearce was excellent also. He showed skill and determination in resisting the act of cannibalism and his acting was not forced... very believeable. The only disapointing thing was, is that they really didn't delve too much into the reason why cannibalism was started except to mention an indian fable. I would have liked to learn more before everyone was eaten! But besides that...... a great great film"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:If you want to come away from a movie thinking that the Old West was the most slow, boring place in the world then My Darling Clementine is the movie for you; unexpectedly beloved, this John Ford \\"classic\\" is only sucessful in showing that even the gunfight at the O.K. Corral can be made dull by the right director."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Fiction","review":"While there has never been a completely factual account of the life of Wyatt Earp (\\"Tombstone\\" comes the closest), this film is completely fictional. First, Wyatt isn't even married in this version, and he becomes enamored with a woman named Clementine; thus the title. Doc Holliday was a dentist, but in this film, he is a surgeon who operates on a wounded bargirl he loves.As a piece of Western Fiction, this film would be alright, but since it was decided to use the names Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday and the OK Corral, the entire project is distracting. The only accurate facts in this film, are that there was a Wyatt Earp, a Doc Holliday and an OK Corral. If it wasn't for the excellent performances of Henry Fonda, and especially, Walter Brennen, I would have given this film one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"A REAL CLUNKER","review":".....This is probably the worst movie that Ford ever made. I video taped this movie because of the stature of FORD & FONDA but after watching it once I deleted it because it was not worth saving......It would take a tome to recount the many absurdities in this film starting with the location, Monument Valley, which is far removed from Tombstone, to the casting of the burly robust Victor Mature as the thin, frail, dying of consumption, Doc Holliday. Mature's range as an actor was limited, he was in his milieu as Sampson in Sampson and Deliah, but to attempt to pass him off as a refined, educated, intellectual pushed my credibility beyond its limit......FONDA played the frontier lawman EARP as an addled Aw Shucks Ma'am simpleton and was totally unbelievable.....The Gufight at OK Corral has been distorted enough by historical mythology without corrupting it more by ridiculous and nonsensical movie farce"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Darling Clementine","review":"My husband is a huge western fan and he didn't have any with Henry Fonda. I bought it for him for XMas and he loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the OK Corral","review":"Amidst the many film treatments of the events leading up to the gunfight at the OK Corral, this very early one looms large. Henry Fonda is wonderful (as usual) in the role of Wyatt Earp, and Victor Mature, though a bit robust for the frail, tubercular Doc Holliday, does a great job of evoking his intelligence, erudition, courage and even illness. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS GOOD AS THOUGHT IT WOULD","review":"This movie hit the theaters on December 3, 1946 starring Henry Fonda as Wyatt Earp, Linda Darnell as Chihuahua, and Victor Mature as Doc Holiday. Earp is trying to cattle across country when they're cattle rustled during the night. Earp is forced to take a job as Marshall in the same town where the country rustlers live. I was interested in this movie when I saw it playing during an episode of Mash. I didn't care for this movie because there wasn't any drama to it. Sure, it was your typical Western with guns, horses, cattle and guns. However you new how it was going to end just 20 minutes into it. Therefore I give this movie just 1 weasel star and that's being nice in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Story Based upon the Earps","review":"This is one of the great Western films. It cannot be stressed enough that the viewer should not attempt to compare the film though with the actual events. The phrase \\"loosely based upon\\" is fitting to describe this film and its portrayal of the famous gunfight.As the Amazon summation says \\"Ford takes great liberties with history, bending the story to fit his ideal of the West, a balance of social law and pioneer spirit\\". Henry Fonda is excellent in his portrayal of Wyatt Earp and the supporting cast make this an enjoyable film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic Western!","review":"If the Western genre has an ambassador, undeniable would be John Ford. He was his maxim exponent. The story of Wyatt Earp and Tombstone now are part of the story. If it remained some doubt about it, you may realize why Tombstone was remade in 1993 (with Val Killmer making the best Doc in screen and by far his best achievement of his career). And surely that means something remarkable.Go for this classic and solid cult movie through the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Darling Clementine","review":"The definitive version of the fabled gunfight at the OK Corral, \\"Clementine\\" is another near-perfect pairing of Fonda and Ford, following their collaboration on \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\" Shot in Monument Valley, the black and white photography is magnificent, fully worthy of the picture's engrossing and suspenseful story. The climactic scene where Earp and Holliday finally confront the Clantons (led by Walter Brennan) at the OK Corral is the stuff of movie legend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Western, and a great edition of it","review":"This Western ranks up there with The Searchers, Red River and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon--don't miss it. And one tip for the reader who wrote below--it's not always obvious even to retailers what mode a video was recorded in, BUT, if you click on Technical Information, on the left-hand side of the title, it will tell you a few good hints--especially, which studio is releasing it. In this case, it's a very reputable one, 20th Century Fox, so you can rest assured it was recorded at SP and is really high quality. And this is a great one."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD RIDE","review":"ONCE THIS MOVIE GETS STARTED, IT'S WORTH THE WATCH. THEY EVEN GIVE YOU SERVERAL DIFFERANT ENDINGS. IN MY OPINION THE ONE THEY HAD AS THE ENDING WAS THE BEST. LEAVES IT OPEN FOR AN SEQUAL FOR WHICH THEY DID. HAVENN'T SEEN IT YET. BUT I WILL SAY THIS JOY RIDE IS WHAT IT IS. ENTERTAINING AND CREEPY. YOU NEVER GET TO SEE THE VILLIN. I ENJOYED IT AND IM SURE YOU WILL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts well but then..","review":"Boy oh boy. Where have I seen this movie befor? Oh yeah it was called \\"Duel\\" and It was much better..This movie starts OK but once the main plot is laid out the rest of the movie is just funny in a bad way..After they trick a Horny low IQ truck driver to a motel room to meet a fictional woman (just for laughs) and hear him kill a person (or did he)? they become the subject of the truckers vengence. I watched curiously as the truckers IQ shoots through the roof.. He suddenly can guess their location on a long stretch of highway with such ease with no logical explanation except that he is a genius.. too bad he fell for their stupid practical joke... if he didn't we won't have this movie.Great candidate for a Rcoky Horror Picture Show like midnight show.Watch \\"Duel\\" insted. Great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good thriller","review":"i wasnt expecting much from this one since there have been so many dissapointments in the thriller genra lately(Jeepers Creepers,Glass House).But this one was actually good.Paul Walker and Steve Zahn both turn in good performances as they are beig chased by a crazy trucker.The dvd has good picture quality and sports some nice special features including some interesting alternate endings"},{"rating":"2","title":"It lives up to its name.","review":"Two brothers (Steve Zahn and Paul Walker) on the road incur the wrath of a psycho truck driver, who proceeds to play a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with them. Superb thriller is a surprise gem, complete with high-octane suspense and scares. The initially subdued and creepy set-up builds nicely to the last half-hour, a terrifying knockout. Kudos to Steve Zahn for a wonderful performance (he also has good chemistry with Paul Walker) and to John Dahl's taut direction. The film may be a little too elaborate at times with a couple of illogical moments, but you'll be too enthralled to care. Enthusiastically recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The title says it all !!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Movie: JOYRIDE was an unexpected surprise, breathed a little bit of fresh air into this genre. Steve Zahn was hilarious, Rusty Nail was creepy psycho and the climax is totally suspense-filled. The ending is great, but the alternate ending is much better, but that's no problem. JOYRIDE is - next to \\"The Others\\" and \\"Panic Room\\" - the scariest movie i've seen this year.DVD: Great sound and picture, many specials: 3 Commentaries from Leelee Sobieski and Steve Zahn/Director John Dahl/Writer Clay Tarver, Trailers, 30 minutes alternate ending, 4 short alternate endings, delected scene, Making-of and a voice-featurette from Rusty Nail"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had me on the edge of my seat...","review":"To leave the theatre.Wow. I expected more from this film. It looked like a class B thriller. Which means plenty of thrills and even some cheese thrown in for fun. It's premise is unoriginal but brilliant in these days of typical teenage slasher flicks. But somehow it just didn't work. It wasn't scary, and there was no pay off in the end. The truck driver was just some big fat dude, nothing special or scary. I just couldn't get into it, and it just didn't work on a few levels. It had some nice scenes, like the big bad truck going THROUGH this other truck in the beginning. The cornfield chase was nice looking. The end was nothing special. And I dunno when he had time to do what he did at the end. Not to ruin anything for ya. If you wanna see a better thriller road movie, rent Kurt Russell's Breakdown. It's simpler but much more mysterious and thrilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is too predictable and not really a thriller","review":"This movie is too predictable, and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who wants to be thrilled or scared. It doesn't really thrill or scare you, unless you're under 10 years old. With the high 4.5 rating on amazon, I thought this movie would be good, but it was a bit disappointing. BUY ANOTHER MOVIE, TRY TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this a comedy?","review":"After watching Joy Ride in the theater, I must say that I left more scared by the acting and writing than I did by the plot. The writing was horrible and the logic in the movie terrible. While movies don't necessarily have to be the most realistic portrayals, they should at least be believable. Stupid things that needed explaining were never explained, such as how the truck driver actually knew which car the brothers had. The line \\"Candy Cane\\" was basically all I left the theaters with. While the idea itself was pretty shaky, it could have been done well. It wasn't. If you want to be scared, don't see Joy Ride. All you will end up seeing is a generic, poorly planned scary movie that really doesn't scare at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"well-made thriller","review":"This is a smart, witty, and extremely suspenseful thriller. It's not as intricately plotted and sophisticated as some of Dahl's other work, but it's not supposed to be. It's more of a thrill ride, a teen horror movie, and a very effective one. Steve Zahn is very good--Fuller is funny and kind of charming, but you want to punch him. As an aside, I really wish people would not waste time reviewing trailers on this site. Anyone who thinks you can judge the quality of the movie from the trailer must not go to the movies much."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the scariest movies I've ever seen!","review":"JOY RIDE is a terrifying thriller! Definitely one of the scariest I've seen in my life. It's a very rare kind of movie, that seriously scares the pants off of you, and has you shaking like a manic in your seat!The extremely talented cast features Paul Walker (as Lewis Thomas), Steve Zahn (as Fuller Thomas), and Leelee Sobieski (as Venna Wilcox).A bit of trivia: Ted Levine (who played Buffalo Bill in SILENCE Of The LAMBS) wonderfully performs the role of 'Rusty Nail', the psychotic and vengeful truck driver.For those who are looking for a scary (and quite funny) movie, go snd see this! Congrats to John Dahl for a solid hit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Joy Ride indeed","review":"Paul Walker (The Fast & the Furious) and Stephen Zahn (Happy Texas) star as 2 brothers on a road trip to pick up a friend (Leelee Sobieski), prank a truck driver with their cb radio and soon regret it. Because now he just won't leave them alone. The result is an often very scary thriller that holds your attention from start to finish. There's some minor flaws but none are bad enough to ruin the movie. For instance it's a little silly that he always knows where they are and even knows their names and you're suppose to believe that it's because of the CB radio. The film packs enough of a punch that you don't care though.I read some reviews here and I saw a few complaints about the ending but I must say I really liked it. Well anyway if you don't like that one there's 4 alternate ones on the dvd and I must say that all of them work. Rusty Nail's (the truck driver) fate is a little different in each one. So that's pretty cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"One very well done suspence thriller","review":"Joy Ride is defiatly not your run of the mill teen thillers.Joy Ride uses different ways of suspence as apposed to someone jumping out at you and killing you.Joy Ride is about two brothers who have just bought a car and a CB radio and are on the way home for summer break.The brothers decide to play a jokeon a guy who goes by the name Rusty Nail.One of the brothers told Rusty Nail that that he was agirl and to meet him at hotel.Rusty Nail did not find their little joke ammusing at all and decides he wants revenge.The movie is really suspencful and will have you on the edge of your seat through out the whole movie.The cast did a great job.The guy who did Rusty Nails voice was truely gave off a very creepy presence.A must see!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jawsome","review":"First off none of the other reviewers who gave this one star really know what they are talking about... This borrows many elements from spielbergh's Duel. Also Dahl was paying omage to that film using the same looking car that was in Duel. Also this film was made two years ago but couldn't get released due to columbine or something in that vein. Also Jeepers Creepers is a slasher movie this is a very pulse pounding thriller. It kept me on the edge o my seat the whole time. The ending is also very good, yet a little predicatble.

Not only is the writing horrible, but the acting... Did they even reherse for this movie? I personally think that John Dahl (director) had a late phone bill or something, because I highly doubt that the director of such movies like \\"Red Rock West\\", and \\"The Last Seduction\\" was actually excited about this hideous work of filmmaking.

But for those of you who like plot, acting, and resolution, waste 8 dollars at the zoo..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche, but with one BIG redeeming virtue.","review":"Joy Ride begins with some of today's best young actors playing interesting characters in interesting situations. You're led to believe it will be a sort of \\"buddy\\" movie, as two slightly estranged brothers must take a car trip together, thus getting to know one another again. It then quickly becomes an exciting thriller with a fun B-movie sensibility.I'm a big fan of genre films and really enjoy a good B-movie. Joy Ride, however, ran out of ideas about half-way through the film. That made for a fairly boring, and downright annoying, last act.The movie has one HUGE redeeming virtue, however. Paul Walker has a surprisingly long scene where he is completely naked. Completely. Naked. Paul Walker. Completely. Steve Zahn is completely naked too. Naked. Completely. Those scenes alone make this worth the price of admission. Rumor has it that the nude scenes were added after the movie tested poorly. If so, then viva la focus group!"},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Commentaries??","review":"After hearing about how great it was, I finally watched the DVD. Rusty Nail? Candy Cane? C'mon!

Would you buy a car just to pick a girl you already know well? A nude scene of the 2 guys?(Sorry fellas, Leelee remains fully clothed)And these people are supposed to be in college? All Unexplained.

You never get to see what he looks like. Was the movie original? No. It is a crazed trucker who chases down a couple of guys who played a prank on him. Was it entertaining? Yes! It had a good mix of suspense and humor. I saw 'Duel' a long time ago when I was young and I barely remember it, so this didn't spoil the movie for me by comparison. This movie may have struck home with me a little more, because I was chased down by a crazed trucker a few years ago, so I know they're out there.

I was in suspense, I wasn't sure who would live and who would die (anybody is game here), I've never been so impressed with Paul Walker's acting, Steven Zahn can play serious(!), and Leelee was really a good choice. I was a little nervous about her at first, but she made more than many actresses might have with her character....To get to brass tacks: the simple premise of a prank backfiring because the dupe turns out to be a psycho seems like it could be very unoriginal and thoroughly predictable. This movie was NOT. It was tightly directed for one, by gifted director John Dahl, well acted, tense and dark script, gorgeous cinematography (neon lights are just beautiful in this film), and a stunning climax! It's closer to five stars than four but I don't want people to think this is the next Psycho.

It's taken a lot of flak (even on this website!) but it's better than what's said about it. The acting is actually pretty good, although Matthew Kimbrough kind of hams it up a little too much. As for the car chase scenes, there are a lot of people who are saying it looks like a cheap rip-off of Jeepers Creepers. Well, ordinarily I might agree... except that I will almost guarantee you that filming of this movie was finished by the team Jeepers Creepers was released. Duh. Yes, I'll admit that it is along the vein of the typical teen horror flick - two guys trying to get away from a psychopathic killer, with the requisite really hot chick in Leelee Sobieski. However, none of the main characters get killed, and some parts of the movie were actually really funny.

Not a board game, but a game where the life of one of the brothers girlfriends, is coming to a stop.

Ted Levine's voice as \\"Rusty Nail\\" is perfect. if you don't know who that is, he's Buffalo bill in silence of the lambs. but his voice has matured a bit, in a creepy way. This is a great movie, i watched it twice in a row to see if i could believe it twice in a row and i'll be damned if it wasn't better the second time around. Great acting from all 3 actors, though at times i felt like paul walker was a little too valley for my taste. steve zahn continues to crack me up even in a movie like this.

Anyway, I saw the preview for this movie and at first it looked cool, but then I realized that it looks like a poor take-off of Jeepers Creepers..I mean, the car chase?Where did they get that from? Hmmm... Maybe JEEPERS CREEPERS! Can't the writers of Joy Ride think of their own ideas? And, what about that lame thing the killer says \\"You really should get that fixed!\\"\\"What fixed?\\"\\"Your back headlight!\\" hahha how lame is that..It may have worked in Scream but I don't think it will work in this movie. My predictions for this movie is that the killer ends up to be some old guy that kills 10 people every 23 years, has a hook thingy he holds in his hand to slash people with, and wears a mask of some \\"ghostly image\\".. Oh yeah, and he probably wears a raincoat or hat when its not even raining!

The book is nearly 400 pages, but the story is closer to 200. Ms. Perry repeats ad nauseam the characters' thoughts and conversations, going over the same ground again and again. One wonders if she has no editor. Or perhaps she's being paid by the word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly boring","review":"I was drawn to main characters of the series - all three of them are really charming. I also think Anne Perry has a gift to think up really interesting crimes and plot twists. But so far I only enjoyed two first books in the series.

But she'll rebound, probably better than ever"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader is cheated of an ending!!!!!","review":"I was very disappointed with the latest Perry book. She spends a great deal of time developing characters and plot, and for the first half of the book you have to wonder where it is she is trying to take the reader. Finally the plot starts to thicken and she takes you on a roller coaster ride through England. Then, just as fast as she gets your attention, she ends the book without a conclusion. I felt cheated and left hanging! It was almost as if she got tired of writing, or the last two chapters got lost in the mail??? She spends over 300 pages setting up a great murder/mystery and then poorly sums it up in less then 15 pages, leaving the reader wondering what happens to the murder and the other characters who are connected. I can't say I will be reading many more Perry books in the future if this is how they will end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"most boring of monk books","review":"This plot of this book was totally unbelievable.

Whenever I finish one of her books, I feel I have learned something new about the human psyche and its darker side. Hester, Monk, and Rathbone, with all their tension and awkward friendship, are fascinating, and watching them grow as people over the course of this series has kept this reader immensely satisfied.

Aiken & West provided the explanations and instructions that enabled me to complete my dissertation. Nowhere else have I seen the information they provide; seldom have I seen statistical treatments as clearly and easily explained. Like many in the social sciences, math was not my greatest intellectual ability. This book made computing and understanding regression interactions a relative breeze. One reviewer bemoaned the lack of information on interactions among categorical variables. I suppose he didn't read the preface that specifically explains the reason for the absence: such information is widely available in any good statistical text. What Aiken & West provide can't be found elsewhere in any real depth.

It provides many worked examples, useful formulas (often unavailable in current software), and heuristics for interpreting otherwise complex phenomena. I should also point out it is one of the few textbooks that grapples with quadratic and three-way interactions, in depth (which is why I purchased it).The only limitation of this work is that it is a little old. Although the suggestions made by these researchers remain highly relevant, it would be nice if they included some more modern topics (e.g., interactions with latent variables, moderated mediation). However, those topics are covered elsewhere and this book is definitely still worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"It took forever to arrive, but great customer service","review":"Book like new.

Clutch have seamlessly combined their own unique 'rawk' sound with the sounds of old.... the blues. Damn, this album's actually made me get into the blues and look at it in a whole new light. This is a great album... different to their previous efforts, but great none the less. And you can't go wrong with an unique voice like Neil Fallon's. This is the type of album that spits in the face of those sucky emo bands that are all over the place now... This is the real deal. Nice bluesy rhythms (drums and bass), good slide guitar every now and then... and ofcourse the harmonica. All fit in very nicely. Without exaggeration, almost all the track are brilliant... been listening to the album since it came out and it stills sounds great.

My point is Im sick of these people that overcharge for these games bc they know youll pay it if you wanna relive those old fun times from the past. I urge any of you who want this game and have a 360 (not sure about PS3) to just get the Silent Hill HD collection. It has both Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 3. A much better deal...save yourself from getting ripped off by the greedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth your buck.","review":"This game was terrific from beginning from end. Its got incredible pacing that will grip you and never let go. You don't have to play the first two of the series to understand the plot, but those who have played the original Silent Hill will find this game to be nostalgic. It may be a bit short lengthwise for advanced gamers (about 6 hours), but for everyone else this adventure will take a little more than 10 hours to complete. There is some replay value to it, with multiple endings and things to unlock.If you want to show off your PS2's graphical capability, THIS IS THE GAME TO DO IT WITH. The visuals in this game are astounding and horrifying. The sound is equally as impressive. Silent hill 3 is definately a top favorite of mine, and that says a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"Great series that still had its roots with it in this game.

While the second game had an amazing storyline with great plot twists, this has a plot so shallow it made me sick that I paid this much money for it. Waaaaaay too short. For the kind of money I put into it, I expected way more. Graphics and sound are great as ususal, but that just underlines the pathetic plot. Save your cash for SH 4, which I hear they are working on. But I'm renting 4 next time, instead of running out and buying. I learned my lesson with this dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Games","review":"Okay look if you want a game that lets you run around and shot stuff go run a search for Halo or something because Silent Hill isn't for you. The Silent Hill series takes brings a Hitchcock vibe to video games where the story is as intrigue as the graphics are beautiful (in a weird sort of way). Although I think Silent Hill 3 was a low point in the series, it was shorter then the proceeding games (I took five hours to beat- but a LONG five hours), and for me it wasn't as scary as the second or the first (which I still haven't beat- I think my game might be cursed or something ;). But on it's own Silent Hill 3 is a great game that provides a mild cerebral scary that many horror games can't match."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont Be scared off","review":"That guy up there doesnt know what hes talking about, Silent Hill is one of my favorite series, and i STILL cant get enough of silent hill 2, i sold my copy to get the greatest hits version of it, so i could play through some extras it has, and if this games anything like the others, it will be a 5 all the way!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"harry mason's adopted daughter heather.","review":"This games otherworld is downright creepy and the rest is the same. I think the enemies on this game are the best in the series. They're not only cool looking but they're hard to kill as well. Which to me is a good thing. I love the characters in the game. The way you meet vincent for a second and call him a wierdo then exit the room and then he becomes a major player in the story. I love the main character's attitude towards everything. She's just an awesome down to earth chick. I usually don't like female protagonists, but this game pulls it off and in a big way. The game is around 6-9 hours long which probably sounds short but every second of gameplay is so great it doesn't really matter.

The gameplay is horrible. Combat is very weak, so you just run away. Also, there's like a million freaken doors, that have broken handles, and that's very annonying.It forces you to explore.

I've been playing first-person and third-person games since Doom 1 days, using a PC. The basic mouse/keyboard control has long been perfected, but the game designers just don't get it. I routinely purchase a good made-for-pc first/third person game and _start off_ on the hardest level and enjoy the game immensely (Deus Ex I and II, all the unreal games, all the doom/hexen/heretic versions, all the Dark Forces/Jedi Knight series, Halo, etc, etc.) These games all have one thing in common: a GOOD adjustable interface. This game simply does not -- I tried various combinations/settings, but it's goofy indirect interface does not work for me. I just wish _someone_ had told me _before_ I WASTED $30 on it.

Not a bad horror film. So I was inspired to revisit the game title. I did a bit of research and found Silent Hill 3 was rated the highest by fans so I chose that one. When I started playing it I was pretty disappointed. It is an old game so I have to keep that in mind, but I don't evn think I'd have liked it when it first was released. The story is utterly linear - you can't deviate from the one and only possible path. You can only interact with predetermined items. If there's a small pile of cardboard bloacking your way, you can't just climb over it, it's a dead end. Super frustrating. There are only a few types of monsters and their graphics are terrible. You just end up going in circles. Some cool horror cut scenes but just not a fun game to play. Don't bother!jon"},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP REVIEWING GAMES BEFORE THEY COME OUT!!!","review":"I gave it one star because all silent hill games that came out before deserved one star, and people are giving this game a good hype before it even comes out.

SH3 just seemed to be loaded down with a bunch of extra stuff for AFTER you've already beaten the game. While it is FUN and kind of creepy (with great graphics and AWESOME music), I really don't think that it matched up to Silent Hill 2, or even 1 for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little closure","review":"The overall gameplay of Silent Hill 3 is great, with really cool bonuses. The best feature however is the fact that it is actually a sequal this time, unlike Silent Hill 2! Silent Hill 3 actually gives you some insight on the events that have transpired since the end of Silent Hill 1. Although the story is [garbage] compared to the psychological thrill ride of number 2, it is still a decent story. Another thing I didn't like was the fact that on my first play through, it only took me 4h 18m to finish. Anyway, a must buy for any Silent Hill fan. *note* you may want to play through Silent Hill 1 again before playing this game, just to refresh you on the story a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"more excitement","review":"Silent Hill 3 is where the amount of fear REALLY goes up a few notches. Encountering a monster in this game will probably scare the crap out of you, thanks to the graphics being a big improvement this time around.The music isn't quite as good as the original Silent Hill, but in this case, the music doesn't really hurt the gameplay at all. You will be scared regardless of what tune happens to be playing. The sound effects alone can make you afraid. Playing as Heather is a really nice twist, also. As you play the game, imagine what she must be feeling.I would recommend this game to anyone who has a strong enough mind to handle this kind of psychological horror. Remember, it may be a video game, but the violence and fear may be too much for many folks to handle.

The lovely and accomplished Lindsay Duncan's understated, yet powerful performance as Anna Bouverie captures all the character's frustrations, disappointments and, finally, flowering in the wake of new love and the potential of a new life away from a loveless marriage and oppressive community. The film offers insightful comment about the nature of marriage and of the role of religion in modern society without being preachy or judgmental; if one chooses to ignore these themes, the film can just be enjoyed as fine, compelling drama. With Miss Duncan, there is fine support from the wonderful Stephen Dillane and from Ronald Pickup and, as always, Prunella Scales. Well worth repeated viewings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"Great acting all around but very weak and unrealistic storyline. I highly doubt that the intelligent woman portrayed by Duncan would risk everything by engaging in a sordid sexual liason with the brother of her husband's immediate superior. Come on! And I'm sure the Arch Deacon wouldn't so lightly brush off the knowledge of Anna's adulterous affair with his brother (which occured in his own house). As a clergyman he would surely condemn their actions and offer couseling to help get the family through this destructive episode. The real problem with this movie is precisely that it does not make any moral judgements. Anna's actions are protrayed as being totally pure and justified. The heavies are her overworked and depressed husband and the church ladies who are just trying to help (as church ladies do). In return, Anna gets to have sex with another man. This is moral relativism at its worst. Not worth a repeat viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Middling Book by a Great Author","review":"Babe Ruth was a great hitter.

Her voice was and still is very thin. There is a technique,singers do with their voice, called vibrations. Graciela vibrates to fast, and tries to sing fancy. When she does this, it sounds like a person that is trying really hard to actually be a good singer. Perhaps this is the reason that her fame is not as big as it could be. For a person that has been in the music industry for over 10 years, Graciela should be a continuous award winner. Unfortunately, her inability to perform well, has kept her from winning many prestigious awards.

Personal problems, and he was locked in the the bitterest divorce case in history, went to the Supreme Court! Things added to his orange juice...Joao Gilberto also has a good reason to have a grudge against Getz but it doesn't show here, he is as mellow as usual. A trooper. His singing and guitar & Heloise hold the day, while Getz pretty much phones it in. What's good on this album comes from him.For better Getz, pick any other decade or his life.

It sounds like a jittery, digitally-distorted, ultra-low-resolution mess, instantly converting an audiophile-quality stereo system into something resembling that plastic Sanyo midi system you had in your bedroom as a kid. Horrible.I see the album has since been remastered in Japan (arguably the audiophile capital of the world) in 2005 and there's also a 2009 \\"Blue Spec\\" pressing (also Japanese) so I'll probably try one of those next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't fit my vehicle!","review":"The trim piece was fine, it just didn't fit my application like it was supposed to.

The hat just stays twisted no matter what you do.Also the crown of the hat is very small.I actually had to cut the crown off to even slip the hat on my head.It is sized for small child.The hoop petticoat is also a joke. It is made with the same silly tubing for hoops.There is no way to unbend these hoops.

Good thing my expectations weren't high. Seemed as if a few chapters were missing, leaving numerous loose ends - I'm assuming this is a ploy to encourage me to read the next in the series, but I'm really not that interested. The book was obviously written by a male - every woman coming in contact with Stone seems to remove her clothes and throw herself at him. Any author who uses the word \\"randy\\" multiple times in a novel should be suspect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic!!","review":"This has to be one of the worts books I've ever listened to! It was very poorly written, the 'hero' is a stereotypical macho lawyer/PI type who constantly has naked women throwing themselves at him (to whom he couldn't possibly say no)and the courtroom scene had me yelling \\"objection!!\\". It was read in a bored monotone, the Mexican characters sounded like Speedy Gonzales and Stone's Italian friend seemed to have a constant sinus cold. The female characters were all weak, whiny, and sex starved, or sex starved and deranged! The so-called mystery is never even solved! This is the first and only Stuart Woods book I will ever read or listen to. Thoroughly amazed he ever got published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a minute too soon","review":"Stuart Woods is capable of writing interesting fiction but this isn't it. Stone Barrington is at his most basic - a phallus with a pimple for a brain. All the females are similar in nature to Stone and not ones you'd care to meet in a dark space. We can only hope that Stone will marry his soul mate Arrington so that she can be Arrington Barrington. They certainly deserve one another. Then they can rename their son Carrington Barrington and call him Care Bear for short. Too cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste Of Time!","review":"This is a shallow, predictable book by an arrogant writer. Not convinced?

The plot has some potential for development into a decent storyline, however, Mr. Woods has become lackadaisical in creating interest in Stone and the other characters we have come to know and love. The unsettling ending just adds to the frustration of getting this far and feeling disappointed once again. Better luck next time, Stuart. You don't get my vote on this apathetic tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing read","review":"i have enjoyed all the other books that mr woods has wrote about stone barrington but this one was very disappointing. i fealt that he just threw alot of words together and didn't gave alot of thought about it. i am tired of arrington. she is a person that i can not like she got her man then she didn't want him anymore but she still wanted what he could gave her. i thought that dolce could have put life in his books for a long time to come instead he has her go crazy. what a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very bad book","review":"I was shocked what I got for (dollar amount)at the airport.

It just went on and on with sex thrown in for no reason. a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stone Is Back...","review":"Good followup from previous Stone Barrington novels. In this one Stone corners himself in a possible marriage and coming to grips with other aspects of his personal life. Interesting turn of events in his life in the end, and certainly an open door for his next novel. I enjoyed this latest adventure and look forward to the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you on the tip of your toes","review":"Being a newcomer to Stuart Woods books, I've definitely found a writer I like. His characters are true to life, or what I think they probably are like in the movie industry. This book is a definite must read and I will be reading the rest of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing Book, Lacks imagination","review":"Stone Barrington is one of my favorite characters in the mystery book arena, so I was eagerly awaiting the publication of Stuart Woods new book L.A. Dead. I must say I was very dissapointed. This book lacks imagination and the usual flair they have. I was bored a great deal of the time, really up to the last third of the book, when the book finally got unboring. The first half of the book goes into the plot and getting Arrington ready for trial, and takes too long and is unnessary. Nothing else developes. Oh yes Stone's jilted fiancee is stalking him in L.A., but I didn't find that too entertaining. I would definately check this out at the library before spending $24.95 plus tax on it.I hope Stuart Woods uses more imagination in his next Stone Barrington book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Waste!","review":"Where to begin? I kept thinking that the books have to get better...WRONG! This book was utterly ridiculous. So ridiculous I couldn't even finish. Stone Barrington is nothing but a materialistic, pompous, arrogant, slut. The story is so stupid that the writer should be embarrassed. The books are all about extravagent dinners/hotels/houses/wines/clothes, and he beds EVERY woman after meeting them for 5 mintues. There is nothing to like about him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down from the beginning.","review":"This is the third Woods novel I have read, and I thoroughly enjoyed the first two. LA Dead misses the mark badly. It is almost as if the author is too caught up in painting the Hollywood jet set that he forgot there is supposed to be at least some mystery and suspense. This novel has niether of these attributes. The characterizations are overdone. I cannot recall an appealing female in the plot. The \\"non-ending\\" is a perfect fit for this most imperfect novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Have You Done With Stuart Woods?","review":"Normally one of my favorite authors and my favorite series, I found this book to be pretty bad. The dialog was shallow (do we need to hear his telephone calls word for word, including details of him identifying himself and leaving word on how to reach him?), the characters even shallower (are there *any* women in this book besides Mary Ann who don't walk around buck naked and throw themselves at Stone?). Even the main characters were pretty unlikeable this time around -- doesn't Stone have anything else to do but boink everyone in sight? Doesn't Dino have a job to do in NY? Why is a mob boss so easy on Stone for dumping his princess daughter? Why isn't Arrington at least grieving for a husband she certainly didn't dislike? Why would Mary Ann invite her sister to dinner knowing the circumstances?..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really was disappointed. Is Mr. Woods going through male menapause? I know he can do much better than this, glad I got it from the library and didn't spend good money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad....","review":"This is my fifth Stuart Woods book, and it was dreadful. His characters are horribly drawn, and don't even remotely resemble what they were in earlier books. The character of Arrington went from an interesting woman, to a horrible cliche of one. For a woman who supposedly respected her husband, I don't think there was one mention of ahh gee....my husband is dead. The other women were written very badly too, and Stone seems to have turned into a male version of a skank. Men can be sluts, and for someone who is supposed to have a measure of integrity, Stone seems to have lost his. The minor story in the book is the murder and mystery. It was treated as a sub plot to the horrible depiction of the characters.Don't buy this book. There are better and more realistic books about the movie industry out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid and mindless","review":"This was my first Stuart Woods book. I was hoping I'd like it because I'm looking for a new author so I have a few books to read between new releases from my favorites. This book has the simplest and dumbest storyline I've seen written by an adult. Every woman wants Stone Barrington and so they naturually answer the door undressed even the first time they meet him. In the end, he comes up with a character to be the guilty party, but has no build up to how this is the case. Seems like he just figures he's written enough pages to sell the book, so he picks a character to be guilty so he can finish and move on. And then he spends the last 3-4 pages to pick up a loose ends that would make his next story more difficult to write. Last book I'll read by this guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"grabs hold of you right from the beginning","review":"wow, this book was fantastic...from the very beginning I couldn't stop turning the pages...i'm not sure why this book had a lower average rating, but I thought it was fantastic..there's lots of things going on in this book, but that's one of many things Woods is good at: having multiple sub plots but using them in such a way that the reader doesn't get lost trying to keep track of everything....everything flows really well..if I had to pick a gripe about the book it would be the ending...it's one of those 'did they or didn't they??' type of endings....which is cool, but if you're like me and you need to know everything, it'll drive you nuts! =)as with the other books in the Barrington series, i'm sure the events of this book will impact stone's later adventures..gripping and fast paced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a brilliant audio or novel","review":"I listened to the Brilliance Audio edition of this book and was very annoyed by the special effects applied whenever the character speaking was on the telephone or on television. Not only were they jarring, but the volume level often dropped at those times, forcing me to rewind or miss something since I couldn't hear it properly.The novel itself is not very good, either, as other reviewers have noted. I've enjoyed others in the Stone Barrington series, but this one seemed an excuse just to hook Stone up with many women who were not his wife, talk about various wines, and not resolve any important points brought up in the plot. As usual in Stuart Woods' books, there were several continuity errors that should have been caught in the editing process. Maybe they were left in to distract from the overall weakness of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"I hated this book and only finished it because it was a murder mystery. I have never read any of Woods' books before, but this Stone Barrington comes off as an idiot. After marrying a woman with ties to the mob, he then loses all feeling for her when a former love, Arrington, is suspected of murdering her movie star husband and he must come to her aid. Lots of sleazy, one dimensional characters with no morals abound in this book. The book was flat, the character Stone unapealling, and the characters very poorly described or not at all as far as their physical appearance and background. I hate myself for even finishing it, I only did it to find out who committed the murder. And after being dragged this way and that a few times, it's really no surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened here?","review":"As an avid Stuart Woods fan, I was extremely disappointed in this book and wonder if he really did write it or if someone else just used his name. Maybe just a filler to make money without effort as some others have done. I will be very careful before I buy his new books."},{"rating":"2","title":"L. A.

You can't put his books down, nor do you want to. L.A. Dead is terrific! Just when you begin to figure the plot out, he throws another twist in and it becomes even more spell-binding. His prose is terrific and there are few wasted words. He'll grab you on the first or second page and from there on, you can't put it down. Get this book now, even if you have to buy it in hardcover, like I did, breaking one of my cardinal rules about only buying paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst book Woods has written!","review":"Disappointed isn't strong enough to express my feelings after reading the latest in the Stone/Arrington saga.I have always really enjoyed Woods' books. The Run was great. The preceding Barrington novels were great. This was trash.I have to agree with the reader from Memphis. Agree in spades!I'll also have to look closely at any Woods books I think about buying in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"What can I say Stuart Woods is a definite leader in novel writing community. I love reading Mr. Woods' novels and have never been disappointed. LA Dead was done in his usual elegant style. Stone Barrington is one of my personal heroes in the Woods' series of novels. LA Dead had me hooked from the beginning -- opening with a marriage and ending in the courtroom. This novel kept me wondering who did it, although some of you will say you had it figured out from the beginning but for those of you like myself yes I guessed but I was never sure until the end. Mr. Woods is definitely a master in this arena. If you're looking for an enjoyable reading experience checkout LA Dead and all of Stuart Woods' other novels because they are worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible customer support.","review":"The unit stopped working less than two weeks after I purchased it.

I didn't try to do the latching mechanism because it didn't seem like it would line up with my older Anderson slider, so I will just do a rod insert in the track for security.All in all it is a much better fit than I hoped for and the installation wasn't rocket science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete disappointment","review":"Unfortunately I purchased this item and fitted it after some difficulty. I have smaller, vinyl door. No matter what you try the doorlock will not function with the given hardware. Even more disappointing was the poor quality of the door itself. The plastic insert was too small to block the entry hole when inserted and our dog just knocked it out of the hole and ran straight through it as if it was not there. I eventually had to package it up and return it, itself no small task. The Customer Service guy was very nice and helpful, but no hint of an apology for the trouble I had to go to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this","review":"If you can put a through the wall dog door than I would do that. This is just not a great product. The instructions are lacking. And with the many different types of sliding glass door this may or may not fit well on your door. For the price the materials are not up to par. The black rubber flap to keep out the draft stayed on for about 3 days. After than nothing would keep in stuck to the dog door.

With a classic story line and a scary soundtrack this game holds up through generations of gamers. Yes this game sells for around $35, it is well worth it with gory kills and a high replay value. This game comes in second for me on my all time favorite list, and is a pretty difficult game for its time but makes up for that with its password system. I suggest this for anyone who wants a spooky game with good graphics and a time tested plotline.

I've read several books on selling, and this one is the worst, mostly because it's very diluted with filler material that adds no value but makes the book look sizeable.The idea of the book is create a 'wedge' between you and your competition by having a proactive sales / support strategy. While this idea sounds nice, at the end of the day this 224 page book's only real content to \\"get your competition fired\\" is a set of six fill in the blank questions that you can, \\"apply to any sales opportunity\\"This book is fluff, plain & simple.

However, you'll get all you need out of this book in the first half. The second half of the book really disappoints in that we have the same items repeated over and over again.

He admits that, contrary to his expectations, conservatives do not age any worse than liberals. He had expected conservatives to age poorly because he thought that conservatives were not \\"as loving\\" as liberals--presumably because conservatives have some set of moral standards, whereas liberals do not have any such scruples. Vaillant also admits that social scientists have a tendency to display \\"contempt\\" for Christians.In general, Vaillant sets his own personal spiritual musings above any recognized religion, dismissing as \\"immature\\" anyone who expresses convictions regarding any and all traditional monotheistic religions--especially Christianity. Unfortunately, Vaillant is utterly unaware of how pompous and immature his own posturing appears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important Subject","review":"The first half of this book is excellent. The author explains the value of the longitudinal study and then demonstrates its value over and over through the stories of the study's participants. The second half of this book is not as clear or specific as to what the author is trying to tell us. The theme seems to be happy, be outgoing, have a lot of friends and family, have a lot of activity, and you will age successfully. Also, there is an inordinate emphasis on cultivating a garden which is difficult for apartment and city dwellers.The book is written for a lay person and the author clearly explains any technical information the reader needs to know. It is definitely worthwhile to read this book and glean from what you can that fits with your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good read...","review":"I bought this book as a textbook for a college class. It is very informative and the style is good. It's perspective is interesting and it puts a lot of pieces of the aging puzzle together.

In essence, the author said \\"Kabbalah is very difficult to learn and you wouldn't understand it anyway.\\" Then I bought \\"Practical Kabbalah\\" by Rabbi Laibl Wolf and received a very good introduction to the subject. I HIGHLY recommend Rabbi Laibl's book.My question is \\"why did the author include the words 'and mysticism' in the title if he had no intention to cover it?\\" My guess is that the editor thought the inclusion of those two words would greatly increase sales.

Don't get me wrong, they taste great--pumpkin seeds, flax grains, and pumpkin-pie spices are a great flavor blend. I just worry about chipping a tooth eating these; they're unusually hard to bite down on and chew. At least that makes them take some time to eat, which helps with portion/appetite control.

Hadlock also bases many of his comments on the recordings that he obviously has spent many hours with.

Good thing because we have stripped the defective ones down to replace parts that keep breaking like the thumb wheel and end plate which the screws just randomly fall out of.

The case it comes in is huge and sturdy. The extra battery is a nice touch. This is the 2nd Neiko caliper I have bought. The only reason I'm replacing the other one ( a 6\\" model) is that I needed the larger length and larger arms. They have both been dropped many times and keep working well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Based on the previous good reviews, it sounds like I got a lemon.

If I leave the calipers on my bench, I sometimes come back and find that the readout has climbed to a ridiculously high number like 90\\" (the calipers are obviously only 12\\" long).If I pull the calipers out quickly it will lose count along the way. Full travel of the calipers should be 12.065\\", but if I pull them open rapidly it only counts to 11\\" or so.For me, these were a waste of $40. I tried to cheap out since my work isn't typically critical to more than .010\\", but these are horrible. I bought a $125 economy set out of McMaster instead and they work great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt measure properly","review":"Several months later and the measurement is now jumping around.

The Roxio software 6 works very well. I know some people are like Nero vs Roxio. Personally I never had issues with Roxio and I would say it is one of the better ones to use. This burner will do as it says and burn in about 8-15 mins. It takes a tad long when doing data cds however. (15-20 mins) Which isnt that bad considering losing 4.5 GB of your data would be sad to lose.. DVD playback works extremly well also.One MAJOR plus about this unit.. it came to me as RPC1 !!! This unit is able to be RPC1 via firmware, however it seems that Amazon.com ships them out already as RPC1. RPC1 means that you can play any region dvd disc from around the world and not just USA.I would recommend this unit to anyone who wishes to start out with a great unit that has support and a long line of good feedback for.

You get many hints both ways during the ride.The movie explores the strained relationship between father and daughter, and theirs is an especially broken one. Evan Rachel Wood and Micheal Douglas both do an outstanding job with their characters, and are thoroughly convincing. In fact, they make this movie what it is, something like this would have been easily botched by the wrong people, but they both hit it home.If you like low key Sundance-friendly movies that make you think, pick this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been great","review":"This film has a good story line and a great leading actor. This could have been a great film were it not for the budget, direction and writing. This is such a low-budget film that I suspect it was filmed in one or two weeks at most. Many of the scenes are skimmed over and left to a voice over to explain all the missing scenes. Michael Douglas does a very good job in his role, but he is a professional, who has been performing for many years. The other characters needed more direction but did not get it. Very little time was spent developing characters or plot. I think the primary problem with this film is the budget. I don't think the director or writer had time to develop the film due to time constraints as the film has the feel of being rushed.This could still be a good film with the right personnel and budget but it will probably never be remade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Precious Time","review":"There is just not much of anything to review here. Pretty much a pointless waste of time-sorta film. Michael Douglas acts slightly manic, in a crazier performance in the Wonder Boys mode, but most everyone else is hard to watch.

The Bible has as much to say about drunkeness as it does about gluttony but it is quite a leap to think that God views drinking a glass of wine the same as He does getting drunk. I have to side with John MacArthur when he says there will be more people in hell because of legalism than alcoholism and a Christian needs to decide what they will do with the issue of drinking and how it will impact their witness for Christ.

I suppose it must have been because it was the first big-budget Chinese film to hit these shores and all the film snobs wanted to ride the crest of the wave.It's utterly devoid of human feeling, other than anger, sadism, pedophilia and brutality. And the constant Mandarin shrieking is unbearable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"The movie on DVD is the director's cut, which includes several scenes taken off for U.S. release. The film is certainly great, but the DVD cover design is beyond gay. It neither reflects the nature of the film nor shows any artistic planning; probably too cheap for a film that received Grand Prix in Cannes and an Oscar nomination."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Pity Allowed","review":"The finger-cutting scene set the tone. The Chinese in the 1930's -1960's seem more inscrutable than Charley Chan. There seems to be no human emotion or pity allowed. The young boys training to be opera actors are beaten and savaged unmercifully. The boy forced to play a girl becomes a girl. His friend, apparently bisexual, marries a prostitute. Then a weird relationship between the three evolves behind stage. The Great Leap Forward destroys their art and their love. Cinematography is striking. I recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy quality","review":"If you've spent thousands on your own home movie theatre system, forget about this DVD -- the insane level of Macrovision used on this DVD will prevent you from even playing it!

This film is still the director's best so far and from the opening scene of Leslie's assailed posture and his hero's cautious interacton with the unseen petty authority, I felt immediately sad. This is a good story and a well made film but it is also so Chinese with the added element of having the perspective of a Chinese outside of the Mainland, the author. In this way, the Chineseness of the film is more intense. I don't regret paying $7.50 for this film even though there are no Chinese subtitles or any special features whatsoever. This film deserves commentary and cast interviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie, but sad","review":"This was a good movie, but sad. I think the acting in it was very well done.

Due to the hassle to reconnect, I would not buy this headset again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy-Dandy","review":"This is by far the best head set I have ever owned. Reliable, discreet and the sound quality is great with those little ear gels. The ONLY small complaint is that those ear gels come off quite easily and so tumble around in my pocket until I put it back on the headset again. Anyway, well worth the money. If you want to spend a few dollars less, buy the BT250, which is just about as good and very reasonably priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Treo, good noise cancelling","review":"This is one of the few BT headsets compatible with Palm Treo smartphones, and it works like a champ. Battery life is better than most and the design is fairly intuitive. Best feature might be the USB charging cable so that you can charge it directly off the USB port on the computer. Great noise cancelling; people hear me better on the headset than when I'm speaking directly into the phone. As with any other BT headset, it looks pretty dorky, but that doesn't stop some people from wearing it around the grocery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding for Treo 650","review":"I had a Moto 500 and a Plantronics 510 and found that both didn't have a clear sound quality, however this Jabra 500 is clear.

Can't call it 'static' per se, as it's a digital device, but it sounded like crinkling paper or something, and this is with the phone less than 3 feet away with clear line of sight! No rhyme or reason for it, didn't matter where I was or if I was moving, no wind blowing across the mic.

Also, people tell me my voice sounds remote like I am in a room.This is not acceptable. I am going back to BestBuy to return it. Why pay $120 if there's no added value?!No doubt, it wraps around your ear very snug unlike the Motorola headsets but there's virtually no improvements compared to BT250.And let me guess - the next Jabra model would be BT500v for vibrate.

It'd be ideal if the sound quality was even fair.But the static can't be ignored. I am wearing my phone at my hip and the static is terrible. This is how I mainly want to use the device. If I have the phone out and resting on my truck's center console, then the sound is much better. But in this situation the phone is probably less than 18\\" from the earpiece.I really wish this set had worked out, because I love how it fits my ear in comfort and ease.

I did notice if the phone is too far from it I do hear static. I mean even if I put it in my pocket as opposed to holding it in my hand. But its not that bad. I would definitely recommend it.

Outside, the microphone picked up too much wind noise, rendering it useless when holding a 2 way conversation. However, if listening to a conference call, it was easy to mute so that you could listen but not disturb the remainder of the call.Unfortunately it died when the charging plug was inserted backwards (it is a small plug which appears to be symmetrical, making it very easy to do).

I have been quite happy with the sound quality and ability to hear, even when in an area with a lot of ambient noise. The multiple gel earpiece covers are a definite plus, as is the USB cable.

However, I haven't had much time to pay attention to the sound, because my Jabra bt500, purchased through Verizon, would not hold a charge from the very first day I got it, about 10 days ago. I would have maybe one 15-minute conversation in the car, and the next day, the battery would be dead. This happened a few times, and it never held a charge for more than a 24-hour period, as far as I can tell. Finally, it would not even TAKE a charge, either from the AC adapter or from the USB adapter. The last time I tried, the red light stayed on for about 10 minutes, then went out. That's the last time it worked at all. No blue light, no sync, no nothing. The charging port is VERY flimsy, but I didn't expect it to break this quickly.

I requested a replacement with Jabra at around 9/11/2006 and now this third unit is defected without it ever working. As you can imagine, I am very disappointed, especially because I have never encountered a single problem with my previous two Jabra BT headset - BT200 for 3+ year (lost) and BT250v for 1+ year (still using daily).

It might be defective batteries, but I think it is a defective charging socket that easily allows you to plug in backwards (it will fry if u just start to plug it in backwards, not even all the way in).

I tried the provided USB cable with my computer - but again the same result.In this day and age - I expect electronics to work out of the box.I know I can return it - and I will - but the hassle is just too much.Now when I search for 'dead Jabra bt500' on google - I see many similar complaints about it not working out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpredictable","review":"I am using this with a Treo 700P and it works about half the time. Sometimes you try to answer by tapping the button on the headset while it is ringing in you ear and it may or may not answer the call. So you end up just picking up the phone and holding it to your other ear and making you wonder why you bought this piece of junk. While it is working the sound is OK but it can't quite reach from your ear into your pants pocket, it will be too scratchy, so I have to put my phone in my shirt pocket or just hold it in my hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pricey and stopped working after 4 months","review":"I would give it minus infinity rating if I could.I paid $120 for the headset and adapter and it's dead after only 4 months.My husband is always on the road and a wireless headset is essential to him. He also told me that other truck drivers always asked him how he made this headset to work. After 4 months he knows why they asked him this question.

If you have difficulty hearing then this is the headset for you. I also own a Jabra BT250 headset as well. This headset has a long life between charges. It provides more functions than most headsets. However, one of the drawbacks is that this headset does not vibrate whereas the BT250 model does. I think that for the increased price, Jabra should have included that feature. If they needed to charge more for that feature, I would have paid for it. It is invaulable. The upside is that there is a longer time between charges. The BT500 also offers more features such as dialing from the headset and muting capabilities. It is a very good product and is well made. I droped it in my driveway and drove over it with my truck. Other than a few scratches, it still works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good!","review":"Had a Jabra 250, worked well, but fell apart(common problem--screw stripped out of plastic.

David Niven, Teresa Wright, Evelyn Keyes and Farley Granger play the leads and you watch their development in great hope that history will not repeat itself a second time. This film, made in 1948, is set in World War II London. The pressing crisis of the war threatens the one romance while the one from long ago was threatened by a different force. You will enjoy this movie tremendously -- I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love can be a guiding light","review":"Enchantment is a beautiful love story told in a series of flashbacks by a World War II British general named Rollo (David Niven) who recalls his love for a young girl who has come to live with his family after her parents were killed in a train accident.As time passes Rollo and the girl Lark fall in love and decide to marry. Their plans are foiled by Rollo's jealous sister Selena (Jayne Meadows) who arranges a military appointment that separates the lovers.When Rollo returns from service he finds that Lark has married someone else.Years later when the heartbroken Rollo finds his niece about to make a similar mistake he steps in to prevent this from happening as the film ends. Teresa Wright's superb performance as Lark is dominant in an outstanding cast which includes Niven, Meadows, Evelyn Keyes, Farley Granger and Leo G. Carroll. Direction by Irving Reis is solid and Gregg Toland's photograhy and Hugo Friedhofer's musical score lend important support to Enchantment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defending Child Molesters","review":"I've had an opportunity to hear Dr. Coleman testify in a child molest case. He had to admit under cross-examination by the D.A. prosecuting the case that he had not attempted to get the entire version of events by both sides before testifying for the defendant. He didn't follow his own protocol of being \\"open-minded and neutral\\" in his approach when investigating this type of case or to gather \\"historical\\" evidence from all sides. He had to admit that he didn't even attempt to gather any type of evidence from the victim or her family, just interviewed the defendant and his wife some three years later and then felt comfortable testifying that the child must have been led by her mother to believe she was molested. Any person writing or testifying as an expert has a duty to be thorough, fair and neutral in their approach to such critical issues and cases. However, Dr. Coleman doesn't seem to want to practice what he preaches."},{"rating":"1","title":"If the answer is yes...","review":"This author doesn't seem to think there is anyway to know if a child is molested unless there is a camera present. The rest of the world relies on open-ended questions and play therapy but he dismisses it as leading. As a mother who knows you can notice changes in your child's personality and play.

The book has errors and omissions throughout, and is almost unusable. Our curriculum was forced to skip some of the chapters because they did not work properly. In short, this is a terrible example of a book that attempts to teach someone how to use AutoCAD, because it would have been necessary for someone to actually proofread the book before it was published.If amazon.com allowed a 0 star rating, this book would get it.

Celine Dion made her comeback with a little bit different sound I think. In \\"I'm alive\\", for example, you will hear with a very unusual but nice tempo. However in the songs like \\"Have you ever been in love\\" and \\"Prayer\\" you feel the old Celine Dion. In overall this album deserves applause."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carole King meets Enya meets and new and happy mum","review":"Celine has not strayed from her regular formula of up-tempo love songs, Streisandian ballads, and classic cover songs. I guess the \\"If it ain't broke don't fix it\\" methodology still holds true for Celine. While there are a few misses on the album, there are some that stick out in my mind as beautiful ear candy, such as \\"Nature Boy\\" (originally done by Nat King Cole, and later done on the Moulin Rouge soundtrack by Ziggy Stardust himself.) which is a very wise, yet pleasing lounge song. Then there is the Enya\\"ish\\" radio version of the title track \\"A New Day Has Come\\", which is a refreshing blend of angelic new age vibes and the classic Celine sound. If you want an album to listen to while sipping your herbal tea, or something to weep to when you lost your true love, go to your local music distributer and pick up this album... you won't hate yourself for it, I promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Alive and Stronger Than Ever!!!","review":"It didn't seem like that long ago that Celine Dion semi-retired for all the right family reasons, but hearing this new collection makes you realize how much we have missed her. From the very first song \\"I'm Alive\\" your are mesmerized. This is a wonderful mix of a career that only gets better and better!!! The upbeat infection of \\"Ten Days\\" extends you to the haunting ballad \\"The Greatest Reward\\" to the remarkable remakes \\"At Last\\" and \\"Nature Boy\\" which she was born to sing. The liner notes brings a real surprise as Celine shares a nicely done collage of baby Rene' and parents.

Honestly I love all the tracks. But the best thing about being a Celine fan is sharing her music with my parents There aren't many artist out there whose music one would be proud share with their parentsI am proud to say I can and do Thanks Celine Welcome back you were greatly missed In short any Celine fan please buy the CD you won't be disappointed trust me I have not stopped listening to it since the day I got it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The new day is better than the old","review":"I have never been that interested in pop music, or for that matter in Celine.

My other favorites are \\"I'm Alive\\" \\"Right in Front of You\\" \\"A New Day Has Come\\" \\"Ten Days\\" and \\"Sorry for Love\\". One or two of the songs, however, I found to be a bit boring and monotonous--thus the four star rating.

The album is definitely worth buying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A New Day Has Come","review":"I have always liked Celine. I think she has a great voice, but she never seems to know what kind of cd to put together. All of her cd\`s have a mix of songs. A New Day has 2 great old standards \\"At Last\\" and \\"Nature Boy\\", why can\`t she put songs like that on one cd? \\"Colour Of My Love\\" is a good cd, it could have been great if it wasn\`t for 4 fast songs. She rips your heart out with a great ballard and then only to be followed by a fast song and takes you out of the mood.I'm sorry, I am very disappointed in \\"A New Day\\" and may think twice about buying her next cd without hearing it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"pleae take back this day....","review":"I rejoiced when Celine Dion finally decided to call it quits with the music industry. Then....one blurry day, Celine comes back with \\"A New Day has come\\"...., which has has to be the most horrible, lyricless, melodicless, annoying album I have ever heard. Sure, I liked a few of Celine's songs way back in the early 90's, but there is only so much a person can take. Please Celine leave! Go back to Canada and sing for them, if we didn't have your name on the charts, maybe we could have a decent AMERICAN singer on the Billboard rather than you. Sorry if this review sounds cruel, but it's my opinion. All the songs are really horrible on this album. I just gave it 2 stars because you actually still managed to sell as many albums as you did with that displeasant voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"POP Diva?","review":"Honesly I have always respected Celines' music she has a wonderful voice and can come up with some really good songs. But when you get to a point in your career that you no longer give as much as you should, it is a good thing to retire.With this release we can now see a POP version of Celine. I guess thats why she is often compared to untalented singers like Britney and Christina. Maybe if Celine retires it will be better for her current diva status. Id hate to hate her make a fool of herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"where are the bad reviews????","review":"This album is a disappointment. The first two songs were \\"ok\\" and upbeat...something which is unexpected from Celine Dion, but they just don't affect me in any way. It feels like there's nothing behind them, almost like she did this album against her will and didn't want to sing the songs.I've listened to this album many...many...times, but with the same result. Boredom and disinterest. The only song that grabs hold of me (somewhat) is the title track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is one of the best","review":"I think this albun is simply great for Celine is definitely a diva.She was retiret for a couple of years and through this marvelous up_tempo CD she proves she's still one of the most talented all over the world.For this reasons a think A NEW DAY HAS COME is one of the best albun of the years"},{"rating":"2","title":"Celine is the best singer out here. So don't hate!","review":"This is Celine's best cd.I don't care what other people say. ya are just some haters. Every song on this cd is good. but some are better than others. I really like track#2(Right in front of me), I surrender and Goodbye. Girlfriend was throwing down!I was shocked because Celine had a long career and her voice seems stronger now. It might be because of her new baby. She's back and she's stronger than ever. Congradulations on your new baby Celine. Don't stop doing your thing.

This cd does not play on computers or burn, but I wouldn't use that as an excuse not to buy it.Again, this cd is great, however, if you didn't like Celine's older material, I would leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting for Celine's new cd was worth it!","review":"I've spent a wonderful afternoon listening to Celine's new 16 song cd, \\"A New Day Has Come\\". Celine is back with an even more stellar voice as evidenced on \\"The Greatest Reward\\". I defy anyone to listen to \\"When the Wrong One Loves You Right\\" and not dance, tap your foot, or sing along. It's going to be a number 1 song. Celine's rendition of Etta James' \\"At Last\\" is a wonderfully well-done version. Dare I even say it's better than the original. Her cover of Nat King Cole's \\"Nature Boy\\" is superb and evokes a strong emotional response in me. It alone is worth the price of the cd. The cd also includes a Spanish version of one of my favorite French songs, \\"L'Amour Existe Encore\\". Two years without Celine was unbearable for her fans but this cd makes the wait worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Day Is HERE","review":"Celine Dion's latest effort, A New Day Has Come, is well worth the wait for the fans that waited almost 4 years for new material. It shows that Dion has really matured as an artist. You can tell in both her voice as well as her songs.She hasn't made a drastic change, songs like \\"Prayer\\" and the original version of the title track show that she still has that lovey-dovey ballad side within her. But, we kind of get a bit of the unexpected side from Dion. Songs like \\"Ten Days\\" give her a rock edge, and \\"Sorry For Love\\" shows her in a Cher-like state.\\"I'm Alive\\" is a pretty good sum of how Dion feels since the birth of her new baby boy. But, the whole album is a briefing of all of her emotions. \\"At Last\\", in particular, is an awesome rendition of the Etta James classic.Buy this album, because if you're a Celine fan, it is well worth the wait. A #1 album for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good could do better.","review":"there are only a few good songs on this cd. will not play many times.muy mal or asi asi in spanish.graciasron"},{"rating":"2","title":"I welcome the New Day...","review":"I was disappointed in Celine for awhile because she slowed down so much. I have a short attention span for slow ballads, and quit buying her music. Now, she has made a refreshing comeback with quite a few up-tempo songs interspersed with the slo-mo's. I may become a fan again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Filler Songs","review":"This is one of the albums you will be ashamed of having when your friends point it out in your music collection. I think she should have been more particular with the songs included. It is about quality, not quantity of songs! There are just too many \\"filler.\\" What is an album without a good break up or I am glad it is over song? (See The Corrs - \\"I Never Loved You Anyway\\")I am glad the Grammy graciously overlooked her talents in this album. You can almost classify this album under \\"opera\\" because she is really singing dialog! I would think Hector Berlioz is more enjoyable than this?! Don't get me wrong, she has a great voice, but her pitch is too high, way too high. Some of the songs seem to be just \\"loud\\" - with very weak melodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celine's best yet!!!","review":"Awesome CD!!! I love everyone of the songs. It's definitely her best ever. From I Surrender or Have You Ever Been in Love to When the Wrong One Loves You Right, I think Celine has done a superb job. No wonder she's number 1!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than LET'S TALK ABOUT LOVE","review":"She didn't make it easy. Some new material, really different. SORRY FOR LOVE, WRONG ONE LOVES YOU...,RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU are just pure gold. The ballads aren't so bombastic - and that's just right. Not overproduced. Unfortunate the song SUPER LOVE is only in Europe on this cd. An absolute great song - after listening to it it will stay in your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Diva Returns","review":"Celine is back and in top form. It has been a long wait, but the Diva has returned. And it can be said that she is in fine voice. Her time away from the spotlight seems to have given her balance and motherhood appears to have brought peace and a renewed joy in music. Just listen to 'I'm Alive,' 'Sorry for Love,' 'A New Day Has Come,' and 'I Surrender.' We have missed you Celine and welcome back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"A new day has certainly come for Celine Dion. She's back and better than ever, which simply is amazing because she was great before. This CD is awesome. It has a different mix of sounds, some traditional ballads and others that are very upbeat and get you out of your seat, and then some beautiful remakes of At Last and Nature Boy. She sounds incredible and has found a new strength and emotion in each song. I love this CD and would definately recommend it to everyone, it will fill you with delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celine Dion picks up where she left off...","review":"I am just so happy to hear some new material from Celine Dion. This album has some good jams, eventhough quite different from her previous material it is quite appropriate for this time in her life. Her songs are always perfectly fitted together, and this album is no exception. The vocals are strong and mellow here. My personal favorites are \\"A New Day Has Come\\" and \\"Right in front of you\\". Every song sounds good and I think there are many hits that will come from this album. Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Again.....no five stars for you, Celine!!!!","review":"The CD is uninteresting. Not one of the songs makes me want to hear it again (save the title track, which is why the album gets two stars instead of one). I tire of hearing her sing vague love songs. At least with her last couple albums the voice and the accompanying music made up for the poor lyrics. Her singing on this album is almost as believable and just as bad as her singing reggae with Brownstone on \\"Treat Her Like a Lady\\" from a prior album. I always listen to that song when I want a good laugh. Very disappointed. Again, my strong recommendation is to listen to it...really LISTEN to it before you buy it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"good singing stuff","review":"im a singer and this is my favorite cd to jam to so if u like to rock out to some good original stuff this is the cd to get"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of meaningless noise","review":"I listed to the album many more times. This album remains insipid. And the new song I'm Alive on the radio now is chock full of nothing...no lyrical hooks, no emotional depth. Whatever happened to the days when she would sing beautiful songs like \\"Water from the Moon\\" and \\"With This Tear\\"? sigh. Also, what is it with music like Celine Dion's bringing tears to people's eyes? It's called emotional instability people. Cure: therapy. My suggestion....buy the Indigo Girls new album. Amy and Emily Rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Celine returns lacking the right melodies","review":"A good Celine CD has melodies that give you a certain feeling when you listen to them. Her great voice paired with an enhancing melodie can be a great listening experience. Unfortunately, i get none of these feelings from this cd. Sure there are some hits here but most of the songs are bland and uninspiring. This was the worst CD i've heard from Celine.I did take a chance and purchase her latest CD 'One Heart' and it is a definite winner. So if you want the real Celine, buy 'One Heart' and leave this CD in the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a screaming banshee","review":"Jeez! when will the likes of Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, and all those so-called pop divas finally stop their screaming, screeching sessions and give our tired, bleeding ears a break?Dion is nothing more than a screaming banshee who thinks she can sing. Heck, Celine, YOU CAN'T! Your voice is grating to the ears like metal against metal without grease. For Chrissakes, keep your banshee voice down!This album is just another joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"GROSS!","review":"AH!!!! Please, Celine stop screaming! The only true diva who can reach the high notes and makes it sound good is Mariah Carey. Stop trying to copy her because it won't work. This album is horrible and I didn't like one song on it! This album is like the let down of the century. I thought I was getting something good, but I only tricked myself. I think I will give it to the charity, but they would probably hate me for it. I need to get rid of this CD fast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen once, you're hooked - twice, a fan for life.","review":"Another album from Dion with no weak selections, this CD has a more eclectic mix of songs than, \\"All the way...a Decade of Song\\". Her, \\"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)\\", a singer's song to her mother, may leave you teary eyed. Her voice has never sounded better than on, \\"Prayer\\". But her title cut, no doubt about her son, René-Charles, \\"A New Day Has Come\\", is mesmerizing. You can listen to the album over and over and only enjoy it more and more each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Definitely one of her best\\"","review":"As a true Celine fan, I believe she truely has the best voice in entertainment. This CD is definitely one of her best. It includes some of her best up-beat songs and a lot of the slower ones. I recommend this CD for any Celine fan who enjoys the slower, soothing songs. However the few faster songs are excellent! Personally, the only flaw in this CD is the fact that Celine has deprived us of her voice in more of the up-beat songs in which she has proved to be very successful with in the past. Conclusively, for a CD from a truely gifted person, it is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back, Celine!","review":"This album is as wonderful as her previous ones. Actually, there are 2 songs on it that made the purchase mandatory (as if there was really any question). Celine's covers of At Last and Nature Boy are fantastic. The power and passion of her voice make these songs every bit as good, albeit different, than when they came out orginally.I realize that some feel that Celine's songs often sound the same, but I don't care. The obvious joy and love of music shows in every song and I enjoy listening regardless.If you like Celine, you should enjoy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celine's Best Ever","review":"I am not a typical pop fan but Celine Dion really stole my heart :-). Her voice is angelic and the songs themselves have been of premium quality (I like 85% of her previous songs, which is a very high percentage for me). I bought this CD without reading any reviews or listening from some sample sites because I have been waiting for her new songs for a long time! It doesn't disappoint me - better still - I love EVERY song inside! There is more variety but the distinctive Celine style is still there. Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Day Worth Waiting For","review":"Well, I'd say that one should definitely listen to this before dismissing it. I won't say it's a totally new and unfamiliar Celine because it isn't. But there's marked development here, with less emphasis on huge flashy production. She still emotes, and that's always been what I like about her. She shows real spirit with such as \\"Right In Front of You\\". That one especially is a bright, happy song. \\"Sorry For Love\\" and \\"Ten Days\\" are other winners. I fear that the cover of \\"Nature Boy\\" might have been a mistake, but not enough of one to hurt. She makes up for it though with \\"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word).There are backup vocals here where there weren't before, and this might indeed displease some longtime fans. But on replay, they come out sounding good.All in all, this is an album to seriously consider, even if you didn't think you liked Celine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes one experience joy and despair simultaneously.","review":"Sue Townsend takes on a morbid subject with style. Christopher is a sad character, but has a new beginning with Angela. To read of a reunited couple after so many years was a joy, even if they were brought together under morbid circumstances. Sue made me hate Crackle and feel deeply sorry for Tamara. I just wanted to take Storme in my arms and protect her from her parents. I am so glad I found this book in Amsterdam.

After discovering Cheryl Wheeler through a friend, I have done my best to share that wonderful talent with as many people as possible. Last night we took some friends to a fantastic performance in Ann Arbor, and she has even more fans today. Her beautiful lyrics, and hauntingly simple melodies, make you feel as if she has always been a part of your life, and knows exactly how you feel.Add to that her wonderful sense of humor, and great ability to change gears in a heartbeat, and you have one of the most versatile, honest performers to grace any stage. How lucky are we to see her in an intimate venue like The Ark!

The tracks found on this album happily take the listener into Cheryl's world, sometimes sad, sometimes happy, sometimes thoughtful--and somehow always enjoyable.This album feels much like a gathering of friends sitting around and playing music together. The songs are seemingly drawn from those closest to Cheryl which allows her to breath life and feeling into each one. Whether she's singing of her neighbors like in Quarter Moon, or 75 September; or love that didn't quite connect as in Almost or Aces.For those that aren't which album of Cheryl's to start with--this is a great place to start. And happily move to the others from here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that funny, but a beautiful voice","review":"I first got to know Cheryl Wheeler from her funny songs on the Sylvia Hotel CD. I also saw her in concert where I was taken with her folksy loving insightful songs. I also thought she was very bright and had an unbelievable way with words. But still the songs that got me most were the ones that were kind of funny. I have to say in a collection album with 19 songs, they are all very somber, and not the funny ones I was looking for. Her voice is beautiful, and the lyrics are still compelling, but don't plan to laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"shipping issues","review":"The CD is a good one but arrived in poor condition.

It sells for under $100 on that auction website that begins with an \\"E.\\" So far I have bought two of them and had no problems with them at all. It is smaller and more compact. It records DVD+R/RW and the recorded discs are fully compatible with Philips DVD players such as the DVD727 and DVP642. One thing the DVDR985 can do that the Medion MD 40570 can't is divide a title. The only other drawback is that it is a much harder process to name titles on the Medion MD 40570. I have no need for that function, however. For a fraction of the cost of the Philips DVDR985 paperweight/clock, you can own the Medion MD 40570 that does everything you need and won't give you any trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run from Philips DVDR985","review":"The engine has been replaced THREE times in two years and is now crapped out again!

To see DVD Recorder output requires using one of the other generous outputs.Tech support also says there is no way to record via i.Link from PC.

Keep in mind that Hip-Hop from that period was not fully appreciated until recently, and Billboard recognized mostly Pop-Rap that crossed over like \\"Parents Just Don't Understand\\", \\"You Can't Touch This\\", \\"Wild Thing\\" or \\"Bust A Move\\" at that time.

Hilda, with sixteen years of a Swedish upbringing and only three years in America (which according to my calculations makes her all of nineteen) is found entering into such wildly diverse activities as rescuing another immigrant wrongly accused of the murder, planting stories in the press, and of course outwitting the police, all while cleaning house. The book is well-researched in terms of the lives of the servant class in the year 1900 but I think Ms. Dams seems more in control of her material when writing about the middle years of her widowed and remarried expatriate Dorothy Martin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The plot to this story was extremely boring with a very weak mystery. The characters were unbelievable and not very likable. Was difficult to even finsh the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"no closed-captioning ??? !!!","review":"I gave this to my wife for Christmas along with other presents including the season 4 DVD - because she loves the show and always DVR's it. (I can't watch the show - it's ridiculous). Anyway, my wife likes to use closed-captioning to make sure that she follows the conversation - but it appears to not be available on either of these DVD's - relatively new products. 'not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghost Adventures Season 3 List","review":"Here's the Offical DVD Menu List.Disc 1:Easten State Penitentiary-Philadelphia, PaRemington Arms Factory-Bridgeport, CTOld Washoe Club/Chollar Mine-Virginia City, NVExecution Rocks Lighthouse-Long Island, NYProspect Place-Trinway, OHDisc 2:Hill View Manor-New Castle, PAWaverly Hills Sanatorium-Louisville, KYVulture Mine-Vulture City, AZLa Palazza-Las Vegas, NVFort Chaffee-Greenwood, ARDisc 3:Armagossa Hotel & Opera House-Death Valley Junction, CAU.S.S.

I DON'T WANT IT BEEPED OUT IF THEY SWEAR I WANT TO HEAR THAT. WE ARE THE PEOPLE BUYING THESE DVD SETS. WHEN I WATCH THEM IN MY HOUSE I WANT TO HEAR EVERYTHING THEY SAY. EVERYTHING, I DON'T CARE HOW BAD YOU THING IT IS. IT SHOULD BE UP TO ME NOT YOU.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly Their Worst Episode","review":"Before you waste your $ and time on this one, they don't find anything at all. There's really no good stories or examples of paranormal activity that witnesses provided, they just go on and on about how they chained prisoners up on the rocks to die at low tide.They hear some minor bumps and knocks, but that's about it.Not very entertaining, but you do get to watch Zach up the ante on dressing and acting like a Jersey Shore douche"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO BAD.","review":"Season 1 started off great but the 2nd disc was all jacked up. Wouldnt work on two different DVD players or the drive on my laptop. I would sent it back but it cost more to send it back than the disk set cost to begin with.Oh well ! Good job Travel Channel."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT CAN I SAY","review":"It's Ghost Adventures,AWESOME show,and in my opinion better then Ghost Hunters !!! If you don't already have this DVD then you need to get out the credit card and buy it :) It arrived on time and in great condition,so THANKS Amazon and sellers for the prompt shipment of my order and YES i'll be buying more things from Amazon in the future,they Rock !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've read the comics, don't buy this video...","review":"The movie is just a bland review of the first comic's plot, but without the character richness and the frightening violence of the books. Maybe did the rating do that, but it really feels like Yukito Kishiro was betrayed in the deal. Other than that, it's a nice and clean anime for teens... but it could have been so much more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends","review":"To begin, I am a die-hard fan of the Battle Angel Alita manga. When I first saw this 'episode' of the Battle Angel anime and the anime version of 'Tears of an Angel' I was very disapointed. I agree with the offcial reveiw that it is impossible to translate Yukito Kishiro's extensive manga into an animated format without losing the incredible artwork. However, the loss of the story is what disapointed me the most.I feel that the depth of the original plot is simply cheapened in the anime. The main villian (Makaku in the manga) has been replaced by a simple \\"brain eating gladiator\\". The intense scenes where Alita attempts to save Koyomi from Makaku are completly left out. The anti-hero Desty Nova, who plays a significant role in the later books, is also missing.If you have never read the manga, you may enjoy this.If you have read and enjoy the manga, you may want to save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool movie ,but the books are better","review":"I saw this movie a while ago and recently bought a copy ,only to once again watch it now.Afterward ,I thought to myself,\\"the books are a whole lot better\\".Don't get me wrong ,the movie is pretty cool ,but that's about it ,because in the books ,you got to see a whole lot of stories develope one from the other.The movie was just a short sum of some of those stories.It's a well told story(in the movie)but things are kinda slowed down and then rushed near the end, kinda leaving you thinking it would be nice to see a series of this story.The movie does no justice to the books ,but visually ,it was totally cool to see one of my favorite characters in motion.Over-all ,the story was cool ,but at the same time, a let-down ,just waiting to be told some more instead of ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite up to par...","review":"Well I must say I was quite disappointed by this video. Having read the manga and being a die-hard fan, I was kind of put out. The name change was utterly horriffic, not to mention the story in general: Basically, for those of you who don't know, they took the first 2 volumes of the greatest series of all time and hacked them up into this video. The change of name to Zolom and the entrance of Sharin, who was never even IN the real thing, made me mad. Not a bad anime on its own though, so see it if you feel like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"Although, unlike most movies, the story for the most part remains true to the books, it just isn't very good. The voices are horrible and they leave out some important stuff. If you just want a nice action film, it's alright, but if you are a fan of the manga, it's down right blasphemy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little Battle Angel goes a long way.","review":"Not as good as the manga but Nobuteru Yuuki's character designs and the weird technobeat soundtrack are good enough to reasons to own this retro classic DVD. A must have for all you Battle Angel fans who are tired of waiting for the Cameron movie to come out.- Nghia"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and interesting.","review":"Battle Angel Alita is a 2 episode OVA based on a popular manga of the same title. The story is deeply emotional and moving, telling of a romance between a cyborg and an obsessed human. Animation is nice and music is very atmospherical and soothing; the ending theme, \\"Just Once,\\" is very enjoyable as well. The only real problem with this OVA is how short it is, but it still has nice character development and plot flow considering its length. A must see for any anime fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stand alone anime","review":"If you are a new anime fan, Battle Angel: hunter warrior is a good place to start. If you're a seasoned vet, then you know this is good. The art looks like it could have been pulled directly from a manga, and for you non Japanese speaking individuals, the dubbing is pretty good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battle Angel","review":"Battle Angel is one of the best anime that I saw. Although story of Battle Angel let me feel sadness, but it caught my attention . The graph and the story are pretty good. It si really good for collecting! So I give the five stars rate in this anime."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Cd's one can get","review":"Even though some people might say German is an ugly language, Deichkind makes it sound good. This german rap crew has demonstrated with this album that it can combine powerful plays on words together with a nice beat and a very catchy melody. And they do this while still being considered an \\"underground\\" crew in germany. I recommend this cd to anybody who likes hip-hop and who can accept the fact that it is in a different language"},{"rating":"2","title":"I think it's worth it...","review":"Like the other reviewer, I saw Bon Voyage on MTV in Germany in 2000. I loved it (especially the bouncing green Mustang, the \\"Green Monsta\\") so I wanted to buy it. And, that I did. I enjoy this cd, as well as groups such as Rammstein and Kraftwerk. I actually don't usually like rap, but this is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"please, know what your talking about before you say things","review":"...Iv played the trial version of Z.O.E 2 on my playstation underground cd, the excitment is never ending, the game is a mix of fast combo mashing battles, techno and orchestrated music,and a great storyline. All of these elements blend perfectly , making an excelent game, it may not have the add campaign that MGS 2 had, but it is sure as hell deservent of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD PACE, GOOD CONTROLS, GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME TO PLAY!","review":"I am a fan of action video games and when this came out I reserved a rental at my store. Now I proud to say that the ZOE club have a decent video game under their belt. This game has a good fighting chemistry as you take control of complex robotic characters that whim through the dark skies and bright looms of green and purple space dust. Anyways if you like games in which you have to clean the sweat marks off the controller you just made from playing a certain game for a long time than I gurantee you as soon as you get into the ZOE zone than you will see for yourself the destiny that awaits of you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does everything that ZOE said it would.","review":"The first Zone of the Enders game was by no means a horrible game. In fact, many people bought just because of the great idea behind it (plus Hideo Kojima slapped his name on it). I mean, huge mech, lightning fast, anime styled battles. The combat delivered, but that was about it except for some flashy graphics. Plus a whiny protagonist thrown into the mix didnt help at all. This game is basically what the first game didnt do + the things it did well. Its an incredible game, pick it up whenever you can. The battles flow better, the hero isnt as annoying, the sub-weapons are actually interesting and everything just flows perfectly. The only flaw i can think of is the plot and the dialogue. The dialogue can be laughable, with the two characters basicallly grunting at each other. The whole \\"big war, bang bang, argh\\" thing is still in place, which was never a great plot in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"VEctor cannon","review":"What an awesome game! all I'v to say is the vs battle was superb where u get to battle against all the defeated bosses or become them. Its pretty challeging with some of the bosses but its all worth it when u recieve ur subweapon called the vector cannon. What power! better than ffx7 13 knight summon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Animated Game to Date","review":"This game puts other games to shame when it comes down to it. It has the best graphics ever seen on the PS2, the story is superb, and the game play is outrageous. This is a must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"extremely well done","review":"i have played this game at my friends house before, and I think it is great. The graphics sound aNd gameplay are all so awesome, and the cel-sahding was a nice touch. i would have rated this 4 and 1/2 but i cant and this is because of the difficulty in boss battles. My friend had to beat everyone of them for me. Overall i think this is one of the best games ive played in a very long time. go out and buy it today"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW Amazing graphics and Great Action Packed Game","review":"WOW!!!! Amazing graphics the story line is ok, The camara angle for multiplayer is very interesting. Some what better than split screen.
