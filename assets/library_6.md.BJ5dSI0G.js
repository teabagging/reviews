Is smaller too, but that is because I didn't read it well enough, a bit too eager to get it in my home.

Adventurous and outgoing when she was busy traveling to Africa as a college professor, she is initially a reluctant tourist of the inner landscape of her life.I became engaged with Elaine's story through her gentle and wry sense of humor, and the delightfully warm cast of characters who offer her support of all kinds along the way.With its elements of sweetness, comfort and intimacy, reading this book reminds me of sharing a cup of coffee with friends over the kitchen table.

It also did not help with the frizziness or fly-away hairs either. I used on towel dried hair and also kept reapplying as I straightened with my flat iron and comb. My hair continued to curl and was a frizzy mess afterward. I also tried using the product simply with a blow dryer and paddle brush and had the same results.Paul Mitchell's Super Skinny Serum is a much better way to go. It works great and leaves my hair shiny, tame, and STRAIGHT!!I really feel like I threw 19 dollars in the garbage!Maybe this product would work well on someone who's hair is not as thick as mine but who knows.If you have very thick hair that's curly or wavy I would definitely go with a different product!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"This product is great.

It is OK but leaves my hair a bit greasy feeling and weighed down and I have to wash my hair more often.So, FYI, I have finally found a product that works the same as the Alterna Hemp Straightening Balm--at least for me, no word from daughter #2 who has curlier hair.

Neither straightened as well as this does. The first few times I used Alterna Hemp, I used too much and it made my hair too soft and it lacked body. I realized I could use half as much of this as I used of the Aveda products, with better results. Unless you have very, very coarse, heavy hair, it can be used very sparingly - which makes it an even better value. I also find my hair is no longer dry - so it apparently moisturizes, too.

I expected the book to give me more history of Lily Dale and the Spiritualist movement. It's mostly about the author's one summer in Lily Dale. The story continually comes back to the author's life, perceptions, etc. instead of exploring some of the profound experiences some people in town had. I think a big opportunity was missed.Additionally, as a man, I felt alienated. Wicker presented the story as a womens' club. I recognize the population of Lily Dale is predominantly female, but does that mean men have no place in spiritualism? There were some men present in the classes, though very few. So that makes the men in Lily Dale the real news. Why were they there? I don't know, it's not covered.The book is really more of a memoir of one skeptical woman's quest to find some kind of supernatural experience. I'm not even sure Lily Dale needed to be mentioned at all in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lily Dale","review":"I love this book! It is a story of the town of Lily Dale, its history, its inhabitants and even some of its visitors. It is compelling and honest.

I know for certain that I have learned much more than I ever could on my own about the mediums and townsfolk. I strongly recommend Lily Dale to any one who is interested in Spiritualism, psychic mediums, or what we find when we cross over."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good starting place","review":"Recently I heard of Lily Dale for the first time, and this book provided a good introduction. (I wonder how it happened that Lily Dale, and the great Chautauqua Institution ... so alike and yet so different .... ended up almost in the same neighborhood!)The book is a LITTLE bit about Lily Dale history and the Spiritualist religion and a LOT about the town's inhabitants and the author's experiences over the course of her first summer there.I had some trouble keeping all the characters straight. Chapter headings, better organization, or photos of the residents might have helped with that.

Next is \\"Be With You\\" a breathy disco track with a catchy chorus. Other highlights on the album are \\"Everything Goes Around\\", \\"If You Come To Me\\", the gorgeous \\"Someone Like Me\\" and \\"Nothing In The World\\". As for more dance tracks, there's \\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\\", \\"Somebody Like Me\\" and \\"Loving You\\". The only bland moment on the album is the song \\"Don't You Know\\", but the rest is pure class.

The eponymous music teacher is played by the great Belgian baritone Jose Van Dam - his singing of Mahler's \\"Ich bin der welt abhanden gekommen\\" is as good as it (that is, life) gets. The singing competition is pretty obvious, even silly, but it's a small price to pay for what is otherwise a musical gem.

Matthews character, that of his ex-fiance and the frenchman are well defined and in my opinion likable, but megs character was flat, she did her best but there just wasnt much to work with. we learn the backgrounds of the other three main characters fairly well, but hers is lacking. her character needed a few weeks of overhaul and maybe another actress all together: i think Minny Driver would have been good still Ryan did what she could with the part. its a good movie to watch if you've ever been dumped AND it gives us a few ideas besides the flaming bag of dog poo on the porch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meg Ryan at her most beautiful...","review":"Simply put, this was a very entertaining vehicle for both Matthew and Meg.

Both have mastered their craft and can deliver the a line, no matter how brief, with all the nuances of paragraphs of subtext, perhaps a function of excellent direction...I don't know.

Now Broderick and Ryan are teaming up to get even with their ex's. The problem is, the offenses they've endured (being dumped and being used) don't really warrant the horrible things they do to these two people, especially Karyo. Which is probably why first-time director Griffin Dunne used two such amiable stars in the feature roles. After all, how can we not root for Ferris Bueller and Harry's Sally? Unfortunately, it ends up being pretty easy not to root for them when their revenge is so excessive, the pace of the film is so uneven, and the script isn't particularly funny.There's a difference between black comedy and just mean-spirited comedy.

Of course, you can tell what happens next....Broderick rushes to New York and starts spying on his girlfriend and her new French lover...This is not a great film...the cast is awkward and lopsided, the plot is ridiculous, and the dialogue not zingy enough to even merit a second viewing. Two thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Science Better Than Widescreen LCD","review":"This movie had the magical Camera obscura (sp?) that made me want to share it with my wife, had to buy it. She liked it, although terrible things happened to the guy who hooked up with his childhood sweetheart. Revenge isn't always sweet, but was funny if you have no empathy for the guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"I am a tour guide in Boston. A friend gave me this book for Christmas.

I continue to use it every week. The message it gives to young children is most valuable when trying to instill patience and understanding. It teaches that we are all the same, reguardless of the color of our skin. I hope that it will be reprinted again and again so that others will have the oportunity to enjoy it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding book of wisdom for children of all ages!","review":"I read this book to my fifth grade students as we study the Civil Rights Movement. They love the story and the pictures! Eventhough it is a book for early readers, it has a strong message. The Land of Many Colors teaches us to judge each other \\"not by the color of our skin, but by the content of our character.&quot"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Movie that Inspired Hogan's Heroes...","review":"While this movie is more serious than Hogan's Heroes, it is delightfully entertaining and includes several comedic moments. William Holden plays a crafty character that is not all that different from his role in the Bridge Over the River Kwai. He has a stash of goods he uses to bribes the guards to gain favors. His fellow POWs suspect he is providing information to the their German captors. Peter Graves is a German spy posing as a prisoner. William Holden discovers Peter Graves is a spy and waits for a critical moment to expose him. Robert Strauss as \\"Animal\\" provides great comic relief. In one scene, an inebriated Animal, mistakes a fellow prisoner for Betty Grable."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT WAR CLASSIC","review":"THIS COVERS A LOT WILDERS' OWN CLASSIC STYLE IN MOVIE MAKING WITH A GREAT CAST. THIS CATCHES SOME OF ELEMENTS OF WAR THAT OTHERS FORGET, OR DISMISS. FOR THE YOUNG IT SHOWS THE WAYS SOME WERE BETRAYED, AND HOW OTHERS SURVIVED.

Its a psychological drama and it doesn't get much better then this."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the two best WW II Prison camp movies..","review":"Stalag 17, the inspiration for Hogan's heroes, is a great adaptation of a stage play. Not quite as good as The Great Escape, a definite step up from Von Ryan's Express. The cast is strong, and William Holden is perfect in the role of the cynical sergeant who knows something's amiss in the sergeant's barracks of Stalag 17. I also feel like the movie captures some of the essentially mundane aspects of military life very well. Recommended to any WW II fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie ever made!!","review":"This movie is very well directed and the main charecter is one the best actors that was ever in a movie.( William Holden). If you ever want to see a good movie here it is. Kids- adults will love the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"William Holden as a defiant POW who defies the odds","review":"William Holden carries the movie as the disliked, resented and misunderstood \\"hero\\". Otto Premminger, who also starred as the German P.O.W. camp C.O., directs a wonderful film full of emotion, humor and triumph. The last 10 minutes is one of the best climaxes in film history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas movie!","review":"What, you say? Yes, the setting here is around Christmastime and this movie is exceptional. Well acted and directed, don't miss it if you haven't seen it yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"At ease! At ease!","review":"The only thing that keeps this one from being just about perfect is the obnoxiousness of Robert Strauss and Harvey Lembeck. Their antics are unbearable, especially in a movie as rich and crucial as this. Although Wilder somehow evaded the McCarthyite witch-hunts (his stint with the government in post-war Germany perhaps?) \\"Stalag 17\\" is his blacklist movie; it exposes the self-righteousness of those whose suspicions focus on the innocent. William Holden's Sefton may seem to be collaborating with the camp guards but he's merely doing business -- would he be quite so nakedly opportunistic and blase if he was really the collaborator? Strauss and Lembeck aside, this is one of Wilder's most incisive meoldramas, and Holden is superb. It's not perhaps as great a performance as the one he gave in \\"Sunset Blvd.,\\" but it's pretty damn close."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie I can watch over and over","review":"This movie is a classic. I can watch Bill Holden's jerk of a character over and over again. I heard an actor say that every actor is particularly good at playing an archetype. In the case of William Holden, he played the character you love to hate impeccably. I would recommend this movie to any classic movie fan and any war movie fan. It's a great comedy and action flick all rolled into one. Buy it now before they stop making copies."},{"rating":"1","title":"let the buyer beware","review":"Warning; Just because Amazon tells you a film is in color, don't bet the farm that it will be in color as they advertised.

Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"What movies should be","review":"When people find out that my favorite movie is Stalag 17, they usually say \\"What?\\" I try to explain that this movie is what movies should be. Entertaining because of the people making the movie. Not special effects. There aren't many actors today who could pull this movie off as is. That is both a tribute to the actors and Billy Wilder, and an indictment of today's Hollywood.

We had a very hard time understanding why there was no anger involved in this incident. How could Eva not have been even a little bit angry at her parents for doing this to her? Many of the students in our book discussion group could not connect with the relationship between Eva and her mother. Most thought the book was extremely unemotional, a surprise considering the topic. Some students, however, felt that it was an example of the coldness of our society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eva in science class?","review":"Don't let your middle school science teacher assign this maybe-interesting read to your class, gives it a grandiose position it doesn't deserve in the science community.

The plot was not very appealing, but since the story takes place in the future, some of the technology that is described is very interesting. Also, the procedures done to Eva make you think. Could it really happen in the future? Is it moral or ethical? All that was good in the book. The characters, on the other hand, were undeveloped (except maybe for Eva). In parts, the story seemed to be sloppily written. Also, I was disappointed with how the story ended.

(I love reading and I read all the time.) But he didn't do enough with these concepts and it was unsatisfying. Some parts were interesting and made you want to read more, but then it got boring again. It was ALMOST a good book. It was quite depressing as well--practically all animals are extinct, and humans are spontaneously commiting suicide (yeah, right)! The technology and science weren't really believable. I couldn't believe that Eva would become that much like a chimp when the scientists said they erased all of Kelly's memory. And since they didn't transplant Eva's actual brain (they just \\"programmed in her neuron pathways\\" or something), why did the chimp become Eva herself, instead of Kelly thinking like Eva?

This book is designed for Donald Trump, not for the early or even moderate real estate investor.Unless your attempting to buy vacant land in Nevada and build your own version of Las Vegas, I would pass on this book. It contains virtually nothing for anyone wanting to buy a residence of any fashion, unless you want the 400 unit apartment complex, and if that is the case, you really don't need this book.William J.

The misleading pictures of Monopoly houses on the cover suggest small-scale residential investing, but the properties under discussion are the size of an entire Boardwalk. Frankly, the whole \\"game\\" analogy may sound like fun, but is nothing more than representing economic forces, e.g. the cost to borrow money, as \\"cards\\" one draws. Ho hum. If you don't have millionaire investors as friends or a job doing due dilligence for huge developments like shopping centers, warehouses, etc., this scale of this book is much too grand.

But for the midsized investor - doing $500,000 to $1,000,000 deals - the book offers very little pratical knowledge. I thought it too academic.I have developed a modest real estate portfolio ( approx. 5 million)over ten properties.

Leveraging current properties, detecting growth trends.etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother reading.","review":"Can't recommend this book, thumb down. He tries to appeal to an advanced or institutional real estate audience but then gets bogged down trying to explain introductory concepts. An entire chapter is spent explaining NOI, which is explained everywhere else (and his audience would have an advanced understanding).On the other hand, if his audience is the general public, then most of what he writes is not of any benefit and possibly too advanced. The result is mushy generalities. If you want useful detailed real estate literature go to the specialty publishers/societies like ULI, BOMA, CRE, IREM, CCIM, ARES, PWC-Korpacz, and AI, not Barnes & Nobles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a get rich quick scheme","review":"William Poorvu teaches at the Harvard Business School and also invests and develops on his own.

Judith herself seems like she has lost her gumption along with her wit and is just rambling through this story trying to out-do her hubby in guessing the murderer, even though she denies it. There is no heart in her sleuthing and even Renie seems less like Renie. Even Gertrude was down right annoying and I usually just find her annoyingly funny!

It was originally undertaken to prove that 'vodka' was invented first in Russia in an attempt to fight off attempts by Poles to usurp the name 'vodka' in international trade.Though there is undoubtedly much research that went into this work, the author does his readers a great disservice by his arrogance and cultural prejudices. Though his facts seem solid, his interpretation tends to be circular and often one conclusion is built on a whole chain of very shaky intermediate claims. His main conclusion, that vodka was invented not only soley by Russians, but in Moscow as well, is reached, by among other devices, carefully defining the product first.Nonetheless, the work is of some interest, but it really does need to be taken with more than a grain of salt.

This CD is just plain awfull and I think I have an eclectic music taste. This is TRANCE music, only one track remained in my collection and that was \\"Chitagong Chill\\". The rest were trash.I should have known because I purchased \\"Ha\\" before, another Talving Singh CD and only one track was good on that one \\"Mustard Fields\\". You really have to be spaced out on acid to get into any of this stuff if you ask me. I made myself a note to NEVER purchase another Talvin Singh CD.

James Caan played a man who used his son to act like a lost boy to gain access to houses so his father could rob them. His son was still a young boy but was tired of his father's thefts, when he noticed that one family he went to as a lost boy had kept guns. I won't say anything more except that he let his father in when the family was still awake and he was supposed to wait until they were asleep. James Caan as the father was very evil. Dennis Quaid as the son was very kind. This movie shows that biology does not necessarily determine behavior. You have free will. I felt the ending was sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take It For What It Is ..Newcomers Are Better Served With Aswad Crucial Tracks Compilation","review":"A pretty composite overview of their long then career tracing their shifts from a jazzy reggae band deep within rasta roots to their later day soul infected,randb fusion sound.Not much additional material for the collector,a live track not on the fine Live And Direct, some 12\\" mixes,1 previously unreleased track..The single CD collection Crucial Tracks is a better introduction and their 2 good albums recorded for CBS, A New Chapter and Not Satisfied are omitted (yes,this is the Island anthology)here..a drawback since these 2 albums were warm,laidback in a very steady groove later metamorphosed into killer live versions on Live and Direct which this collection spotlights.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable bore","review":"I have a moderate interest in philosophy, and watched that recent show on PBS called Consolations of Philosophy, with some interest.

Queen Are unique and this is a five stars record."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic \\"must-have\\" for any Queen fan.","review":"This album is in the classic Queen style. They are the masters of overdubbing and vocal decadence and this album really shows that off. It's personally one of my favorites, \\"Somebody to Love\\" especially. As with many albums, there will always be a song or two that maybe aren't to your taste (me? I don't like \\"White Man\\" but that's just me) but if you are a Queen fan or even you're just a fan of their classic \\"Behemian Rhapsody\\" (from \\"A Night at the Opera\\"), you'll find plenty here to entertain you.

After a striking multi-layered intro, comes the smashing \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\". Mercury's \\"You Take My Breath Away\\" is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. Some of Freddies most fun and creative moments are found on \\"The Millionaire Waltz\\", \\"Somebody To Love\\" and \\"Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy\\". May shines on this one too. \\"Long Away\\" is a sort of folk like number I find hard to resist. \\"White Man\\" is a combination ballad and heavy metal written in the perspective of the Native American, that is one of my favorite Queen songs. Another favorite is \\"Teo Torriatte\\" sung partially in Japanese and an amazing achievement. It ends the same as it began and just makes you want to play it all over again. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"If you're wondering where you should begin when buying Queen's albums, then buy \\"A Day at the Races\\" along with \\"A Night at the Opera\\".

This is Queen in 1976. Right after the masterpiece \\"A Night At the Opera\\", and right before another genius album \\"News Of the World\\", Every Queen fan will probably tell you that this is their favorite or close to it. As an album compared to other music of other artists it is great. But, compare it to other Queen music and it doesn't stand up. It sounds like a lot of effort went into the production of this album, but maybe not as much to the songwriting. There are great songs like \\"You & I\\", \\"You Take My Breath Away\\" and \\"Good Old Fashioned Loverboy\\" . The rest are mediocre at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"The counterpart to Opera","review":"Again, Queen does not stay in one musical genre with Races.

This is probably a weird statement to make, but when you think outside of the box, they have many different uses:- Curtain rod hangers(recently tried this in a nursery and it adds a very modern touch to hanging curtains, plus they glide perfectly on the rod)- Study card holder(hole-punched the corner of index cards and had handy flashcards in minutes)- Picture holder(used this concept on a film set and had location shots, favorite camera angles, and crew contact information all together on one ring)- Book Rings(why not state the obvious, right?)Unlike binders, these rings do not tend to lose their ability to snap together. In other words, they don't bend out of shape easily.50 may seem like a lot, but you'll find uses for them eventually."},{"rating":"2","title":"very handy","review":"This loose binder rings are perfect for what I needed them for.

So much cheaper than actual shower rings.

A very informative and useful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written guide to Info Security","review":"This book focuses on what is, or should be, the most valuable part of any information system, the information. The book guides the reader from the very basics (the definition of information), explains cryptography, then recommends methods of securing the information system. The book is intended for college students but would benefit anyone who has an interest in learning more about information security and why it is important in the Internet age. The CD included with the book is very well done. It has many programming examples as well as interactive chapter tests and question sessions with the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"NQ + (x) = Excellence","review":"Doug Lofstrom and the New Quartet do a fantastic job on this album. Doug Lofstrom's original compositions makes up a majority of the music, along with African Marketplace by Abdullah Ibrahim, and Doug Lofstrom's arrangement of \\"Jigs and Airs\\" which is comprised of traditional Irish music. All of Doug Lofstrom's pieces take you on a journey along a winding road that explores interesting jazz rhythms, great harmonies, interesting chord progressions, and challenging solos. African Marketplace, by Abdullah Ibrahim is a fun and entertaining piece that depicts a walk through an African Marketplace on a busy day. The New Quartet performs brilliantly. There's a certain quality and excitement in the music that shows the whole group truly enjoys what they're playing, and they play it really, really well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Documentary","review":"This is an excellent documentary. Of course, it includes the famous newsreel and radio broadcast of the airship's destruction, but it also describes the history of airships and sets forth the political and economic circumstances surrounding the Hindenburg.

In The Truth About Jane, Stockard Channing, one of my favorites, is fantastic in this true story about a teenager that decides to explore her sexual lesbian identity and how all hell breaks out as a result. It's especially poignant for me knowing that these films are all based on real events and real stories. This film held me and my family totally engrossed in the story and what was great is that it was not one sided, rather we can understand the feelings from both sides, from the mother's point of view and the daughter's as well. Jean Smart in Change of Heart is brilliant. She's one of the most underrated actresses around, in my opinion, and the story is mesmerizing. A great grouping of films so far, looking forward to seeing Her Desperate Choice over the weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but not a pre-requisite","review":"The adverse excursion evaluation and exploitation does play an important role in systematic trading, however, the book later on skin-deep touches trading management and betting strategies, which in turn do not have much to do with the title of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"It's large, cumbersome, underpowered and slow.

Worse yet was my 'quest' on the unit to find a way to get to the 'replaceable battery. The only visible screw on the unit was at the back end of the handle and was of the Allen [sp?] variety. Not one of my set of 11 Allen bits would fit.Possibly the saddest part was that I purchased this at the retail price of $30.

I have found that if I place my pants in the press with the front crease of my pants placed on the left side of the pressing table by the locking latch, the pressing results are very good. When the pants are placed thusly the Corby 3300 press consistantly reinforces the commerically pressed original crease on the pants' legs.

This is by far the worst video I have ever used. The routines are extremely boring and the music is horrible. Furthermore, there is no ambiance -- the video set is dull. Exercising to this tape was so painful, I could not finish it. I will give this tape away. This tape can not compare to my Reebok Step Videos by Gin Miller. I have every one (that I know about). Gin Miller arranges energetic step routines with lots of non-stop movement. Besides that, her team is fit and ready, the music is great, and the video sets look like exercise studios!

Margaret Bennet certainly used her resources well, however, I felt there was just too much information in a single book. The anecdotes were educational and humorous.

While I applaude Mrs. Bennett for her presentation of the customs I sought, I was disappointed in it. Based upon my experience, I could not recommend the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, boring, repetitive","review":"I picked up this book because i am traveling to Scotland in the fall and i wanted to go deep into the Scots culture.Sadly, this book was basically a waste of time.The only thing the author does is interview later generations of Scots to know about what are the customs in Scotland.The book becomes an endless sea of paragraphs just repeating what the other paragraph stated.Basically, what you read it just old people recalling the same events and rituals with minor variations which makes for a very boring reading.The author fails to try to understand where those rituals and traditions came from.She fails to go deep into what this traditions and customs reflect on the whole country.Is just a dull collection of repetitive stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scottish Customs","review":"Takes you by the hand and walks you through day-to-day customs: courting, birth, baptism, relationships, marriage, death.

The concept of a future bride carrying a chamber pot from house to house where she jumps over the pot several times in front of each door (filled with salt) and people insert coins into the salt is a delight.

Through friends and sample CDs I have heard a few different renditions by her. I anticipated the receipt of this album.

This recording is a dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing sonsgtress, magnificent musicality of Washington","review":"I think Dinah Washington sounds best vocally in this compilation of ballads and standards.

I have heard her other CD's but for me, this is one CD which I can play in the background as I eat my favorite foods during a quiet and rainy afternoon and think about the day that has passed. Quiet times with a musician of her great artistry mark this CD of Miss Washington... extraordinary voice and delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"The rollercoaster of love","review":"Few seem to bother noticing that What a Diff'rence a Day Makes! was a concept album. Side A of the original LP consists of after-the-breakup songs of longing, remembrance, misery and regret. Then, flip the LP over, and Side B begins with the sun-breaking-through-the-clouds of the title tune, as the lovers in this song cycle get back together. Side B takes you through the giddiness of love and then back towards the growing realisation that things will go sour again. Listened to as an entire album, Dinah's beautiful vocal performance, set against these haunting arrangments, makes for an emotionally-wrenching experience.

It feels and looks cheap. You would think after spending 100 dollars the quality would at a minimum match that of James Avery but you can not even compare the two. I could bend the medallion with my fingers that is how thin it is possibly about as thick as one milimeter or so. 2nd the chain that the came with it looks like it should be made for a child instead of an adult. It looks cheap and is far to small to go with the medallion and i'm not talking about the length of the necklace but i'm talking about the links of the chain. If you have seen baby necklaces and how small the links are this chain is 18' of that.

King and T-Bone Walker, or the acoustic rural blues of countless Delta-bluesmen from the last century. But he was no mere copycat; you felt the passion Bloomfield invested in anything he played, regardless of the type of music.

I do not want to give too much away, but the movie seemed to be building nicely until a ridiculous plot twist involving Olivia Wilde. It is sci-fi so I am willing to suspend belief up to a certain point if a script is written well; but after the aforementioned plot twist, the movie started to unravel and go down hill in a rapid, gravity-fueled inferno.

I'm including this on this site hoping someone will let the PsTB (powers that be) know that if they seriously think I'm going to spend good money, especially the incredibly inflated prices they demand when a movie is new, with out knowing what I'm getting, they are seriously deluded. This movie was distributed by Universal Studios Home Entertainment and this practice of not including extras on their rental discs is a growing travesty. I'm recommending that all of us who want the extras and want to see them before we buy the movie stop buying anything from Universal as a protest. At least that is what I'm going to do.

Even though the torture was shroud in darkness, you knew exactly what was happening and I just want to throw up. I'm NOT a fan of any sort of sicko horror movies and I feel rather dismayed and mislead to the nature of the film.

I give it 4 stars for the effort and the acting is always magnifiscent from harrison ford suprisingly. At first I was like \\"oh no, not another alien movie.\\" But they did put a twist on it not just with the cowboys, but also with smaller stories within the movie. I am being generous in giving the 4 stars because this film didn't leave me with any \\"wow \\" moments or saying i can't wait to buy this movie on dvd, or anything. I want to say it left a bad taste in my mouth because the whole alien and amnesia thing has been played to death and now they are just putting cowboys in there, but overall it's a decent film and you'll get your money's worht. No complaints here from this movie out of me. It just wasn't one of this year's best films for me but an entertaining 2 years. And i like their effort on the plot.

Daniel Craig takes himself a bit too seriously here, Harrison Ford getting it exactly right, and this is definitely a film where you have to check your brain at the door AND be willing to suspend your logic for awhile. The VERY talented supporting cast, especially, are terrific here at supporting the bigger names; without them, even with Craig and Ford starring, I don't think I would have enjoyed this as much as all.

Besides having two high quality actors (Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig) the plot was almost too simple for the average viewer and very corny. I understand mixing the two genres of western movies and sci-fi flicks probably hasn't been done before but this wasn't the best way to go about doing it. The aliens and their ships did seem pretty cool but theres very well done CGI in many other sci-fi movies plus they didn't show the aliens that clearly. Olivia Wilde has been good in other movies but looked totally out of place and did a poor job of acting in this movie. Overall though the plot, certain scenes in the movie, and poorly done scenery with CGI and the actors made it look to be a level right above \\"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\\" (A B-rated movie).

I am tempted to say anyone writing a positive review on this movie is a paid flack, a shill, but maybe it is just irrationaly loyal Ford fans.

Yup, that didn't make sense at all when I first heard about it. I saw it less than an hour ago on blu-ray, and no regrets. It was a little boring at first, but the story got better, and so did the action. I don't want to ruin the movie, but expect a lot of action. A bit emotional scene to make the story flow, but don't expect much of that. This movie actually makes more sense then what the title says. The scenery is great too. It was worth spending 2 hours watching. Probably not worth watching in the theater, or buying the movie. I would not watch it again, but rent it if you want to check it out. The overall movie is more like 3.5 stars, but 4 stars since harrison ford is in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A+","review":"My husband loved this movie! It was action packed and interesting.

I enjoyed the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining!","review":"I love watching movies with Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig, both great actors so I decided to buy this movie.

I've seen those aliens in other movies. They are always slimy. They are technologically advanced, but really stupid and we can easily defeat them. There is always a space ship that has a core which has to be blown up. Of course, wrist weapon is a must, aliens' version of Spiderman weapon. Craig is good for a hero.

A rousing if preposterous adventure blending two of Hollywood's most treasured genres--the epic western and the sweeping science fiction.Director Jon Avnet does his Spielbergian best in pulling out all the stops in this entertaining film.Daniel Craig trades tuxes and his Astin Martin for denims and beer as the mysterious drifter who butts heads with gruff town bully Harrison Ford in battling unusual outlaws--bloodthirsty aliens out to steal the gold and the town's citizens. The fine supporting cast includes Olivia Wilde, Sam Rockwell, Keith Carradine, Clancy Brown and Walton Goggins. The alien creatures are excellent and special effects are state of the art.The movie is fun to watch and original in its execution.

The hot chickseemed to be thrown in there gratuitously, and didn'treally fit the part she played.

Yes, some people would want the DVD+Digital Copy, but why should I have to pay for something I don't want or need. I've already switched all our DVD players in the house for Blu-rays so I have no need for a DVD copy and I'm from old school and at this point, I don't want to mess with digital copies of movies. I'll make this the first movie that I will refuse to buy (combo). I'll just wait for my turn to get it from Netflix to watch. On another note, I don't want no part of 3D. It get's old fast and it seems to me, that they're concentrating more on something coming at you, then on the quality of the movie on the whole. Special effects are great, but you don't have to do them in 3D to make them great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"this is a good mix of western and science fiction. this is a awesome movie. i love this movie. i love the story and the actors are awesome. this is a out of this world movie. great for western and science fiction fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've been warned","review":"I wanted to like it.

You have to get midway through before the plot really becomes understandable at all. There was NO need for letterbox, and had I known this I would NEVER have ordered it - it was not a Lawrence of Arabia, for God's sake!Ford and Craig must be desperate for roles. I never like Craig as 007, can never take the place of Sean Connery, Timothy Dalton or Pierce Brosnan, but I blame this movie's lack of good direction on the Director, and the dark recordings on Dreamworks and Universal. After Craig was half-way acceptable in Casino and Quantum (007), he is just barely acceptable here. And Ford, after those Marvelous Indiana Jones movies is really having to stretch here. Both of their acting does neither any credit. If you want a good ALIEN movie, a BELIEVABLE one, buy Alien and Aliens with Sigoourney Weaver. At least you can see most of those and they are beLIEVable.Cecy Ivie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad script, bad genre and bad acting","review":"Would not recommend this movie to anyone able to form two or more sylables.

Having said that, the movie is really not worth the price of a movie house admission. SCI FI at its worst. The first part of the movie, about an hour or so, it is very slow even though greatly acted out by Ford and Craig. Nothing is new or refreshing about this movie. Let's see, the cattle baron rules over an entire western town.......Old stuff from old westerns. The Aliens themselves, seem to be taken out of the movie ALIEN. So, not much creativity there. I said it in one of my previous posts, whatever happened to good movie writers lately in Hollywood? The plot and the dialogue were really silly at times. And I also have seen better CG in other SCI FI movies. Great, if you want to watch it on Netflix or cable, but not worth it the admission fee at the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"AND?","review":"tiresome acting with over the top special effects. it's getting old. what should of been a blockbuster leaves me wanting my money back and the 2 hrs spent watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Film I Have Seen In Years","review":"Made the mistake of watching this \\"film\\" last night. Haven't seen anything this bad in years. Lifeless acting, unbelievable plot twists (even for Sci-Fi), convoluted story line, obscene violence and torture, and the kind of character development that makes bread mold watchable.

It could have been a decent Western (tell me Daniel Craig isn't Steve McQueen reincarnated) or fairly good 'Aliens are here to kill us movie', but in combo it totally didn't work for me.

I was expecting an exciting action movie and a terrible story line. Instead you got a mix of a love story, a tale of redemption, a tale of revenge, and a tale of the potential for humanity to be destroyed. And none of these stories were very good. On top of that there is about 30 minutes of action in the entire film.

Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie, but the human drama in between alien attacks is old fashioned and familiar. Example? Gruff, stubborn rancher Harrison Ford distrusts Indians, but later has to save the Indian chief in the heat of battle, and the two make eye contact and nod to each other out of respect. As a fan of westerns, i've seen that moment countless times before in other movies. Still, its all in good fun and very well produced. Daniel Craig makes a great cowboy and Harrison Ford was excellent.

The dub is okay, mostly because that's the only way I've been able to watch it, so I'll have to find the time for the Japanese version one of these days. If your wallet can handle the hit and you have a weekend with nothing to do, I highly recommend this anime. After FY, try some of the others by Yu Watase like Ceres and Alice 19th (which is still just in manga form)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yucko.","review":"Fushigi Yuugi - quite possibly the most overrated shoujo anime ever. Formulaic plots, whiny one-dimensional \\"heroines,\\" super cheesey dialogue, and lazy animation to boot. Stay clear of this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"This show is way too overrated!Ok,so you have a whiny girl who eats everything she sees and never gains weight.And then you have bishounen who all fall for the her!And plus,the rape scenes in here are way out of place!It could have been good,but I just couldn't bring myself to like it.Miaka and Tamahome fall in love way too fast and screaming each other's name every five minutes get so annoying!But,I'm not saying someone else might not like it.I just hated it.Maybe if the characters were more mature,I might have enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Enchanting Story","review":"This anime touched my heart completly and is by far to me the most interesting anime I've ever watched. The love, the drama, the funny, the sadness, the rage, was all contained in the \\"Mysterious Play\\" It had me so moved that I even wished that something of such existed in the real world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definetly worth it","review":"Okay, First I have to say that I never comment on anything unless it's terrible or terribly good. And this was it. This series is spectacular. The theme is kind of girly but a couple of my guy friends (and we're talking football jocks that only really like Jerry Springer) Could get into this series. The animation was beautiful. It was done in a slightly panned over style that takes some getting used to but over all done very well. The story line was very interesting and you could almost never guess what was happening. And I must say that the relationship between Tasuki an Tamahome is hilarious. Maybe it's my, lets just say interesting type of humor. Overall the series is one to own if you're into a romantic/adventurous/betrayal/fighting type series. And believe me, it has all of this roled up in one. But be warned it can be addiciting, so make sure to resort to some self control. By and By, get the DVD set. Way better. Sincere., A gigantic fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance, Action, WAFF... FY has it ALL!","review":"First let me say that I'm not too much into Shoujo anime, but I'm going to make an exception for an exceptional anime. Fushigi Yuugi TOTALLY ROCKS! The characters are 3 dimensional and most of them have very realistic personalities (I know a girl who's a lot like Miaka). The viewers are taken on an emotional rollercoaster with the characters. If you like romance stories you'll absolutely LOVE Fushigi Yuugi. Whether you're a guy or girl you'll fall in love with the characters. As other reviews have mentioned, it does become stale a few times, but they are few and far between. Fushigi Yuugi has definitely taken a place among my favorite animes. The DVD sound quality is also excellent and the picture is crisp and clear throughout most of it. It's everything I'd expect from a Pioneer DVD release; that is, excellent quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for most...others - read this.","review":"It's a beautiful series with a great mix of humor, joy & sorrow. I'd highly recommend it to anyone that is fairly open minded or wants their children to be...but for those who are not, or do not raise your children to be, you might not want this. It's got a few, maybe 2 at most, swear words, some love triangles (some with \\"forbidden\\" or not always excepted same genders), also a very brief Miaka nudity...but it's very PG13. I let my children watch it & we have no problems with them not understanding or liking it. But I just wanted you to be forwarned. Thanks for reading. ^_^"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great job by Pioneer","review":"Since most of these reviews are on the actually show itself, I'll comment on the packaging and extras. I like this packaging better than the Tenchi Muyo DVD set. It has a nice gold-foil emblem on the front, and a clear slipcase with the logos and art printed on that. This is most welcome, since the Tenchi case shows wear after a few months of use. The disc trays are clear with artwork showing through. Each disc and background art are a different color. It includes a full-color booklet with chapter and character info. Also in there are voice talent and production credits. The dubbing is good; certainly not the best. The animation and story are excellent. Can't wait for the second set! (Pioneer also has the rights to Akira so we can expect a DVD release sometime next year! )"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE GREAT ANIME","review":"This series is about a girl named miaka and how she was transported into the book of the four gods. The first time she was there with her friend Yui, they were attacked by slavetraded and were rescued by a boy with an ogre symbol on his forward. Being the teenagers they are they fall in love with him. Later we find out that Miaka is the priestess of suzaku and how she has to find the suzaku seven..I think this is a wonderful anime with a great story line but like most of the series that i read first as manga, I was really disappointed with the voices. Miakas voice is way too high pitched and makes her really annoying. Other then that i cant find many other flaws in it. I highly recommend it and any of Yuu watase's works for anyone who likes shojo."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST SHOJOU EVER","review":"This is the best shojou anime ever. I continuously say that because it's true. This isn't an anime for boys, really. There are fight scenes but there's too much romance in here. Go back to watching your dumb Chobits or Tenchi Muyo's. Anyway, this anime will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and you will definitely love the romance and the love triangles in this anime. There's also a slight slice of life in there between Miaka and Yui, it's a common thing, happens all the time. I recommend this to anybody who's in love with love and triangles, and adventure. What doesn't this anime have? People don't like the fact that Miaka eats and eats and doesn't gain weight, I think it's to do with what girls want. Girls want to eat sweets and not gain weight, girls want fantasy and adventure and to be surrounded by bishounen. I definitely recommend this, a major soap opera anime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"simply AMAZING!!!","review":"best anime ever! it's beautifuly done! the story is so cool..trust me it's worth ur time and money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and unintelligent","review":"I can't belive I ordered this thing.First of all, it wasn't created with DVD in mind, so the quality isn't too good (unlike Cowboy Bebop, for example). But the main problem is that this thing sucks so much!It was nice and funny until episode 9, but after that it started to be based on tragedies.. just like that, with no warnings.In addition, Miaka, the main character, is horribly dumb, and it doesn't make sense that such a bucko would lead the gang. There's bad mixture between humor and tragedy there, and the music repeats itself too - you'll get sick of it very soon.The characters look cute, though. So I'd recommend downloading pictures of them instead of buying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool.....you know!","review":"A very good film. A lot better than most cartoons are! The plot is interesting, and characters r very very cool! The minute I started waching it I couldn't stop, time went by sooo quickly.

If you the type that likes a movie with a little of everything (comedy, action, drama, etc.), well this is the one to check out. The storyline just engulfs you.

You can't go wrong with this anime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fushigi Yuugi","review":"Fushigi Yuugi(a Mysterious Play), is surely one of the best anime titles out on the market to date. It is an intricately woven story of love and friendship. Of course, a love story can never be without a love triangle. The story brings together elements of laughter, sorrow, hatred, and pity. Even though the story seems aimed for more of a Shojo or young girls audience(15+), it touches each and everyone of us. This title is a definate buy. Yuu Watase has given us one of her best, and we shall always cherish it as one of the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"The First Half of This Series Needs a Debunking","review":"I like Fushigi Yuugi, but you know what? The first half wasn't very good. The second half is so much better despite the fact that Tamahome and Miaka are as prevailent as ever. The first half was mediocre at best. Weak animation and bland coloring, plenty of Miaka and Tamahome, and not nearly enough Seiryu action or enough Yui screentime. I don't understand all this Yui bashing Yui is wonderfully developed character. She's infinentely interesting to watch. While Miaka............ >.< When people point out her \\"good traits\\", they aren't very good and don't make up for her predictability. All the eating so much jokes are nice and dandy but it's old. REALLY old. It's not funny anymore. Just find a place to rent these tapes subtitled (its dub is bad and it sucks in the second half too) because it's necessary to see the first half for the second half to make sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I have all episodes of Fushigi Yugi The Mysterious Play. I re watch them when ever I can get some time to myself. It has a great plot, although sometimes the 'I love you so much but I can't be with you because of this/that' gets really frustrating. My favorite characters are Nuriko and Chichiri! Whoa! The kick a**. Anyhow this anime has it all, action/adventure, romance fluff, extremely sad and depressing moments, but it's worth it. This box set holds half of the 52 episodes. I prefer dubbed for this anime only because I like the voices when they speak english, the subtitles make them sound...strange. I definately recommend this! If you aren't into anime yet this would be a good starter, in my opinion anyway. I started with this one, and at first I wished I had gone with a shorter series, but then if I had I probably wouldn't be as addicted as I am now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"turn foxes into Buddhas","review":"Steve Heine has succeeded in writing a book that is accessible, enjoyable, practical, and funny.

Most of the material in this book came directly from wartime intelligence publications with mistakes which have not been corrected. There are too many mistakes to cover them all here but one example is on the first line of page 58 which says that \\"the portable steel pillbox was only encountered during the November 1943 assault on Betio.\\" This is wrong because there were some encountered in the Aleutian Islands. More and better research should be done before a book is published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't seen ANYTHING worse than this.","review":"I've bought one and now regret it alot.

This CD has more of a feel from Traffic's Where the Eagle Flies. The song...Time is Running Out...instead of a so-called \\"Disco attempt\\" in my opinion, is more early Rap if anything.But let's face it...this CD is for true die-hard fans. I would buy it for Luck's In alone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Winwood Album","review":"I bought this solo album when it came out in 1977 and I still listen to it. I found Winwood's later work too slick and polished for my taste but this album has a nice R&B; feel to it. This album is mostly a three piece band with Winwood on keyboards and sometimes guitar. The rhythm section of Andy Newmark and Willie Weeks is superb, they are both master musicians. Winwood is a great singer and these are nice songs.Traffic is still one of my favorite bands and the commercial path that Winwood took after breaking up the band was ultimately a little disappointing. Apparently he found himself broke in 1977, despite having had a successful career. This must have influenced his decision to start making more commercial music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love This Record!","review":"Maybe I'm nostalgic, but it's hard to have a poor album when your rhythm section includes Andy Newmark on drums and Willie Weeks on bass. These two session greats alone make this album worth listening to, not to mention innovative songs like \\"Luck's In\\" (check out the cool polyrhythmic groove and the jam). No, it's not Herbie Hancock's Headhunters, but for a \\"pop/soul\\" album it picks up a fair amount of steam. I've always liked Winwood's voice and keyboard playing. The hook to \\"Time is Running Out\\" is infectious. At least four of the six cuts on this record are way above average."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"THIS is little Stevie Winwood who was so brilliant with the Spencer Davis Group and Traffic? \\"Time Is Running Out,\\" with its disco beat, sounds like late-period Doobie Brothers, for crying out loud.

This has some TRAFFIC like songs, so that's a plus, but I don't like his commercial, poppy sounding stuff from 1986 and later. About anything he did before 1981 is worth listening to. This isn't super great, but it's a very good effort for a first solo album, so I could definitely recommend this self titled album by Mr.Winwood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sporty chef","review":"I was happy to find this Bear's apron to give as a Christmas gift.

I had ordered this expecting it to be the same as my old one but it was a newer model. I was somewhat disapointed that this newer model was $30 more than the older one and when it arrived seemed more cheaply made. The new one is Aluminum versus steel in the older model. It also required a lot more assembly. In some ways it's better than the old model (lighter, aluminum won't rust) but at the same time the handle seems more rickety because it's not a single piece like the old model and tends to flex where the two pieces connect. The short hose that connects to the reel also seems like a generic 5/8\\" inch when the older model came with a 3/4\\" Goodyear hose. All and all it's a solid hose reel and way better than anything plastic, but I think I would have been happier with another one of the older models at $99 instead of this newer model at $129."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tired of buying a new reel every year?","review":"OK, so this reel is expensive and has plastic parts.

The Rapid Reel does require assembly, but the instructions are very good with every step clearly illustrated. Usually when assembling something like this I am running to the garage every two minutes to get another tool, but the Rapid Reel really does take only a Phillips head screw driver to assemble.

My only complaint (so far, I haven't used it much as we've had so much rain) was not with the product but with the catalogue company. Nowhere in the catalogue, or on their website, does it say \\"assembly required\\". As it turned out it was easy to put together. I just wasn't expecting it so on receipt I was angry. I emailed the catalogue company and they said I should have asked their customer service department WHEN I ORDERED IT.

She's actually quite good at age five, always wanting to snap shots with my camera. She knows, however, the when pictures are downloaded onto the computer, they are not supposed to be so grainy that you can't tell what you are viewing in the photo. She also has become very good at centering the photo in the viewfinder, but that's not what turns out to be on the picture. This camera is nice in the fact that the child only has to push one button, aim, and shoot- but the BEST resolution, which is AWFUL only allows about 20 pictures to be stored on the camera before a download. I don't know many children who take a trip to the zoo or the beach and take only 20 shots. I would rather spend the extra money and get my child the one that will entertain her, teach her a new hobby, and serve the purpose of getting her to STOP WANTING MY CAMERA!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kitz Cam Digital Camera Kit","review":"If I could give this a negative star rating I would.

It's just a collection of sounds arranged in dull formulaic patterns. It sounds like they are trying to do something different and progress, but end result is a cliche.

I was expecting the album to be more on the lines of \\"Who Painted...\\", like more folksy sounding, but it's more classical. I still enjoyed the rest of the cd, it's great to have on in the background while your entertaining or just doing whatever around the house. I'm surprised I haven't heard much about Hayley Westernra, she's a great talent. They should play \\"Who Painted The Moon Black\\" on the radio, it's a beautifully written song, it needs more exposure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"I first saw Hayley perform on a Sunday morning news program and immediately fell in love with her voice and ran out to buy this CD.

Haley's voice is the purest I have ever heard.At one time Sarah Brightman was my favorite but Haley at the ageof 16 when I firt heard her, has far surpassed Sarah. Angelic, celestial,devine, words can not relate to the sound of her voice. In additionher attitude, manners and respect for others are a direct link to herparents ideals. Beautiful beyond belief."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice pop album","review":"It is said that Hayley Westenra is the next Charlotte Church. I excpected that this album contains classical music but I can find just two pop-sounding classical songs (Ave Maria and In Trutina). This girl doesn't even have \\"classical\\" or \\"operatic\\" voice! So, why do people speak about \\"opera singer\\" Hayley Westenra though none of her albums contain a single opera aria!But this is a very nice pop album. Hayley's voice is very clear and it sounds great with the simply accompaniments. I think that Hayley should not be compared to Church; she sounds more like Sarah Brightman or Celine Dion. So, why do I give four stars instead of five? -Because most of the songs were quite boring. But Hayley has very nice pop singer's voice and a good technigue. I hope she maintains this kind of repertoire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first album","review":"The song choice was spread among traditional and more contemporary music.

This one has more pop songs in it. Songs like \\"Pokarekare Ana\\" and \\"In Trutina\\" are the more better songs. I'm not trying to say I don't like Hayley Westenra trying new things, but it's too much pop. I wouldn't really call this classical. Songs worth listening to are:-Pokarekare Ana-Amazing Grace-In Trutina-Wuthering HeightsOverall, her voice sounds nice in all the songs, I just don't like them being pop songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute chick with awesome voice!","review":"Hayley Westenra is sooooo cute!

I'm always interested in hearing a new voice, the same as hearing any musicican with his or her instrument.At first listen, I thought Haley's voice rather sweet but without depth. By the end of the CD, I was irritated with the sounds...very one-dimensional and weak.There's little quality of real phrasing or emotion in any of the songs. And when she sings classical pieces, it falls dramatically short of the ability of any bonafide vocal instrument.I think her voice could grow into a pleasant-enough light soprano capable of Faure's \\"Pie Jesu\\", for example but only with a lot of training and dedication."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pure Disappointment","review":"When I heard of her, I was quite excited for another young performer. However, when I actually bought the cd I felt like crying. Not only does she not stand up to Charlotte Church she lacks any emotion in her songs. Unlike Church she simply is singing words and does not let you believe she even understands what she is singing. Maybe given some time she will get better. Until then I recommend sticking to the first young singer who was said to have the voice of an angel, Charlotte Church."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst... but that's about all I can say for her.","review":"Hayley Westenra sounds very much like Charlotte Church. However, she isn't as good. She lacks any real sense of classical singing, and her voice is very immature. To be frank, I don't find her very talented at all. She's about a step up from Brittany Spears, but that's all I can say for her. Her voice is thin and powerless, and sometimes her high notes are actually slightly painful and harsh. If you want that same style of music, I'd go for Church or Brightman. Neither are the greatest of shakes, but they're both better than this little pipsqueak-voiced upstart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another boring nasal voice","review":"Played tracks from this cd and dogs started howling.

Seemingly unrelated source material is all given a bland MOR treatment. Many reviews have complemented the singer's voice, but the constant electronic enhancement obscures her singing, and creates a synthesized tone reminiscent of Muzak in Chinese restaurants. The booming choruses are really ridiculous given the singer's tiny voice. And \\"Amazing Grace\\" deserves special mention as a truly unworthy performance, especially when there are so many great ones. There's possibly talent here, but voice lessons and enough musical experience to develop a point of view are needed before another disk is warranted"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Charlotte Church","review":"Wow!! Great voice, nice phrasing, has pops and classical mix on all registers. Bought 6 copies for my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavenly voice with no equal.","review":"Hayley Westenra's new album \\"Pure\\" will affect you deeply if you like uncommonly pleasant singing. It's a \\"stealth\\" voice, to be sure, in that it sneaks in sweetly and harmlessly enough, but by album's end you find yourself wondering what just happened. You'll scratch your head and ask, \\"Did I just experience the finest human voice in all the world?\\" Then you'll look in the mirror and notice a goofy ear-to-ear smile on your face that tells everything.So let's just get it out in the open: Hayley Westenra has the most heavenly, ravishing, soothing and uplifting voice in the universe and \\"Pure\\" will almost make you forget about Norah, Barbra and Celine.As obscure as she is in the USA today, word of mouth about \\"Pure\\" will eventually elevate Hayley to a dominant place among popular music artists. Get in on the magic today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's hope she's like wine","review":"I'd say she has a better voice than Sarah Brightman and a purer sound than Charlotte Church, but she has the same problem all young singers have. They simply don't have the emotional range to match their vocal ability. This version of Wuthering Heights is the perfect example. It works because it's an incredible song but I'd a whole lot rather listen to Kate Bush sing it for the emotional depth of her performance. Kate's versio has an energy that has nothing to do with hitting the notes. Hayley hits all the notes and they are lovely, but overall it leaves me cold.I say give her a few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!","review":"Hayley Westenra is a wonder... The song \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is worth the 16 dollars I spent on this CD alone... it's THAT GOOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty...","review":"but I can't wait to hear what she sounds like when her voice actually matures. When I initially heard the cd, I thought of Westenra as a sort of Enya/Charlotte Church hybrid. Her voice is undeniably pretty, especially on \\"Dark Waltz\\", which I think is easily the best song on the entire album. There are a few weak spots, like \\"Amazing Grace\\", but overall a very good cd. If she ever reads this, I ask her not to sing too much too soon; it would be a shame to ruin a voice like that like Charlotte Church did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Quality","review":"I was dumbstruck when I heard Hayley's voice. I popped in the demo CD as I drove home and my jaw nearly hit the floor (which made driving somewhat complicated). The strength of her voice alone compelled my to drop 20 bucks at the next store I drove by. \\"Who Painted the Moon Black\\" convinced me to buy this album, but I can't stop listening to the complexity of \\"Wuthering Heights\\".

And what is worse are the five star reviews for it. I've noticed a common thread in those reviews - spelling errors, grammatical errors, and simple-minded analysis (although the last is understandable - there isn't anything deep in the source material). This book does NOT get into the mind of a warrior, does NOT shed any new light on the war, is NOT a field manual for snipers, and to top it off, is so poorly written it's laughable. I'm not doubting Hathcock's bravery - I am merely commenting on the book itself. There are much better books on the subject out there. This book is good for some people though - wannabes, hillbillies, junior high dropouts, surplus store employees...."},{"rating":"1","title":"hype","review":"This book only contains made-up nonsense.

It covers everything from the good times and funny events to hearing the screams of a fellow soldier being tortured.Thats what is great about this book it shows one what is happening and draws you into the moment as if you are standing right with them.

He sacrificed everyday many things we all take for granted, his family, his health, his life. When you start this book and see how this man so unselfish did his job you will come to realize he was indeed A REAL AMERICAN HERO of our time.

This man was, assuming what he writes is true, personally responsible for killing 93 people, none of whom had any chance to fight back, prepare themselves or do anything at all. This is a step or two above cold-blooded murder, but not far. If you had spent several years doing something like this, why would you write a book about it? Why would you glory in it? A best-case analysis is that he felt this was something that had to be done, distasteful as it was. Then do it and out of respect for the people whose lives you had to end, shut up about it. But presenting this horrible career in slaughter as some kind of role model or heroism is obscene. What kind of mind would view it that way?

He definitely had unique skills and a level of self discipline that is rarely seen but he was also a humble and unassuming gentleman who knew what he needed to do and pursued it regardless of who was watching.

Carlos Hathcock took his impressive shooting ability to Vietnam, he survived all the missions, sometimes alone in the jungle, he felt confident on what he was doing and also, I think, he had in Captain Land the voice of experience, which in a situation of war is always important. After his first tour in Vietnam he became a legend, he really made a name of himself after missions like the Apache Woman and the General or the amazing story of \\"Sniper counter Sniper\\". Sadly, he was badly injured in his second tour and despite his injuries, he managed to help the rest of his companions showing another great side of him.

I found it sad about how he had to get all of those medical treatments. I found it sad when he would be trying to shoot his rifle and just couldnt because of the extreme pain.

In the beginning of the book the author already makes you aware that a lot of the material would be made up. I certainly didn't need to know that Carlos Hathcock wiped the grease paint from his buddy's face. The author also presumed to know what was on the mind of the enemy. He shouldn't have given the highlighted exploits at the very beginning either. That didn't give you much to look forward to in the upcoming chapters. There was, however, very detailed accounts of missions and that of the shooting matches which did make me want to read a chapter completely before putting down the book for a break. The pictures were a nice addition as well. I am not a writer but do appreciate a good book.

Toomany questions have been raise about much of the book, most notablyApache woman and the relevance of the long shot with a 50cal..

It recounts the storied marine corps career of the top sniper in Vietnam. Carlos Hathcock AKA \\"Long Trang\\" was a one man killing machine in the Vietnam War.

I don't want to ruin that part but let's just say he killed alot of people!

I bought this book to glean sniper tips/tricks, of which there were few, but I was more than amply awarded by the story telling and inside information about the beginning of formal sniper training that continues today.

Well written and well researched, it is not only a very good history of a terrible time in our nations history, but a stiring story of one man and the difference one man can make. It is difficult to imagine the mental discipline involved in the situations the marine found himself involved. All in all this is a well written book.

Lewis in 1969 the NCO's preparing young men for Viet Nam would take a moment to talk about long range kills with the .50 caliber, and speak in awe of an unamed Marine sniper. In 1974 I shot competitively at Camp Pendelton and at Camp Perry, on the line with those same Marine snipers, and it's possible that I may have even been unknowingly close to Hathcock. This is a technically correct book on snipers, long range shooting, and it is simply a well-written book. Viet Nam, like all conflicts, was defined by many people, most often those who died or those who killed because of ill-thoughtout politics but this text stays true to the topic of snipers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for children, I guess.","review":"As the previous reader indicates, this book is more for children, as long as they understand it's a fictionalized account.

This the album that made me think that Tricky is weird. A very dark CD but somewhat a fun one. Some of my favorite tracks are drum thumping 'Vent', the screeching 'Bad Dream' the driven 'Sex Drive' and mellow 'Bad Things' I like the asthmatic voice, different, just like this album. This is one of those albums were once you get pulled into it, it's impossible to get out."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT FOR THE CHER CROWD!","review":"This album, though not Tricky's best work, has been neglected long enough. Upon first listen, I was disappointed by the lack of easily comprehensible rhythms and melodies, but I soon discovered them to be more brilliant than anything on Maxinquaye (which was and still is one of my favorite albums.) This album isn't easy, which would explain why many people (not most) are disregarding it and picking up the new Cher album instead (oh yeah, they believe!)

I also bought it on the beauty of 'Christiansands' and was let down by how jarring and bleak everything else was. If you find Shostakovitch to be too peppy for your tastes, then this album would be your cup of tea...Because, let's face it folks- if mega-star Tricky can get this depressed, than what's the point of you trying to keep a smile on your face as your trudge through your pathetic, work-a-day life?For those of you who... want to listen to similar music that's actually enjoyable...may I suggest anything by DJ Wally, Rhythm + Sound w/ Tikiman, Wagonchrist and Joy Division."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get \\"Maxinquaye\\" and perhaps \\"Nearly God\\"...","review":"...

The historical section are rather thin and for beginners only. Then she tries to do justice to all the different races on the island by mixing them, rather unbelievable, into one family.It is a good novel, but not history and not a family saga.

This book opened my eyes to people, the language, and the traditions of Jamiaca. I was shocked at the importance of ethnic and inter-racial mixing. Best thing the author did for the reader was to add the family trees to the beginning of the book. The reading was challenging in visualizing what these characters looked like.

Refilling it is difficult but not a deal breaker. However, after refilling it only twice (not a lot of use) the motor's running but nothing's coming out. What a waste if we can't fix it because Amazon will not exchange or refund for it. I read another review that there's a small spring that comes off with refill and ends up in the grinds, can't find that either. (that was appealing).

The battery holder comes out the bottom of the device. It came out ok, but took maybe a half hour getting seated back in the device, apparently too big for the hole. A problem immediately came to mind - you must remove that same battery holder in order to refill with peppercorns. A half hour each time? The turn over and auto-start is a gimmick as well and quite impractical. If you accidentally tip over the device, it grinds and expels pepper for you. In other words, I am sticking with mills that fill from the top and have a button you push to grind, when you want to grind."},{"rating":"1","title":"electric pepper mill","review":"We were looking to use these as Holiday gifts this year.

Instead of dispensing ground pepper, it merely went thunk-thunk-thunk while the motor tried to make the shaft turn. Worse, there is no way to disassemble the grind head to remove the blockage. Eventually, after a lot of shaking (the pepper mill) and cursing (me), the peppercorn dislodges and I get some coarsely ground pepper out. Then it jams again. Was it the peppercorns?

I have ordered a different brand from amazon today and when I get the new one I will put a wrench on this old one to see if I can open it without breaking it. Also the plastic has become sticky.

Mostly the former. It has one recipe, however, for a whole-grain leavened bread which is more sophisticated than a rustic sourdough. That recipe alone is worth the book's price and produces a more flavorful and healthful bread than the sourdough leavened white bread I just made using a recipe from Classic Sourdoughs. Additionally, Classic Sourdoughs is not well edited for clarity, contains a fair amount of incidental information not relevant to learning how to bake breads, and lacks the extensive research that went into creating Laurel's Kithchen Bread Book. Unless you cannot obtain good quality whole wheat flour or have a strong preference for white flour, Laurel's Kitchen is a much better value for your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overrated book and recipes","review":"This book is a good source of sourdough history and theory.

Now I make naturally leavened bread almost every week. I finally trashed the silly \\"proof box\\" that Mr. Wood recommends. I occasionally dip into this book to try the recipes and I'm pretty sure some of them have significant errors (the SF sourdough turns out more like a ciabatta because either the flour or water measurments are wrong).

Unlike many wall sockets, which allow wires to be connected by curving them and a screw pressing them into the socket OR inserted straight into a female hole, this socket only does the curving+screw twist. No big deal.Sockets say they are 5V and 2.4A. My ipad 2 charger outputs at 5V and 2.1A, so in theory this should charge the ipad2, and in practice it does. I installed it today and it's currently charging an ipad2 and ipod5 at the same time.I don't believe for a second this will save me $20/year, as amazon claims in the listing, but this reduced my use of an adapter + existing port, and Apple is starting to cheap out on those adapters now anyway; the ipod 5 came only with the lightning cable and not a 120v adapter.

This anthology is about horror. Anyone who is unaware of the nature of horror stories should not be purchasing this book. With very few horror publications coming out these days, I was pleased to find a new anthology of fresh work and great premises. Lauren Fitzgerald's \\"Wasting\\" is one story that stands out in my mind. Her story is not merely a scary tale, it is a broad statement about society and our standards of perfection. Plainly stated, if you are not interested in reading horror, you won't like this book. If you are, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"To paraphrase Roger Ebert - I hate, hate, hate, hated this book","review":"I bought this book many years ago, when it was relatively new on the market. What I found on reading it, instead of the light, pulpy anthology I thought I'd find, was a selection of either impenetrable 'arty' tales that made little sense to me, sex scenes with no point beyond shock and titillation, and one of the most vile, nauseating stories I've ever had the misfortune to read - 'The Stick Woman.' The sheer sexual sadism of this piece still inspires nausea at the thought to this day; I am filled with remorse that I ever read it.So unpleasant was this book, that is the only book I have ever ripped up and thrown in the trash.

Ketchum, Taylor and Lee's stories were great... well worth it.

Extreme sexual perversions (snuff and kiddy porn) and self-mutilation are horrifying, but they are NOT horror! This is the second time I have bought a book of horror fiction only to be met with the small mind's answer to horror - atrocities and butchery. No wonder the horror sections sport as many Lovecraft, Poe, Bloch, and Stoker books as they do new writers. They are all that is left of the truly scary stuff. Even King writes more fright and horror than gore and carnage. Horror should frighten, not disgust. There are some things people should not have to ponder as they close their eyes at night; the top of that list is crudely written fiction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"kids happy...mom disappointed","review":"The Zurg action figure did not hold up very well.

A successful California optimologist, the protagonist spends the too much of the narrative defending his materialism. When he's not bothering with that, he's repeatly over-describing his less successful brother (After the first few times, I understood that the brother was violent and troubled during high school). There's a good story here, but it's trapped under a poor, plodding narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazed by the reader reviews","review":"I thought this was a very well-written and interesting description of the relationship between two brothers. I agree that pages 75-125 were slow but the rest of the book is by no means dull. Canin gradually reveals what caused the estrangement of the two brothers and his description of life in the small Wisconsin town where he grew up is often vivid with truly three-dimensional characters. I don't know whether anyone will believe me after reading the prior reviews but I highly recommend this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow and tedious","review":"This is the shortest book I failed to finish. I'm sorry, but for a short novel, it was just got too wordy and touchy-feely for me. I loved Emperor of the Air, a collection of short stories in which feelings and places were described succintly. And the events happened at a quicker pace. But in Blue River, Canin stretches out all his descriptions of places, of main character's resentments, disappointments, fears, and memories. It really feels tedious to read and halfway through it, I just had to give up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even great writers have bad days","review":"Ethan Canin is a great short story writer, but when it comes to novels, he misses the target. His short stories are great because they are brief, and are told through actions and conversations, not sentimentality and excessive introspection. Blue River, like For Kings and Planets, are undisciplined works, perhaps too ambitious, with overwrought language and too much filler material. A much better story with the same theme appear in the Palace Thief, called Batorsag and Szerelem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Although I loved For Planets and Kings, and looked forward to reading Blue River, I found it tedious and monotonous.

Unbelievable! I actually cut away some of the metal to make the openings bigger to allow the birds better access to the feed! The results were minimally successful. The birds do not like it!

This feeder worked fine for about 2 weeks. Different birds were attracted to it (cardinals cannot access seeds from this type of feeder) and the squirrels stayed away. But then they had a meeting or something and came up with a great plan. So one day I look outside my window and see a squirrel swinging on the feeder while another squirrel sat underneath, eating the seeds as they fell. I was incredulous, thoroughly annoyed and yet impressed. Squirrels are diligent critters. So we had to buy a baffle. It keeps the squirrels off the feeder, but they still eat the seeds off the ground and chase away mourning doves and other birds they prefer ground feeding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Design","review":"Duncraft 18834 Squirrel Proof Blocker SelectiveThe birds loved it for a day until the squirrels discovered it. The squirrel guard worked but it took them no time to knock the feeder down (even though it was secured to the hook with extra wire). I was able to put it back together but fitting the too short ends of the hook back into the horizontal post was a challenge. When it happened again the next day, I was not able to find the squirrel guard. The feeder is also very hard to fill because you have to hold the cap and the squirrel guard up out of the way with one hand while trying to get the seed in through the small space left. If you remove the whole feeder to fill it, the tension of the hanging hook on the horizontal bar is lost and the bar falls off so that you have to reassemble everything again.I should have ordered another Globe feeder from Gardener's supply.

The film is also largely gutless in dealing with the socio-economic issues. It instead argues that bad high schools create bad neighborhoods, but then contradicts itself when it gets to analyzing just how bad most of the education at suburban and rural schools is. The socio-economic issues are not limited to inner city schools, nor is bad education. This film tends to make the teachers looks like the causes even when it says it's trying to be fair. The one expert they interview the most is Canada and he himself is contradictory and a mixed 'bag'.

There are many factors that influence student success and failure. Study after study show that teachers are only a small part of the equation. Issues such as poverty and parental support/involvement account for much of student success. The film suggests that if only tenure and unions were eliminated, all education problems could be magically fixed. If this were the case, then why are the states that have no unions/tenure some of the lowest performing in the country? Also not mentioned in the film is the fact that the vast majority of charter schools produce significantly worse results than traditional public schools.

There are committes that have their own rules that decide what happens to a teacher. But rather than go into all the inaccuracies and misleading statements (real life is complicated folks) I want to propose that we concentrate on the principals. If a school had a great principal it will be a successful place for kids to learn and grow. On the other hand, no matter how many good teachers you may have at a school a poor principal can kill progress, I've seen it. If we could create a rigorous and well funded training program for principals I believe we would be doing the best for our students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely agenda biased.","review":"This movie is a pure agenda movie. The only reason this film was made was to forward a political agenda to forward the agenda for privatization of school districts.I know it was considered powerful, and it makes sense because our schools are failing, but as always in documentary style you find over-generalization and editing making a stronger case than really exists. Teacher tenure, unions, suffering schools, all are targets of the film.Reform is a great thing, but if you wanted to really learn about it and improve schools you should research those who actually have done research. Kozol who has written many books on the subject gives a completely opposing view point of this film.

Among the many egregious lies two really stand out. First, it claims that the entire public education system is harming American students. The fact of the matter is that our public education system performs extraordinarily well. It does happen to underperform in areas of intense segregation and poverty, which leads to the second lie.

I am from the inner city and know all about our public schools. Fortunately my parents had the means to send me to a private school half way across the city and eventually move to a neighborhood with a magnet school for the remainder of my school career, college and beyond. What about those children and families who do not have that luxury? Where do they end up, why and it is not for a lack of their parents trying. This movie tells us why but ends with only so much on how to change our current reality. Great film for all that are not delusional about the state of our public school system. Hopefully this is just the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not be mislead","review":"It is easy to get sucked into this documentary and believe that public schools are failing, teacher's unions are evil, and charter and private schools are the answer. I strongly encourage anyone that watches this documentary to read the following article: [...]. Many of the \\"facts\\" in Waiting for Superman are either false or misleading. There is a political agenda behind breaking up unions and moving towards vouchers and private schools. This movie was originally considered a frontrunner for the Academy Award for Best Documentary. It was not even nominated after it was revealed that some of the scenes were fake and the information was twisted to further an agenda by the filmmaker. Roger Ebert wrote a positive review of the film and then later recanted after he learned that the documentary was \\"not all that it seemed\\".

They started out as a screemo/hardcore band back in the 90's and they've grown a lot since then as musicians. This album reflects the latest stage in their evolution of the Piebald sound. Sure, none of the tracks here resemble anything along the lines of \\"Grace Kelly With Wings\\"--but trust me thats a good thing. They seem to be going for a more classic rock sound these days. For instance, this album features an awesome Kinks cover, \\"Strangers.\\" I'd recommend this album for that track alone.

At times I admit, I got so sucked into the book I thought to be living in Mara's shoes the whole time! It is a lovely written book of love, royal intrigue, and adventure I have ever read. It remains my favorite book ever, and always shall. I recommend it to anybody!

Now, Mara Sheftu, And Thutmose III want to take back what is rightfully theirs. On the way of getting back the throne they needed a little bit of money.

Why do they publish books like these? It was extremely confuseing, and dull, and an unpleasent reading for me. The charactors were uninteresting, the plot was zooming in an awful direction!

I find books like this a terrible part of our world because it makes people dread reading. Why do schools make us suffer by reading this trash? So, if you are looking for a bad read, and an uninteresting plot, read Mara Daughter of the Nile.

I don't think there are many books that I could whole-heartedly recommend as I do this one for girls in the YA group.Vivid, evocative of time and place, and lets you feel, hear, taste and smell the environment.

Yet this book gives me the same thrills over and over again, earning a place in my heart ever since the first time I read it, few years ago. A teacher lent it to me, and about 2 years later, I found it at a book store and jumped to buy it. I like the head strong Mara, and the charming Sheftu and everything along, all their encounterings and their love for Egypt and each other. This is a book that I would recommend to anyone. The theme and moral is very strong, too, though I loved the characters best. I am now excited because we are supposed to right a story about ancient Egypt during school.

BUT...while I know it's fiction, I think it really sells one of history's most fascinating and inspiring characters short. In this book Hatshepsut is reduced to a pretty stereotypical scheming evil queen/stepmother-type. It's one interpretation of history I suppose, but recent scholarship paints a more positive picture of her, although a no less ambitious one. Please read Pauline Gedge's \\"Child of the Morning,\\" for a different fictional take. No Mara and Sheftu maybe, but Senenmut gets a much better deal. Please note though, Gedge's book, while certainly not overly violent or racy, is not a children's book, although any teen that read \\"Mara\\" could certainly enjoy it. Joyce Tyldesley also wrote an excellent history called \\"Hatshepsut:The Female Pharoah,\\" for those who want just the facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mara, Daughter of the Nile","review":"A wonderful novel I discovered when I was in junior high in 1975.

The copy was \\"old\\" and tattered when I found it in the school library, no one had checked it out for many years. The librarian saw how much I enjoyed the book, so she gave it to me as a \\"discard\\".

While delivering messages, she finds that Sheftu must do a horrible deed(don't worry, it's not that important to the story.)I can't tell you any more, it'll ruin the story, but belive me it's GREAT!

Shortly afterward, handsome Sheftu also hires her to spy on the royal palace, in order to gather information to throw Hatshepsut off the throne.

If you're going to quote the lyrics, listen to album first. It's \\"You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.\\"The remainder of side one is as listenable as any album ever recorded - New Kid in Town, Life in the Fast Lane and Wasted Time, which is one of the best songs on the album, not one of the worst.Side two is a little tougher to get through, as Victim of Love and Pretty Maids All in a Row are weak, but The Last Resort - a typical Don Henley classic, is a fantastic finish. Altogether a great album. 4-stars because of the brief slump on side 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hip-easy listening at it's worse","review":"This has two pretty good tracks - 'New Kid in Town' and 'Life In The Fast Lane'; and one track, the title track, that has interesting lyrics, but is spoiled by the limp reggae beat. (Check out 'Watching the Detectives' by Elvis Costello and 'Police and Thieves' by The Clash for a more productive use of reggae -artists who understood the genre.) The rest of the album is bland, disposable, certainly forgettable, soft rock. Hip-easy listening at it's worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO BIG DEAL AT ALL !!! WHY ALL THE PRAISE ??!!!","review":"THis album is really weak. Except for the title track (which, by the way, is a master-piece) there is absolutely nothing here, just a compilation of mediocre love/country/pop songs at best !!

For most of us (I think), Eagles probably ate the Carpenters."},{"rating":"1","title":"What no Zero? Worst album ever?","review":"I was shocked at the 5 star reviews for this album. It might be the smuggest, most self centered collection of banal third rate rock ever recorded. The melodies are trite, the setiments predictable and hypocritical and their watered down Poco styled music is only matched by their watered down boogie rock. Pathetic. Perhaps the worst well known rock album ever. I'd give it Zero stars but there doesn't seem to be that option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even disco was better than this.....","review":"Take yourself back to 1976. Rock was growing tired. Bands like the Eagles had their string of hits and were losing their imagination. So what do the Eagles do? They hire Joe Walsh and dedicate the rest of their professional careers to POP.It was music like this that spawned the disco and punk backlash. If you want some good Eagles music, skip this one (and The Long Run), and pick up one of their first few LPs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of useless sugary, cheesy, heartless pop","review":"Well, you can see that I do not enjoy the Eagles so much... Much on the contrary, I think they are one of the wrost bands ever to appear, making silly commercial songs with no punch, no real talent at all, and even so selling millions and millions of album, in the best \\"Backstreet Boys, Britney Speasrs, Spice Girls\\" style...This album is plain bad, awful. The tittle track is a gem that makes you wonder how the same guys who wrote such great tune wrote the obnoxiously bad rest of the songs in this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eagles: with an edge","review":"Starting with one of the odder topics for a hit single (Is it Hell or just a very odd check in policy?) Hotel California shows the influence of Joe Walsh's addition to the band right away. The softer edge of Southern California rock is sharpened to a point on the title track, \\"Victim of Love,\\" and especially \\"Life in the Fast Lane,\\" which gives the listener exactly what the title says. Even the softer tunes like \\"The Last Resort,\\" \\"New Kid in Town,\\" and \\"Pretty Maids All in a Row\\" seem to hit with more musical power (listen to the bass and piano on \\"Maids\\") and the lyrics have a bittersweet feel to them.

Get real. The debut from Eagles is worth highest rating but this album is far from that standard. Yes, there's the song \\"Hotel California\\" and I agree that it's one of Eagles' best ever, and probably one of the greatest songs regardless of artists/bands. Apart from \\"Victim of love\\" and \\"Hotel California\\", the material is quite weak and very uninteresting. \\"New kid in town\\" and \\"Life in the fast lane\\" are usually considered great among Eagles fans, but I believe they're both pretty [bad]. I suggest you get the three first albums because they display Eagles in their prime. I would give this album only 1 star if it wasn't for the song \\"Hotel California\\" (which is indeed a 5 star song)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring wasted time.","review":"When I heard the song Hotel California I wanted that album. It was big mistake though, because when I bought and played it, I wanted a refund. The title song and Life In the Fast Lane was great, New kid in town was a good calm rocker. The rest are really boring fillers. Wasted time and its reprise was boring all the way through, Victim of Love was downright depressing and I hate depressing tunes, Pretty Maids All in Row was lousy and dreary. Try and Love Again was not good, and The Last Resort was big time filler. As a suggestion borrow somebody's HC album and get a copy of the first three songs.

Everyone who was not a hillbilly found them incredibly annoying. One day, they decided to write a song about a hotel in California and call it (Here comes the big surprise) Hotel California. They then put it on an album that sold a bunch of copies. However, all those poor people didn't know that they had wasted a lot of money on songs that either turn out to be an ingenious combination of annoying and boring. The song Hotel California is one of the best-known of all time but really is just a bunch of hillbillys trying to sing and write good songs but coming up way, way short.

Get this treat for your multichannel system and your ears will thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic for a reason","review":"I'm truly astounded that anyone could give this album 1 star. No, it's not their best work, but it's still a classic, and has probably one of the top 10 best rock songs of all time (the title track). \\"Hotel California\\", \\"New Kid In Town\\", and \\"Life in the Fast Lane\\" are all great songs that have earned their way into the popular music canon. \\"Wasted Time\\" is also an excellent song. \\"The Last Resort\\", the last song, is an epic, beautifully-written song about (according to Don Henley) \\"how the West was lost\\". It's probably the most beautiful and most underrated Eagles song.The reason I can't, in good conscience, give this album 5 stars is because of \\"Pretty Maids All In A Row\\" and \\"Try And Love Again\\". I suspect that these songs being on the album were a compromise that the band struck up internally so that bandmembers other than Henley or frey could get a chance to sing lead and write songs for the album. Those two songs are really not up to usual Eagles standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Eagles album","review":"This is probably the Eagles's best album other than the Greatest Hits collections. It represented a big change in the Eagles's style of music. They went from slow, easygoing songs to more upbeat songs such as \\"Life in the Fastlane\\" and \\"Victim of Love\\" in this album. Of course \\"Hotel California\\" was probably the biggest song of their career, but all of them are great. The Eagles do just as good with these new songs as they did in their previous albums. Even the ones like \\"The Last Resort\\" that weren't major hits were good songs. If you want to buy any album by the Eagles other than the Greatest Hits, I would definitely recommend buying this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!","review":"The title track was one the Eagles' all-time best,undoubtedly. On the cover,we see the band in a hotel lobby with many other guests. Other hits include NEW KID IN TOWN,LIFE IN THE FAST LANE and VICTIM OF LOVE. Eventually,Glenn Frey and Don Henley,the band's drummer would pursue solo careers of their own. Frey and Henley are the Lennon and McCartney of the Eagles. Frey takes the lead on NKIT. Henley takes the lead on the title track,LITFL,WASTED TIME,VOL and THE LAST RESORT. The other songs are good. There's also an instrumental and classical reprise of WT which is 1 minute and 22 seconds in length. Some tracks were recorded live for the 1994 reunion concert album HELL FREEZES OVER."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOTEL CALIFONIA","review":"GREAT CD LOVE IT, UNFORGETTABLE SONGS. MUST BUY CD.

The author does an excellent job at creating realistic and likable characters, and I applaud her choice on the villain. The only real problem I had with the book was that things wrapped up too neatly. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a happy ending, but the complete about face of his parents who he comments on through the book about being pleasure seekers who think little of their children was a bit too much.

This author always uses a lot of comic relief throughout her stories. I enjoy it but I've noticed in the reviews that some others do not. It may come across as a little silly sometimes, but I like it nevertheless.

Dwight Yoakam is the true villain of the story and you won't be shedding too many tears by the time all is said and done. Robert Duvall appears in a cameo, but blink and you'll miss him. As always, Duvall delivers. The late John Ritter backs the cast nicely in what was probably his greatest film role. Thornton wrote, directed, and starred in the picture, making him my generation's equivalent of Orson Welles handling all duties on Citizen Kane.

I didn't know what to expect at first when my husband suggested buying this DVD. He had read reviews, but I had not.Boy, was I surprised to find such an outstanding picture. It really brings one back to the truth that you can't judge a book by its cover. And I'm not talking about the title and cover of the DVD, but about the characters in the movies. The character of Karl had been judged by society and suffered the consequences. If this is the way the world operates, we are all susceptible to being judged or judging someone we consider to be 'beneath' us.Buy this movie. You won't regret it. Excellect script. Excellent performance.Gail Gupton, Author: 'The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment', and 'Seekers of Truth'."},{"rating":"1","title":"sling blade","review":"The movie came in a timely manner, but unfortunately we didn't get to watch the whole movie because there were to many glitches in the first thirty minutes ,so we just turned it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"SLING BLADE","review":"THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME IN A STRANGE WAY.

He did such an unbelievable portrayal of Karl. Each of the rest of the actors, Lucas Black was perfect for the part of the boy who was about to be 'shut out' by his single mother's lover(Dwight Yoakam)---that had a drinking problem among others.

I have seen this film three times, each time desperately trying to figure out why so many people have gone completely gaga over it. The plot is not only too simplistic, but breathtakingly implausible, the whole thing is just so full of southern cliches it becomes more and more painful to sit through as the movie progresses, and the performances are strictly hollow, with no depth or originality.I have simply just given up trying to figure out what the fuss was all about.

What a shameless Oscar bid by Billy Bob Thorton. What an idiotic story. What an excremental script. And how stupid does Billy Bob & Co. think we are? I mean, a key plot development is the main character meeting a small boy, explaining that he just got out of a mental home where he was imprisoned for killing some people immediately after which the small boy invites him to come live with him. A second key plot is the small boy's mother being told all this and not having any problem with this arrangement. HEL-LO?!

I was in awe for quite some time after watching it.Well, my narrative comes mostly from the Christian perspective.I saw Jesus Christ quite clearly in the person of Karl. Karl's simple but at the same time deeply loving personality reminded me of Jesus. Just like Jesus, Karl decided to sacrifice his life for others. Also, the movie is full of Christian overtones since Karl appears to be a very strong believer in God.Also, the theme of broken families/relationships runs deeply through the script. The parental abuse and its implications are shown in a bright light. The band of \\"damaged souls\\" meet at Vaughn's table...is quite a scene.The actor performances were terrific; Billy Bob, Yoakam and Duval should get five and a half stars for their acting work.Great movie, must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"sling blade","review":"recieved movie sling blade in very prompted time and was in very good shape , made a nice add to my movie collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the most over rated movie of all time!","review":"Geez!

He places education in the United States in the greater context of ancient and medieval educational theory and practice. His insightful philosophical observations in his introductory materials and his epilogical comments are worth the price of the book.

Wes' characterization is dead-on and runs deep; I could hear Alexis Denisof's voice in my head for each line. This is a story and a villain that are particularly Wesley's, and it is wonderful to watch the interactions between him and the rest of the team.

The newly appointed Fairy Godmother Magrat Garlick, in search for cosmic harmony and how do set this bloody wand off pumpkins, and the classic double act that is Granny and Nanny.Pratchett has managed to mix in Little Red Riding Hood, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, The Wizard of Oz and even The Lord of the Rings (complete with a sleazy Gollum). Even when I knew a joke was coming, Pratchett did so well with it that I smiled and even laughed anyway.I couldn't find a single flaw.

If so, this is THE book to read. I have now read 14 of Prattchets Discworld books (I think there are something like 26), but this is by far the funniest. The cr** suzette, the dwarf bread, the dairy air... it is just too funny. The best thing however is the vampire. Pratchett never mentions the word vampire, yet as you go along, it becomes clear to you what he means. (i love the way Greebo finds someone to \\"play\\" with... hahahahahaha... it's just too funny). Any way! Well done! I hope threre will be more books like this! Now I have to go back and read another Discworld Novel!

His humorous turn of phrase and outrageous characters are always a treat, but I love the witches most of all. When Granny and Nanny get together its always an adventure. In Witches Abroad they leave their own little part of the world to look for a fairy godmother gone wrong.

Nanny's language lesson, however, is very worthwhile (ordering drinks in any language is \\"Three drinks toot swiet chopchop\\").Besides, they spoil a perfectly good story. What kind of a plot is it anyway, to make sure the servant girl DOESN'T marry a prince.Witches abroad is not a book; it's an experience. The writer probably does not take responsibility if you laugh yourself to death!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"Witches Abroad is one of my favourite discworld novels. I am a big fan of the witches series and this has to be one of the best. Any book that has Nanny Ogg singing about hegdehogs makes me laugh. This is a good story for learning more about Granny Weatherwax. You are always told just enough information about her to ask questions, but are never really given any answers. I feel in this book you come to understand some of those answers. If you are trying to get into the discworld series then this is the book for you.

Even then, the dialogue is almost constant (rarely making sense) and leaving little room for plot. As a review in the front page of the book says, \\"You can never pick up all the jokes he makes in one reading\\". Sadly, this book left me never wanting to pick it up again. Alas, I'll never \\"pick up\\" on all those (possibly hilarious/possibly just as horrendous as I thought) jokes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just great","review":"I have never read a Terry Pratchett book before (except from half of Moving Pictures), but I think I might start now, since Witches Abroad is definitely one of the best books I've ever read. I particularly liked Granny Weatherwax, who is one of the greatest characters I've ever met in a book in the sense of having flaws and behaving badly and still being someone you just have to like. There are a lot of great scenes in the book, like Granny playing cards on the boat and her fight with Mrs Gogol, who is another wonderfully drawn character, too. So if you ever wondered about what makes stories happen, or what it really means to be a fairy godmother, just buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best soft focus filter","review":"This is one of the best soft focus filter I've ever used. It is great for romantic or glamor portraits. Of course, using this filter makes the images that you shoot with it permanently soft.

If you still shoot portraits with film, this filter should definitely be in your tool kit."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son LOVES it!","review":"My son is 5 months old, way below the age range.

Anyway, this show is about these big puffy aliens that these little kids worship and send gifts to by blowing on the gift until it goes up in the air. And in between there are these little stories with Grandpapa and Grandmama and Brother and Sister, which obviously must be made for very dumb children because they are entirely about some very simple thing like these kids jumping in a giant, squeaky sock...then grandpapa is listening to the sound and doesn't know what it is for a minute...then he finds out and they all do silent laughter.So only get this if you have very young kids, like infant-2 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"ACK","review":"Boobah are berry scary!!!

Dark comedy slams straight into uncomfortable realism as director Lars von Trier and his dedicated cast commit to celluloide some truly unforgettable set-pieces in a narative that never once tells you how to react to what you are seeing.Von Trier is once again in top form, building on his already impressive filmography (his epic two-parter 'The Kingdom' was shown in weekly instalments on Australian TV recently; THE best thing around, roll on part III) to tell the story of another female character determined to see to the end of her decisions, however painful the consequences may be for the people around her.Bravo! to all involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy barometer","review":"Anyone with a fascination for strange and discomfiting cinema should see The Idiots. For me it's a bit like Lars Von Triers having a go at Even Dwarfs Started Small. There are a few moments, especially the final scene; where a strong Mike Leigh flavor comes through. Honestly, the middle section of this film was really difficult for me to watch. Sometimes I would only watch 5 minutes and have to stop and digest / shake it off. Not that that's a bad thing; since I consider it a worthy barometer of my own preconceptions and programming. Certainly worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infantile","review":"I really liked the potential of the idea behind this film, but to achieve its aims the makers chose to resort to equating idiocy with disability.

His previous movies ZENTROPA and BREAKING THE WAVES are examples of mesmerizing movies - movies that will stay with you. Therefore it is so disappointing to watch The Idiots. This movie may stay with you as well, but for the wrong reasons. It does not reach the standard set by other DOGME creations."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Self-Indulgent Mess","review":"I watched this film in amazement that it is somehow considered important or new. It is just a rehash of the 1960s with spoiled middle class children attacking their \\"bourgeois\\" and \\"fascist\\" society while managing not to work. There certainly is terrible prejudice against the mentally ill,but this film exploits it.

Irons is wonderful, and Ian Richardson is, as usual, a commanding figure on the screen. The direction is fine, and so is the music. But the plot! It is so absurd that you want to throw tomatoes. Here is a guy whose woman is giving him oral and anal sex, and in the concluding scenes he is stunned to discover that \\"she\\" is a man. Who would not have been fooled...except any intelligent person with good eyesight. In short: this movie is utterly ridiculous and by no means worth anyone's time.

I find it strange that there are so many people who can't wait to ruin the surprises for the innocent movie viewer. Off with their heads!!!There is more than just a plot to interest a person in this film. To me, Jeremy Irons is one of the Best Actors of all time. The entire cast is perfect. After the Actors and story, the visuals are second-to-none. Lush, atmospheric, mood setting and perfect settings for the storyline. The costumes were time-accurate and well done. The music was spectacular without being obtrusive (Chinese Opera scenes exepted).If you react similiarly to how I did, you'll find yourself with a few new favorite Actors at the end of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good transfer.Lack of extras","review":"This is a decent release of Cronenberg's \\"M Butterfly\\".Nothing special but at least it's finally on DVD.As for the film,critics seem to love it or hate it.I like the fact that the story has Cronenberg's trademark color scheme,Shore's always-amazing score,and the great artistic talent of Jeremy Irons.Not an earth-shatteringly amazing film,but it's not supposed to be huge in scope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I was very disappointed by this work.

These orders were subsequently cancelled and the book delayed (though I can not see a reason for any delay...could this book have been worse at some point?).If there is any industry conspirarcy going on here, it must be J.

The music is wonderful. It is very dark and moody, best when played on a cloudy evening. I have never heard anything that so perfectly captured the feeling of the rural south. Since I am from Hamburg Arkansas, and the movie was filmed in Benton, I get completely absorbed everytime I play it. It is great night music and it is perfect to listen to while driving. My two favorites would have to be \\"the Maker\\" and \\"Loneley One\\". They seem to define the movie. \\"Jimmy Was\\" is a little bit more up beat and \\"Darlin\\" is incredible. Daniel Lanois has incredible ways of capturing the right mood with his music. Any time I need a little bit of relaxation, I put this one in. If your a blues fan, there is some great picking also. Billy Bob Thornton really knew what he was doing with the film and the soundtrack is no exception to the film's brilliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plenty of strong songs -- not all in one sitting","review":"There is a lot of great material on this soundtrack, songs and sounds you aren't likely to be exposed to elsewhere. But it isn't something you'd sit down and listen to from start to finish. It is a soundtrack after all, not an album in the traditional sense. So if you like to mix and match there's plenty of good material.

It is very well done, however it still lacks few elements that would make it a first class action movie. However, I would like to give five for its plot and portrayal of romance.

So what! It moves with lightning speed, it strikes without mercy, and it's exceptionally entertaining.Some folks may want to see it twice, because it's confusing at times. If you're of the queasy stomach type, you may want your mom close by to give you comfort in the opening scenes. No matter, they provide the necessary balance for the rest of the film.Action sequences are ruthless, also for the actors who sometimes were injured. That gives you a clue as to the efforts taken to make a realistic action movie.I enjoyed it and will buy it.This DVD contains about an hour of \\"The making of...\\" material which is as interesting as the final product.4 Stars for being predictable and setimental.

Otherwise, an exceptional movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, Great Plot, emotional & Action & suspense","review":"The plot is great.The most interesting part is it is in a way different from most American action movies with similar plots.SHiri combines both emotion and excitement with solid plot.It is unlike from most action movies you will encounter. It goes beyond that. Surprisingly superb storylines and unbelievable actions. Great Cast. Main charater is a very well known actor in S.Korea.

And a real clumsy one at that. \\"Shiri\\" recycles every action movie cliché imaginable that I felt like I was watching a James Bond highlight (lowlight?) reel most of the time. The plot is laughably bad and predictable, and the acting and dialogues are even worse (not having to read the subtitles isn't always a blessing).

I've printed the same photo 5 times (it comes with an ink cassette and \\"postcard sized\\" paper for 5 prints), each time the resulting print has some errors, generally yellowish blotches, a speck here and there. etc. It seems like it could be caused by what would have to be microscopic dust, but that's speculative.Unflawed portions of the photo look fantastic, but you wouldn't want to have them framed or on display... which is another problem, and is mistakenly written off by some reviewers. The paper it prints on is not standard size. A 'borderless' image, at least with the supplied Canon paper, ends up cropping portions of the photo, and the usable section is 5.8\\" wide, because of the perforations.Confused what purpose this serves unless you love to send custom postcards... a lot?"},{"rating":"1","title":"nice photos but zero reliability","review":"I was happy for about 3 packs.

I tried opening up to removed rolled up yellow thing and it was beyond repairable condition.Sending it in for repair would cost as much as buying a new one, but I didn't want to risk it again. I kept the non-standard photo papers for years to find a use and then finally threw them away.Don't spend a dime on this product.

The reason is the proportions of the sensor on the camera are more square than 4x6 so the printer just cuts off the top and bottom of the digital picture file. No warning in the manual, no way to print the full picture file on a 4x6 paper by leaving space at the ends.

She has many problems along the way, including poor attendance, a low food supply, and a difficulty convincing people that God is indeed real and needed in every single life. She does NOT step out of the boundaries of the Bible. Emily simply sets up a church and teaches because there is no preacher in the area. She doesn't preach, only tries to help people see the importance of a faith in God and tries to help them understand the Bible and how important it is. This is a wonderful book that helped me understand things more clearly and get things sorted out in my own faith. I thank Janette Oke for writing such a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emily Evans","review":"This story is non-eventful. In other words boring. I have read Janette Oke for years.

Geoffrey Norman has written a gem that does as good a job as any in inspecting and explaining the motivations and rewards behind two of the great mysteries of life: climbing and fatherhood. This book was especially poignant for me, a forty-something father of three daughters - all of us beginning climbers. A must read book for any father, climber, or anyone else who would like an insight to either of the above.

Edgar,lead singer Leo Lacroix and the rest of the \\"White Trash\\" ensemble are on fire on this classic album. I saw this act in the 70's and they blew away every stop with a high-energy blues/rock/soul revue. The horn section (featuring Edgar's sax)and lead guitarist (a relatively big name player whom I can't recall)is terrific. Why this band was never more popular is a mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"This album is by no means bad but it isn't great either!At times there are glimmers of good music like Good Morning Music but overall the album fails to excite the listner.The Trash may have been a good live act but they failed to capture that intensity on the record.Worth a listen but for specific tastes only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edgar's Here","review":"Edgar Winter is an overlooked multinstrumentalist, who is adept on keys, sax, percussion and vocals. At this time, he was trying to make a name for himself and crawl out from under his older brother's (Johnny's) shadow. Johnny was the subject of a bidding war by the record lables, which Edgar documents in \\"Keep Playing That Rock and Roll\\". The release features blue eyed Texas soul, as exhibited in \\"Save the Planet\\", which has the obvious environmental message as well. \\" Fly Away\\" is a tender ballad that showcases gospel like choruses.

We are vegan so I prepare a lot of bean-based dishes. This pot cooks two cups (dry) beans in 12 minutes at the lowest setting on my electric range (you still have to soak first). This used to take almost an hour in a regular pot. Meals that I used to prepare a day in advance, such as cassoulets, can now be made in 30 minutes start-to-finish if I remember to soak the beans ahead. This my first pressure cooker, and probably my last as it seems to be very sturdy.The pot has never stained - it looks brand-new after six months of almost daily use. It's very easy to clean and store. The book that came with it is clear and helpful but the recipes are not very inspiring. I'd recommend Veganomicon for great recipes. The book that comes with the cooker does make it easy to figure out how to adjust a recipe for pressure cooking - basically you use 1/4 of the water and 1/4 of the time.Worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Tony Orlando and Dawn tunes","review":"This 3 cd set is just fabulous.

Seeing how ICP has regressed now and clung on to their \\"cult\\" status, I respect them even more. After this album, they could have totally gone MTV, but they didn't.

This album, their newer album the tempest, and their dark lotus tales from the lotus album all have a special place in my heart that just remind me of fun people and all the fun I have had listening to the music with them.

I must say, if your a true ICP fan, and dont have this one, I dont know what to say but to run down to your local Best Buy or something and get this one. No disappointments.

The very concept of fusing the two most destructive forces in western society, rap and clowns, is terrifying."},{"rating":"1","title":"White trash redneck DRIVEL! Utter GARBAGE!","review":"I wish I could give this lousy CD and band 0 stars! ICP is sonically and lyrically the absolute WORST thing to happen to music. These no-talent posers are devoid of any conception of good music, and rely on simpleton, crass, white trash yahoos and hicks as their fan base. Their popularity is without question further proof of the 'dumbing down of America', in all it's forms. As our crumbling public schools continue to fail our youth, with math, science, and verbal and language skills on the decline, and violent video games and misogynistic music becoming ever so popular, we have to take pause and ask the question \\"what is happening to our society and our youth.\\" ICP is just part of the problem though. Music and standards in general are 'on the decline', everything is 'Made In China' now, and the middle class is dying. Perhaps this garbage is just a reflection of our current state of decline in America?"},{"rating":"2","title":"IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT YOU SHOULD","review":"Shaggs and J really put it together on this cd I love everyone of their songs.

They're both homosexual and have fun together each night. Listen to the \\"Ken Kaniff\\" skit on Eminem's Marshall Mather's LP album and you'll hear these two doing what they do best.

The lyrics are perverse, Very explict, and lack any imagination whatsoever. The music is very entertaining and fits the lyrics-somewhat. My friend no longer listens to them because he has outgrown and gotten tired of listening to their raging about cutting, dicing, and shooting people. There is no reality to any of their songs. I have nothing against owning or listening to meaningless cds every now and then, but the stuff contained in these cds is full of rage and immaturaty.

I would recomend this cd to anyone who is even slightly intersted in getting their side busted with laughter. Although this cd is not really for kids, I would still let my children listen to it, if I had any. This cd and the tunnel of love cd are the best works by ICP since the basement cuts, which is the rarest tape by them. There are only fifteen in existence. But back tot he point.

The first one I heard was The Neden Game. From that moment on, I swore that ICP would always be the all time band for me. Now that I have finally purchased The Great Milenko from amazon.com (BIG UP!!!), I know that ICP will live forever. The lyrics are the best and funniest I have heard for ages.

The rest of the tracks are also good, those are just my favorites.I used to hate rap and only listen to rock. I don't really know what genre to call ICP, if anything I'd call them rap with a little bit of rock. I would sum up ICP by saying their lyrics are amazingly funny in a rap style, and the background music sounds far better than anything in rap or hip hop. If you haven't heard ICP don't assume their like the other rappers and get this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely ICP's best.","review":"Don't let the fact that this album is by ICP throw you off buying it. Sure, most of the lyrics are the usual \\"evil clown\\" crap that they usually peddle, but on this album they truly show through some real talent, especially the work of their own personal beatmaster, Mike E. Clark. On a few songs on here, such as \\"Under The Moon\\" and \\"Pass Me By\\", they truly show some great craftsmanship on the songs. One of the problems with ICP albums is the large quantity of \\"juggalos\\", as they call themselves, who will likely put you off ever buying an album by them. However, this album rises above all the rest of the albums by this group. Sarcastic, darkly funny and a truly pointed album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Joker's Card","review":"In my opinion, this is the best joker's card and album ICP has ever released. What makes this cd great? Well, a 1 million dollar budget doesn't hurt. The production values for Milenko is just so much better than the previous three joker's cards. However, even with top notch production, the album does not lose any of its charm. This cd has a good mix of humor, horrorcore, and rap/rock that's executed to perfection.

Their sound is hard to describe. Its more indie rock than anything I guess. Its very experimental, yet not too out of reach for an average music fan.

Expect to hear about this band in the future because there is no way that they will not get popular.Overall they are one of the most original bands I have ever heard. This album is by far my favorite of 2007. Also. the cover art for this album is THE BEST COVER ART I have EVER seen for a band. There was so much thought put into it it blows my mind.

The games are broken down to 5 catagories: ALL TIME FAVORITES (Backgammon, Checkers, Chess, Chinese Checkers, Reversi) WORDS & NUMBERS (Anagrams, Dice, Kakuro, Sudoku, Word Cubes) PUZZEL GAMES (Concentration, Enigma, Jigsaws, Mahjong) FAMILY FAVORITS (3-D Tic-Tac-Toe, Naval Battle, Parcheesi, Quattro, Snakes and Ladders) STRATEGY GAMES (Dominoes, Go, Mancala, Gomoku, Shogi). In addition to having a lot of obscure games the game is not very intutive. It is difficult to figure out how to get help or get to the tutor mode. The font that is used plus the colors (font and background) make it difficult to read in places.

You can count on pretty much any Nikon products that are made within the highest standards. I have several other brand polarizer but this one is one of the best looking ones. I've stacked this filter and 3mm Hoya ultra thin on my 12-24mm Nikkor and due to its excellent sky darkening effect can hardly notice any vignetting problems even at the shortest focal length. The only problem is that depending on the angle of sunlight you may get uneven sky darkening effect on a wide angle lens. I'm a big sucker for polarizer filter and 90% of my work is done with it. Graduated Neutral Density filter sometimes can give better result on sky darkening effect depending on light condition.If you have the money just buy it; you won't regret it. If you want to spend less money, go ahead and get some other polarizer at half price. Taking great pictures is about observation, not about owning great equipments."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bluest Skies...","review":"It does what a quality polarizer is supposed to do, make the skies blue and the foliage pop.

What I want to explain is its construction.This filter is slim, slimmer than my other filters by 2-3 mm which is significant with ultra wide lenses. The one disappointing aspect is that the adjustment ring is flimsy, not its construction but when you use any touch will change the adjustment ring. The polarizing filters I had in the past had rings that took a bit more effort to turn but also they didn't feel like if you antecedently touch the filter the adjustment ring would turn.I would have liked to say that this was due to a bad batch or I got a defected one but I bought two (one for my friend) and they both feel the same way.Maybe this is a \\"feature\\" desired by people but certainly not myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible, but doesn't filter the reflexions","review":"I got it in time, nice, everything is OK - except I see myself in any glass surface like before.

And it's difficult to try to pick all that stuff off. Finally, I have really dry skin, so anywhere there is rougher skin (my hands, feet, sometimes legs) the material will snag and catch and it's really annoying.

The triptans I was taking on a regular basis weren't working and I didn't feel well on them. I revisited Dr. Buchholz's plan because I had nothing to lose and it made sense to me.

There is no scientific evidence but only anecdotal reports that triptans, such as imitrex cause rebound headaches and limiting patients to only two days of treatment with triptans per month is a crime! 2. Botox has completely relieved migraines in thousands of patients. There is not a single major headache center that does not offer this treatment. 3.

Indeed, I compared the Neotropic \\"Neotropic\\" track to a version I have from another album, and the two could not be more different. The Journey Into Ambient Groove 4 version has no stereo separation in it at all.

An assignment of 5-10 problems can be expected to take an average student upwards of eight hours. The text is disorganized (as a previous reviewer noted) and more important, overly formal. Mathematical symbology is used to excess, making the theorems and examples nigh impossible for most students to comprehend without guidance or hours of ponderment. In many cases, the examples are peppered with expressions such as \\"it is obvious that . . .\\" when the reader may have no idea what Cullen is doing! In one case, a notational convention (D as an operator meaning differentiation) was introduced several chapters before it was defined, and several frequently used symbols and notations are absent from the glossary inside the front cover"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Try This at Home","review":"This book was less than satisfactory. The author, Charels G. Cullen, does cover many of the topics in a typical Differential Equations course, but the book is completly unorganized. He provides problems at the begining of the first few chapters that one should not be expected to know how to do until the book is finished. Without an instructor and supplemental material, some of the topics are nearly impossible. In the course I took we rarely used it except for homework problems, and the reading we did do needed detailed explanation the next day.

If there was a better way of connecting the garden hose to the reel plumbing they would be good hose reels. However, I have not figured out a good way to connect the garden hose to the reel plumbing using the method provided by Rapid Reel! I plan to have a welder friend build a metal adapter to connect the reel plumbing to the garden hose such that the garden hose can be connected inline with the reel, which will eliminate the problem of the hose kinking and make the winding of the hose on the reel work more smoothly!

There's an informative, well-written introduction and then there are 400 pieces of his art. The reproductions of Matisse's works are pretty good (though some span two pages, which always irritates me since you miss so much in the fold) and this isn't some giant tomb.

As expected, Herbie has a lot of sound effects that he puts to good use, maybe not as crazy as \\"Headhunters\\" but spacey nonetheless. This is more of a commercially inclined record, but it still has its share of tempo changes and showcases. Stevie Wonder blows out an amazing harmonica solo on \\"Steppin' In It\\" and there is a killer bass solo on \\"The Traitor\\". The album ends with \\"Heartbeat\\", a dark tune that alternates between a brooding stomp and a funky shuffle; it closes the album on a somber note.Each song averages 8-9 minutes. There are a multitude of players on this record and its evident by the busy styles you hear. Worth checking out if electric funk is your thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery does not function on its own.","review":"I bought this item thinking that I could use the included battery.

It is very well written indeed. The author is to be congratulated on covering such a broad sweep so well, you feel no major area of activity has been left out or skimped on. He is also highly to be congratulated on explaining technical aviation matters in a very accessible way.The chapter on the V-Rockets is particularly good.The story as a whole has great drama.It would be wonderful is this book could be expanded into a series - one volume on each year of the Luftwaffe - it would be a major work of note and extremely helpful to the non-specialist.I have only missed one star as he does not fully explain the aircrew shortage (there could be many reasons for this shortage - but I'd like to know what they were - he does an excellent job in explaining the fuel shortage.)The book made me want to read much more about the Luftwaffe and its notable commanders and aviators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Border line anti-Mormon litterature!!!","review":"My sister told me about a book called \\"As a Thief in the Night\\" Well apparently there are two called by this same title. If you are LDS, you want the one authored by: Roger K. Young! Dont make the same mistake I did. This particular Book is not pro-LDS, and is more about how the LDS church was wrong about the millenium; at least by this author's:Dan Erickson's, opinion. This book is border line anti-mormon litterature.I find his title is particularly misleading, probably trying to ensnare people like me who are more excited about getting the book they want then fact checking particular authors.

Rick Washburn also joins this rag-tag team as a British Commander attempting to provide some comic relief but ultimately leaves you begging for relief from this hopeless movie. On the back of the DVD it says it is much akin to the spirit and theme of Dances with Wolves and to which I can only respond by quoting the ninth commandment, \\"Thou shalt not bear false witness\\". Heaven help us all that this movie may never find its way into our DVD players. It's only saving grace is that it's rated PG.

All captured from Lee Perry's Black Ark studio of the 70's, this is about as good as it gets. From the wicked grooves of \\"Dub Revolution\\" to Max Romeo's \\"War Ina Babylon\\" to the wonderful falsetto of Junior Murvin's \\"Police and Thieves\\" as well as Augustus Pablo's melodica on \\"Vibrate On\\" to Perry's own soulful vocal tracks to early uplifting performances from the Heptones, the Meditations, and the Congos, everything you could possibly want is here. The production throughout all three \\"reels\\" is amazing. All of the dubs and versions are nearly as good as their original tracks, if not better. The rhythms remain inventive and creative thoughout. In my opinion Lee Perry is the wierdest, most creative, most interesting musician Jamaica has ever known, and nothing stands as a better example than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is outdated.","review":"I didn't like this book.

As another poster mentioned, the mount can be used without the arm as well, though this does greatly reduce the amount of swivel available.

But this is not a book that complains about the sad state of theological education. Dembski and Richards provide a plan for what students can do to stem the tide of secularism and heterodoxy in religious schools. They and the other contributors offer a number of essays on timely themes, which carefully dissect unjustifiable assumptions in a variety of areas. Their approach exemplifies their conviction that the best solution to bad ideas isn't quarantine or overexposure, but inoculation.

If you're looking for nuts and bolts, you'd best search elsewhere. This is a shallow work that fails to deliver on the promise of its title. You're occasionally entertained, but the content is eminently forgettable. The book reminds me of college classes I've taken where you're mildly engaged, but where you're given nothing truly valuable to take away from the course. You're hoping for pearls of wisdom somewhere along the line, but you're consistently disappointed.

Ms. Noonan has been writing speeches for (mostly conservative) politicians for many years, and has a wealth of fun stories to tell about that experience.However, that's not why I bought the book - I purchased it to try to improve my public speaking skills, as the book's title implies would be its purpose.

I was a bit concerned about cots when I purchased this, but I've used it indoors and in a tent, and its perfect. I could have gotten a slightly smaller cot, but this one *seemed* to be the most well made of the ones I was looking at, and this was proved correct.

It is what it is - a book that is meant for mass market & broad appeal. Unfortunately, this means that the book will only be \\"a little bit helpful\\" for many and \\"a lot helpful\\" to few if any. It simply scratches the surface while avoiding the more challenging and sometimes complex topics parents face. I agree with some of the other reviewers who state that Supernanny seems to lack the depth that will be helpful in raising a child well. This is certainly a fun read, but do not go into it with very high expectations.

I'm not sure if I've just never bought this model before, but I don't remember there being a raised rubber section in the middle of the flip flop (where the label is).

When it comes to just plain enjoying a Ambient CD for it's listening pleasure, I cant recommend a CD more highly. I can put this CD on and do some reading or studying, using it as background music and it fits perfectly. But it's also beautiful to listen to. It's not full blown Eno ambient which I respect but don't really enjoy.

Two weeks ago the volume control stopped working and I ended up with an MP3 Player where I can not hear anything since the volume level was very low when the problem happened.The bottom line is that today I only have a fancy USB Flash Memory that works quite well.

I think if you get Pryor's self-titled debut with WB and Evolution/Revolution, you'll have the perfect combo for the early Pryor.

The spreader portion is detachable and loosens up a lot resulting in badly done crepes. One time I was spreading and it fell off. I tried to tighten it, but would not tighten. Since the spreader is thin, I did not want to use a mallet to make it stay for fear that it will break, besides it will come off again. I am just glad the crepe maker I bought had its own spreader, which I have now been using instead. I wanted to return this; however, I do not want to pay for shipping. This spreader costs $15.00 and would cost $9.00 to ship (amount I paid for shipping when I purchased) so it had cost me $24 already; so probably not worth returning. Maybe if I glue the spreader to the handle, then I can use it someday? Oh well...buyers beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crepe Spreader review","review":"This crepe spreader is too expensive for $15.

It did not come with glue...duh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal responsibility - personal action","review":"Anyone who having recently read John Allison's book \\"The Financial Crisis and the Free Market Cure\\" should read von Mises' book. The foundational thinking behind Allison's book is represented in large measure from von Mises' writings and the Austrian economic school of thinking. The book challenges traditional thinking about government-led economic intervention in times of crises. Sound economic practice is based on principles and not on political whims of the moment. Great emphasis is given to the notion of personal achievement or the freedom that allows individuals to take primary control of how they want to live."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fundamental book on economics ando society!","review":"A must read if you want to understand the inner workings of society and dispel all the myths surrounding it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Free Marketeers who can't get enough","review":"Not an easy book to start with - better to read after other greats who are perhaps more understandable, like Murray Rothbard, Milton Friedman, Ayn Rand, Henry Hazlett, Walter Williams.

Mises was an absolute genius and this is his magnum opus. After reading this there are no doubts left about the greatness of capitalism and the depravity of socialism. He covers every aspect of the market economy, as well as the characteristics of the socialist and hampered economies. He explodes fallacy after fallacy. This book reveals that capitalism is the greatest thing that has ever happened to the world. It has elevated living conditions to previously unthinkable heights. It is the only system that fosters human beings to live in civilized manner. This book is unparalled in human thought. It is the economic equivalent to Ayn Rand's fiction masterpiece Atlas Shrugged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream Weaver","review":"The portrayal of a Native American called Ingrid is fascinating. As part Cherokee, and interested in fiction of early America, I was not aware of the extent to which other groups had reached into northeastern Canada and Greenland. A lot of realism! The detailed description of Ingrid's journey and the interaction with her father and stepbrothers illustrates interesting pre-Columbian local tribal customs about family values. It was interesting how fifeteen century European priests tried to transform her paganism to their beliefs. It made her seem mature, more independent, and I found myself relating to the character. I found Dream Weaver's story so clearly that I finished it in two evenings. It was hard to put down! The work, to me, ranks favorably with my other recommended readings that include Linda Shuler, Sue Harrison, Lynn McKee and Jean Auel.

All the Compaq's connections are in the right place, though missing is any USB 2.0 port. The video card is in line with the other components, with a 16 meg ATI card onboard driving a very sharp 15\\" active matrix display.

The first 8% of this book is devoted to superfluous verbiage about nothing as the Brits are want to do. Harry, the author, had gone to law school and then decided to be a stage actor, but was never able to come close to his father in that craft. Father remained the best known and loved English actor of the time. Eventually Harry put his law degree to work in researching and writing about noted criminals of the 18th and 19th century. Comparing his writing to John Grisham, one can't help but wonder if Irving's years of theater didn't taint even the criminals biographies.

The only modification I did was getting tennis racquet grip tape and taped up the dip handle since it was just plastic. It was fine when I wore cusion gloves since I work on free weight as well, but the added mod gave me the luxury of just getting on it when I feel like it. The foam grip on the pull handles are sufficient, but it seems like they'll rip due to wear and tear.

Good product for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It can fry... but it sticks","review":"I love electric skillets, but this one does not have a great non-stick coating. Everything sticks, even things that are naturally non-stick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"We received it and returned it the next day. The quality was not up to our expectations. It moved all around on the counter. The legs are plastic and look as though they will fall off. It weighs a lot less than our same size Rival skillet. Basically it just looked and felt cheap. That all said, I can't say how well it cooks because we didn't try it out. Just be aware that it is a cheaply made product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst electric skillet we ever bought","review":"We had high hopes for this skillet, because of the positive reviews we had seen online, as well as previous experience with this brand. What a disappointment!! The non-stick coating wears off in about a year of NORMAL use, not even once a week. Now, even when we also use a non-stick spray first, as well as plenty of oil etc., we still have to scrape off the stuck food, from eggs to veggies. Please learn from our mistake, and DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!! I really don't know what's happened, if it's environmental standards that allow less of the non-stick coating or if the company is cutting corners to save money - but this consumer will never buy a Presto product ever again, and I'm spreading the word of our experience, to friends and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"presto electric skillet","review":"This is a great item.

Each one lasted 18-20 months and then started to blow the fuse when using. I will probably replace again with the same product, since competitive products are not made to last either. I have no complaints during the limited lifespan and would recommend the product for daily use."},{"rating":"2","title":"I deserved this!","review":"After years of suffering with my old skillet I purchased this one. With a family of five it can accommodate large meals, leftovers and pancake breakfasts (no need for a griddle). The see through lid is wonderful. No more nonstop peeking in fear of burning food. It is much more attractive than my old dinosaur with the huge cheap plastic dome cover too!

It is great for frying chicken, pork chops or fried potatoes. It heats quickly and evenly and fried foods cook quickly. The glass see through lid is great as you can see how your cooking is doing. You can fry, grill, bake or make casseroles in it much faster than on our stove. It is heavy cast aluminum with a nonstick finish inside and out and it is easy to clean up later.The heat control is nice in that it is easily adjusted and accurate to set the right temperatures. The skillet has side handles that keep cool for moving it around. The frying area is large so if you are having company or just have a lot of family you will love this great kitchen appliance.We use ours all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Electric Skillet","review":"I like this skillet, it gets the job done. It cooks evenly and has accurate heat settings. Also, the clear top is a plus. My complaint is that it feels cheap. It just seems really light weight and there is a lot of plastic pieces.

I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve's Review","review":"We have a few other Presto products, and they all work quite well. Growing up, my mother used her Presto electric skillet almost every day, and this is what prompted me to purchase this brand. Cooking, heating, warming, are all easy and perfect! The food cooks evenly too! This skillet adds a new dimension to cooking for me, in that I prefer cooking with electricity rather than natural gas...I now have both in the house. Clean up is effortless, either by hand or in the dishwasher. I find the only negative aspect of this design, to be the ability to easily view the temperature dial due to the intrusion of the handle...it's directly blocking it. To compensate, one has to look through or around the handle. It's an annoying inconvenience however. I completely recommend this product, and hope you will enjoy using it as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would recommend","review":"There are several things I love about this skillet. It seems to evenly heat and simmer is just that - a simmer (I have had some skillets that will boil and burn the ingredients on simmer). The only draw back is that the lid is not vented. Moisture does accumulate inside. However, for what ever reason, this extra moisture did not seem to \\"leak\\" down into the pan itself that much. Just be careful when removing the lid. I definitely would recommend this as a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-stick means coating comes off!","review":"Functions well except that coating flakes off too soon.

Others just seem to burn things that are directly above a singular round heating element. Not so with this one.We also love the size. It is larger than others that we have had. That means more veggies fit around the pot roast. Since the roasted veggies are our favorite part, that means a lot to us.We have only had this one for a few months, so the jury is still out on how long the non-stick surface will last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Expectations.......","review":"I am very happy I purchased this skillet.

We had a older range top/stove top at our house and it pretty much only had 3 temperature setting (obviously very annoying to cook on). So I invested in this electric skillet to have some sort of temperature control when cooking foods. And like I said, it performs fantastically!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful all purpose skillet","review":"This particular electric skillet is the 4th one we have owned.

The feet of this skillet are very slick. There is no traction. In turning the Salisbury steak the other night it took off on me and the next thing I knew it was dangling off the counter by the cord and dinner was on the floor. All it would have taken would be manufacturer flattening the foot portion of the leg a little or applying some sort of no slip/rubber foot. I will be sitting the skillet on my silpat for all future use as, in my opinion, this presents a serious safety hazard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legs are the weak link","review":"We got our unit for Christmas last year.

It is in perfectly good shape but I have begun looking for a replacement It is far better than the one I had before (Rival S16RB 12-by-16-Inch Oblong-Shaped Electric Skillet with Removable Pan: I didn't read the comments here and should have)but it still has problems. The temperature is difficult to regulate--things either burn or they take forever to cook--seems like there is no in between (i.e. perfectly browned) The skillet slopes into the center so it is hard to turn things and the handle is on the same side as the plug so that makes it even harder. The skillet is light but it feels very cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Non-Stick","review":"This skillet lost it's non-stick finish after 2 uses. Not only that, but it was cumbersome to store. I threw it away after 3-4 uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made.","review":"The legs are terrible. They aren't stable even when you first screw them on, and then the screws constantly loosen so it wobbles. This is a safety hazard. The lid doesn't have a steam vent, which is annoying. The pan also has hot spots.It's a nice large size. Nice for cooking, but cumbersome for storing. I made the mistake of storing it on top of my refrigerator, and one day it wasn't pushed back far enough and the whole thing came tumbling down when I opened the freezer. The glass lid broke into 7 billion pieces, some of which I am still finding.My last cheap electric skillet, a Black and Decker Deep Dutch, was much better. I got a few years out of that one, with the legs staying sturdy the whole time(the heating element eventually broke)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slides around on stove/counter top & too big for dishwasher","review":"We disliked this Presto electric skillet so much that we returned it. It's so big that it didn't leave much room for anything else in the dishwasher. And it slid around on our stove/counter top because it doesn't have non-skid feet. We switched to the Proctor Silex 12\\" electric skillet because it leaves room in the dishwasher and has non-skid pads on the feet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"Maybe their manufacturing process has changed or something, but this skillet started losing the non-stick after about 3 months of nothing but making bacon, eggs, and burgers/chops/steaks. No metal or anything else ever touched on the surface (bought the silicone spatula at the same time just for this) and yet it still started flaking. It seems to follow the burners under the surface.

This skillet has saved the day, which is key as my family still expects culinary delights daily from my makeshift kitchen! I have used the skillet for everything from boiling water for rice or noodles to making bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches - cooking all ingredients at the same time. The size is great, as you can space out items you are cooking - and get it done all at the same time.The temperature seems to stay constant, so that is not an issue. The only minor issue is that the legs seem to keep loosening up. I believe this was mentioned by other users in previous reviews. This seems like a minor issue for the manufacturer to resolve.All in all, I am very happy with the product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We use it every day","review":"I had some misgivings about this product based on the range of reviews - the same misgivings I have whenever I shop for small kitchen appliances.

You can get a good one or you can get junk.The Mr. Coffee coffee maker we bought in 2006 had the same kind of mixed reviews as the Presto 16-inch electric skillet but it's still working perfectly after nearly daily use six years later.My wife is giving the Presto electric skillet a real workout and hardly uses her electric cooktop range since it arrived.She loves the large cooking area and the precise controls and is particularly pleased with the ease of cleanup of the non-stick surface.So far, it looks like we rolled the dice and got one of the good ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"electric fry pan","review":"Works great - accurate temperatures and easy clean up.

We are very pleasantly surprised by how well it cooks. The only thing we're not crazy about, is because of it's size & shape; it's difficult to empty the used cooking oil. Not sure how they could improve that. Perhaps the kind of \\"lip\\" you find on a coffee machine carafe. That would make it perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I admit I want to return this ... when simmering, it only \\"bubbles\\" where the heating element is around the edges so I don't believe it gets hot enough.

So, this Presto skillet was used on a regular basis. The concept is great...to be able to use the skillet to serve in...is a nice plus. It's attractive enough to put on the table for family dinners. But, the coating began to flake off after about 3 months. The skillet heats quickly and the thermostat was precise. I just wish these manufacturers could get this non-stick coating to STAY ON the skillet.

Bought a relatively inexpensive Bostitch that worked well at first, and then bought another rebuilt one for spare. Neither compressor got much use during warranty periods, and both refused to build enough pressure to drive framing nails into southern pine after light to moderate use. Still work OK if using spruce lumber or small finish nails. Good compressor for someone who will never or seldom use it. Sort of like a cheap exercise bike. Good tool to buy if you don't plan to use it much! Basically, it is a junk throwaway tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total junk","review":"I bought this compressor to use as a portable unit; nail guns, air up tires etc. First, it will not start on an extension cord smaller than 12 ga. Second, it is often hard starting even plugged directly into an outlet. This compressor has less than two running hours on it, and I've gotten no reliable use from it. At this point I'm ready to give it away, So I pulled the cover off to clean it up, and discovered the casting broken just above the mounting bolt on both sides. I paid $200 for this thing, and got less than 2 hours of use from it, and now it is ready for the dumpster.Man, but this ticks me off.I will never, and I mean never buy another bostitch product!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bostitch Compressor Parts are cheap and do not last","review":"We bought this 6 gallon compressor and have had it for two years with very light use. The regulator knob where you set the psi is plastic and it threads onto a metal pipe, so the threads are quickly eaten up and then the unit will not work. This is a very common problem with these compressors (you can look it up and see many complaints online with the regulator).We tried contacting the 800 service number - who sent us to a local (40 miles away)service center. Of course they will be happy to replace it for parts and labor $ - with another plastic knob that will not last.We have also had to replace the hose that was on the unit. I do not recommend the Bostitch brand of tool or thier service."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will NEVER AGAIN buy Stanley/Bostitch products","review":"My compressor failed after owning it (bought new from Lowe's) for about 2 years. I did not use it heavily, and the piston and what looks like a fan failed...grinding to a halt with an ugly noise. My customer service interaction with Stanley/Bostitch (the maker) had them asking me to pay $116 for parts, when I paid about $160 for the product. For a few smallish parts (less than 10% of the whole) they want to charge me $116. My response to them: As I wrote to them, that kind of gouging is \\"clearly an abuse of the privilege of having customers buy [their] products\\". I will never again be a customer of Stanley/Bostich, and recommend that you take the same position, unless you like being gouged for minor parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"smells like burning","review":"I bought this compressor with the trim gun set for a good price at Home Depot. It always smelled kind of funny when it ran but since it was brand new I assumed that's just the way it was.

I called the manufacturer and the only other option they gave me besides shipping it back to them was to physically bring it in to a repair shop over an hour away. I got it back two weeks later, and it worked just fine for about a month until it started acting up again to the point that it just wouldn't load beyond 20 PSI.For a less than $ 200 compressor, it is just not worth my time to be on hold for an hour to claim the warranty or drive for an hour to have it fixed yet again.My advice, invest on something more reliable ( I am not blaming the brand, I use Bostitch Nail Guns ) but I know that if had taken the time to research it a little further I would have never have to waste my time or money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I have had mine for about 1.5 years and used it sparingly during that time. I noticed early on that is had issues from not turning off to not turning on. Now i cannot build any pressure as the regulator is broken. I took it apart and saw that the unit is basically a plastic quagmire. It is of very poor design. Bostitch should be ashamed for selling this crap. Now in the scope of things I wonder how long it might be before the tank over pressurized and blew up my garage. Do not buy this or any other unit made by this company. It is simply dangerous IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is disposable - worked for ONE project w/finishing nails...","review":"I purchased this to do some work around the house after hearing that Bostitch was a good brand. Well, technically it did allow me to complete one project but it was incredibly loud and it took 15 minutes to achieve decent pressure(!?!?!).I used it for tacking up baseboards (small finishing nails only) and then stored this thing in our workroom. I also used it to pump up low car tires once. Just over a year after purchasing it, I tried to drive some more finishing nails but this thing won't charge up beyond 10psi. It is out of the warranty period and it costs almost as much to fix it as to buy a new one.Next time I want to buy disposable garbage I'll just go down to Harbor Freight and save some money...-Disgusted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased with product","review":"I would recommend this compressor to any one.It does not pull very many amps so it can be used on a low amp breaker and a long extension card .I am a serviceman and have been using a craftsman dual tank compressor for many years. The bostitch compares to the craftsman.Have read reviews that people has said the bostitch is loud.All compressors that put out any volume of air will make noise and each compressor has there on tone of noise.I can not hear that this compressor is any louder than others. It just has its on tone.You can not go wrong with this compressor for medium use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Purchased this compressor w/Brad Nailer as a gift for my son. He used it once, then moved to an apartment, storing the unit with me. I went to used it and it would not bring up any pressure. Afraid I broke it so looked up a factory repair center. I brought it in and they told me \\"they did not want to mess with it\\". I said what? and the explained that this was so bad he had ten that customers have just told him to keep it. Also the factory rep came by and he could not even fix it. He went on to say he replaces the valves in them for $47 in parts +$40 in labor , the customers leave and return them next week broken with the same problem. Bottom line the nailer is great, but buy a Craftsman compressor and save yourself the headaches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for me!","review":"This compressor has worked great for me. I like that it is somewhat powerful and also light enough to pick up by hand. I also like the oil-free aspect of it - keeps everything clean.I use it to run an impact wrench, keep a fleet of cars tires pumped up, and run a diaphragm pump. It has plenty of power for more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Design & Poor Manufacturing Quality","review":"The unit was a gift. I started using it some months later, after it was out of warranty. On the very first project, it started leaking air at the regulator/switch assembly and would no longer develop pressure. The design of this assembly is very poor. I can see why the factory was not able to assemble it correctly and the reviews are so low (more 1s than 5s). Out-it-goes. No Bostitch purchases for me. I got a Husky, no problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and noisy","review":"Bought this to replace an old pancake compressor. This Bostitch is very noisy, almost too loud to be inside. Also has very little useable capacity, runs almost constantly on a framer and very frequently on a finish nailer. I used this on one job and am replacing with a Dewalt twin stack. As I have many Bostitch Nailers I was very disappointed with this compressor, the only good thing I can say is that it was fairly inexpensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty nice little air compressor for the homeowner!","review":"I have owned this air compressor for about a year and a half. We built our own home, and I used it quite a bit. If you were going to be using a compressor all the time, you may want one with a little more air capacity so the compressor does not kick on all the time. But for me, this works just fine. And a great price on Amazon to go with it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a few months","review":"First one arrived broken. Amazon took it back and sent a new one. Worked ok for a few months and now runs constantly at about 110 psi when its not even being used. I'm told its a bad piston/valve assembly and now I have to take it to the nearest repair center. Its also pretty loud but comparable to other similar pancake compressors. Anyway, my advise is buy a porter cable if you want something that works for around $150. Sounds like many others would agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopefully it dies tomorrow!","review":"My home compressor is a Makita Mac2400 which blows this thing out of the water. However, I have to use the bostitch at work. Earplugs are my new best friend.

Materials were good quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Ever Review","review":"Okay, so this is my first review, but I was forced to do it because reviews for this EP make me so angry. I believe people are misunderstanding the point of this album. The album was inspired by a lifted pickup truck Jason Lytle saw at Lake Tahoe with a license plate that read \\"ToddZilla\\". Some of the more uncharacteristic songs on the album are inspired by the thought of what this \\"Todd Zilla\\" guy must be like. Thus you end up with songs like Pull The Curtains with it's explicit lyrics and Florida, which are meant to be written from Todd's viewpoint, not Jason Lytle. With that said, the album is quite solid with the exception of A Valley Son and Cinderland, which are certainly B-Side material for Grandaddy, thus the 4 stars. Give songs like Goodbye a listen all the way through and tell me that outro alone (at 3:20) is not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!","review":"After reading the review up above me and being a Modesto native, it's really hitting home that Grandaddy will soon be no more. I guess people move on. But their music has changed my life in so many ways. It makes me homesick for Modesto. Gives me hope that music is good again. Moves so smoothly listening wise and lyrics are always top notch.This EP is no joke, it's amazing. Jason's always onto some new kick and with this he deciding to rock out like crazy. It starts you off with a jam and then slows a bit to let you catch your breath and then picks right back up. When he gets to the song \\"Florida\\" honestly I didn't know Grandaddy could go that nuts. To just scream out in agony mixed with rock and roll fever. It must be him letting go of this music and not going willingly. I shuddered at the song. But to break it down. If you love Grandaddy then you'll love this I'm certain."},{"rating":"2","title":"goodbye modesto, goodbye grandaddy?","review":"if you haven't heard, this is quite possibly the second-to-last grandaddy release. we'll probably get a single or two from next year's album, but jason has said he's movin on and up and out to l.a., leaving grandaddy behind. oh well. he's also said he'll always record music, so that's all i need to know.anyway, on to the e.p. in a word, brilliant. if you're a grandaddy fan there is no way you won't love this. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is the length. need more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't quite get myself to like it... - won't be missing them","review":"I can't avoid thinking of The Flaming Lips when I hear Grandaddy. I cannot avoid it, I am sorry. This EP is no exception to that, but this time I also happened to have a hard time finishing it up. It felt like a meal I had to have, but fortunately it was not the case... I enjoyed the flavor of the first few songs, but eventually they start repeating themselves and toward the end of the album (\\"Florida\\" to be more specific), they just loose it. They are no punk act, so I am not sure what are they trying to accomplish. I am sorry if this offends some fans of the band, but I won't be missing them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mel being Mel","review":"Another tiresome screed from professional moaner Mel Hurtig.

But just about everything from the time cameras were invented has been included in this book.It's basically a love affair with surfing. It's got illustrations of people serfing (that's no surprise I guess) but the things like record albums, movie posters, decals. Here's the Beach Boys, Annette (who didn't get off the beach) and Frankie, Gidget of course who started it all, and Elvis. Here are the stories, the champions, the music -- basically the story of the pioneers of the surfing culture.This is a beautifully done book, well illustrated and with enough of a story to present the history of the sport."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Celebration of Culture, Not A History Of Sport","review":"I got this book for my soon to be 12 year old nephew who's lives in Newport Beach and already surfs many times a week. But he won't get a lot out of this book. Why? It's more a story of the culture around Surfing (particularly when it was popularized in the mid sixties) than a story of how the sport evolved. There's lots of nostalgia to enjoy if you're 58 years old like me and grabbed your first wave in '63 but, I also know Surfing's history inside out and there's too much missing here to rate this book highly. Any book that supposedly tells the history of Surfing and neither Phil Edwards or Nat Young are mentioned but actress Barbara Eden is 3 times is laughable........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Kitty!","review":"Bad Kitty arrived safe & sound to my classroom.

It is so very funny and original that it takes a second reading to realize that the art is extraordinarily beautiful and detailed.Unlike the professional reviewer above, I enjoyed words like sQuash for the letter Q. When a writer has a theme like food (or destruction!) in an alphabetic book there are sometimes very few words available to them. I'm always interested in seeing what the authors do with letters like Q and Z. So add another good grade: Good use of the letter Q!The information page says this book is intended for the 4-8 crowd.

I skimmed through the whole book to try to find the tiny paragraphs scattered throughout that are actually about his eating disorder.

Don't read this book, even if you don't care about reading about eating disorders."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm with Leslie.","review":"Hate to say it, but I found myself doing the same thing as the reviewer named Leslie: leafing through the book, searching for passages about the author's husband's illness, and not passages where in which she talks about herself.

I identified with the author's underlying fears and feelings of inadequacy that made her feel like she deserved the life she ended up with. It inspired me to be careful and make sure I make a choice because it's the best choice for me, not because I fear success or failure. This book reminded me of my mother - how she put up with challenges and a husband that wasn't right for her because she wanted to be a 'good wife, good mother'. It helped me understand why she stayed married to my father when it was obvious she wasn't happy. The author in this book gives so much insight into the motivations of women in her generation. They are worlds away from mine! I loved this book, and I will get my mother to read it.

This time around I listened to the digital audio version from the public library.I guess 20 years ago the frank sexual content did not bother me, but now that I am older, I think it should have been left out of the book. It slows the pace and seems unnecessary to get any points across.

Fortunatly, she already knows to hunt and she can heal...so she is a step ahead of the game. This book takes us through her learning to make it on her own, as well as how Jondalar comes to with her. I loved it too, because I found the whole discription of ancient life very interesting.People complain because Ayla is too perfect and does too much in her life (domesticating horses, discovering cave age lighters), but it is not completely implausable.At any rate, this is a great book that is well-researched and it is one of those books that I've read many, many times!Loved it!

What a character she is and my heart goes out to her. I will read the next book in this series but having read the first two back to back I will take a short break before starting it.I was very happy to see the progression of events for this girl as I read on.

I can say though with certainty that I am glad I read the first two books of this series and look forward the the next book, The Mammoth Hunters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Auel Slays Her Own Masterpiece","review":"In my mind this book holds the distinction of having the greatest disparity between the greatness of the first book (Clan of the Cave Bear) and the dreadfulness of the sequel. It is a predictable and contrived love story that I knew in entirety within the first 30 pages. Jean has shown that at least on a romantic front she has all the depth and imagination of a 14 year old girl.Lets also not forget that in a mere fraction of one girl's lifetime, the protagonist discovers thousands of years of human advancement single-handedly!Garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow but almost as good as the first book.....","review":"Auel's second installment in the Earth's Children series does start out fairly slow. Not only does the plot follow Ayla and her newly-found animal companions but it also focuses on Jondalar, the handsome blonde-haired, blue-eyed wonder, and his brother, Thonalon. Most of the first half of the book tends to make you want to skip pages to get to \\"the good part\\" however, again, there is a wealth of knowledge about the Ice Age throughout the pages. Auel even uses several pages to discuss flint knapping. For those of you who aren't interested in the historical perspective, you may find the book rather dull until Ayla and Jondalar finally meet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitious","review":"First off, I liked Clan of the Cave Bear because of its imagination. This book is not as good. For one thing, everything in the book gets repeated, and then repeated again, and then repeated again. We aren't stupid, we got it the first time. For another, about 2/3 of the book is spent romanticizing an entirely unbelievable new character (Jondalar) who we don't even care about until at least mid-way through the book.I found myself skipping entire pages and never missing having read them.Maybe the Mammoth Hunters will be better. We'll see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"An out and out bad book. The dialogue is corny, and the scenes are quite boring especially those with Jondalar and Thonolan. I skipped a lot of pages because I couldn't bear to read through their dumb scenes. It's supposed to be prehistoric times but these two characters talk like they're in 2002 L.A. with the main goal of scoring on women. Pretty [bad]. How this book ever got good reviews from the critics is beyond me. The only interesting scenes are those with Ayla. Clan of the Cave Bear is really good but don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jean Auel turns to a smut author?","review":"I, like many others, really liked Clan of the Cave Bear. I liked Valley of Horses up til the latter half when the wanton and repetitive, graphic sex began. I mean, I don't mind an occasional sex scene in a book, but this got to the point of monotony. It continues in The Mammoth Hunters which I was unable to finish. I found myself skipping over the sex scenes to get to the plot which became repetitive in itself. The author tries too hard to make Ayla into a superwoman and Jondalar into the ultimate ladies man. Then when they get together, they become bumbling idiots who can't even look at each other without jumping in the sack. I was so disappointed with the direction the author decided to go with this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well...","review":"I did like this book, I thought that it was interesting and I needed to find out what had happened to Ayla.

You must read and find out.Overall, I enjoyed the book a lot, and found it an interesting enough read to see what continues to happen with Ayla."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superwoman meets Mr. Hunk","review":"In my opinion this is the best book of the Earth Children series.Ayla, a Homo sapiens girl raised by Neanderthalers after her parents have died (book 1) has fled the clan and has found a pieceful valley to live in.It is amazing what she can invent all on her own: what took mankind hundreds of thousands of years she manages on her own in just three years or so. Even though this makes the story rather unbelievable, the writing is so entertaining that yu keep on turning the pages.Parallel with the story of Ayla's survival in the valley runs the story of 2 brothers on a long quest for they-don't-know what.

The story of Jondalar and Thonolan was exceedingly dull and could have been at least half as long as it was. For having so little pertinence to what happens later, it was way too long. Alya's intermittent story in the first 18 chapters was still worth reading, though. But it wasn't until chapter 19, when Jondalar and Ayla meet that it started to get really interesting. After that, the book was a much faster read. But considering that 75% of the book isn't that great, it was somewhat of a disappointment, after the every-page-is-interesting Clan of the Cave Bears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition is riddled with typos","review":"The typos are many and distracting.

I think I'm done with the Earth's Children books."},{"rating":"2","title":"what drew me to the book...","review":"I read the first book and instantly fell in love with Ayla and the craziness of her life. I couldn't wait to find out what happens to her next so I immediately bought the second book. Although the books are quite long and at times can seem to only contain descriptions of the character's worlds and routines, the author manages to work in exciting tidbits and details of the character's story lines through the vast explanations. You are literally just reading chapter by chapter till Ayla and Jondalar meet. Just when you think you can put this book down and pick up another it snags your attention and you are completely engrossed once again. The book can definitely be quite explicit at times just like the first but once you move past this fact all you want to do is keep reading to find out what happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, but distracting number of editing mistakes.","review":"I always enjoyed this series and was pleased to buy it for my kindle. However the frequent number of typos and words that were spelled correctly but not what the author intended have me thoroughly disgusted. It detracts from my enjoyment of the book. I feel that when paying almost as much as a paperback format I should receive something of equal quality and this edition failed.

Much colder then with massive glaciers extending far south into France. Have you ever given serious thought to the men and women that lived during this time side by side with the woolly mammoths and cave lions? They had to be a very complex,clever and creative people !

In The Valley of Horses, Auel revs up the feminism somewhere between hyper and supra. The first hundred or so pages are okay. If you like Clan of the Cave Bear you will like this section. In truth I didn't get past page 250. The manslut who just can't find 'true love' was way too much. Sometimes I think feminist should have to put locks on books that can only be opened if the user has the correct amount of estrogen in her system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't get item or money back!!!!","review":"For all of you shopping on Amazon I wouldn't buy from this seller.

Auel continued to take everything that made the first one great but she added a new emotion to this one which made it wonderful. True love. Sure in the first one Ayla had love for her son and love for her family but it wasn't the same. True love seems to be one of those things that very few are privelaged to find and for someone to put the very emotion of it and prepare it on paper I think is incredible. I'm not a romance buff because I tilt more to the historical books but I think anyone who feels like they have something in their life missing can relate to this story. The story line was completly imaginative and amazing. Because of the way she plays her words I can see the story unfolding in my head. I would even go to be dreaming the story becuase her books just captured my mind. With her details and research...definitly left me impressed once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissatisfied","review":"I ordered this book as a gift to finish a collection.

The album by the Hoodoo Gurus is brilliant, the book isn't even remotely close to that, in fact several stars out of 5 not so.This veers well into really, really boring romance novel territory. It may be supposed to be like that, but at that length, it gets really tedious, really, really quickly. Avoid it, unless that is what you are looking for, as smart guy and smart girl lust after each other across Neanderthal territory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second in series","review":"This may have lacked just a hint (barely) of the tension in the first book, but it is still a page turner. The story continues with Ayla after she is banished from the clan. She's heartbroken at having to leave her son behind and the family she grew up with. She finds a wonderful valley and is finally joined with a companion.The erotic scene between Ayla and Jondalar is spicy! One of the best romance pieces I've read in a book that wasn't listed as a 'romance'.Chrissy K. McVayauthor of 'Souls of the North Wind'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but repetitive","review":"I realy enjoyed the first book and enjoyed this one as well. My only regret is that it is sooooo repetitive. I realy got tired of hearing Ayla's ideas of where babies come from. I have read the entire series and firmly believe that if the author took out all the repitition it would turn out to be TWO very compelling and enjoyable books. I hope the author takes into consideration this recurring complaint from her readers and keeps the flashbacks to a minimum on her next endevour. I eagerly await her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than ever","review":"You thought clan of the cave bears could not be topped? Guess again, and add some good crys for the romance and love/sex scenes. This was UNREAL. Don't worry about some bad reviews you see here. They are from men who know they could not possibly match up to Jondalar, so they have their ego speaking. I have yet to find someone, female OR male, who did not like it and learned a little something in the process. After all, this is how every woman would like to be loved...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cave man meets harlequin novel","review":"While I couldn't put Clan of the Cave Bear down, I could not finish this clumsy sequel's attempt to match the the heroine with the over-sexed cave man. The first book (Cave Bear) works, in part, because there is no verbal language. The language in Horses is absurd and maybe I should have tried to read more than 100 pages but I think I know where this is going - and I don't need to be convinced Ayla, the first modern woman, needs a man to complete her mastery of nature.Let me guess. The romantic coupling this builds to leads to the birth of blond, blue-eyed people that will be the model for strong, self-sufficient Clan of Aryan world...Sad that this supermarket love story is called the Earth Children Series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real change of pace from the first book","review":"I have to say that I was very dissapointed reading this book afterhaving just finished Clan. The former book was absolutelyground breaking--an insight into an alien culture that said asmuch about the Clan as it did us. But this book, is more of aromance/survival/animal friendship story. To me it read likea combination of \\"The Blue Lagoon\\" meets \\"The Black Stallion\\"meets \\"McGyver\\" meets \\"Lassie\\". Ayla spends the first half ofthe book befriending wild animals and independently inventingmost of the major innovations of the stone age. Then shemeets a man that is a wandering Casanova who has neverreally fallen in love with anyone. Will Ayla be able to tame himand get this \\"bad boy\\" to finally settle down? You'll have to readthrough many missunderstandings and lost oportunities to findout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here we go again - Romance among the woolly mammoths.","review":"Like its predecessor, 'The Clan of the Cave Bear' this novel is well-written but ethnocentric. The archaic Homo sapiens (Neanderthals) have disappeared, which is a pity considering their rich culture and belief system. Instead we have the person who is deemed worthy of being Ayla's mate - a tall, blond, blue-eyed Cro-Magnon like herself, who could show Don Juan a thing or two when it comes to sex. The happy couple also invent the spear-thrower and learn how to light a fire with flint - in the process Jondalar of the amazing virility meets the only woman who can love him. Try a Harlequin, they're cheaper.On the plus side, 'The Mammoth Hunters' and 'The Plains of Passage' are bad enough to make this book look good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jean M. Auel's Earth's Children series is facinating.","review":"This novel, the second of the Earth's Children series, is written in such graphic detail that it is impossible to put down. Auel's extensive research and vivid imagination capture the heart and soul of the prehistoric era. I highly recommend the entire Earth's Children Series beginning with Clan of the Cave Bear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sequel to Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"\\"The Valley of Horses\\" is Jane Auel's sequel to \\"Clan of the Cave Bear.\\" \\"Clan\\" is by far the better book, but \\"The Valley of Horses\\" is a worthy sequel (and there are several books to follow this one).When we left \\"Clan of the Cave Bear,\\" the heroine was a modern version of man living among a dying species. \\"The Valley of Horses\\" helps the heroine find more people like herself for the first time, and she meets Jondular and falls in love.

Unlike Clan, the middle two books are brain candy. It's like Auel is being forced to write a bad tv sitcom.Fortunately, it gets better with Shelters of Stone.

I finally read The Valley of Horses (I have not read The Clan of the Cave Bear, and now I never will) and could not believe how bad it is. I don't recall ever coming across a less convincing attempt to recreate the language, relationships and culture of another time. It is as if the author took a script for a 1980s soap opera, changed a few words and offered it as a rather poor parody of a stone age story - except that it is not intended to be a parody. I am sorry I wasted my time reading this (...) when there are so many great books I could be reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"YIKES...hard to believe the smae author wrote \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\"","review":"I found this mostly tedious....lots of overwhelming and BORINGdescriptions of things...little interesting character development..BUT if you are interested in Ayla's story...it serves thatpurpose superficially"},{"rating":"1","title":"The sex book","review":"I tried really hard to like this book, but the first half really drags. Let's see what we've got here - Ayla talks to herself, weaves, invents the lighter and livestock domestication. On the other side of Europe, Jondalar and his brother wander through villages having graphic sex with pretty girls. They also get injured a lot and get drunk/stoned a couple of times. Oh yeah, and we find out that the Others don't like the Clan. Oy vey.Finally, Jondalar hooks up with Ayla. Oh boy! maybe things will pick up for the second half! Overall, they do, but Ms. Auel needs to be introduced to the black marker in the worst way. In short, the book is necessary reading if you want to understand the rest of the series, but it's really just a transition book. It could have been a lot more."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the books in the Earths Children series are excellent","review":"I thought that this book was very good...the first one in the series left u hanging...so this one was really interesting..as are all her books in this series"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking Pre-historic Saga","review":"Set in ice-age earth. Ayla has left the cavemen that have raised her in search for her own people. This novel was fascinating, being set with just the main character and her survival skills in a pre-historic world, with cave-bears, mammoths and other dangerous creatures. She found contentment on her own with her animal friends. I found this not only educational but it also drew me into Ayla's world. She leaves her valley in the end after finding love in a tall stranger from the north. Read Clan of the Cave Bear first to better appreciate this novel, you will not be disappointed. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly disappointing sequel","review":"I felt that Clan of the Cave Bear was a work of literary genius. Naturally, I couldn't wait for the sequel. Clan of the Cave Bear was a fascinating intellectual insight into the lives of prehistoric humans. Unfortunately, The Valley of Horses has none of that. In my opinion, The Valley of Horses was a tepid story that took a severe nosedive at the end. There is none of the rich tension that made Clan of the Cave Bear so irresistable. The plot of The Valley of Horses is thin and utterly predictable and the book then disintegrates into a lifeless, suspenseless work of dull pornography. Those readers who loved \\"Clan\\" would do well to skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really the prehistoric era?","review":"First let me say that I loved Clan of the Cave Bear and had great hopes for this one. Boy, was I let down. I found myself arguing with and complaining to the author as I read. As a student of prehistoric human culture, I found the portrayal of these characters' culture to border on the absurd. Everyone is well-fed, because hunting and gathering are so incredibly easy. Whenever a tool or device is needed, the characters simply invent it! Marriage ceremonies, domestication of animals, and the building of boats are the extracurricular activities of these Ice Age peoples, since no one is too preoccupied with the business of surviving. And let's talk about building boats, since the author does; slowly, uninterestingly, and for an entire chapter that you can just skip if you want to - you won't miss a thing (except a few yawns). The size of Jondalar's member is also discussed more frequently than is needed. Overall, this is a poor addition to the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the 'Clan of the Bear' writer?","review":"More than half of this book is like reading two different books, one chapter at a time. In one of them, Ayla is Isaac Newton of her era. No wonder Jondalar confused her as a Donii. In the other part you learn about the sexual adventures of two young men. The end of the book is all about sex. Don't get me wrong, I like sex stories, but not when they do not add anything to the story. This book could be much more about the clashing of the Clan and the Others cultural references. It actually gave me some hope when Jondalar and Ayla met. But some chapters later she learns Jondalar's language in a nightmare and from then on it's all about solving relationship problems.I read the reviews of the next 3 books and I'm really disappointed.

But to assert this lacking the overall context, it is not useful.Professor Kohlmann should perhaps confine himself to the details of the terrorist groups and avoid writing about areas such as the Balkans where he lacks the expertise to make incisive comments.As just one example, he fails to grasp the role of the various Orthodox Christian groups in the region.

The musicianship is superb as is the production but the tracks are over before they've begun. Some lasting over a couple of minutes before ending. With Jazz/fusion you expect relatively long tracks to give the musicianships a chance to show off their chops, but on this apart from one or two tracks it doesn't happen. There are very few solo's if any. A shame because the ideas are brilliant in a sub-mahavisuna text. Imagine 'inner mounted flame' crossed with 'hot rats' without the solo's and this about sums it up. I was dissapointed because it just doesn't get anywhere or is never given the chance because of the pitiful length of each song. There is fifteen of them so that about sums it up. What a wasted oppertunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated.","review":"This Arti & Mestieri recording is nowhere near as good as their 1976 release Tilt. This recording which pre-dates Tilt by a couple of years is a far busier affair with a pronounced emphasis on the horn section. The tunes are just not compelling or memorable.

This film like the 1991 Bugsy film is a Hollywoodized phony biography of Siegel and Hill. Hill is shown in this film as a savvy woman who came from the hills of Kentucky to make a life for herself. She was in fact from Georgia and had what one woman called \\"the mouth of a truck driver\\". Hill was one of the original Hollywood drug dealers. Her main line were Amphetamines supplying even poor Judy Garland and numerous other stars who needed to stay thin and used her services. Siegel built the Flamingo with Lucky Lucianos's heroin trade profits. It never amazes me how Hollywood loves to glamorize 1940's gangsters. Dyan Cannon was horribly miscast as Hill. Keitel plays Siegel in this film and was actually better than Warren Beatty's performance in Bugsy, Keitel is in that film also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting brain teasers for coders","review":"This book has a set of bugs to work through in C, Java, Perl, Python, and Assembler.

I have a greater respect and admiration for the Polish than before and was thrilled to have some Polish history set in the Napoleon days, as well as a taste of Polish high society. The heroine, Anna, was a bit much at times since she had few faults, but it was a great take off from the first novel. As a matter of fact, it was a direct take off from Push not the River."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Nearly As Good As Push Not The River","review":"I absolutely fell in love with James Conryod Martin's novel, Push Not the River. I couldn't stop flipping the pages to see what horrible misadventure and life lesson the countess would learn in the coming chapters. It was like peering at a bad car accident. A real guilty pleasure.However, this sequel left me sorely dissappointed. While the first novel was mostly the story of the countess' personal life adventures, this novel was essentially a war story. In fact, it seemed at one point like Napoleon was the main character. Also, the characters' personalities seemed to change dramatically from one book to the next, which made it difficult to buy into.I highly recommend reading Push Not the River, which was actually based on the countess' diary, and leave the cliffhanger ending to your imagination. Skip the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book put me to sleep several nights in a row. . .","review":"I fell in love with the heroine, Anna in Push Not the River, yet in this book, Against a Crimson Sky, she had little more than a walk on part in much of the story.

Even if it is in an illegal bussiness the way that he carrys himself with the untouchable attidude is what everyone likes.

I used this book and Surgery Recall (a must in most surgery clerkships) and felt well prepared for the shelf. I scored well above the national mean and the class mean.

I did all of the question in this text and felt very comfortable with the material (having answered most correctly and quickly). Fortunately, I used pretest and surgical recall as well. Had I relied on this book alone, I would have been shell-shocked while taking the shelf. Again, the difficulty level in this book is inappropriate and provides poor preparation for the exam that counts!

I would advise anyone to purchase the 4th edition with caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufferable","review":"Like most other reviews of the book indicates, there are way too many errors in this book: several wrong answer choice indicated as being right (e.g., it would say C is correct when clearly the explanation says that D is), run-on sentences, spelling errors (\\"alcoholic\\" stool?), and explanations that are ambiguous and don't even address why the correct answer was correct. In one instance, the explanation just cut off in the middle of a sentence. It's almost as if the editors didn't even read it over after the first draft, or maybe they are marginally literate.What truly worries me, however, is how much these minor errors reflect the possibilities of major informational errors; THAT would be the worst part of the book by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent review of subject for the beginners","review":"This book highlights only on things that are important. To the point and accurate.

I can definitely say that this book isn't good preparation, because the explanations don't make any sense. The first chapter is Trauma. I read my assigned textbook's chapter on trauma, attended my rotation's trauma lecture, and then tried my hand at this book. The questions didn't have anything to do with what I'd read in the textbook or heard in lecture. Question 1 deals with proper used of a Steimann pin for a supracondylar fracture. What??? The explanation didn't give any more info above saying that this fracture should be treated with a Steimann pin... didn't mention WHY that answer choice was correct, why the other answer choices were incorrect, or what a Steimann pin was. If you're looking for a question book that will actually teach you something, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Pretest instead","review":"The purpose of doing questions, in my opinion, is to get better at doing questions like those on the shelfs! People say that they expose holes in your knowledge as well, but that is not always useful information because people generally study as much as they can in the time they have. This book is not good at training you to answer questions correctly because the questions were way too difficult. By difficult I mean that you couldn't use your brain to figure out the answer with the knowledge you've accumulated, you had to have known the completely random fact that they decided to write a question around. In summary- buy PRETEST, much more useful for the shelf, in fact, there were at least three questions on my shelf directly out of the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors","review":"As the other reviewer said, this book has too many errors.

I found this brand and when I saw the nail polish remover (with the nail polishes), I thought I'd try. Well, not only does the nail polish flake off in a couple of days but the nail polish remover, that is suppose to take off this special nail polish, doesn't make a dent. I used 1/4 of the bottle without removing a speck of the color. I had to resort to old fashion nail polish remover which took it off in one swipe.

In some ways, though, it's less humor and more social analysis of movies that...well, as the title suggest, shocked the public. The nuggets of info of what went on behind the scenes or how these movies impacted (or didn't) the box office was very fascinating. I didn't really dig the \\"For Further Disturbance\\" sections as often a lot of it was rehashed stuff I had just read on the movie in question.Definitely a book that needed to be published and something \\"fillum\\" snobs should read. Yes, Virginia, there is a whole movie world out there that does not fit your pigeonholes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profoundly Tedious","review":"Joe Bob Briggs becomes what he rails against - a bore! Too many goldurn words in very teeny tiny print that drone on and on about the significance of this and the importance of that. Thank God I was given the book and didn't have to buy it. Joe Bob knows better than anyone the curse of overanalyzing the obvious -shame on him for being such a hypocrite. The worst offense committed by Mr. Briggs, is that after getting into his essays and being so turned off by his tedious workovers, I am also uninterested in watching the movies themselves. In his weird, condescending way Joe Bob assumes that exploitation movies need literary validation. Avoid this book, and watch the flicks - if you are into that sort of thing. I too am profoundly disappointed in this effort. Joe Bob Briggs, beloved Drive-In Reviewer of Grapevine, Texas - should hang up the speaker and limp off to teach a film appreciation course to people who would rather intellectualize a movie than see one or make one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"I'm so glad Joe Bob Briggs didn't write (yet) another tired and predictable book about [...] beer.

However, one of the four binding pieces had the holes drilled in the WRONG spot; measurement off by 2 cm, which is enough to make it not functional-the screw will not fit into the pre-drilled hole. RRR!! I am really wishing we hadn't purchased this piece and if you are wise you will NOT buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book for highly seasoned tutors","review":"This book addresses some, but not all common garden variety questions teachers have about everyday issues with technique. Moreover, Miller's answers are highly technical and clearly directed at seasoned tutors in an elitist manner. For the ordinary mortal, you will need to have Google or a music thesaurus at hand at all times so you can research the numerous references to biological processes and parts of the anatomy which, after some chapters, makes for very tedious reading indeed. Miller has not written this book for the every man and most of the information is either irrelevant or too highbrow to comprehend. I imagine that the purists would love the information in the book but for the rest of us we are better off looking for resources that are more easily understood and that can be put to practical use immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"deviations project","review":"This album is great! It is classical music with a new feel. I love how they combine many elements of sound to create a new experience for the listener. If you listen, you can hear pop, classical, techno all in one song! I highly recommend this album for when you are in a classical but not too classical mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just fantastic","review":"This CD rocks. There's no other way to say it. It's classical music--with a twist. The violinists are excellent musicians. The deviations are funny to those who are classical music fanatics, and amazing to the casual listener. From Bizet's \\"Carmen\\" to \\"Swan Lake\\" and Axel's \\"Crazy Frog,\\" this album takes some random (but impressive) pieces and makes them (even more) fun and exciting to listen to. Random becomes a lot less random. It all makes perfect sense.It's very new album and I already can't wait for the next one that I demand these two artists do. Electronica and classical meet in this album. It's witty and clever, and very fun to listen to. Have I said enough to convince you that this is just fantastic?Recommended to both casual and ardent classical music listeners"},{"rating":"2","title":"good relax music","review":"Very good start record cd.

Cole's Corner simply does not match up to them. Hawley has always had a wonderfully soulful, somewhat Scott Walker-ish quality to his music. On this disc, unfortunately, all of that is gone, and he has careened off track and made a country album. Not a bad thing, I suppose, if you are a country music fan, which I decidedly am not. All the songs on this disc strike me as left over country music B-sides. As one other reviewer put it , the songs are under-written and over-produced.Please, Mr. Hawley, take off the cowboy boots and back slowly away from the pedal steel guitar....Lowedges is a markedly superior effort to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype's Corner","review":"This album has to be among the most over-rated of 2005. It's even found its way into Mojo's top ten. I've given it time and space to grow on me after my initial negative reaction but each listening alienates me further, The songs are derivative, lyrically bankrupt and horribly over-produced. Hawley sounds like a middle of the road ballad singer of the 1950s/60s without the safety net of strongly written songs.If you are considering buying this, I urge you to listen to it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Musician","review":"I bought 4 Richard Hawley CDs. Coles Corner, Lady's Bridge, Late Night Final and Truelove's Gutter. Not a bad way to start a collection. I owe it all to Exit Through the Gift Shop, a documentary on graffiti art. That is where I heard Tonight the Streets Are Ours. Try to get that song out of your head after the first time hearing it. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Music Is Still Alive","review":"Having seen and heard Richard Hawley on a local TV station recently, I was disappointed with myself for not paying more attention to him earlier in his career. I immediately rectified the situation, and went out and bought 'Cole's Corner'. This album is a real throw-back to the days when music and romance went hand-in-hand. The album is littered with powerful tales of lost and unrequiented love. You can almost hear the Roy Orbisson, Johnny Cash and Scott Walker (to name but a few),undertones in each song. The voice is rich and honest (some refer to him as 'Elvis Of The North' - as he is from North England). This album received critical acclaim from all the reputable music critics and rightly so. Comes highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly Timeless.","review":"This is the best new album I've heard all year. Hawley sounds like what would happen if you crossed Dean Martin and Roy Orbison into one man and had him produced by Lee Hazlewood.The comparisons between Richard Hawley and Sinatra, the Deaner and other crooners have been extensive. But I want to make it clear that this is no novelty act, no mere exersize in nostalgia. Unafraid to mingle a modern electric guitar with sweeping Hazlewood-style strings, Hawley is neither regurgitating days of old nor being self-consciously eclectic. Richard Hawley is just the real thing. A world-class singer and songwriter crafting a string of perfect jems that would be hit material in 1960 or 2060.Anyone of any age can fall in love with 'Cole's Corner.' This is an album that we will all find ourselves coming back to again and again over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mood Setting","review":"Richard Hawley has the ability to set a mood with every song. \\"Coles Corner\\" and \\"The Ocean\\" are the two best songs on this CD...I have listened to it 50 times and those are the 2 songs I keep wanting to hear again and again..They take me away to another place and that alone makes it worth the price. Good Job Richard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anodyne","review":"I bought this on the basis of other reviews (and because I've just moved to Sheffield and love the place) and was very disappointed. If you like classic crooners, fine, but he's no Scott Walker; the lyrics are nothing special, and overall I found it very anodyne. Good background music, won't frighten the horses, but nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Country& Western.......","review":"After hearing Richard Hawley's True Love Gutter CD i immediately purchased on Amazon. It grew on me the more i played it and i knew i just had to have more of this smooth voiced entertainer.

I have played it several times and it just doesnt grab me like the other...so into the frisbee bin it goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I listened to an interview with the artist downloaded from the Gaurdian newspaper online. He played a couple of acoustic numbers. The vioce, big, deep and rich with just a hint of nicotine. The songs, fresh, mesmerising and heartfelt. Immediatly purchased this album and recommend it to all conisuers of intellegent, well constructed, superbly produced romantic pop music. Treads some dreamlike territory that resonates with echos of Jimmy Webb and Glen Cambell, Burt Bacharach,Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison. Pulsating with atmosphere, expansive and lush. Has it all. Why isn't this guy huge?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Voice to kill for","review":"This won't be some people's cup of tea.

Period.","review":"I am 17 years old and stumbled upon this book after seeing a few minutes of an interview with Andy Rooney. I knew of him, but found him quite interesting in the interview and decided to check out the book. I'm glad I did.\\"Common Nonsense\\" is a collection of very short essays about nearly everything in life you could think of. Sports, politics, hobbies, food-- you name it, it's covered. Although he does repeat himself occassionally, the book is very facsinating to read. When I finished, I felt that I had just read a roadmap of life-- Mr. Rooney packs in 83 years of wisdom. Most everything that he writes just makes so much sense.This is a fun book to read. The essays are short enough that you can read as many or as few as you want. He doesn't try to flaunt his writing skills with long, verbose words.

Do not look for political correctness ( although he does apologize after the fact) but do enjoy his endearing style and endless wit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Andy Rooney's version of reality television.","review":"This book consists of numerous very short (1-2 page) essays on a wide variety of mostly mundane topics. Each essay appears to have been written in about 20 minutes -- the overall effect is like watching a slow-moving reality television show about a fairly articulate, occasionally amusing, and otherwise ordinary old man. We hear how Andy likes to organize his papers, what he does on a typical Saturday, what his dream house would look like, and so on. None of it is particularly enlightening, funny, or well written. Since the essays are all so short, this is a good book to keep in the bathroom or at the bedside. It will also appeal to people who favor Reader's Digest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had the entire airplane laughing","review":"I bought this book at an airport on a late night flight from Las Vegas to Houston.

Much to my dismay, \\"Common Nonsense\\" is neither. It is truly a waist of time to read a bitter old man's opions on anything and everything that has to do with modern life. This is the first book by Andy Rooney that I have read and it has truly ruined my opinion of him, I almost feel sorry for the guy! How can a man live through a war and return home only to become a well known, if not famous figure in the U.S. media and still complain about EVERYTHING! Don't buy this book unless you enjoy being disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritatingly Repetitive","review":"I thought I liked Andy Rooney, I was wrong. This book is a collection of observations of Mr. Rooney, observations that have been poorly researched in some cases (Stating that police officers have a arrest quota was one of the more laughable beliefs). The book is entertaining for a few pages, then Mr. Rooney's constantly whining voice started eating at my brain and I just got sick of the whole thing. If you are a real fan of Andy's 60 Minute spots, then this would probably interest you. I, however, was nauseated by the constant bitching of a man who has more than most could ever hope to have.T"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Modest Man","review":"Andy Rooneys latest book proves again that he is a modest man who has a lot to be modest about. On minor issues, his comments ring true and evoke a chuckle. But on major issues, his comments lack depth, nuance and gravitas. He wants readers to accept his views on the basis of his authority as a 60 Minutes humorist, not his reasoning. But most readers now reject superficial analyses of important issues. They have access to a wide range of opinions on cable and the Internet. They want evidence, not spin masquerading as common sense.. Andy Rooney is more like James Carville than H.L. Menchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inane","review":"Common? Sure. Nonsense? What else can we expect from Andy Rooney?I can't believe this silly old meatball ever got anywhere in journalism, if journalism is, in fact, what he does.

Even the most obscure mathematicians are covered in good detail along with what they proved, as well as how they proved it. For those interested in historical mathematics, this book is invaluable.

This book, is one of the better ones for this purpose as many of the stories or short enough for bedtime. The stories are also categorized for easy selection.

It has all kinds of literature in it (poetry, classical lit, bible verses, etc). The first section is about obeying your parents. The author gives examples through literature of children who didn't obey their parents and the consequences. For example, she retells the Greek myth of Icarus and His Father. It's very fun and helps spark conversation about obedience throughout the day with \\"remember the story...\\".

Butcan't belief that God let Hitler \\"luck out\\" and escape death so many times because of weird occurrences that ended up saving his life. In this story, the wood partition of the table and a rushed phone call saved his life. While I enjoyed the extras more than the movie, the \\"home movies\\" of Eva Braun, while containing beautiful scenery, added little to the content. Even the \\"Eva appears nude\\" was way over played in those long long dragged out soundless movies. Sorry it missed the mark for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Characters with whom you will fall in love","review":"Shinn returns to the world of the Twelve Houses and her characters from Mystic and Rider, but focuses on Kirra, the shapeshifting daughter of House Danalustrous. Concerned by rumors of impending rebellion, Kirra and her companions set out to protect the Princess and test the temper of the Twelve Houses. Loyalty, tolerance, and class distinction are just a few of the thems upon which Shinn touches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sequel.","review":"To be true, my wife read and I'm starting in some days. From her impressions, this book is a great sequel to \\"Mystic and Rider\\", and all the characters we love are back but focusing on Kirra and her relationships to the nobles and to Don.Great reading with a lot of emotion and a great fantasy romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"[spoilers] I read this strictly because I enjoyed Shinn's Archangel series. However, I did not like the first installment in this series and continued with this one only because I assumed it would eventually get better. But, the adultery was unacceptable to me, plus it didn't initially seem like it was actually going to go there. When it did happen it was abrupt and unbelievable, so I put the book down. I would have kept reading had the story been remotely interesting but absolutely nothing was happening anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this book!","review":"I skipped this book during my first read of this series, and I'm so glad I did! The protagonists, Kirra and Romar, are both incredibly selfish, reckless, impulsive, and completely unsympathetic. Why would I want to read about them having an affair?Also, the book slogs. Not much happens. Unlike many Shinn books, it was entirely in one person's point of view (Kirra's). It would have been far more interesting if Donnal's view had been interjected periodically. This book was redeemable only because I already was invested in the other characters, having read Books 1, 3, and 4.Thank you to all the other reviewers for the warning! Glad I heeded it!Skip this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story!","review":"I love this story it is one of my favorites! I really recommend reading this book to everyone who likes Romance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic read","review":"Fantastic read. Very much like the first book. I admit at the first chapter I thought about dumping the book but once the plot got going I couldn't put the book down. In fact it's midnight as I am typing this review. I look forward to reading the rest of the books in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great character development","review":"I only recently found these books and was really taken in by Mystic and Rider. The Thirteenth House delves deeper into many of the characters, with Kirra front and center, of course.Possible SPOILERInitially I found her clandestine infatuation rather juvenile for such supposedly more mature adults, but I realized that this affair was quite true to Kirra's approach to life (although Romar was less plausible to me). So the love story drew me in so that by the end I was truly moved by the character's plight and resolution. I truly enjoyed the characters' development in this book, although the villians of the story seem a tad one-sided. I would like a tad less romance and more forward movement in the plot/story. Still, a very good book indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I was so worried I would not like this sequel because of the bad reviews on amazon. I loved it. It was full of adventure, excitement, and romance.It still includes all the original group and introduces many new characters. It is mostly Kirra's story and you discover more about her character and come to love her. Yes, Kirra is naughty and makes some bad choices, but dont stop reading just because of that. She rights her wrongs and pays the price. The writer never pretends like her behavoir is acceptable and come on people its just a book, its not real. I definitely recommend this sequel if you enjoyed the first. I even think i liked this book more."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Science","review":"This film asks a very important question - does a movie really need a plot? After pondering upon the matter for two hours, during which I was subjected to a noncohesive sequence of CGI scenes, I think I can safely conclude that, indeed, it does. Further inquiry would reveal that some presence of acting aptitude might have a distinct impact on one's viewing experience. The title is clearly a cruel pun directed at the viewer and the dialogue appears to have been written by a trained monkey using an Etch a Sketch while she was actively participating in a feces fight. I recommend that instead of watching this video game you just play one or rent a decent film. Either one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work of cinema - highly underated - litte commercialistic though","review":"This is an engaging and artistic film that works on every level. It could fly over the heads of some people who don't understand the artistry and intelligence film because of the very intentional and self aware flash and spectacle that is in the film. Anyone who dismisses this film as a mindless action movie is an idiot. This is a well written, well directed work of cinema that posesses a level of artistic quality that is rare and usually completely absent in hollywood films. This film is a result of an individual's creative vision and not another banal product for the masses.Sucker Punch catches you with a jarring twist at the end that turns out to be a feint and that is part of the genius of the script writing. The film then flows into an ending tone which is great.A very entertaining, as well as a very satisfying movie.Highly recommended. Ignore the low reviews. This is a Solid 4 star movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it for the special effects sections","review":"The real world plot was a bit forced and some of the story premises and twists did not work for me. That being said, once they go into the dream sequences, the special effects, the CGI were state of the art and fantastic! The fact that there are five hot babes in sexy outfits wielding swords and kicking-ass kung fu style didn't hurt none either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie...","review":"Excellent movie. I really do not understand, because it has been so undervalued. Visually it is very good, but the bluray is a bit granny. The story is well told and the pace is fine too. The actions are consistent and the effects are fantastic. Overall I think this film is very solid and shows again that Snyder handles very well the effects and such stories. Really pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is not anything more than what it is.","review":"I saw this in theaters on opening day and I did enjoy it. What amazed me was the critics reviews. Not so much that I thought they should have given it praises for best picture, but I thought that for some reason they figured there was so much substance that they never received as a viewer. I thought the film was nothing but effects and action and nothing more and thats why I enoyed sucker punch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic Attempt at Social Commentary?","review":"Currently at 28:10 mark and *yawn*. So far:*Mindless fan service sans the franchise*Poor acting*Bland characters*Incoherent plot*Uninspiring soundtrack, excluding White Rabbit*Mediocre SFXThis film lacks vision - all I see are women in costumes walking around in front of a camera. I think we need to leave the pinkish violence genre to the Japanese, or Tarantino.Addendum: Ended just as I expected. How disappointing. And I'm really not clear on what Zack Snyder was trying to accomplish by marketing this film to an audience whom he then uses the movie to berate. Um, what?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost better than being poked in the eye with a stick","review":"The very thin plot exists only to tie the action cutscenes together. Speaking of which, the camera work on the cutscenes was so shaky it made me nauseous to the point where I couldn't even watch. The actresses all seem to have studied at the Kristen Stewart school of acting. I only recommend this movie to people who have wronged me in some way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut scenes from Duke Nukem Forever","review":"I struggled with giving this one star because it has a good soundtrack (for what it is) and some of the visuals are impressive, but as a whole, it's simply a steaming pile of cafeteria glop, a soup made of trans fats, high-fructose corn syrup, mechanically-separated chicken, and MSG. Every spoonful you eat makes you sicker and more ashamed of yourself, but for some reason, you don't stop until the bowl is empty, at which point you just get up, walk away, and hope nobody saw you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Zach Snyder know what a story is?","review":"That was the question I had after watching the film...After the promise of 300 and the effects heavy, soulless adaptation of the Watchmen - and now this...I'm beginning to wonder if Hollywood is the one being sucker punched. Sure the effects are great, but the fact that one remains unmoved and disengaged in the process of the film is BAD NEWS. Vapid just about sums it up. Abbie Cornish is great though. Sucker Punch had the potential - but it just makes me wonder whether Mr Snyder can really make a good movie, or if he needs help in the scriptwriting department. Probably both!! Avoid this like the plague..."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 hours of my life I won't get back.","review":"some great special effects and action scenes but these get tiring after a while. overall very depressing movie that seemed to be trying to express some overarching deeper meaning. It failed. Miserably.Really,really not worth the time or the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only movie I've ever walked out of","review":"This movie is hard to watch. The director's disdain for women is apparent, and beyond that, the narrative is poorly constructed, and the film is boring.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"Combine extremly out of place, unexplained action sequences with the most wretchedly depressing storylines I have ever seen. I can sum it up like this. A group of young women are sexually and physically abused constantly, then imagine that they are fighting robots and all this nonsense (I am actually a fan of this genre), when in reality their situation constantly gets worse. None of the absolutely disgusting villains get whats coming to them, there is no closure or justice whatsoever. Watching this movie is like molesting a mentally challenged person, then giving them a lollypop to suck on and telling them to 'pretend it never happened' that is the same sleazy, shameful feeling you get watching this horrible movie. I was shocked at how wrong this movie was. Very sad, horrible, depressing, exploitive, wretched, miserable movie.. easily one of the worst I have EVER seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindnumbing","review":"A conglomerate of music videos for the misogynist male. The characters are two dimensional with a very weak plot for the storyline. The resolution of the movie is jarring and disconjointed. The visual effects are beautiful but even that can put you to sleep like repetitive mindnumbing sex. Try doing the missionary position for an hour and a half with no forplay and you will get the same effects as this dvd.The viewer is the one who gets Sucker Punched!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All kinds of bad...","review":"Just a really poor movie. Non-sensical story used to jump between sci-fi action sequences. It made little sense, was misogynistic in nature, and just boring. It's like a 1970s \\"women in prison\\" movie without nudity. Even adding nudity would not have saved this clunker.What I wonder is who's spending millions to make junk like this? Why not just donate 1/100th of the film budget to me. I could write a better script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Watching Sucker Punch was like watching a video game....except there are video games that are more sophisticated then this film. If I had to guess, I would say the movie had more to do with making a quick buck then actually satisfying an audience. Basically, the plot involved the protagonist devising a set of tasks to escape the asylum where she was wrongfully committed....which might sound like an intriguing premise, but when you actually see the movie the lack of reasonable explanations for the steps to her plan in addition to how easily the other girls at the institution go along with them....well, it was just ridiculous. If you read, I'd recommend checking out The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"I'm a huge fantasy movie fan, and love comic-book style movies, so this was RIGHT up my alley. Or, at least it would have been if it were not so repulsive. I simply couldn't appreciate the gorgeous graphics and amazing acting behind the sick and twisted way that women were treated in this movie. All I can say is thank heavens I rented it, and did not purchase it based on the genre hype. I would hate to throw away something I'd just bought! That said, however, if I had bought it, it would have gone straight into the trash regardless. The victimization of this poor girl (and the others) was just too horrible for me to bear, in spite of her fighting it. I would have LOVED this movie based on the graphics, acting, and \\"fight scenes\\" if the subject matter they chose didn't turn my stomach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture This","review":"Picture Sin City made much worse and do I really need to say any more about Sucker Punch? Oh the story doesn't follow any linear lines, somewhow we get from mental institution to brothel over night. I didn't make it past that part. My eyes started bleeding profusely as my soul offered itself to a higher power for soiling my DVD player with this crap. Abysmal doesn't cover this movie, it's the kind of trash you should to death row inmates 24 hours before execution just to violate the sanctity of their hearts and minds. This kind of films makes you wonder if storytelling shouldn't be a licensed job where you actually have to show serious competence before ever entering a studio."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm the Sucker","review":"Not a movie for me, I felt that the acting was awful, it opened pretty well but as the movie went on I got bored and started playing with other stuff around the house. I wish I had illegally downloaded it before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"PROS and CONS","review":"PROS: Great CGI, beautiful women, OK music (but not great).... CONS: Too much CGI (yawn...), very very very stupid women, boring story, paced like a video game intro, DVD/BluRay way over-priced at $14.00.... MORAL: wait until it comes to Netflix for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extended Cut? Is that a threat?","review":"I made the mistake of watching this film recently on a date. To be honest I am surprised the girl is still talking to me after this horrible film.I am a fan of Zack Snyder's former works; That being said, It was so painful to watch that I started disliking movies of his that I thought I had enjoyed.One thing that many people have managed to somehow skip in their reviews is the fact that the soundtrack is essentially a snuff film version of classic songs retooled to make the original artists turn in their graves. Poor Freddie Mercury and John Lennon, I am so sorry that they did this to your memories.Zack, I really think it is time to switch careers. I hear the gas station around the street is hiring. Maybe you can go back to school part time and actually re-learn how to make films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mysogynist Movie DIsguised as Female Empowerment","review":"Some girl's step father accuses her of killing sister, locks her up in asylum and pays some guy to put her on the short list for a lobotomy. She apparently really must be nuts b/c she promplty descends into these ridiculous fantasy sequences that exist ONLY to put these women in skimpy outfits and degrade them. There is no point, no rhyme, no reason to any part of this movie. It's a bunch of grey toned semi-action sequences interspersed with women being raped, killed and beaten. It's like one long video game trailer and not a very good one. Then the girl gets the ice pick to the orbital socket and swish swish she's all gone. dumber than dumb"},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie sucks","review":"this movie is the stupidest movie i have ever watched in my entire life it doesnt make any sence and it is wack thats all i can say"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing & Disappointing","review":"A young girl's sister is murdered by her pedophile stepfather after her mother dies.

If you think this is \\"fun\\" and \\"entertaining\\" then I feel sorry for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give it zero stars","review":"Avoid this thinly plotted drivel at all costs. The characters were one-dimensional, the plot seemed to be made up as the movie went along, and the \\"action\\" scenes were poor copies of better sequences. It made the second Transformers look like Hamlet in comparison. The visuals were pretty darn good, but as anyone who saw Star Wars episode III knows, great visuals just can't carry a movie. I couldn't wait to escape from the theater. Save yourself the misery of this watching this audio/visual brain melter."},{"rating":"1","title":"A New Low in Junk Cinema","review":"I have nothing against fun, junk cinema. But, come on. This movie was just so hollow. No real characters, peril or violence with a pulse. I loved Dawn of the Dead and Watchmen. So far, Snyder is hit-and-miss with me. I really wanted to like this one because it looked fun and fun to look at. Negative. The visual flare wears out its welcome very quickly, and all you're left with is story, which is preposterous and unfulfilling. It's just empty trash. skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Ed Wood movie with more budget","review":"Are you people insane??

I saw it and thought the cover looked interesting. The cover was far more interesting than the movie.Imagine going to a ten theater Cineaplex, and spending the evening watching the first 10 minutes of each movie.I got about to the third or forth plot change and just gave up. It is like a movie where the producers keep demanding a complete script re-write and then they piece all the unrelated previously shot film together to make a movie, simply because they spent money on it. The segments themselves were dark and sadistic without any real reason for it, since none of the segments were carried through as is done in a traditional movie story-line."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst film ever made","review":"This is the worst film ever made. The movie with carrot top is better then this film. It's terrible. People who like this film have no taste. Go and buy Inception and Shutter Island instead of this stinker. They are about the same price combined as this film and you will thank me later. This film is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Garbage","review":"I knew little about this movie other than it was from Zack Snyder and I liked his other films like 300, Watchmen and Dawn of the Dead remake.Not sure what anyone was thinking when this movie was put together. And I love Grade B movies, usually even the bad ones are worth laughing at. Not this one.It looks nice, especially on Blu Ray. The CGI is pretty. But what about THE PLOT???Don't waste your time with this. Take a walk or a nap or go have a drink and figure out something else to watch.

It was not advertised like that. Girl empowerment, uh no! Girls getting used, and ended with no sense of justice, just sadness. Seem as if Zack Synder's mind was on overload when he wrote this.

See at your own risk !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it but someone might","review":"I didn't get a whole lot out of it. The way the story line cuts off into no-existant action scences was weird for me and the whole thing was very dramatic and fantasy based.Others might like it though. The animation is very good and the fight scences are pretty impressive. There's definitely more action than story line so if that's a plus for you, you might like it. I thought it was too much flare and not enough movie though. There is a plot line but it's weird and dramatic and there are random jumps into make believe battles, which I thought threw off the momentum of the story. Recomend it only if you're in the mood for lots of action and are okay with the over-dramatizations.One last thing. There's this big thing about the main character dancing but you never see her dance... That's pretty weird right?

The opening to this movie is an interesting premise, but that's where it ends. The pacing is poor, the characters are lifeless blow up dolls. The film proceeds from the initial hook as a boob and special effects fest for no apparent reason other than to please the younger male demographic. If you want boobies and panty shots, this is for you. Basically it is A-list soft corn porn for the timid underdeveloped males. If you're a grown up looking for a film with more depth than a puddle of primordial ooze, seek elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mixed bag at best","review":"I was surprisingly somewhat disappointed with this as I love Synder's other films but \\"Sucker Punch\\" suffers from style over substance throughout. While the effects are great & the film itself is very picturesque & beautiful, it nevertheless feels like your watching a two hour music video or a video game. I thought I was watching the Animatrix after about thirty minutes into the movie. While its purposefully over the top with it's mash up of genres it still seems to lack that special something that 300 & Watchmen had. Oh well, can't win 'em all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't do it for me","review":"This is a really weird movie. Half the time you have no idea what is going on and even when it is over there is some open interpretation.

What kind of writor would put dancing all the way through a movie but you never see the person dance.And what does dancing have to do with fighting???

But it's just terrible. The paper-thin plot, the manipulative cartoonish set pieces, the \\"acting.\\" Nothing redeeming in value about this thing.

It's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get Suckered!","review":"Just sat through it, and, although it is truly an effects fan's wet dream,the film did nothing for me.I understood it perfectly fine, so let's not drag out that old chestnut \\"He doesn't like it, so he obviously is misinterpreting the film.\\" The problem is, the story is simply as boring as all hell. I was so bored halfway through, that I stopped the disc for awhile so that I could wake up. I liked it very much during the first twenty minutes or so, and then all the flash began to unravel into a big pile of nothing.....at least, nothing remotely interesting. It's flash for flash's sake, story be damned, from that point on.I suppose some of the video-game addicted youth would love this type of thing, though. Until a new Guitar Hero game comes out, anyway. Then this \\"film\\" will be forgotten....and rightfully so."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I've seen","review":"I bought this movie thinking it was going to be a kick ass action movie with hot girls, well at least they got the last part right.

Honestly with movies like this, or what it should have been, I don't want to \\"think\\" that hard, if I want that I'll watch Inception or Pans Lanbrynth. It's like she's crazy and imagines herself as a berlesque dancer but that imaginary world is so messed up she imagines herself in another imaginary world fighting things.....what??! Other than the girls(especially Jamie Chung and Vanessa Hudgens) being hot and maybe 2 good imaginary fight scenes, I would'nt recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the future of movies?","review":"I have not seen such an incoherent pile of dog puddle in years. As near as I could tell the only thing that holds this movie together is the laws of physics that makes it possible to create the DVD disc. Somewhere Roger Corman must be laughing his head off. Not only did the makers off this movie produce a razor thin plotline of a movie, but they bilked the financiers and the public while doing it on a grander scale than Corman ever dreamed. Cheap plot held together with a few decent action scenes, but the only worthwhile stuff are those action scenes. You could fast forward through the rest of the movie and come away with as much enlightenment of what the movie was about as I did watching the whole damn thing. Those action scenes are the only thing that saves this movie from the 1 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, I was suckerpunched...","review":"I am not going to try and fluff this with words that only critics understand, so here it goes. It sucked. A horrible mish-mash of dream montages aimlessly fill the screen. The \\"stop and pose before I react\\" thing is getting old, as is slow motion nearly every 5 minutes. The movie made no sense at all. Scott Glenn needs to be donkey punched, as he cannot act to save his life.

However, when you finally realize this entire movie consists of the character's imagination the movie becomes that much more interesting.Over-the-top maybe, but never over the limit. The Blu-ray Extended Cut is definitely a lock for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie!","review":"Item arrived expertly packaged and on time. Was exactly as described. I have watched this so many times I am afraid I am going to wear out the Blu-ray...luckily it comes with a DVD also! The extras on this set are a great compliment and provide a bigger picture of what is actually going on in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Underrated Movie","review":"So I guess I'm wierd, but I really liked this movie. The cinematic action sequences (even though performed by scantily clad women) were well choreagraphed, and digital effects were flawless (in a graphic-novel sort of rendering). The underlying message in the plot went well with the movie. Blu Ray features are worth the price. I got this last year at a blow-out christmas price, so I couldn't pass it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange","review":"I went to see this with my two teen daughters (17 and 14). We often love the movies the critics hate. We love action, graphics, and movies that keep moving and don't always have to make you think or cry. That said, this was the absolute worst movie I recall ever seeing. It was simply too weird to explain. I wanted to love the action parts, but the action made no sense since it was all in her head while she was dancing? This was the first movie that all 3 of us walked out of hating. To this day I have a sense of confusion feeling when I even think about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst SF/fantasy film of the year - unless you're a virgin","review":"Stupid pointless comic book anime wannbe childish abusive junk. Awful wish-I-could write like Frank Miller but can't, the main character doesn't say more than one line for the first 23 minutes ... makes no sense whatsoever, and the loud music doesn't make up for low budget FX ... think Sky Captain quality, not Clash of the Titans, \\"better than videogame\\" but barely. Seems like it's for boys who never grew up and/or wish they were chix. Don't waste your time on this mutt! Go watch Scott Pilgrim instead - that movie doesn't suck. This movie is really really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie","review":"This is probably the worst movie in recent memory. Bad acting, bad story. I have zero hope that Zack Snyder will pull off a good Superman movie after seeing this one. Not even worth a rental. I don't understand how you can accidentally make such a bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed. Action flicks should have more Action.","review":"Very disappointed when I watched Sucker Punch. I was expecting a lot more action and story. You should know before hand there absolutely no plot to this film. And you will be watching the movie just for eye candy alone. Unfortunately there was not enough action scenes to qualify the movie as an Action movie. It's very slow moving and very bad acting. It's so bad in fact it's actually annoying every time an actor speaks. I give this two stars because their some nice visuals. Overall I would not even reccommend watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"perfectly awful","review":"this is easily one of the worst movies ever made. the person who compared it to watching a sibling play a video game for an hour is accurate except i would add that its like watching an unusually boring video game. I saw this in the theater and it felt like an extra long trip to the dentist, except more uncomfortable. Maybe like having a dental procedure while getting a colonoscopy at the same time? It felt like it went on for about 6 hours and was incredibly boring and stupid. The only good thing about this movie was the sense of relief i felt when it ended. If i had not been there with a group of people, i would have left after the first half hour. I dont understand how so many people could watch the same movie i did and give it 4 or 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sucker Punch is for the Viewers","review":"The movie ending is disappointing. Just like the ending of the Matrix. 3-1/2 of the 5 heroines end up dead. It must be too hard to make a movie with a happy ending. Or maybe they have to keep us guessing. Anyway the worst part is that they are trusting this director with the 2012 Superman movie. I guess I will need to keep my expectations low. This movie is for suckers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love this movie and was one of the 6 people that saw it in the theater","review":"I saw Sucker Punch on opening night in the theaters. As well, I bought the DVD yesterday. However, I feel very much like a second class citizen since the extended cut of the film was only available on BluRay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's complete (R@P. I could complain extensively about this but, obviously, those responsible DON'T CARE WHAT I THINK. Which is what has created this prejudice manifesting in real-world terms of the product disparity. I was even going to buy the BluRay combo pack just to get the extended cut of the film until I read on the back of the box that the extended cut in the combo pack was only on the BluRay disc. Like I said, complete (R@P. Yes, I gave this a 1 star rating as an editorial comment on Warner Bros. In an earnest review, I give the movie five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nerdgasmic","review":"Many give this movie a bad review, but that's because they expect something very different to what is, do not expect a memorable story, but if you are fan of Japanese anime, I like the scenes of compatible, swords, guns, nazi's, futuristic, video games, zombies, this movie is all, and more"},{"rating":"2","title":"punched out","review":"I had an open mind with no expectations going into the movie. The first few sequences were very good, but then it fell into a repetive trap and I thought it was a mistake. But then \\"I got it\\" once one of the superwomen died. After that, it all started to make (some) sense and I loved it.Great to see that the modern graphic novel adaption doesn't try to water it down for the masses. The \\"dispatcher/bus driver\\" is still a bit confusing but I'm waiting to buy it so I can fill in that piece of the puzzle. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is what happens when 12 y.o. boys are the target market","review":"Seriously, who gets paid to green light dreck this awful? 2 stars because the production quality is excellent and the acting decent at a minimum [clearly, one cannot expect actresses cast based solely upon their appearance to establish new standards for thespianism...] Can't fault the direction or the CG guys: they had a manga comic book script to work with, and did a bang up job! It's just... GIGO. You can't fix stupid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fantasy action movie","review":"I went with my teenage daughters to see this as they had been looking forward to it for months. They loved it, as anime fans they were in heaven with the costumes and over the top action. Yes the ending was very sad, and it did feel a bit rushed but honestly I also enjoyed the movie and am puzzled as to why it has been so trashed. It's made by the 300 guy, what were critics expecting, a Merchant Ivory sitting room drama? My only gripe is that to achieve a PG-13 rating, much of the film's darker elements or scenes were deleted. The extended cut is a better film and I think if it had been left in it's original form it would have done better in theaters. If you liked Sin City, 300 or even Kill Bill I think you will dig Sucker Punch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Effects...Uhhh","review":"Yes, cool effects and without this I might not be interested. Yes, there are some beautiful women and some action, so that was fun. The story was less satisfying. But, again, the Vfx are fun to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sucker Punch","review":"A little more violent than I prefer although I like the moral victory outcome. I love the soundtrack. word word"},{"rating":"2","title":"Action but not a lot of plot","review":"This has great actionand the overall video game look to the movie is interesting. The plot is a little weak for a movie. It would probably be OK as a theme for a video game but as a movie it falls short."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Sucker Punch\\" a must see movie!","review":"\\"Sucker Punch\\" had to have been one of the best movies that I've seen in awhile. Despite many negative reviews that other people may have said about this movie, I found it to be engaging, mystifying, and thrilling. I especially enjoyed watching the \\"fantasies\\" that Baby Doll imagined, one of my favorites being the World War Two steam-punk zombie scene. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"If the description doesn't sound like it's your cup of tea.. it's not.","review":"This is a movie set in a fantasy world. You will see a group of young women in stylized fights scenes with Nazis, dragons and monsters set to cover versions of classic rock songs. If this sounds exciting, you will like this movie. If you're \\"not sure\\" when don't watch it. This movie has a very specific audience and many will \\"not get it.\\" However those that \\"don't get it\\" shouldn't have bought it in the first place.This is a very twisted version of Alice in Wonderland, and if you want to go down this rabbit hole, you'll love the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"This was a really good movie. The imaginative power driving the movie reminded me of when I saw the first Matrix movie, and more recently Inception (although I give both of those movies 5 stars, whereas I think this movie is just over 4). Although the cast was young compared to the Matrix or Inception, I thought they played compelling roles that draw the viewer into the story. Overall, definitely worth renting or buying. Definitely 4 stars based on pure imaginative power alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom line - terrible","review":"Visually stunning at times - yes.Everything else - terrible.The plot/story line - unwatchable.There are much better ways to spend 2.Period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, fun, fun","review":"Fantastic visual effects, great action sequences, hot characters, guns, monsters, bad guys, fantastic soundtrack and a way outside the box approach. What's not to like? My wife and I saw it last night and enjoyed it very, very much. It's too bad it won't do as well as it should because a lot of people just won't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crapperpunch.","review":"I think this is quite possibly the worst movie I've seen in 5 years. The \\"storyline\\" rips off parts of 4 or 5 other movies (maybe more I didn't catch) and the girls walking around all bas ass comes off as a Saturday Night Live skit. Some of the battles were cool, but even then every time the girls fall from any height they have to land all dramatic like on one knee with their head bent to the ground, which is ripped from the naked Arnie parts of the Terminator movies. A movie for hipsters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"I waited and waited to see this one. Seemed to have everything. 300 style action, pretty girls, awesome cinematography...but they blew it! The girls are just catty, the fight scenes are totally unbelievable and one sided, the music is awful and makes it seem like a music video (remakes of an Iggy Po and Pixies song).I kept wanting it to just be done with. The girls have four tasks to complete and by the 2nd I just couldn't believe there were two more to suffer through. Even if you're just looking for eye candy, there is just not enough of that to entertain for an hour and a half.Boring, boring, pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stink, stank, stunk","review":"What a stinker - no plot, way too distracting with all the special effects hurtling past your eyes, and bad acting. It's the trifecta of awfulness!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie","review":"I really wanted to like this movie. First problem is that the movie did not sync with the ads and trailers. The second problem is that the plot is bankrupt of entertainment value. Don't get me wrong loved the effects and action sequences but they could not overcome the fatal flaws of the plot.At best this is an acquired taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful - 15 minutes of cool, 75 minutes of asylum","review":"The trailers make this movie look amazing, but in actuality it's an extremely bleak picture of girls in an asylum who have horrible things done to them - in cold blood. The fantasy action parts are amazingly cool, but you feel robbed of the excitement when 'reality' keeps getting worse and worse. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star only because its as low as Amazon allows","review":"This is a movie for teenage boys who live in a fantasy world of video games and porn. Great special effects, but a story line that jumps around more than a water bug.Borrow it from a \\"Sucker\\" who bought it, and then only if you have watched every other video in your personal library, the public library, your church library and the bargin bin at Wal-Mart.Maybe you can get a corporate training film, or a video you watched in drivers training. Avoid this movie. Unless you like that one hot chick in it. :) Then turn the sound down.I wish I could give negative stars for this waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It felt like a bunch of adolescent boys got together and asked, \\"What do we like in a movie?\\" and then filmed scenes with those things in them and just threw them together with some plot line that unsuccessfully tried too hard to be profound. In the end it leaves absolutely no investment in the characters. I just wanted everyone to die so I could go home. Ridiculous and painful. The only redeeming factor was a decent soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say ... boring","review":"What can I say, the movie was boring. The WW1 scenes were unrealistic.

It uses weird, slick camera angles, slow motion and mediocre visual effects to try to fill in the holes left by lack of characters, a terrible dialog, and no recognizable plot or development. Seriously, what the hell? Once you saw the blonde teenager with a katana, and a samurai with a gatling gun, you knew it was only a matter of time before someone showed up in a battle mech."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucker punch the let down","review":"this movie absolutely sucked.the charecters bring you into a dream world to cope with everyday problems.you enter the dream world like 4-5 times during the whole movie.it is sad that this whole movie is based around women whom are eye candy and that is what they push on you in this movie.as a man i don't care how good looking women are in a movie or how tight their clothing is.if the plot of the movie sucks the movie sucks plain and simple.I would rather go to the dentist than watch this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unique spin with way too much Hollywood glamour","review":"When I see a good movie it usually entails characters that are developed or developing, high detail in story and portrayal, and uniqueness from the mainstream archetype. This movie fulfilled the bonus points for initial interest, but lacked detail and coherency for plot. There were too many holes in the story that seemed like things were rushed and filled in with a gleaming overabundance of \\"the bigger the better\\" mentality.A decent movie if you're not interested in thinking at all while your eyes are fixed on the screen. There's a tremendous amount of eye-candy (not specifically speaking of the scantily covered ladies). However, a horrible movie if you need more substance to feel a longing for more or rewardedness for plopping your butt down for the duration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucker Punched for Dummies","review":"I rented this movie thinking I would take a chance..

Such as it is. Saw it at an Imax, and some of the scenes LOOK spectacular, but there's no danger. There's a lot of stilted dialogue.

I remember the trailer on TV some time ago and thought it would be interesting. It is. It has a sort of similar theme as \\"Inception\\". It starts off a little hard to follow but becomes clear in the end (thank God). I going to keep it and watch it again some day, so that's a good sign. A movie like \\"Super 8\\" I would never watch again in my life and I will get rid of it at the first opportunity. Sucker Punch is worth seeing and wondering what the heck is going on here."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!!!","review":"I really don't understand all the negative reviews of this film. Seriously, do so many people just not \\"get it?\\" If you are a fan of anime, World of Warcraft, Dungeons and Dragons, The Lord of the Rings, or Kill Bill I and II then you will LOVE this movie! It incorporates elements of them all. It was so well done too! I caught it by mistake halfway through and was sucked in right away! I was thrilled to see it on Blu Ray along with an extended version of the film. With all the crap coming out of Hollywood these days as well as endless remakes of the same films, it's refreshing to see something new for a change!

Two hours utterly wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is a Pantload!","review":"I knew I was in trouble after only watching about 2 minutes of this truly wretched movie.Computer generated effects and terrible music vidoes does not a movie make. They literaly spent hundreds of dollars on the script. I feel that a single star rating is much to generous, but Amazon does not give a zero star option. This movie is a true pantload!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucker Sucker","review":"Sucker Punch was as interesting as watching your brother play Wii for two hours.I'm a fan of Zack Snyder as a director, but as a writer he seems to suffer from M. Night Shyamalanism- that is, he's so enamoured of his own notions that he doesn't stop to ask if they make sense and fit together in a compelling and worthwhile story.I'm also a fan of cotton candy and other things that are pretty and fun and mostly empty. But even cotton candy can be chewed, and even mindless entertainment is still supposed to be entertaining. I'll wait for Snyder's next effort, I just hope he pairs his remarkable visual aesthetic with a real story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pretiest WTF? movie ever","review":"This movie does nothing but look good. The actors phoned it in, but at least they were nice to look at. It felt like every cool visual you've seen in a dozen other movies got mashed into this one.The character development is non--existent;the plot- barely hinted at; and the pay-off- who cares? Looks GREAT, though.

The general story follows a young girl as she is forced into performing for patrons of the establishment that she resides.

The movie involves trips to other worlds and locales where the main character along with her friends go on various missions. I recommend the movie to anyone who enjoys imaginative action/drama movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Taste","review":"This movie definitely requires a certain taste in movies and an open mind.

In short, it's a mess. There is an undercurrent of entertainment running through it, but it doesn't quite add up to an entertaining movie.

It was clearly made to bring in the male geek audience with its video game-like fantasy/action and scantily-clad actresses. But as a geeky girl, I was going to overlook the latter in hopes for some substance in the film. Unfortunately, there was no plot or character development and the \\"dance\\" that she does repeatedly before going into her fantasy world is probably the stupidest thing I've ever seen.

I thought I was getting a fantasy movie. Its not. The fantasy parts are not connected to each other. In that sense, it contains some fantasy mini-scenes. I've seen better story line coherence in video games. The fantasy parts are linear and last about 5 minutes each. Then its back to this weird hidden psycho-ward of no escape. Its kind of like Sin City if you imaging that movie without a plot. But then Sin City does not float between multiple realities like this does.The worst part of it all is that no time is spent to explain the relationship between fantasy and real worlds. Or why she has these fantasies. Its kind of like playing a mini-game inside of a game, in order to accomplish some task.

There are so few action heroes that are women, that that alone made me want to see this. But the movie itself was a horrible disappointment.A common problem with some movies is that they start at 1000 miles per hour, leaving them no where to go, nothing to increase the tension. So, the plot & the intensity just flatlines through the whole movie.The stylized fight sequences which looked incredible on the previews, went on WAY too long. The sequences / settings, seemed to have no connection to the movie or to the fight scenes. They were just random scenes that I assume, someone just thought they looked coolAnd the ending...without spoiling it......was a total let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay to rent but not buy","review":"This is probably going to get lost in all the other reviews but I'll put my two cents in. First of all I'd only rent it. I would have felt ripped off if I paid full price for it. It seems to have been designed with the notion of turning it into a video game. You get the gist of the plot at the start of the movie, but no real detail. You never find out why the other girls are there except in the fantasy land dance hall or what happens in the real world of the mental institution while all the fantasy is going on. All in all, it has the feel of a comic book that was turned into a movie, but had to be cut and edited like Lord of the Rings to be able to adapt it to a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...","review":"This has got to be the WORST film I have seen since Twilight, I didn't think ANY movie could top that one on the c***dar but WOW.

I finally get to watch it and it easily has one of the worst plots ever!!!! Its like they took two movies and put them together to make one bad movie. Granted when babydoll has her \\"dreams\\" its pretty bad ass. But WTF it makes no sense for the plot. It isn't that the plot is so deep no one could understand it. It is just that the plot is so bad I don't know how many people were so generous on the reviews. Honestly if you want to see it, I do not want to sway your opinion but the movie is just painful to watch. I mean really.....still in shock of how horrible the plot was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm Come off wondering WTF","review":"Ok so i don't review allot of movies but i do try to watch my far share. Me and some friends where watching this movie and kind of looking at each other when it finished like what was the meaning of all that. I have to say it was to me a life is a bitch ending. I did read that the director had done 300 and watchmen so this was his artistry movie but to spend so much on over the top special effects dream sequences just didnt seem to stick enough substance in to the film to justify all taking place in her head. I have to admit as a guy in his twenty yes the women where attractive but was that a enough to drive the movie i dont think. I would say u have a hour or two to kill go ahead but dont choose this as your weekend movie night flick.

Even the characters appear disinterested & very distant. Though, being kidnapped & used in sex trafficking can make one so, however, I get the feeling that some of the actresses are thinking to themselves: \\"why did I agree to to do this film?\\" There's very little to no commitment.

While the cinematography was very well done and given a real script it could have been an action fantasy in the new noire style of Sin City etc. it instead pushes a bunch of poorly stitched fantasy MTV videos together in a dismal attempt to come off vaguely philosophical or something, jury is still out on whether there was a point.I wouldn't mind seeing more from the crew who put it together as long as they get a script and troop of actors worthy of the effort...

This book simplifies the swing to its bare essentials. Excellent anecdotes and swing drills included. Most impressive to me is his criticism of Ben Hogan's classic \\"Five Step\\" book with reference to the shoulder plane during the swing and how it forced his swing as a young man to be too upright. This book is not for the 25 or above handicapper simply because the numerous descriptions and examples would probably hurt a very-high handicapper rather than help him/her. But for those below a 25, who are familiar with golf lingo, this book provides excellent structure for working on one's swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"the song \\"into the night\\"is well worth the price of admission .having been a hit twice.time life has some of the best compilations around .puts the now franchise to shame"},{"rating":"2","title":"Work Fine/Tight Fit","review":"Batteries work fine.

It simply doesn't have the range or sensitivity they'd lead you to believe. The components in this mic probably cost $2. They need to charge accordingly. I don't see any benefit from what is purported to be cancellation of phase shifts or noise or whatever... it's basically a dull pickup under most circumstances. I don't care how big the table is.Then, I tried recording a violin. I had to strap it to the violin to get good response/volume but the recording sounded like my ear was pressed to the violin. Right.

Don't waste your money on this book. All you get is the melody and the chord changes, all of which are printed so small as to be illegible on the band stand. In addition there are no bass lines or any real sense of how the tunes are supposed to unfold. If you want to see how a fake book that contains R & B should be layed out and published check out the New Real Book series put out by Sher publications. Unfortunately the R and B is scattered throughout those books and not systematically put in one cover as it is with this horrible edition by Hal Leonard. It would be incredible if Hal Leonard's people would subcontract the work to make a good fake book to someone like Sher, then we would have the comprehensiveness that Hal Leonard provides along with the very high quality and true usefulness that Sher and his arrangers bring to a project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection!","review":"What a great collection of tunes.

It is a first hand account and we are not brought down by the dreary chronology or dry scholastic jibberish of Western history academics. His introduction warns of his awareness of the flaws of the culture, but he wishes to show the strengths and beauty of a dying civilization. Truly unique, inspiring and thought provoking"},{"rating":"2","title":"A past gone forever","review":"I don't think it is possible to go wrong with a book by John Blofeld.For those of us who long for another time, he is the perfect guide.No one I have read is more capable of conveying the mood he isexperiencing and transporting you there. In the 1930's there stillexisted Taoist monasteries and lone wizards. He sought these out andrelates the lore around them along with examples that make you wonderif they had true magic. But even in relating his everyday life, youare still taken under his spell. City of Lingering Splendour is of thelast few years before the Japanese invaded and started the end of thismagical era; later finished off by World War 2 and the Communist revolution.His writing is like finding a lost isolated world, a treasure from before therewere such awful concepts.

Now about the collection of hits: If this collection was ENDLESS there would've been alot more of her hits. I suggest you buy the Anthology ,which was only put out a year before this one, containing over 30 songs of her entire career. I also suggest buying \\"THE DANCE COLLECTION-A COMPILATION OF 12\\" SINGLES\\" which contains 8 extended versions of her 70's hits including the 17 minute \\"MACARTHUR PARK SUITE\\".

In that respect, Night Wounds are purists -- there are no pop hooks, no rockist aspirations here whatsoever. Tho the second half of \\"Ex Best Friend\\" has a nice little groove a la The Pop Group.

It gives me good curl definition with zero stiffness, and when I blow my hair straight, the Glaze makes it shiny and silky. Also, it eliminates frizz, which is a problem in my humid climate.

He asked a truly mixed bag of artists to interpret Gershwin favorites, and dedicated the album to a harmonica-player, of all things, who I gather is famous among serious musicians. His name is Larry Adler and he plays a version of Rhapsody in Blue that will knock your socks off. Adler was 80 when the recording was made, and he knew Gershwin. Gershwin is said to have remarked, after hearing him play Rhapsody in Blue, that he now realized he had written it for harmonica. Doubt me if you will, but let your ears decide. The artists were allowed to choose which songs they wanted to perform.

Originally on the same label (Cramps) as the great, great (let me say that again) GREAT Italian band , Area. And although this group does not really have many similarities to Area there are some. like their interest in melding together jazz/ rock with folk influences. All players (six) are really good and project that high energy muscular fusion so characteristic during the 70s. The guitar player comes from the Arti & Mestieri group, so high energy playing comes as no surprise. What really surprised me was their original sound and compositions. There are vocals but used like another instrument, a little bit crazy and weird (which is a lot of fun to listen to). I have their other 1st one and it is also very good.

Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan work well together, and make you laugh the entire time they are together. Whether it is Jackie's tries at the english language, or Chris Tucker immitating Micheal Jackson, this movies will put a smile on your face, if it doesnt make you roll on the floor and laugh. There is tons of action in this movie, and it does have a pretty good story to go along with it. Buy or rent this movie, well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good DVD but no English subtitle !","review":"This is a very good action-comedy movie. With Jackie fighting and Chris talking, it is hilarious. All the extras on DVD are worthwhile to watch except that while they are trying to give you so much extras, they forgot the most basic feature which is the English subtitle!The subtitle is the norm for the DVD and I was so disappointed that this was missing. I need this option since Chris talks so fast and I couldn't catch all he said (this is very true since Jackie himself pointed out this fact in one of the extra features).Overall this is an excellent entertaining movie to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent action/comedy","review":"I havent had such a good time in the movies for a long time. I was laughing all the way through. It is a very well made, lighthearted action/comedy, well in the Jackie Chan tradition that does not make the mistake of taking himself seriously, unlike other people (ie Van Damme, Seagal, etc). Apart from the excellent humour, the most important thing is the chemistry between Chan and Tucker, which makes the movie great, in fact, it looks as if they were having a lot of fun making the whole thing. It is definitely better than the first one, and were all waiting for the third. This is entertainment!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first","review":"This is a must see movie. Jackie Chan is, as always, fabulous, and Chris Tucker is very funny. More action, more laughs, more rush. You won't be disapointed. Well worth the price of the ticket.

Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better then the Rush Hour 1","review":"If you like Jackie Chan stunts and a good comedy you will like this movie.

His nasal screech and pop-eyed overacting are like nails on a blackboard to me. In \\"Rush Hour 2\\" he portrays an utterly dense and racist American cop, which will do nothing to improve the image of Americans to overseas audiences. Jackie Chan is as agile and chaming as usual; he and a few good action scenes in an otherwise moribund film are the only reasons it gets two stars. The wonderful Zhang Ziyi is criminally wasted. Seeing \\"Rush Hour 2,\\" it is easy to understand why Asian stars such as Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh decline to make the leap to Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, but obnoxious.","review":"There were many take offs from Rush Hour in this sequel, as we all knew there would be from the commercials. As an owner of the first Rush Hour dvd, I'm rather irritated that most of the jokes in Rush Hour 2 seem to come at the expense of women. Breasts seem to be the highlight of the film...seemingly Mr. Ratner was now fresh out of ideas and had to go to stock. Misogyny abounds in this film, even comparisons of women to buffets. Even Jackie Chan has now taken part in such ludicrous objectification. I'm highly disappointed with the quality of entertainment. Zhang Ziyi and the Chinese Vegas partner were the only pure joys in the film. Of course, Zhang Ziyi's fighting scenes didn't do her justice one bit. Tucker and Chan seem to have outworn their charm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Movie (only for the Laughs, Horrible Kungfu) Bad DVD","review":"This is without any doubt, one of the best comedies in the history of movies, but at the same time, it is the worst martial art Film of all time.

If u are looking for a good action flik this isn't what you're lookin for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good American Chan Movie","review":"This movie is great. Simply hilarious. Chan and Tucker make a great team. I could not stop laughing.Now, as a Jackie Chan movie. . . That's another story. Jackie Chan fans who have seen most all of his Hong Kong movies (including \\"Accidental Spy\\") will be a little let down. U.S. directiors like to (or have to) crimp on Chan's style. The fights are shorter and less impressive (using more special effects than all his HK movie combined). Director Brett Ratner seems especially CRITICAL of Jackie's style. He directly critisizes the roof-top fight in \\"Who Am I?\\" as beeing too long and pointless. DUH! It's Chan! The fight itself was the point!Anyways, you'll find loads of fun behind-the-scenes stuff including interviews and making-of clips. You'll also find two \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trailers hidden in the scene selection area (this DVD was released before \\"LOTR\\" came out in the theaters).Over all a great DVD of a great movie, just not a great Chan movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Haven't Seen This, RUSH To Your Local Blockbuster","review":"Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker absolutely tear it up in this heavily awaited sequel to the smash hit \\"Rush Hour\\" I've been a huge Jackie Chan fan for years now and while I like his pure kung-fu films better, usually, I must say that this movie is one of the most overall entertaining movies ever. This movie has got everything, from action to comedy to a good storyline to suspense to.....you name it. Also, Chris Tucker is hilarious in this movie, pulling in his funniest and most memorable performance to date. There are some crazy stunts as usual and the movie also stars Zang Ziyi (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) who I love as well.Overall, this movie has everything you could want in a Saturday night flick. Also, the dvd is loaded with extras including deleted scenes and outtakes. This is an absolute must have for any action, comedy or Jackie Chan fan.

The undeniable onstage chemistry between Tucker and Chan delivers a very entertaining action/comedy. The first few minutes had me worried that this movie suffered from \\"sequel-itis\\" but it soon picked up and had me laughing just as the first did. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"funnier and more action packed than the first one","review":"i found this movie to be better than the first one.there's still lotsof action,but it's even funnier than the first.there's some really goodfight scenes,and Jackie Chan's moves are even more outrageous this timearound.the banter between Chan and Tucker is much funnier and morenatural.once again,although there is some violence it's not excessiveor gratuitous.i think there is also less coarse language than thefirst,and like the first,there is no nudity,but there is a bit ofsuggestiveness.overall,i though this movie was a great ride from startto finish.it's even faster paced than the original,and Tucker and Chanhave even better general and comedic chemistry.for me,Rush Hour 2 is a 4/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get ready for a 2nd rush!!!","review":"A lot better than the original, Rush Hour 2 is choc full of sharp, witty, comical dialogue, exciting action sequences and better acting than its predecessor. The story once again takes us from Hong Kong to Los Angeles and Chris Tucker has come along way since the first movie, he deserved the 20 million he got paid for this film. Jackie's action sequences are lot better and creative in this one and this sequel also stars Zhang Ziyi in her first hollywood film. It once again features bloopers over the end credits and is full of extra features as well. Even if you don't like the original, you may find this movie to your liking. All fans of the first will definitely want to buy this, it is well worth getting.Can't wait for the 3rd installment which hits the big screen in August 2007."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a duo...Funniest yet!","review":"If you don't mind rolling on the ground laughing, you'll love this flick! Both Jackie and Chris make a perfect couple when it comes to humor. But don't worry, there's plenty of action too!

I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did...and yes it is better than the original Rush Hour!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Total Riot!!","review":"From the opening where Chris Tucker dances like Micheal Jackson in a dangerous bar filled with thugs to the outtakes during the credits, the hilarity never lets up. Jackie Chan does some unbelievable stunts and the duo just plain kick some bad guy butt. The fight scenes are very well-coordinated and seem very realistic. The plot line is decent, going along very well with the plot line set forth in the prequel, while revealing Chief Inspector Lee's history. The humor comes from Chris Tucker in the form of one-liners. Anyway excellent movie that is not a waste of your time, and is pure entertainment. Go Watch it ASAP!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Left It At Rush Hour","review":"Brett Ratner really should have left Rush Hour a stand-alone show. Rush Hour 2 is pretty overblown and it's even annoying enough at times to make one visibly wince. The writers had Tucker go from funny & clever in the first one to downright annoying and obnoxious in this sequel. Some of the sequences were entertaining however, mainly the fight choreography, and the 2 high-powered women (Sanchez and Zhang) help make the movie more interesting, but overall the film falls flat on plot and buddy cop chemistry. 2 stars for introducing some new elements in the Rush Hour saga but failing to deliver in enjoyment value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't take offense...","review":"This was really a very crappy movie. I tried to give it a chance, but I ended up twiddling my thumbs and whistling the Charles in Charge theme.Maybe it's my hatred for \\"buddy comedies\\" (like that one with Owen Wilson and Mr. Chan-- \\"A Not Funny Take on the West\\"...), but this movie sucks ballsacks. I first noticed this when Chris Tucker spoke, then the plot began to unfurl, yet Chris Tucker kept speaking. The crappy jokes didn't help it along, either. Usually, when you mix action and comedy, you come out with a quivering, inbred form of entertainment. I think you'll see what I mean when Taxi comes out.I know, it's harsh but it's true. And don't shoot the messenger; the messenger of common sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only thing missing is humor","review":"Could somebody please tell the producers of future Rush Hour movies to please include humor in future installments of the franchise? I couldn't find anything remotely funny in Rush Hour 2, just Chris Tucker annoying the hell out of everyone within sight and earshot. Correction, there was one funny element: director Brett Ratner is supposedly a huge fan of the film \\"Enter the Dragon.\\" As a result, he chose Lalo Schifrin who did the score for that film to work on Rush Hour 2. Oddly enough, we get music that sounds like it belongs in a martial arts film from 1972! Anybody have a clue as to how Rattner came from out of nowhere to start directing big-budget Hollywood films? Who did he sleep with?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackie Chan is (...)!!!","review":"Even thongh Jackie Chan is welcome by Hollywood, frankly speaking he's no longer popular in Asia, esp. Hong Kong! To Hong Kong people, his style and his action are too common and boring. He's not funny (even he tries so hard to be an action comedian) and the way he acts is (...). He uses stunt man so offen and his kung fu is just like stupid dancing. For really kung fu, please go to look at Bruce Lee.Maybe he's really hot in the eyes of American people, but some time later, you'll know what I'm saying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"seen it before....","review":"I liked this movie the first time when it was called Lethal Weapon, I mean Lethal Weapon 2, I mean 48 Hours, etc. I saw every joke coming from a mile away because it was borrowed from every other buddy cop movie ever made. For a younger audience, I'm sure the movie was hilarious, but for a more seasoned audience, it just looks tired and old. It gets 2 stars instead of one because of the nice eye candy in Zhang Ziyi."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies ever","review":"This is one of my favorite movies of all time!

Carter (Chris Tucker) is in Hong Kong on what he thinks is a vacation far away from the Los Angeles police department. Of course, Li has other plans.There are the usual Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan antics and there are many scenes in Hong Kong which are visually quite nice.The plot line is a bit sillier than the first Rush Hour but there is all the racial slanted comic relief you would expect.I prefer the first Rush Hour myself, it's wittier and the plot makes more sense.I wouldn't reccommend purchasing this one unless you are a die hard Jackie Chan fan but it's a fine rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilariously Entertaining","review":"Rush Hour 2 is a formidable follow-up to the first movie, and in fact, I would say it is even funnier than the first one. It may not be the most plot intensive movie, but what it lacks in that respect is more than made up for with its comedy. Jackie Chan, as expected, provides some great action sequences but I think a big difference between the second and the first is the added comical role that Jackie Chan plays, and the added action role that Chris Tucker plays (along with his incredibly funny lines, of course). All in all, it was a great movie and I recommend it to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rush Hour 2 - -Rush Chris Tucker out of the Film Industry!!","review":"Pretty decent second outing with the pair trying to thwart an illegal counterfeiting operation and a subplot of Jackie Chan's character on a vendetta to find the man who killed his father. There's a lot of great stunt work, shootouts, action, and chase scenes with locations in Las Vegas, Hong Kong, and L.A., but any movie with Chris Tucker, gets an automatic 1 star. Chris Tucker plays the same character in all his films. Ever since he ruined THE FIFTH ELEMENT (people thought Jar-Jar Binks in SW-The Phantom Menace was annoying), any movie Chris Tucker (even the first RUSH HOUR) is in...STINKS!! For all those who agree, watch JACKIE BROWN, Chris Tucker gets oft in the first half hour of the film. (Samuel Jackson sticks him in the trunk of an automobile and does a James Cagny on him. That was funny!!) Jackie Chan is as great and engaging as usual..too bad Chris Tucker isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"rush hour2","review":"MY opinion of Rush Hour2 is that its funny, and has lot of comedy and action.His funny when chris Tuker is singing Jackie chan made me lough when hes Fighting.

LAPD Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) is on vacation in Hong Kong with his friend, Detective Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan). Carter just wants to relax, have fun, get some \\"mu shu\\", but Lee can't stop doing his job even for a minute. This time, he's hot on the trail of gangster Ricky Tan (John Lone), who may have been behind an Embassy bombing.More-of-the-same in terms of content AND style, but still pretty engaging, with lots of action and thrills. Chan and Tucker still share the same chemistry, and overall there are some good laughs. (Worth it just to see Tucker perform Michael Jackson's \\"Don't Stop Til You Get Enough\\"...) For me, one of the perks of this sequel is watching \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" beauty Zhang Ziyi as a very fetching and lethal assassin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely funnier than the first..","review":"I'm not one who enjoys sequels too much as they are usually not as well done as the first movie, but in the case of Rush Hour 2, it's definitely funnier than the first movie. They pretty much managed to polish the chemistry between Jackie and Chris which really shines in this film. The DVD itself is another masterpiece. For it's price, it comes jammed with lots of extras like the first. It's got the director's commentary, couple of biographies on the making of the movie and Jackie. There's even a little hidden trailer for Lords of the Ring in the chapter select menu screen. Now, why can't other more expensive dvd movies follow suit? The colors were crisp and solid. Definitely a pleasant to view. Buy this movie if you liked the first. You'll be pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of Jackie","review":"Even Jackie Chan can't save this film. The plot is dumb, Chris Tucker's character is too thin to take seriously, the bad guys are stupid and the fight scenes are cut too quickly to have the fun of watching Jackie do what he does best. Why does anyone think bad writing will be covered by lots of action and still be successful??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexist comedy that tries to expose a non racist rap","review":"This movie portrayed women only as objects of men's desire. In trying to put humor to racial tension by sticking a black guy with a chinese guy, the oppression of women is used as a playing field. As the black and chinese man break racial and cultural barriers, they dig women into a deep, deep hole by being obsessed only by their bodies. There are scenes where women are portrayed as submissive tenants to men (in the chinese spa) and scenes where women are spied upon in a sexual manner (jackie and chris spying on the agent in the hotel). Although the agent is a woman she is depicted as helpless and useful only to look at as her plans to unveil the chinese mafia's crime are ruined by the men's (Jackie and Chris) insensitivity to the operation. Even though this movie may do justice to race relations it gives a big TKO to the oppression of women."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FUNNY AT ALL","review":"When you see the trailer of this movie, you lough more than seeing the movie itself.This is a bad sequel, the first RUSH HOUR, was really cool.This one is stupid and not funny at all.Chris Tucker is the only good thing here.Jackie Chan gives me the creeps."},{"rating":"1","title":"The man who ruined X-Men","review":"This was a stupid film. It is not funny, it is not entertaining, it is garbage. No wonder X-Men; The Last Stand was stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chris Tucker needs a lesson in other cultures!","review":"In typical Jackie Chan fashion, the action and fight scenes were great. As an Asian-American, however, the jokes poking fun of the Chinese culture and others were too much. Chris Tucker chose the most evident things to make jokes about, and displayed the tendency of some Americans to be closed-minded about other cultures. It would've been nice if Tucker redeemed himself at the end, but he continued to be the same close-minded jerk throughout the movie. Were it not for the awesome fight scenes, I would not have enjoyed the movie at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good example of a bad movie","review":"Is this a Kung Fu movie or comedy? Well the fights where boring and unimaginative. Unlike previous Jackie Chan movies. This movie pales in comparison to movies like Drunken Master and Rumble in the Bronx both in the comedic and action sense. The comedy on the other and relies mainly on Tucker's character being a village idiot. Witch at times made me chuckle just out of pity. I do agree that the out takes where the funniest part of the movie. In closing I would just like to say don't be suckered in by all the advertising brain washing that says this is anything but a B rate movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible !!!!!","review":"This has to be one of the worst movies of 2001.The big problem, other than Chris Tucker's unfunny big mouth, is the lame plot.

Until then, this will have to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a shame","review":"i can go and pull out all my cd's and come up with over 80 minutes of music that would easily be a reasonable greatest hits album, but they cheepshotted us. Why? I don't know, other then to try and make a profit by having a couple new songs. I love Cypress Hill, but HATE this tactic.Only reason i gave this cd 2 stars and not one is because i love the songs on here. Even though i have played each and every one to death before this cd came out, i was glad (previous to seeing the lacking track list) to see them finally release a greatest hits album. With efforts like this, they wonder why the music industry is suffering. give people what they pay for, a full cd, especially for those who had invested in all the prior cd's that allowed to make a greatest hits."},{"rating":"1","title":"No answer keys for chapter reviews.","review":"In the book there are very nice review quizzes. The huge problem is I don't have anyway to know if I am answering them correctly since there is no answer key. To get the answers, I would have to purchase the teachers edition. I've been out of school for awhile, but I'm pretty sure the books use to have the answers in the back, so you could check your work. This is only a problem if you aren't being instructor led. If you have a teacher, you can ask them if you're doing it right. If you aren't so lucky, and you're doing college online with no instructor interaction this presents a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"No play by the way","review":"This cd had a good selection of songs but unforgently it skiped all the way through.I'm going to attempt to get a replacement.I have had real good luck with Amazon, and expect the problem will be resolved promplyI noticed it comes from Germany, maybe there a chance the format is differant there?Looking forward to getting the replacement and hoping it plays OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow downloads, so-so quality, POOR programming","review":"Totally agree with the first reviewer concerning content, or rather, the lack thereof. The amount of stuff available on this thing is worse than nil, because it's mostly free, low-quality, BORING clips that you can get FOR FREE on the Internet by yourself. (E.g., try Microsoft's windowsmedia.com.) I haven't tried the premium channels but that's because there's NOTHING worth paying extra for. Downloads are slow and the video quality is VHS-like. I'm afraid to say this is a rip-off despite its cutie-looking interface. Do not buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"Akimbo's not the greatest, granted.

I spent 20 bucks on this that I might as well have burnt.

First of all, unless you have the recordings of each of the songs, the \\"riffs\\" he tries to teach are meaningless. Curt tends to talk off the top of his head and much of what he talks about is supercilious remarks that take up too much time. The tabs are hand written and the cover looks like it was done on a home computer, and badly (too many different fonts on the cover, a big no-no in desktop publishing). Save your money! Actually, minus 1 star is more accurate. Nothing to learn from this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. The tablature is handwritten and unreadable.","review":"Terrible. The tablature is handwritten and unreadable. For lesser money you can get a proper tablature book. The Pink Floyd video is also very bad. The tablatures are so small thay you cant make out what the Guy is playing. I wish I could return them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"The quality of this video is not really up to snuff for a professional tape (taped on a cheap video camera?). The content - a list of EC licks are rattled off fast with little thought for context or content. The intro. was ok - although it concentrated more on the guitarist on the tape than on E.C.. However, I did learn an alternative way to play one lick off the little paper leaflet that came with the video (the best part of the package) and which I have now lost! Not really worth the money. This would be overpriced at half the current price."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO. IT IS A HOME MADE VIDEO. ITS PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO RIP YOU OFF. THE TABLATURE THAT COMES WITH THE VIDEO IS HANDWRITTEN."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would pass on this DVD","review":"The DVD is poorly made. The cover states 'Newly remastered version' so I would hate to see what the old version looked like. The video quality is not very good. But the main problem is the quality of the music. The DVD consists of about 50 riffs that Eric Clapton played. Each riff is introduced on the screen as 'Riff 1', 'Riff 2' etc. There is tabulature included, which makes this DVD of some value. But there is hardly any talking by the instructor or introduction to the Riff, ie from which song it is from. Some of the riffs are recognizable in terms of the songs they are from. Most of the riffs, I didn't recognize, even though I am a big Clapton fan.The instructor doesn't show you how to play the riffs, he just plays each one, one time and then let's you figure it out from the tabulature. I was very tempted to return this, but then I thought I will use it as a reference one day, so it will sit on a shelf for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"satisfied customer","review":"The product was in excellent condition and arrived in a timely manner.

There are, however, a few things I didn't like about the chair. The rockers on the bottom are made of plastic and slide easily on most flooring. The cotton material on the sides and back of the chair is not as good of quality as I would expect for the price of the chair. The chenille is really nice. The chair height is great for toddlers to sit and climb into the chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me!","review":"I have never used a rug before this one, so I'm not sure what to compare it to.

There was really no way to wash it so we just threw it away. What a waste of $17.99.

So, the mat can get a little wet on occasion... might as well just use a towel under your cat box as opposed to buying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"great buy","review":"This mat is awesome. I don't think there is a product out there that could catch every crumb of litter but this mat comes close. It greatly reduced that amount that I had to sweep up and the cat seems to like it too. I find him taking a snooze on it often. Definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can watch the litter fall off their little feet","review":"This rug works great. I replaced some very thin rugs that got moved around more than I would like with this rug. It is heavy enough to stay put.

It's an essential item.On the Litter Maid system; it's the plastic gears in the roller/scoop mechanism that wear out and if your use the wrong litter or if you fail to heed the instructions on filling the box, it'll also wear out the gears.

It does appear to work but it's not full-proof.I'm glad i bought it, but it's not a perfect solution still."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for what it is...","review":"This mat is so much classier looking than those tacky plastic mats you see in PetSmart. It's big enough to hold two small cat boxes and still have room to catch the litter the kitties kick out of the boxes. (The boxes I have are both uncovered.)

The cats don't seem to mind it, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well","review":"This rug fits perfectly under the LitterMaid automatic litterboxes, either the regular or the Mega.

The other favorable tracks include William's rendition of a Sting bluesy tune entitled Sister Moon (in which Sting even does backup vocals).

There is a plethora of suggestions along the lines that one should encourage primative mothers to give their children fruit instead of sodas, if they have any money for snacks. I bought this book based on the glowing reviews, but after looking it over, I returned it. Maybe wonderful for the Peace Corps but not for the average household wishing to avoid the medical profession as much as possible.

Luckily, I did! It was disappointingly lacking in functional medical knowledge, given the title. Most of the book kept drifting into discussions of handling political/social/superstition issues associated with living in tribal/Third World villages. I found the implied assumption that these people groups do not possess even a modicum of common sense regarding basic hygiene to be elitist at best, and downright insulting at worst. Get a copy of the American Red Cross First Aid and Safety Handbook, and go forth armed with your own personal knowledge and sensitivity to others - you'll be miles ahead of this book.

Perhaps those with extensive training will forgive us who do not have the head knowledge and/or experience to fill in the obvious gaps in the text.

It is full of bad ideas and common sense advice; several pages, complete with preschool illustrations, pertain to how to explain why witchcraft can't hurt you and why you should stay hydrated with water that dosn't have feces in it. The most usefule tidbits in the book tell you to run and see a doctor, which you'll definitely need to do if you follow much of the other medical advice in this book.

If you like vanilla, cinammon and cocoa butter scents you will like this. In spite of feeling light on the skin, it has amazing moisturization and I really feel smooth and soft all day, and the scent Lasts- it doesnt just smell great in the jar.

If You're Funny...","review":"Anna Faris is the only bright spot in an otherwise inane film. The problems begin with the screenplay; populated by one-note characters, a non-existent storyline and dreadful dearth of jokes. One must wonder if the writer or director had ever partaken of the forbidden flora, as the experience is depicted as being akin to dropping acid after a 3 day meth bender, full of talking dogs and flaming skulls. John Krasinski has nothing to do in this film and only succeeds in being as boring as his character is implied to be. The \\"plot\\" revolves around a young \\"actress\\" who spends all day getting high and playing video games. Her one and only love is her expensive new bed, and it is the threat of losing this bed that drives the \\"action\\" in the film. It's nonsensical, unenlightening, and worst of all, unfunny."},{"rating":"2","title":"People, This was a great movie!","review":"I can't understand why so many people have panned this movie.

If you were really baked out of your mind and you watched this movie who knows, maybe you might laugh a couple of times. However if you're straight I don't think it's going to work out well. Since I haven't smoked in 20 years it certainly didn't work well for me.It's painfully obvious that neither the director or the main star have ever been stoned or know what it's like to be stoned. The main character at times behaves as if she's drunk out of her mind, or having an intense acid trip, but at no time in the movie does she convince me she's stoned. At other times she just seems like a typical ditsy, airheaded, blond Hollyweird chick. As a matter of fact this movie would have been far more believable if it was about an airheaded blond chick in Hollywood on an intense acid trip.I am happy I saw this movie on cable for free, as I would have been pissed if I actually bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's funny if you're high","review":"The acting is atrocious.

It's so not funny. There are no jokes, no good lines, nothing, and Anna Farris is the crappiest pothead I've ever seen and John Krasinski was just a waste of talent. I really did not get this movie.

The clip on the back is ridiculously large and I have to use both hands to open it. Finally, I think the entire concept of these glove cases is ridiculous.

PFM, King Crimson(Bruford-Wetton era) and Frank Zappa can all be heard as influences. The musicianship is top-notch. The compositions are somewhat fusion-like but still more rooted in prog than jazz.

The charming stories of friendship between very different creatures are entertaining, and also nice springboards for discussions with little ones. It's remarkably quiet and old-fashioned compared to many of today's options for children, which I love! It's pleasant background noise while I get a few things done, but also a DVD I will just as often will sit and watch with my child.The video itself is the most enjoyable item on the DVD. The \\"A Day for Eeyore\\" is not the \\"classic\\" it claims to be, poorly drawn and with a voice-over for Pooh not even reminiscent of the original.

I would have given this product 5 stars but gave it only 4 because the can is so large and the lincoln logs only fill is maybe half way. There is a lot more room for more logs. 115 sounds like a lot but you are only able to make the one cabin seen on the front. I ended up buying additional logs (not lincoln logs) so that me and the kids could build additional buildings and a fence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough peices","review":"I was disappointed with this toy because there were not enough of the larger logs, and, I believe, there is a limited amount of structures for a child to make.

I must say that I was disappointed with the quality of the product. The instructions say not to use the product on carpet because the dye may rub off and stain it! The green roof slats are rounded on one side. The roof is very hard to attach to the roof trust for a three year old. Because the side that is round is the side that faces down, they are hard to keep in place. Also, the way in which the red trust is cut, the green roof pieces slide off too easy. If I had it to do all over again, I would not buy it! It would probably be better to shop a garage sale and try and find an old set that was made correctly.

I have spent so much time trying to clean these things off, and saving a few bucks here at Amazon definitely was not worth the hassle. What's worse, the outter shipping box had only a little ding on it when it arrived, but the paintball box itself was totally smashed in, which means that the paintabll box was already smashed when they packed it and shipped it to me, and yet they sent it anyway!

The quality of the bubbles was considerably less than what you could make from a dime store bottle and the bubble generator itself was unnecessarily complicated and performed poorly.

I was wrong. It's complicated,frustrating to get to work right even for an adult. The directions were hit or miss on some of the finer details on how to produce the bubbles. The plastic used to make this also has a distinct (and my wife says \\"Unpleasent\\") scent. The smoke liquid to create the smoke effect is not to be used by children. Another point I would have liked to have known before buying this. I ran under the assumption it was a non-toxic,fairly easy to use toy going by the age on the package and just the concept itself. What's easier than making a bubble?

Unlike some other metal cases, this one is quite strong. It holds the cards well and even after a drop, they are still in place. The latch holds tight but easy enough to open the case when you want to. If you use it to carry a Compact Flash Adapter, it can actually carry three Compact Flash cards as one plugs into the Compact Flash Adapter.I would recommend this case highly; too bad that the case maker, Microtech no longer makes it. Really nothing to go wrong with it so no problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a person just starting into the 80's metal guitar","review":"I used to own this on video a few years back. This video is sweet. Although at times you may catch yourself not even trying to do what Curt pulls off (mostly because you're enjoying watching him play) it will definitely improve your dynamic range of guitar playing ability.Here's a BIG plus: he shows you what effects he used, what amplifiers (50 watt Marshall Plexi, then Soldano lead, etc.) He goes on to show you 50 or so guitar riffs (mastering these riffs will render your a god among your other guitar player friends - unless they are guitar gods themselves).The reason that I only put 4 stars: because he only shows your Eddies wicked riffs, he doesn't show you how he plays his rythm (which is still half rythm, half lead).Anyway for an aspiring shredder, it's well worth your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No good , no good , no good","review":"This is a poorly produced DVD, with little educational value.Save your money and buy a decent book, like Van Halen Best Of, Volume I for example.Van Halen Best Of, Volume I (Best of Van Halen)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen a lot of bad \\"movies\\", but.....","review":"This has to be at the top of the list.

Bad acting, horrible sound quality, terrible music, and a script that has lost its way finds this movie both insulting with it stereotypical views of jocks, frat and gays. This movie was so bad I decided to have a few vodkas about a 1/3 of the way through to diminish the pain. The movie is so unrealastic it should be rated as fantasy / comedy.

They wanted me to ship the product to them so they could replace it, but I was in need, so I kept it and face milled it flat. The magnets are held in with resin and there are inherent dangers in doing this so I don't recommend anyone try this.It works great now and holds strong.

Easy to use. Best if you can leave it on a dedicated router as installation requires you to chuck up a setup pin (don't lose this or your in deep dodo) to ensure that the bit you use is centered on the jig (kind of a pain but necessary.) The adjustments are every 1/16\\" so any finer than that just wont happen with this unless you use a larger bit than the standard recommended (1/4\\" straight); otherwise some calculations are needed (given with the kit) to get the overall diameter of the hole you are cutting. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the guide pin is a little long for using in 3/4\\" wood.

Humanity in The Spin probe many things over the course of its silent struggle with the \\"bubble\\" - probe the \\"bubble\\" itself, probe the Hypotheticals but in the end the humans, as we always are as a collective group, are short sited. In the face of a great mystery, the humans continue to pettily bicker about their problems. This portrayal of human banality in times of greatness are a healthy reminder to look at the primitive mind of man and how they react to things which they don't understand. But there are also characters in the book which rise above this common ignorance to attempt a greater understanding and, ultimately, a wish for the betterment of mankind. Character driven 100% of the way through the book, the plot rarely slacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Realistic Tale of Science Fiction","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Strong character development and interesting twists keep you hooked. Wished there was more on the Martian and that the ending answered more questions, but the ending was good.

The story flows evenly and quickly and though it is technologically complex at moments, but easy enough for the layperson (aka non-sci-fi geek!) to understand. The characters are especially engaging, testing the limits of what the human body and psyche can handle. Overall, an excellent book (and author, as I've recently found out!)! It really makes you re-assess your place on this planet, and how you would react to a potential global disaster looming around the corner of the unforseeable future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific read!","review":"I picked this book up on the recommendation of a blog I read regularly - the first time I've done that, in fact. Well, I didn't regret it! The book was a gripping read from the start, thoguh occasionally frustrating in its slowness to reveal answers (I'm an impatient person). I enjoyed seeing the growth of the characters from their early teens through to the end of the book (I'm sure I could have kept better track and known what age they were at the end, but it didn't actually matter; the plot required only that they be adults, so I'm guessing they were late forties by the end?). The plot itself was new enough and different enough to never be predictable.I think my highest recommendation for this novel, though, is that I can't wait to read it again in a few weeks to see what I missed on the first exhilirating read-through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging Story","review":"To sum up; Spin is a quick read with an engaging story. Not hard sci-fi, this story about how humanity would react to a mysterious astronomical event offers intriguing ideas and strong character development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spin.. a tale","review":"Wilson does a nice job of sort of throwing a mysterious quandary into normal reality and then showing how it affects humanity. There are things I would expect to happen if the earth suddenly were to become surrounded by such a shield, and Wilson hit most of them, which was satisfying, as often authors will leave out apparently obvious repercussions. However, there wasn't anything _really_ surprising about what happened, so while the story was enjoyable, it wasn't a complete page-turner. I also wished he had flushed out the end explanation with a little more detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind-blowing","review":"The concepts, rather than the characterizations, are the real reason to read this book. I thought I knew what direction the book was going to take; I was completely wrong. Though it is very well-written, it lacks the connective tissue that is more realistically employed in classics like Dune. Some of the sections were not wholly realistic and the Simon character was a major distraction disguised as an antagonist. But Wilson does deserve create for his beautiful, brilliant prose. If you are looking for a book to take you beyond what is commonly imagined in SF, Spin has what you need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Science-fiction for people who don't like science-fiction","review":"This is a story about many things: longing for love, a lover had, a lover lost. Politics, business, and a power struggle between father and son. There are science fiction elements sprinkled into the long, winding tale - but a sci-fi tale it's not.Like the main character who is afraid of confrontation (won't go after the girl, won't stand up for himself, won't look into the box), Wilson sparingly teases you with interesting sci-fi concepts, only to beat a hasty retreat back to his comfort zone. This relegates the majority of the book to the minutiae of daily life and exquisitely boring relationships.This is science-fiction for people who don't like science-fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spin the get to sleep book","review":"I say many great reviews for SPIN so I decided to download it to my Kindle, I am not sure, if anyone really read this book.

Instead, I listened to the audio version to and from work.The idea is intriguing, and the information on why the Spin membrane was imposed on Earth, and by whom, is doled out very slowly.The book also explores a few concepts that are difficult to explore realistically: stuff like sending slow spacecraft way out into the galaxy. Saying why these can be explored would be a spoiler, of course.The reactions of individuals, governments, religious groups and societies at large to the Spin are also interesting.The ending is sort of flat, and I'd imagine we won't know the answers to a lot of questions until his book 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, thrilling, buy it!","review":"Interesting characters, stunning plot developments, and a very original idea to start with.

I recommend this book to any hard core Sci Fi fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good character development, boring story","review":"I recently received the book, and all books I get I read at least 100 pages to see if the story captivates me. I know some stories are slow to develop, that's why I give them 100 pages. Wilson did a fine job at building the character's persona's, hence the 2 star rating, but the story was ineffective at best, totally boring at worst. You can have the most interesting character, but if you have a sloppy story, the whole plot will fail. Like Superman, comic fans all love him, but say you put him in May berry with Aunt Bea and Sher riff Andy, well then, it'll flop as Superman has nobody to challenge him. But I give this author a C for effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent hard SF, false notes in character development","review":"Rest assured, this is an enjoyable thought provoking read with some interesting variations on old SF themes. However, perhaps in response to the oft-repeated canard about character development, the author strains too mightily for interpersonal themes and character development. Not that there is anything wrong with well worked out characters with well worked out social spheres but this author does not pull it off transparently. Instead, you get the sense all along this book of these additional themes being contrived and forced into the narrative. As a result in the third quarter of the novel the pace really fell off and I found myself having to push on because I hoped there would be an interesting payoff in the last quarter. Fortunately, I was not disappointed and nor will you be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been a short story","review":"Reading this book I kept asking myself when it would end. It has an interesting premise, good concepts, but should maybe have been a novella or short story. The characters are flat, amazingly predictable and the plot grinds along at a glacier's pace. I do not typically get angry at books, but this one really irritated me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting scifi","review":"The parallel storylines (half the story is told in flashback, alternating present-time and flashback chapters) allow Wilson to tease and pay off things well, and he's mastered the chapter ending cliffhanger. The first 400 pages of the book lead up to an amazing world-altering chapter. I found the concluding chapters to be a bit weak, unfortunately, with no real climax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing great here","review":"This book would have made a great short story but in its current form it is too long and boring. The intermixing of protagonists running from the 'officials' and the main story line was pointless. It did not advance the story while it ate up page after page. Plus, if you are running from the law why take a drug that will debilitate you for two weeks? Also, the sub-plot of religious nut jobs trying to breed a red heifer was a waste of ink. At the end I was waiting for the big pay off with regard to the origin of the spin membrane, instead human kind is given a new planet to trash without learning any lessons about how to take care of dwindling resources."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly brilliant!

The whining mother on 1900 House ruined that production; all the upstairs gentry, while taking every advantage of the limited luxury they enjoyed, spent their time bitching and treating below stairs with the entitlement mentality of trust fund babies on steriods. The below stairs folks were more credible, though clueless as to what was expected of them by way of the unending toil they'd signed up for .

I saw only 2 of this 'House' program, before it finished running on TV. I was so delighted to finally get the whole program to view from start to finish.The most remarkable evidence of money corrupting people was displayed in this program, as the people chosen to play the lord and lady of the house became less and less in touch with the reality of the world in which 'their servants' lived. The pompous lord and lady actually believed that they were deserving of such outrageous attention. They showed less and less compassion for others, as they fell more and more into their roles.

The arrangements are basic, but perfect. And that voice! Man, Howard Tate is right along side Otis, Aretha, Ray Charles and Bobby Bland! It's no so much that they sing well, though they do of course!

I'm looking for replacement parts, and have found that the cost looks like more than it's worth. I purchased a Wal-Mart replacement while at the beach, and it is an EZ up, and is of the same design and won't hold up either.

As for this product, the plastic holding the main crossbars across the top broke in two places by the time I had used the product 3 times (I think the first break happened the first day we used it). The 4th and last time I used the product, we had to tape the crossbars together in the middle so they wouldn't fall on our heads and the top of the canopy was flaccid and waving around in the wind.But that's not all... there's already a hole in the canopy fabric, the bag tore and the zipper came completely off.

Unfortunately, we had a rain storm which blew in & out in less than 10 minutes. There was not enough time for us to close the tent down. The tent metal assembly poles & frame are not strong to withstand even a light rain storm. The poles and frame bent beyond repair and one area broke entirely. Luckily I had some beach umbrella's to put out for our guests, since it was hot in the 90's & sun came out right after the rain.I would not buy again.

I had a friend help me do the bean bag drill and I feel we wasted alot of time for nothing. Play dodge ball. It is way more physically demanding and fun. Games aside... I didn't care for this book. On my own part I would have to say I have never read any of the author's other books and dont know much about them. If this is a template for the other's, I will not waste the time, let alone the money.

If they made Fred's character a bit smarter for the television series and made a few of the other characters just a tad more realistic (while still showing many hilariously eccentric qualities simultaneously) perhaps the series would be a bit better, but let's face it: Fred's home is the internet, not the television screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average at Best","review":"This Set is Mostly FOrgetable.Send One Your Love is a Classic but the Gems to Find Here are few&far in Between.Come Back as a Flower is a Good Song.but nothing Overall here is on Par with Songs In The Key Of Life.Stevie is a Great Genius but even a Genius has Duds and this one is it.Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just wish...","review":"Ok, this is a Masterwork.

Why did FASA comission this book as part of the Twilight series? I can't be more blunt! It dragged and the whole novel took a decent person in the guise of Russou Howell and turned him into a sadist.

The book does nothing to advance the Twilight of the Clans series, serving to bog you down in between books that actually are readable.The main character whose name is \\"Horse\\" (yes, Horse) is hardly believable, while his nemesis, Howell is needlessly sadistic and is almost clownish. He spends more time yelling and screaming, so that it is hard to understand why the allegely competant Clans would not have killed this idiot off. This book was so bad that I literally question how this man ever got this book published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemenly out of place...","review":"The book truely seems out of place in the twilight of the clans series. it is only when you read Falcon rising you understand it fully. it is a set up to show that the jade falcons treat their freebirths in an enlightened way compared ot other clans.

My feeling is that it was only stamped as part of the \\"Twilight\\" series in hopes that it would sell better, but it really didn't further the plot at all, develop characters there, etc. I might have been less disappointed had the book been published on its own...I also wouldn't have bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of tripe.","review":"I can't believe that people would actually buy this sorry excuse for a novel. What do you mean Robert Thurston is a good novelist? His style is plodding at best and at worst it's pompous and artificial. Michael Stackpole on the other hand is one of the best authors I have ever read and deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as literary giants such as Raymond E. Feist, Frank Herbert and so on. Now to the review: Why is Russou Howell such a sadist? Why are the suthors so anti-clan? Why oh why was nothing added to the Task Force Serpent story? Whatever you do don't buy this. This is trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most pointless BattleTech novel I have ever seen","review":"Robert Thurston is a good writer, so I suppose I'll have to forgive this poor excuse for a novel. He takes a strong and somewhat enigmatic character like Horse and \\"wastes\\" him a a confusing plot. He also \\"wastes\\" a good man like Russou Howell by turning him into a drunk sadist.

I think we sometimes forget that just because some clanners are genetically bred that they don't have feelings. In this book they do and you see just how hard they can be to deal with.

Robert Thurston keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"This book is awesome for one lacking battles. Sometimes it concentrates on how drunk Galaxy Commander Russou Howell can get. Although he has 2 poorly armed galaxies almost all Galaxy commanders only control 1 galaxy. I think the last battle was stupid though it was smart of howell to use horse. If I were Horse I would not know what to do. Horse helped get himself labeled dumb by choosing to attack the jade falcon forces but having like 20% accuracy and hardly doing anything. For an action less book it deserves a 5. for an action book a 1.8. for an overall book it should be 3.4 but I'll give it a 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wished I could give '0' stars","review":"I really liked Thurston's Jade Phoenix trilogy which gives us the major and most detailed description of Clan society in the btech universe.But 'Freebirth' is an absolute pain. It's chaotic, it makes no sense, it is full of logical mistakes, it's simply embarassing.You want facts? How's this:2 LAM's destroying 2 front class clan omnis pilotted by elite clan MW's...go dreamin'.A proven clan officer who goes whack, acting like Jim Carey, and flopping around like Lieutenant Harris in Police Academy?A solahma mechwarrior who's all of sudden competing like Natasha Kerensky herself (SCom Buhallin).Oh, dear...you gotta wonder who's been the freeborn editor of this novel. So if you wanna do yourself a favor: Don't read this book, even if you're a die-hard btech reader.

If you are into the Clans, even for completion's sake, you could skip this book and not be missing anything.Set about a year before the events of Operation Serpent's invasion of Clan space this story details Khan Pryde sending Aidan's old comrade Horse to the very same Huntress, for reasons we never do find out as nothing that occurs has any bearing whatsoever on later events as the Smoke Jaguars are destroyed. Actually, despite it's length this novel is in my opinion little more than an overly detailed prologue to 'Falcon Rising'.Basically, this entire book could have been written into another novel as a short outline of events to flesh out more of Star Colonel Howell's background...which was more or less done in 'Shadows of War'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"oh man, this book is terrible.The story does not further the time-line of the Battletech universe.All he does is summarize information about what Freebirth means, the Clan invasion, the Clans' traditions.The author of the book can't put together a coherent plot.It is like a bad soap opera.The characters' dialogues are often interrupted by petty, trivial information. It is not smooth.Some of the pages in the book is like a \\"Copy 'n Paste\\" of the first book in the Twilight series.The author goes on and on about the 'death' of Trent by Howell in the first 8 chapters. The worst part of the book is the \\"Circle of Kinship\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is it doing here?","review":"When I picked up this book I was eagerly awaiting to find out what was going to happen to Task Force Serpent. This book had no place in this series and should never have been written, although if it was a book on it's own no-one would buy it. It is by far the worst book in the series so far only just behind Starlord.

This was clearly a staff favorite as it was playing each time I visited the store. I was very familiar with Bossa Nova but had not heard of this duo. The rich mosaic of the live acoustic guitars, supporting percussion and of course Wanda and Roberto's amazing voices make for a thoroughly beautiful listening experience. You feel like they're in front of you in a cozy little venue in Brazil. Perfect for relaxing, a loungy get together, romance, you name it. This truly is old school Bossa Nova at its very best. If you enjoy Joao Gilberto, Jobim and the other masters don't even think twice, add it to your collection now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxed Brazilian Duo","review":"Acoustic guitar and soprano duos in Brazilian music are a winning combination. After listing to Luciana Souza singing respectively with guitarists, Romero Lubambo, Marco Pereira, and Walter Santos (her father), I felt there was too much guitar bravado and did not groove on her stylized jazz voice. Something was missing. I needed to hear this earlier album of Wanda Sá and Roberto Menescal. Sá desired simplicity and informality in this recording and the result is splendid. There is joy and happiness in her voice. Menescal's occasional singing applies harmonic accentuation and mellowness. It is as if listening to a jam in a corner of some studio, the artists entertaining themselves with great bossa nova tunes. The supporting percussion is unobtrusive. If you like your bossa nova relaxed and pure, this album will delight you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Wanda","review":"I love Wanda's voice and the rythm of all those bossas and a couple of boleros.You can perceive she is smiling when she sings. Glad that she is back. Robertois a master guitar player and composer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the editing?","review":"I must agree with Sandy S. that this was a poorly written book. The book needed thorough editing and the author needs to be reminded that good fiction writing consists of showing, not telling. Furthermore, it doesn't feel like a mystery if you know who the killer is early on in the book.I purchased this book because it covered a subject matter that I enjoy, but rarely find in fiction form. Unfortunately, although I think the author knows her ghost hunting, I think she forgot that the fun of a ghost story is in the ghosts. She had one or two creepy moments that I applauded her for, but I would have enjoyed more haunting. I realize that this might not depict a real or typical haunting, but this is fiction afterall.Overall, if you really want to read this, I would suggest trying to find a copy you didn't have to pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I read the same book?","review":"I hate to be the first person to give this book a negative review, but I thought it was reallllly badly written. The characters are all two dimensional, and the writer gives away the murderer early on in the book. Also, who edited this book? A woman named Elaine hires the heroine, but later in the book they refer to her as Sylvia, then back to Elaine. I found myself going back to the beginning trying to figure out who Sylvia was. She didn't exist. One reviewer states this book is written by a Mensan. She may be a genius, but she can't write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haunted!!!","review":"I agree with a previous reviewer, this was a poorly edited book.. Who the heck is Sylvia? That was so jaring, I read about one character who hired the protagonist, and then mid book the character's name changes. I could never get into the book after that. If the writer cannot keep up with the name of the characters in her book, and the book is only 181 pages, there is a problem. The subplot of the missing daughter was never clarified either. Did the daughter run away or was she kidnapped? Over all a very poorly written book, which is a shame, because the premise could have been excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"customer service was horric","review":"After never recieving the item all I recieved was the run around.

If you think this is old hat remember \\"There is nothing new to Selling\\" maybe new ways to do old things and new names for old methods.

From his poor upbringing in Detroit to having to become a car salesman to feed his family because he couldnt do anything else.

Maybe 12 chapters into the book before the word \\"computers\\" is mentioned. Not very helpful for someone who wants to learn sales today. And incorrectly titled; I did not learn how to sell anything to anybody. Most of the book emphasized how to sell cars - in a bygone era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste","review":"This book was such a waste of money and time spent reading it. Unless you are in the car sales business, this book will not do you any good. The title of the book in my opinion is decieving. The advice is basic and again it only pertains to an individual who sells cars. Not to mention, the author toots his own horn too much throughout the book. He spends so much time talking about his greatness at sales. Total turn-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe he was once a good salesman...","review":"He talks about how great he was and for good reason, he's proud. I don't suggest the book however for anyone selling anything other than knives, direct TV in Best Buy, used cars, etc.He talks soo negatively about customers and basically says to pretend to like people and pretend to care. The bottom line is that is no way to sell if you sell something where the customers know what they are doing. If you are in pharmaceutical, medical equipment, college textbook, etc. sales (or anything where the buyer knows more about your product than you do), following this book could ruin your career.Stop Telling, Start Selling a lot better book and shows how to do things the right way."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Sell Anything to Anybody","review":"I never understood properly what marketing is all about; until I read this book.I run a small business and this book has shown me what it takes to make sales happen, and the reason why my sales are so low right now.This book show's you how to do exactly what it says on on the cover \\"How to Sell Anything to Anybody\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balanced, well-written account.","review":"An interesting history of Japan that covers the development of Japanese society, thought and politics from before Western contact up to, and through, World War II. This book is not a history of the battles that Japan fought, but an analysis of the events leading up to WWII and beyond. It was confusing at times especially in the time period of the early 1930's to understand who was doing what to whom and why. The seemingly ambiguous political structure made it difficult to determine who held power. A well balanced account of the war from all sides.

I would reccomend this...and actually, i wished that he would write another one like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect King Primer","review":"This novel, or novella is an excellent introduction to Stephen King. It stays pretty true to Silver Bullet the movie based on it, or it was based on I forget which came first in this case. The book is quite short, so those that criticize King of having a propensity of being a ilttle verboise at times have no ammo in this case. Yet every word is vintage King, his language and style shines through clearly in this tale abaout a werewolve terrorizing the typical small town. I recommend this book as an introduction to King because its short and I find it has everything that has become his trademark over his literary career, just in little less quantity than some of his other works. Cycle Of The Werewolf I would say is the appetizer to whet the readers' appetite for Mr. King's literary smorgasboard of fiction. As an added bonus there are beautiful black and white and colour illustrations throughout story by Berni Wrightson."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the Great Stephen King???","review":"In days past, Stephen King was perhaps the most talented and prolific horror writer in history. That began to erode with the release on the fantasy Dark Tower series. This 'book' (more of a pamphlet) is perhaps the most overpriced and underwritten item yet. It is a very short, large print paperback with a 12th grade story and is super overpriced. Save your money until the crowning of a new King."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"MR. King was definitely off his game on this one. i like short stories, but this book was nearly childlike in its composition."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNIMPRESSED","review":"I've read almost all of King's books, and I find this one to be predictable, boring, and - if I may - not of the same caliber as others such as Christine, IT, and Cujo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story With Good Illustrations","review":"I have enjoyed most of Stephen Kings past books, except for Carrrie, Pet Semetary, and some others. I'm not much of a horror fan, but I still enjoy some Stephen King. This was one of the best. The characters are interesting, especially Marty, who is in a wheelchair. Not many heroes in horror stories are in wheelchairs. He is a brave character, despite his disability. Anyway, the illustrations were great, and the details, like every chapter is a one month, and named after a month, and has a picture with details from the month (For Example, a picture of leaves scattered all over a graveyard in October). Add a great story, more pictures, you have a great story, despite how short it is. The idenity of the werewolf is surprising, though you can figure it out early. But I won't spoil it. I recommend it. One star taken off for shortness. It ended too early."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Taste of the Werewolf Myth","review":"Much like an adult picture book, you can read this Stephen King offering in one sitting. The illustrations are great, but the story is a bit lacking. Anyway, gives you a taste of the werewolf myth, complete with the gore and savagery associated with the creature. A good diversion for a day or two. A better book, actually a complete novel, on the werewolf theme is Adam Pfeffer's \\"Kolak of the Werebeasts.\\" That, at least, is a much deeper story that explores the trials and tribulations of transforming into a beast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Best, But...","review":"Although this is one of King's less ingenious novels, it is still entertaining. This novel is proof of King's love for old horror stories, especially the grotesque horror comics like \\"Tales from the Crypt\\" etc. Along with the artwork that is peppered through the book, King shows his loyalty to this genre of horror. I would not call this novel great, but I would call it fun, enjoyable to read, and still one of my favorites.I would say the same about the horror comics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I'm a big fan of Steven King novels, but this is not at all up to his usual standards.

With Cycle, King has deviated from convention and adopted a unique approach to the telling of the lycanthrope's tale: the werewolf in question did not come about as a result of the bite of a werewolf, but had simply....happened, there being no reason for it. In typical style, King has also not shied from using the most gruesome and horrendous of descriptions and scenarios in writing Cycle, and the hero comes in the most unlikely form of a crippled 10-year old. Cycle makes for a most enjoyable and thrilling read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice pictures","review":"The story is good, but the reason you want to buy this instead of any other King-book, is bacuse of the pictures.

I just received the book today and have finished reading it. I don't even remotely think that it was worth the money I spent on it. The book is 12 chapters long, each chapter labeled with a month of the year. The book is also illustrated. These things are not typical of Mr. King's works and do add something interesting and unusual to the book. However, out of the 128 pages, only 54 of them have story related text. After taking the 75 minutes to finish the book, I was left with a great sense of disappointment. My recurring thought was, \\"That's it?! \\" The book is a far cry from Mr. King's best work, regardless of its length. If you want to read it, I suggest you borrow it from the library. Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"When I got done with this book I thought Stephen King had decided he wanted to write a children's book.

Also the reason its not on the soundtrack is probably due to the bands request. They are notorious for turning away from soundtracks, i was shocked when i heard they were in this movie.

Given that many of the tracks appeared to be very short, I thought this album was meant to be played as one long continuous piece, but that is not the case. Most of the short tracks are just random clips of ambient music and sound. A few of the tracks have vocals, but they are not very good. Many of the album tracks give you the same \\"empty\\" feeling that you have throughout the movie, only you aren't watching the movie, so it's not as easy to get into. Save some money.

Great album, great band, period. And no, if Limp Bizkit is your definition of \\"metal\\", then don't buy this album. This is metal without image, where what you hear takes center stage.

I first saw the filmclip for Fazer years ago in 94 and searched for anything \\"Quicksand\\" I could find. I bought Slip - and thoroughly dug it - and waited patiently for Manic to come out. I was stoked with ALL of the songs on Manic and I'd heard there was alot of tension between band members when they recorded, which I reckon comes across on the album. The song arrangements, the different tempos and the slightly sharper production quality to Manic Compression make it a different album compared to Slip for sure, but it's still an excellent Quicksand album. Don't let \\"Slip-heavy\\" fans put you off this disc - if you like intelligent, heavy, tight and rythmic music from talented musicians, GET THIS."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 years!!!!!!","review":"I thought I'd right a review now being 10 years after this CD was released (WOW has it been that long!?)

I enjoy Cray's previous albums with a horn section, but I have to say when it's just him and his band pared down, his voice and guitar playing are even more compelling. You really believe what he is singing about, he has so much conviction in his voice it's scary!

After that just clip on the motion detector. And one last step. Turn the can upside down or lay flat. See, inside the stay away of sscat can refills there is a tube that goes to the bottom Of the can and this picks up the liquid in the can. The air duster cans don't have this tube inside so its necessary to turn the can and sensor upside down or on its side. This way no need to buy 12.00-15.00 dollar refills.

However, I just wasted my money because the refill canister, upon putting the top on the can, just releases the air in a constant hiss, which it isn't supposed to do, and it can't be returned. So, it is just a waste of money. Others have run into this problem with the refill also. I guess since it is not returnable they just send out defective canisters. No quality control.

I will say that it was a great workout and met my expectations. The reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because of the format. In her previous dvd she would teach a step and then you'd do the routine and after each new move you learned you would put them all together....With this workout she teaches all the steps in the beginning and at the end you put everything together. While I am not saying the moves were difficult, it;s hard to remember which moves come next, especially at such a fast pace. I found myself thrown off at times trying when doing the entire routine trying to remember which step should follow the previous. Had the instructional followed the same format as the previous dvd, this would have been a really good video."},{"rating":"2","title":"How About Some Flatbread With Some Dip?","review":"These Kamut Sesame Flatbreads are delicious, they're great with soup or just to have as a snack withspread or cream cheese.

Oftentimes, examples of English grammar are given, only for the next passage to say \\"in French this isn't important.\\" The book ends up seeming like a self-indulgent exercise rather than a useful tool to teach yourself French grammar.

I even had someone who speaks spanish borrow this book of the french language and it helped her despite that spanish and french are not entirely the same language despite that they derive from Latin. She ended up getting the Spanish version herself. For a quick refernce I definitely would recommend this book for someone if they were in a pinch."},{"rating":"2","title":"great tool","review":"While I haven't gotten really far into this book, I've so far found it to be amazingly helpful for trying to unlock the mysteries of why the French language can seem so convoluted at times. What this book does is to review English language grammar rules for those of us who have forgotten much of them, and then it compares side by side the same rules as they apply to French. It makes it so much simpler to understand than just throwing rules at you and telling you to remember them just because. I took this book to my beginning/intermediate French language class and the teacher said she was going to order a copy for herself! I think that speaks volumes! I think anyone who is serious about speaking French well and truly understanding it will benefit a lot from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"good additional resource","review":"I teach French and have many resource books as aids.

The book offers very little in the way of insight, description, and the impact of these wonderful toys had during the 60's. Coupled with poor black and white pictures which were mis-labled, mis-positioned, or just wrong, the book gives no benefit outside of the casual curiosity seeker. While the title specifically states Spy Toys \\"A Historical History and Price Guide\\", there was enough other things such as records, army toys, books, glassware, and current Toys R Us toys which obviously did not belong. For the advid collector or the neophite starting a collection, this book offers little interest, you'll get better information and pictures off the descriptions on E-bay."},{"rating":"1","title":"1/2 good","review":"I purchased 2 of these bars for my truck and with barely any use over a couple of months, one spring flew out during normal ratcheting rendering it useless.

At times it almost gets to be funny but at no point, i repeat, at no point is it ever actually funny. This is a waste of a good hour and a half of your life. Don't rent it, try something else instead. The story is infantile, the direction pitiful and the acting is piss poor.

I'm sure this particular director can do better and the less people who see this movie the better for him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"8 Heads, Not 1 Laugh","review":"This should have been very funny. This should have been \\"Weekend at Bernie's\\" with a real edge. Instead, this worse than those 1960's live action Disney movies with Dean Jones or Sandy Duncan or better yet- a WB sitcom. The basic story is silly enough, but there is not one laugh in this whole film. The cast tries much too hard to wring a smile out of the material, but the writer resorts to trotting out clicheed old characters like the grandma who smokes and cusses and the two really dumb mob guys. Considering the talent involved, this is one of the worst films of all time. On a side note, if you are from Mexico, do not watch this unless you are looking to be offended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some kind of bad.","review":"This film is like nails on a blackboard. Not one smart thing about it. It was marketed as a dark comedy along the lines of \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" but it's more on the level of \\"Private Resort.\\" Grindingly unfunny."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Zany Underrated Comedy","review":"This movie received a lot of grief for its total uninhibited irreverence. But if its irreverence doesn't offend you, you can find it a quite pleasing little comic gem. It's about all the misadventures of an American student visiting Mexico when his duffel bag accidently gets switched with another that was sent to verify a mob hit. Confusion and intrigue reign supreme as both parties desperately scramble to undo the mix-up. If you like this kind of comedy watch and enjoy. But if you find it cruelly offensive, don't say I didn't warn you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"I saw this movie on tv, then rented it. I love it! It is no masterpiece, but it is a very refreshing change of pace for a movie! David Spade is awesome, and so is the rest of the cast!

Off-the-wall and absolutely hailarious! 8.5 out of 10!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Entertaining","review":"I ran across it on cable and watched it, for lack of anything better to do at the time. Amazingly, I found it absolutely hysterical, laughing so hard, I could hardly breathe! It showcases Pesci's overlooked and under- appreciated comic abilities. If you liked him in My Cousin Vinny, you'll certainly get a kick out of this one. It might be a bit too slap-sticky at times for some people, but it is definitely worth adding to your collection. I will be looking forward to it's eventual release on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Comedy","review":"8 Heads in A Duffel Bag is definitely not your average comedy, but i think its one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The plot is a little odd, and at some points slightly weak, but overall it presents a very comical situation. Joe Pesci is fantastic as usual in his role as a retiring mobster. David Spade, although he plays a relatively small role, is also hillarious. I highly recomend this movie, if you haven't seen it yet you're missing out big time."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bunch of silly actors","review":"I don't know, maybe I just wasn't in the \\"right mood\\" for this movie But the biggest problem with this comedy was actually quite simple: it just wasn't funny.

Boy, was I wrong. The packaging is amazingly classy and beautiful. That must be what I paid for. The CD instructions give me choices- I can go to Menual Instructions, Regesteration, or Install - so the technical writers creating the CD didn't proofread or let an English speaker test their product.But the real problem, the one that forces me to pack the item back up in the pretty box, is the pixelation - the resolution SUCKS, absolutely SUCKS. This product completely fails in its main objective.

The screen is a tad on the low resolution side, as such, most pictures require a little tweaking to make them view properly. The software worked flawless on the MAC and PC.

After spending an hour choosing and editing photos using the TAO software I was hugely disappointed at the very poor display quality. You can easily see each individual pixel in the display, and you can't make out more then 60% of the pictures I transfered to the keychain. Its even worse that the company preloads this device with pictures perfectly optimized for the display to give you a false sense of hope that your pictures may look ok. This would be a fun toy for maybe $15 dollars but this currently is huge rip off and a poor quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"The product image uses a simulated picture.

The size, the ease of syncing photos with your device (only downside is once you load a photo, you cant change the order of the pictures). The worst part of this, is the quality of the display, its not what you see on the website. This is very pixilated. You will barely make out the photos (and I use a 6 megapixel camera). DO NOT BUY!

I don't usually write reviews but I felt obligated to since I feel people shouldn't waste money and time to return.

I tried the resizing and nothing helped (have been working with digital pictures for the past 7 years...7,000+ pictures now). The only thing that did look decent was a full face shot with nothing else but the face (even that wasn't that great but at least viewable). Don't buy if you have any sense of enjoying a decent picture. Also was alot bulkier that I expected - a bit much for carrying around on a keychain. Gave 2 stars for the ease of the software. 1 star for picture quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent novelty item","review":"Bought 3 of them, 2 were bright and 1 was dark. I talked to support at TAO and they are replacing the dark one. The difference in the bright and dark was immense and the brightness really makes a difference in viewing. OK, the picture quality could be better BUT for the novel idea the price really isn't all that bad (I don't think anyway...). I would have loved to pass out digital picture frames as gifts, but since those are hard to find at under $200 each, $43 each for the concept will do. (I should mention that these are for people who take tons of digital pictures and enjoy novel things...) These come in a nice gift box too..."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"Picture quality is so BAD the item should be sold for $5 or $10 bucks. Great idea but techonogy is poor.

I have a PowerBook G4 which means a mini CD cannot be used. When I went to the Tao Electronics website, there was no sign of downloadable Mac drivers. The people who sold me this device took it upon themselves to send me the Windows drivers on full-sized CDs, so they are not the problem, in spite of themselves. The problem here lies squarely with the absence of customer support from Tao Electronics. Why can't their website just include every set of drivers for every single thing they have ever manufactured ever in the history of ever? What prevents them from doing this? Mumble mutter. As of this writing, I have a still-dormant keychain, and no way of making it work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this","review":"Junk.

When I ran it the first time the pictures on the key chain overlapped so I deleted them and tried again. This time the software hung and I had to force it to quit.

Having said that, it is nice to have 50+ photos on a device that I can throw in my purse. Because I am familiar with everything I've loaded, I can still enjoy the fond memories associated with the photos, even though the resolution is adequate, at best. Software is easy to use. Probably overpriced at $50. If it had cost 1/2 that amount I wouldn't feel like complaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and Cheaply made","review":"I was really excited when I discovered this digital photo keychain by Tao. I bought one for my cousin as a gift and bought an extra one for myself. For 50 bucks a pop I was expecting something pretty high quality, but I am disappointed to find that the image quality is very poor. Even if you do crop the photos to fit the screen the images appear striated and pixelated. Since I know that the cost of disk memory is getting pretty cheap, and cost of a small LCD screen like this one cannot be that high, I feel like I've been ripped off. If I had known what I was getting, I wouldn't have paid more than $20."},{"rating":"2","title":"digital pic key chain","review":"The key chain itself,seems wonderful and is just what any granparent would want for showing off the kids pics.

The display is definitely a little fuzzy, as I've seen indicated in other reviews. That was never really my biggest concern, since my expectations in this price range were low. It's just the inconvenient nature of loading the photos and keeping in charged that is kind of a pain.This is ok as a novelty item, but it will end up in your \\"junk drawer\\" sooner, rather than later. Put the money into a decent storage iPod or other music player and call it a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"digital keychain scores a hit","review":"The first one I got from Amazon wouldn't hold a charge, but they sent a replacement within a couple of days with no hassle or grief! YAY AMAZON111The unit does exactly what it is supposed to do, and does so with reasonable clarity.

It is by far my favorite film of the year, or many years for that matter. I am a huge movie tie in novelization addict, and since Conquest is sort of the Rise of the original film series, I had to track down a copy of the novelization.I have always enjoyed reading John Jakes. I first became aware of him at a young age when I read his Brak the Barbarian novels. Conan ripoffs to be sure, but I loved them at 12 or 13 and devoured them. Later on I read The Bastard, North and South, some of his SF, and even his early sleazy pulps. I liked them all. He has a terrific readable style, good tight descriptions, and a great sense of pacing. He would make a good screenwriter.Overall, one of the better novelizations I have read. I wish he had done a little better with the MacDonald character, but Jakes really captured the dark brooding Orwellian feel of the movie, and the action sequences are exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy 8s - You have to be Crazy not to own this game!","review":"Remember the great games of crazy 8s you played as a kid?

I will second his opinion and say that this is absolutely the worst book I've ever read. My suggestion to Robert Kaye is to get an editor to rewrite the book. The book is full of incomplete sentences, misspelled words, and tangents that don't make any sense. His notation and theory also need considerable work. For example, at one point he writes a Db major chord with both flats and sharps which only helps to further confuse the reader. I'm not a stickler for notation; I could look past the notation errors if only the actual text made sense. He also has graphics, quotes, and makes connections between unrelated topics that make the reader wonder if the author has gone mad.

I had read about Greg Sage and the Wipers before, but this is the only album of theirs I have managed to track down and buy. I hear it's not the best one, but if it's any indication of the band's music, they are easily better than the majority of the grunge bands they unfluenced. The main problem with this is that too many of the songs sound alike, especially during the first half of the disc. But that doesn't mean the songwriting is bad. And Sage's guitar playing (sort of a grungy Tom Verlaine is the best way I can put it--except Sage can sing) is particularly amazing. If you buy this, you'll definitely be impressed by the peek at this chronically underrated (or unknown to be more specific) band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watched the first part on TV . . .WOW had to see the 2nd part","review":"My husband and I watched the first part of this on TV but something came up and we missed the 2nd part.

Ramsay is much more toned down and less over-the-top in KN and this show than in Hell's Kitchen. If Hell's Kitchen been your only experience with Ramsay, where I find him insufferable and unwatchable, this is different. There he's just a big insulting jerk, and there are enough of those out there in the world: I don't want to watch them on TV in my spare time....In this show he's still blunt and curses a bit which is just how he speaks, but here it's entertaining and pretty hilarious at times; he also really wants to help the hotel owners succeed, and you can learn a bit about the business, one reason I also loved KN. I do wish he would go back to the hotels months later to see if his advice has been followed and to see what happened like he does in KN; would make it even more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Kitchen Nightmares....& Ramsay's Abrasive Style","review":"First of all, I must say that Mr. Ramsay would have had a stellar career in the military as a drill sergeant! His abrasive style may not be to everybody's liking, but the man get's things done. SO, if you liked Ramsay in his other series like Hell's Kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares, then you will no doubt love Hotel Hell. It's almost like a carbon copy of Kitchen Nightmares, but it's been enjoyable to me. I'm a fan, and I like how he does not take any BS. He does curse an awful lot, but it's usually bleeped out. Ramsay is like the business consultant from hell--he won't kiss up to you or coddle you. He's there to get these business owners to really take a hard look at why their business is failing...and themselves too. It's voyeuristic fun at it's best...at least if you have a thick skin and enjoy watching these business owners squirm."},{"rating":"1","title":"arse","review":"alright I like Chrome a lot, but this stuff hit the gorgonzola a bit too hard.

More of a \\"rock record\\" than anything before or since, but is no less of a great Catherine Wheel record because of it.

An Irish friend whose musical tastes I generally shared recommended I seek it out. Overall, I was pretty disappointed with it - it was a bit too alternative/metal for me. But like many of the other reviewers here, I liked 'Heal' well enough, and I still think \\"Judy's Staring At The Sun\\" is one of the best songs on ANY release from the 90's. In terms of having a perfect mesh of lyrics, melody and song construction, I'd put it right behind \\"Losing My Religion\\". Not that the two songs share any other similarity other than they are, IMO, just about perfect (funny, I didn't like a whole lot of 'Out of Time' either). Soon as I get around to buying a burner, I'll copy Judy and Heal and then sell Happy Days to my local used CD shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more karate scenes in the dark","review":"In this album the band members appear more confident in their musicianship. It's like those TV series that start out with very poor lighting during the fight scenes, but then turn up the lights when they no longer have to get a 170-pound stuntwoman to stand in for Sarah Michelle Gellar. This is the album in which they turn up the lights and allow each bandmember to proudly lay his own crisp, clear track. My first Wheel album--and still my favorite for outdoor activities, Happy Days was the perfect starter for me. I might not have become such an ardent Wheel fan had my first exposure been Ferment. And since this lengthy album has absolutely no filler songs, it is truly a great value. Listen to it twice before you come back to Amazon to share your review."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not about prisons but ok book","review":"This book had ups and downs.

As this horse Alcatraz is a horse who had been bread to race escapes his masters home and gets used to freedom. His escape comes at a terrible price though as he becomes known as a murderous beast and Marianne the new ranch owner wants him killed, but Alcatraz is a smart, tough an seems to be a magical horse, able to mystify his hunters that are unable to catch him.

This book presents ashtanga in such a dull mechanised way, one wonders why anyone ever took the practice up. Full of insipid step-by-step pictures that completely miss the spirit of ashtanga. Who exactly is this book aimed at? There is not enough info for a beginner and there is no 'heart' for the more experienced yogi. The photos are neither artistic nor particularly useful. Shame really, as John Scott was the first westener to draw the visual sequence of the ashtanga primary series in a sort of pictogram form. Why was that not included in the book, and instead we got those awful close ups!If you are looking for a really good ashtanga book that is about the spirit of the practice and is also practical to actually use get David Swensons, 'Ashtanga Yoga'.

However the maximum hole/cutout that the 400J can do is 7 1/2\\", so it is not useful to me. I give it two stars so you'll read this and not make the same mistake that I did. Look like the 200J may be the correct product for larger holes. NOTE: I'm not an expert and it seems the terms \\"hole\\" and \\"cutout\\" are used somewhat interchangeably; additional reading seems to imply that \\"hole\\" is used when you want to remove material from the inside of the circle and \\"cutout\\" is used when you want to remove material from the outside of the circle.

I challenge you to find any slot car set that you can just squeeze full throttle without coming off the turns. It is part of the racing experience. These little bad boys have amazing speed and you have to adjust your speed accordingly on corners or yes you will fly off. If my 7 year old can master this art and still beat me in races then I think anyone can do it. Just like a real race, jam that throttle in the straights and get off it in the corners and you will have the time of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cars never stay on track","review":"We tried this out for a few hours.

It uses a ton of fuel. This is an issue when the power is out and gas is not readily available.

The handle is underbuilt for the size of this thing and should have been made to lift from both sides not just the right side. It has easily bent and now needs to be fixed. Changing the oil is a bit tricky.From a power standpoint it is awesome. I have yet to overpower it even when connected to the house. During the last ice storm even the neighbors were plugged into it.

It has more storage than necessary and I now wish I had chosen the smaller version (which would be much more suitable for any mechanical trades basic set of hand tools). This bag is HEAVY and LARGE. The latter which meant for me adding more tools than I need to fill up the cavernous interior. Naturally making it even more hefty. If you are a plumber or electrician and work for someone who supplies the big tools opt for the smaller version, I believe it will suit you just fine (hammer and hacksaw fit the xl but I'm not sure about small version). Once again Veto tool bags are the highest quality in my opinion and I wouldn't settle for less (only when it comes to weight)."},{"rating":"2","title":"top notch.","review":"this bag is well worth the price. it holds a boat load of hand tools and they all stay put! it wont hold small power tools like some of the other bags, but who shows up to work with one bag? they need to speed up the process of making the two other size bags so i can buy them as well! a top notch \\"over built\\" product! -ian"},{"rating":"2","title":"VETO PRO PAC XL","review":"I've only had this bag for two months and so far I can say Im very happy with it. As an electrician for twenty years, I wish I would have found this item sooner. After years of using cheap bags that offer minimal tool organization, this bag is excellent if you appreciate being able to find the tool you need without having to rummage through everything to find it, I also enjoy the fact that with a quick lookover, I know if I have all of my tools before leaving a project. The XL might be slightly larger than I would've needed, but the added space does come in handy. Even with all of my hand tools in place, there is room to toss in a drill, heat gun, etc. on top. The overall construction seems to be very durable. The bag is heavy, but I think its worth the price for something that works very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loops galore!","review":"Lots of loops for the handyman with loads of screwdrivers, pliers, etc. Well built--and therefore quite heavy when fully filled.

But I returned mine. The shipping weight alone should have tripped a circuit in my brain - 8 lbs! This is a heavy bag. If all you do is lug this from the tailgate to the jobsite - say 30 to 50 ft - you'll love it. It'll outlast you. But I work in NYC apartments and haul a lot of what I have to use to the site - and up many stairs. Plus, the design of this bag begs to be loaded with all the tools you have - even the ones you don't need or use anymore. When it arrived, I had an epiphany...I need 3 or 4 bags (lighter bags) loaded with specific tools for specific jobs - take what I need, leave the rest. If it fits your style of work I'm sure you wouldn't be dissatisfied with the Veto bag - but it wasn't for me. I wish the company made a bag that was to a 1/3 the size/weight. I'd keep that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Murse (man purse :)","review":"I like to have my tools organized such that I don't have to look for them. It is very well made and will probably last a lifetime for my use (weekend warrior).This tool bag has about a billion pockets so everything has its place now. One minor thing is that most the pockets are deep so smaller things are limited to being in the front.It would even be better if one side at least accommodated a power driver - my deWalt driver does not fit in the bag. Not a huge deal because very rarely does one bag hold all my stuff.The covers fold over and snap so that they stay. That's a nice thought but it takes a bit of time to find the snaps - heavy duty Velcro would have done better, I think.The large bag is heavy. Loaded up with tools, it is really heavy.Not perfect but a nice bag, all in all. Certainly better than my other ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best tool bag I have ever owned","review":"Wow, Thank you Veto for designing an awesome product.

I was given some of his greatest hits CDs, and of course I had several vinyl albums of his when I was younger, but this is the first one I deliberately went out to purchase because I loved the songs \\"Believe,\\" \\"Belfast,\\" and \\"Blessed.\\" I love the way some songs sort of blend into others, but not necessarily because they are on the next track. \\"Believe\\" and \\"Belfast\\" blend in together, and in many ways fit together in sense and feel as well as the message.Elton John has never been one for the deep, penetrating messages in his songs in such a way that they overpower the music which is toe-tapping fun. But in many ways, this CD seems like a change. The songs all seem to have a deeper meaning, while remaining very much in Elton John's musical style. There seems more care given to what the lyrics say and how they say it, it seems to me.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Made From England","review":"While Elton John has made some of the most brilliant records of all time, there have been some hidden gems that've been made that a lot of people have really forgotten about. While Elton was riding high on the success of The Lion King, he released Made In England, which you can only find available for downloading off the internet, and not in the record stores. This 1995 Elton John album, brings back the feeling of his signature 70's style, through the perfectional mix of orchestral and rock styles. The album includes a lot of great songs from his #1 Adult Contemporary hit Believe, Blessed, the upbeat title track Made In England, and great simplistic songs like the elequent House, and the Rock driven Pain. I absolutely love this record. This is the very first Elton John album I've ever purchased. I really recommend this as a great gem to your music collection.Songs: A-Price: AOverall: A 1/2-"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT Album","review":"If you enjoy Elton John's work of the early to mid 1990's Made In England will keep you smiling. No, it's not Madman Across The Water, but unlike some of Elton's music during the mid 1980's, there's a seriousness to this album that's refreshing. It appears Elton placed some emphasis on making a great album rather than just creating some good singles combined with filler songs.The title track and Lies are fun and rockin' while Man has a tilt towards the gospely type songs E.J. excells with. Please, is catchy pop at it's best and I was disappointed it never bacame a single. It certainly would have been an automatic hit. In other areas, E.J. doesn't quite hit the mark as in the somewhat sappy, Blessed.This was Elton John's best work in years up to that point. In my opinion, it's not the masterpiece of some of his 1970's albums but it ranks up there with his creative and throughly enjoyable albums of late such as Songs From The West Coast and The Captain & The Kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"Okay okay. So it's not dog awful. But it's close to being. How can you give this 5 stars?, This is nothing compared to the great classic albums like 'Honky Chateau', 'Tumbleweed Connection', 'Goodbye yellow brick road', and 'Captain fantastic'. This is just Adult Contemporary drivel that gets so undeservedly over-rated. If you want something to bore you to tears this is it. Songs from the West Coast was much better, though not as good as the afforementioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good things always come to an end","review":"Elton is a great artist, a real one.

It was he who first traveled the road followed by Phil Collins, Sting and like minded soft rock mush heads. If you're a fan of the genre, you have doubtless heard him, and this album is as fine as any in his catalogue. Perfect for listening with your lover on quiet summer nights. Especially notable are \`Pain', Made In England' and \`Latitude'. It's a must have album for his fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a great album!","review":"Probably the 2nd best album of Elton John of 90s (after \\"The One\\").My favorite tracks here are Cold,Please,Latitude and Believe.I especially like the calm mood of this album.Even the rockers like Pain sound rather mildly. Actually,Cold is one of my favorite EJ songs ever. When you are listening to the song it really makes you think of something...Well,you MUST listen to it yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Masterpiece","review":"I have heard a considerable portion of Elton John's enormous back catalog, and as an experienced EJ listener I can say without a doubt that Made In England, despite being a recent effort, is one of Elton's very best albums. In fact, it is my favorite besides Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (surpassing my previous runner-up, Honky Choteau). Okay, so what makes it so good? Well, first off this is BY FAR Bernie Taupin's best set of lyrics ever. They are good, fairly deep, and occasionally funny. Elton is not slouch on the album either, of course. He turns in a good performance on the piano and his usual stellar vocals. Also good are the orchestral arrangements (reminiscent of early Elton John albums) and Davey Johnstone's guitar work. Sure, he's not Steve Vai (and you don't have to be, if you're in Elton John's backing band), but he can play. The best songs include Believe, Made In England, House, Pain, and the beautiful Belfast. A must own for any EJ fan, in fact get it early."},{"rating":"2","title":"So wonderful and fresh.","review":"This album was breathtaking. Its songs were very touching and humble.

WRONG.This particular Panasonic model not only has lousy picture quality and no remote, but there are no fast forward or fast rewind functions other than skipping all the way ahead or all the way back to the beginnings of scenes. I'm a film buff, so I like to be able to back up two or three seconds to check out that explosion in fps detail, or to move forward or backward at 2X or 4X or 8X, etc. Plus, if you extend the adjustable screen forward as shown in most illustrations, you cannot see or reach the control buttons without moving it out of your way.I'm no video product engineer, but I hope my impression of the VERY inadequate picture quality and overall poor design of this player makes you think twice.

In my case my first CD-Rom from Kaplan broke two thirds of the way through the math section, forcing me to void all of my hard work and also lose valuable study time. However I called customer service and they gladly sent me out another CD. The big problem came when this CAT error came up as I was using the replacement CD. The tech support guy informed me that all I could do was send back the CD to get a refund. However I would like to know who is going to refund my money for the GRE when I score poorly due to these circumstances.

When I first used the CD I could not even attempt the analytical section but after using this book I scored a 670 on the analytical section of the exam. I found that after using the book and cd I doubled my scores when compared to the initial diagnostic.

Verbal was not as helpful, I scored a 660 verbal on the Kaplan pretest, studied all the words in the book, and scored a 660 on my real GRE.

Aside from the editing problems, my primary complaint with with the CD-ROM.

My family and I hoped this book would shed light on perhaps a gentler time, with a return to \\"the basics.\\" William Turner has written a wonderful account of his life growing up on the Chesapeake Bay in the 40's and '50s. The stories are entertaining, with laughs, as well as gasps, as well as tears. My sons, ages 10 and 6, beg me to retell his stories on our drives to our new Eastern Shore retreat home. From bear sightings to pig butchering to duck hunting adventures to sinking boats in the dead of winter, William Turner paints vivid images in our minds of life on the Chesapeake Bay during a time of neighborly help and family closeness. He is an artist, and shares his sketches in this book as well, which further brings home the true meaning of his stories. This is a treasure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Step Back in Time","review":"This book is a warm, personal look at a time and places on the Bay that are forever lost to most of us. It is such a pleasure to meet characters and hear about practices and community living of a by-gone era. I'm biased--I love the Bay. And while this book satisfies my interest in learning more about life on the Chesapeake, it's also a wonderful tale of an American boy's life in a rich and beautiful setting. It's a great bedside book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this CD","review":"If you are looking for the original movie soundtrack of piano music, this is not it.

Back when country wasn't cool, Miller wrote and performed songs that crossed the lines between country and pop. Many of his songs are timeless icons of our society and many others have become clasics when performed by other people -- \\"Little Green Apples\\" and \\"The Last Word in Lonesome is Me\\".The collection spans the full spectrum of his recording life from some early takes through the Broadway musical \\"Big River\\".If the music wasn't enough (and it is), the included booklet is full of great photographs, bio information, and song notes.Roger Miller was a true original and this collection captures his spirit well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish There Was More...","review":"The official editorial reviewer here calls Roger \\"a novelty act\\", while another reviewer commented that Roger's music would have you picking your jaw up off the floor if (a) you had a sense of humor, and (b) you had a tender heart. I agree with the second reviewer.Roger Miller had a sense of humor and a tender heart, and the marriage of the two constituted his genius... and he was indeed a genius. This box set is an excellent introduction to Roger's genius; tragically, it is also a poignant finale, for out of the entire Roger Miller catalog, this is the most comprehensive collection out there... you won't find much available that isn't in this collection, and that's a shame, 'cause there was so much more... so very much more.State Trooper: \\"Sir, can I see your driver's license?\\"Roger Miller: \\"Sure!

Listen to the words of \\"Little Green Apples\\"; you won't find a better love song. He's gone now, so his memory is diminishing some. I recommend snapping up a copy of this collection, not only because its entertaining, but for you folks just starting down this road, it's a guide on taking complicated subjects and turning them into easily understandable packages. Roger Miller was also one heck'uv'a guitarist too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I could have met him!","review":"This is an excellent set. High quality sound and a wide range of Roger Miller music. I remember my older sisters and brothers listening to Roger Miller a lot when I was a kid. The first song I ever memorized was \\"King of the Road\\".I have enjoyed introducing my young boys to Roger Miller when riding in my car. Their favorite songs are \\"Boing, Boing 707\\" and the one with the big black birds descending from the sky. \\"One dyin' and a buryin' is a song I had never heard before, and I have really enjoyed it.Also, his \\"suicide\\" song.

While Brownies to Die For! has a more captivating title, and is hardbound, I'm a little wary of the photos, which I feel are very amateur for a published book, especially one by a food writer and recipe developer.

No idea why I bought it (except that I thought Lonely Planet put out decent guides), but this book was of far less value than the freebee tourist bureau handouts that one finds along the way. I'm absolutely certain that the authors did not visit any of the locations, as they provide no insights at all into the destinations, and their recommendations seemed outdated and sketchy at best.

Superficially a courtroom whodunnit, it is set in a Shirley Jackson Lottery kind of community, populated by well drawn characters who shift in roles and take on new dimensions as we come to know them better and better. It is artfully plotted, so that the perspective shift wrought by quiet revelations of the last pages requires the reader to thumb back through the volume to find out how this all really came about. But, under the tale of murder, investigation and trial, the author presents an intelligent examination of ethnic identities and human values. This is a first- rate book, rich in thought and emotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting but tendentious novel/mystery","review":"This novel did best with the witty dialogue and the fast sweep of the plotline. What I found most irritating were the small narcicisstic tics. How many times did we have to be told that our two strong, brave Jewish heroines had strong, brave Jewish (dark and curly) hair, just like the author's picture in the book jacket? Still, these two characters were quite interesting; the characters from the town itself were drawn as stick-figure foils The final denoument seemed ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly ambitious","review":"This could have been a great beach read if Korelitz hadn't been so intent on making it Deep and Literary. Its strengths include an inherently compelling plot, dialogue that crackles, and some terrific (if far-fetched) courtroom scenes. However, this book boasts not one likeable character. Not one! Its biggest flaw, though, is that Korelitz loads it down with so many themes -- being a mother, being a friend, being an outsider, being a woman, being a Jew, etc. etc. etc. -- that the entire thing creaks and eventually collapses under its own weight. The ending is beyond ludicrous. Korelitz is obviously a gifted writer; here's hoping that next time she plays to her strengths and avoids the thematic overkill that marred this book so badly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page turner!","review":"Definately one of those books you want to stay up all night with - just one more chapter!

The author can put together words with a nice touch, but the characters are all over-wrought and just plain stupid. They never speak up and say what they think, but instead, moan inwardly. The plot revolves around a dead baby and the young woman who is accused of being her mother and killing her. The woman says the dead baby is not hers. The DA says otherwise.

Samsung offers only a 1 year warranty and refuses to acknowledge that there is a problem with their DLP sets. There are numerous on-line discussions regarding this issue. To do the right thing, and keep their credibility, they should recall these and replace them.

I would also have to question why a reputable vendor, such as Amazon, would even carry Samsung products.Amazon, do your homework and don't support companies who don't stand by their products or produce items that are shoddy at best and then do nothing to help the consumer to fix the problem. And consumer, if you really want to purchase this Samsung, or another one for that matter considering the manner in which the company is handling these complaints (and they are all over the web) then just take your bucks, find a toilet and flush away because after 2 years, that's what you'll have done with your hard-earned cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible picture with DVDs","review":"I bought this TV last December and hooked up an HDMI DVD player to it.

I love this album so much that I have been hunting down anything that sounds like it since I first heard it six years ago. I've discovered that this IS the definitive collection of the JBs hard hitting, mostly instrumental funk. Left off of this album are the cheesy tunes contained on the worst JBs effort ever, \\"Bring the Funk On Down.\\" If you have so much as an inkling that you like funky music, buy this set.

Using a wealth of sources, she shows with particular clarity the great incompetence of the bureaucracy, where everyone seemed more interested in fighting for influence than in serving the people. She also puts the focus on crime, hooliganism and how the lot of women was slowly improved through the chance to get a decent education. Fitzpatrick also does not disappoint with the crushing effect of the nightmare years of 1936-1938, when millions were executed or imprisoned during the Great Purge. A vital read for all those fascinated by the topic of Stalinism"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative; complements another book I read","review":"I read this book after I had read \\"Harvest of Despair\\" which was about collectivization and what happened to the paesants and farmers during this same time period. \\"Everyday Satlinism\\" painted the picture of what was happening in the urban parts of the country and also helped further understand how Stalin's policies shaped the culture of the country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Clapton","review":"Nearly all of clapton's old masterpieces on one killer compact disc...

It's not terribly expensive, but it's also not a complex product.The problem is that the unit I received had very misshapen trays. This means they don't fit properly into the shelves of the frame and wobble around.It's not as noticeable when they are full of papers but extremely so on a light load.The construction of this item is also cheaper than I expected. Rather than having pre-drilled threads when putting the frame together instead you screw into a plastic cap.

I'd love to see an expanded edition come out in the future.Highly recommended as a gift for those you teach, whether youth or adults. The price is great, and it's almost always eligible for Amazon's 4-for-the-price-of-3 offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Sayings of the Bible","review":"This book is a great help to understanding hard verses or parables.

They just go from the hand of one student to another. They are not easy books, yet the kids read them quickly and eagerly pass them on to their friends. Definite choice for readers ten and up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was disappointed. The book had a lot of potential, yet it failed to deliver.What was perhaps my biggest issue with this book was the setting. In essence it was a great setting, but like I said, it failed to deliver. The author failed to make me love the world. This resulted in me not really caring when Morgarath attacked, or was preparing, to attack. I don't really care much if he wins. That may sound shallow, but it's the sad truth.When it came to characters, he failed as well. They seemed shallow and clichéd. I did, however, develop a great bond with Will's horse, Tug. I also liked Halt, even though his characteristics were somewhat cliché as well.Besides that there were problems with the story ending feeling too conclusive and not exactly leaving the reader dying to read the next book and also many technical issues with the writing, primarily the P.O.V. that bugged me. I honestly have no idea whether I will continue reading the series or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"A so, so story","review":"Ok, nothing special, copied from a disney film, but well written and a page turner,I don't think I would read the next n the series.If you want an easy to read book, its ok but a little of every disney film you have seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Tolkien!","review":"I don't understand the hype. Flanagan is not a great writer, just a clever advertising man dealing in clichés. So what if the battle scenes are not to violent and suitable for children and there's not too much cursing.A badly written book doesn't become a masterpiece if it's morally acceptable. (Ask Oscar Wilde.)If you want to read a fabulous fantasy story to your children, just turn to Tolkien or Rowling.

I've only read the first chapter, but from the synopsis I draw that it is AWESOME! Actually, the main reason I'm even here is investigation. You might call me \\"The Writing Ranger\\", because just about two weeks ago, I completed the first draft of my fantasy novel. Now, it's more of a novella(it's only 50,000 words), but I'm scouring Amazon's fantasy novel reviews to see what's attractive in fantasy. So, let's play the ol' give-an'-take game. From now on, if you review fantasy, say especially what you like about it. In a few years, I should have my novel published and you can read it.

I really liked how the author went into such detail about the skills and habits of the rangers. I think most boys would enjoy that part. And Will was very easy to relate to, being the underdog of the bunch, and without much hope at first. It was satisfying to see him progress and gain people's respect. And I really liked the vivid details in the story. Details of the scenery, fight scenes, weaponry, people, just everything, make it really come to life. I would recommend this book to kids who like reading about (and thereby going on)adventures.

It was intriguing, exciting, and suspenseful. would recommend it to almost anyone. It is well written and deserves a 6 out of 5. The characters are complex but easy to understand, the plot is great, and I would love to be a ranger at any time, no matter what the job was. It would be an interesting job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"A very good book, especially considering that the author first started this book as a series of short stories for this son. I've read many fantasy books and this book as all the elements needed to make it a hit for teens: easy to read and follow, likeable characters, straight forward story line, straight forward delineation between good and evil, heroic deeds, villains getting their just deserts, a little romance, a little mystery, and a few nice twists thrown in - in short a complex enough story to get your attention but not too complex to bore the young adult.I'm not going to rehash the story here, but briefly it's about an orphan or as they call it here, a ward, who is apprenticed to a Ranger (you'll need to read the book to find out what that is) and goes on his first adventure to help save the kingdom.I'm very glad that there are so far 10 books in this series because it means I will be looking forward to reading 9 more books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A simply entertaining fantasy","review":"This book along with the entire series is just an overall enjoyable read. It is not complicated and it is a very linear story; rather predictable but at the same time it captivates you to keep reading. Far from lacking because of it's simplicity the author really does a fantastic job of portraying exactly what is happening in the story and the character development is very entertaining to follow. A fantastic children's series for the young and young at heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining YA Story","review":"I listened to the audio CD for this book, so I really can't comment yet on the quality of the writing. The quality of the storytelling is decent. I feel like I've heard the story about a trillion times. It's worth experiencing once, but I don't think it's the type of thing I would go standing in lines for hours over.Ruins of Gorlan has everything a YA fantasy should have, a young orphan (why can't these hero types ever keep their parents around?), some tough decisions, an almost unspeakable evil bad guy whose name must inevitably begin with \\"m\\", etc. Will is a likable character. Purposefully not the hunky hero type (those can all be found in the chick lit section), Will is a small, agile, intelligent lad who finds his dream of being a knight crushed, and so settles for becoming a Ranger's Apprentice.His friends aren't very well developed, but being book 1 of 9ish so far, I'll let that go for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanna be a Ranger, too!","review":"This is actually the first in a new fantasy series for juveniles, but I thought it was excellent. Lord Arland has taken in the orphans of the area, and in their 15th year, they have Choosing Day. Will, whose parentage is unknown, wants to go to Battleschool more than anything. However, his slight stature stands in his way, and he, instead is lured into apprenticeship with the Ranger. Will comes to enjoy his apprenticeship, although he still finds his master, Halt, a little strange. When danger threatens the kingdom, though, Will finally realizes the importance of his job and his master. I really liked this story - and I look forward to the next in the series, The Burning Bridge, released in June."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book totally rocked...","review":"I am a 38 year old homemaker and picked the book up one day because of the guy on the cover (surprised? Not...) It was really great. I wanted the main guy to be like Aragorn from LOTR and it was so close. He was so cool. Will was great as a main character and loved the evil creatures like the Wargals and those Kalkara. It seems like these creatures are done in in this book but I hope that there is a possibility that there are more in book two. I have to say, Horace's character was pretty cool too. I definetly recommend this book to others as well who love fantasy adventure. Heck I'd love to be a RAnger for Halloween if I could. Anyhow, the book and the writing was not Ugh...It was AWESOME!!!! Go by my review. You will not be sorry.Gilraen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising Series","review":"I thought this series would be like any other fantasy series written for young adults - Middle Ages setting, knights, a looming evil in the distant mountains. These elements are present, but the characters of the series make up for the too-familiar environment. Will and Horace are believable and emotive and as the series progresses, so does their development until the reader comes to care about them quite a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"cant wait till next book!","review":"i think this book is unbelievable, it was amazing every step of the way. i also cant wait until the next book comes out. because i really want to see the battle of morgarath. even though this book was fantastic it wasnt flawed, i thought that this book was a little to desriptive, but other than that i thought it was great. but it needed more involment of his wardmates like horace.he was a great warrior.and john could have told us more about wills father. i would have liked to know more about this mysterious man, this book was exciting, jaw dropping, bone chilling, and amazing and mysterious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended...","review":"As a reader, I had really mixed feelings about this book. Although the story wasn't bad and the characters were likeable, I found that author's style of writing to be lackluster at best. It seemed that Flanagan had bought a truckload of adverbs and was just itching to use them - every verb seemed to have one attached. I also lost count of the number of times a scene ground to a halt with unnecessary, long-winded description of a location, a character's shoes, or some historical tidbit. While some of this information might have been important, placing it so often in the middle of dialogue made a lot of the book feel like stop-and-go traffic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I love this book... especially after reading the whole series everything halt says either makes me cry, laugh, or make me fall in love with him more. Always hang at the edge of the page when I read this book... I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't like fantasy thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light, fun reading for a wide age range.","review":"This is a quick review of the main series (1st 10 books) instead of one book at a time. While traditionally a kid's book, it can span into teens and adults, though I might imagine more on the male audience. This series reminded me of a lighter Percy Jackson. What is easy to like about this series are the main characters, the brevity of the stories, and the pace of the action. The books do not get bogged down into too much detail or sense of self importance or subtle messages - the writer sets out to tell an interesting adventure, and delivers just that.While the main themes, situations and settings have been used countless times before, it does not detract from this series. Unlike some of its peers, the adventures and dangers were more in line with reality - not over the top heroics/success and also not so much death/violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"good start to great series for younger readers","review":"Let's get this out of the way first off - This is a book for kids and does not have curse words, sex, or graphic violence. This is part of a series and thus the \\"ending\\" is not the end and isn't really satisfying as a stand-alone book.As an adult reader with any fantasy background at all, you will find the plot and characters familiar. The author obviously read the Wheel of Time, Lord of the Rings, and the other standards. That said, this a GREAT series for younger readers. My 10 year-old son is already on the 3rd book and loving them. This is a great way to get kids into this genre without too much gore* or too much pointless meandering around (Yes Robert Jordan - I am looking at you)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rangers apprentice","review":"This was an absolutely wonderful book with action at every corner and lots of interesting things everywhere I also enjoyed the Europeans and skills and name John hare come up with."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loved the book","review":"My son is getting interested in reading (like my older daughters were at his age with Harry Potter).

I think it's listed in the teen/youth section, but it is a great series for anyone. Will becomes a ranger's apprentice without really understanding exactly what it is that rangers do. The first book is his initiation into the group, which is endearing and humorous. The rangers are secretive, serious (in their duties and pranks on one another) and sarcastic. The relationships between Will and Halt as well as between Will and the other wards of the castle are some of the most interesting I have come across in ages. Just when you think the book might be slowing down, there is another adventure waiting and another twist in the story.

It does not leave any streaks and is not as expensive as some others I have tried. One tip though - I recently finished using my last bottle (I usually buy these several at a time) and purchased a couple more from Amazon and to my dismay, found that the new bottle left horrible streaks. I called the 1-800 number to complain and to ask if they had changed their formula. Their suggestion was to shake the bottle really well and instead of using the spray nozzle, to pour a little bit of the cleaner on a cloth/paper towel. The explanation was that sometimes the mineral oil separates from the cleaner and that is when the streaks appear, and also that spraying is not the optimal way to dispense this kind of cleaner.

I have purchased numerous other brands from local stores but never found a product that would clean as well as this product nor would it protect the finish from future marks and smudges. I highly recommend this product if you have stainless steel appliances.One additional benefit was using this product on my sink.

True, some of the classic nursery rhymes are outdated, but as your children grow with this book so too can your conversations regarding the occasional sexist overtones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back To Memory Lane","review":"I vividly remember my mother reading this book to me when I was a kid. It's strange because even though some of the rhymes are...how to describe...\\"strange\\" (\\"I'll grind his bones to make my bread\\"), I have wonderful, warm, loving memories from this book. I now have two daughters and I've purchased one of these books for each of them. For Xmas 2012, I purchased one for my brother's kids. It's very special to me to be able to share this book with the kids in my family, and I see this as a great hand-me-down for other families, too. The pictures are colorful and captivating, there are many rhymes that you can easily jump around to since it is not a story book, the rhymes are catchy and fun, and the rhymes at the end are goodnight/ending rhymes. There is something about these rhymes and the pictures that really appeals to the senses of children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richard Scarry's Best Mother Goose Ever! For Sure!","review":"Richard Scarry's Mother Goose art work is remarkable! The pictures are large and colorful and the book is constructed to hold up under lots of use. The characters are so expressive both readers and lookers will be royally entertained. This book is a five star experience for all ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All time classic","review":"This is the all time classic Richard Scarry children's book. I had this book when I was little and was thrilled to find out it was still being published. I read this to my 3 year old son now and he absolutely loves it and asks for it often for a bedtime story.

It not only opened my eyes to the harsh realities that a homosexual man may face, but it also allowed me to appreciate and respect their lives and struggles in a predominantly heterosexual society. This play not only captured the essence of Oscar Wilde but also can claim a spot amongst the greatest and most moving plays of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexual witchunts still common today","review":"Gross Indecency did a fine job of revealing the puritanical injustices commited by the court of Victorian England. It gives insight into the public sentiment and attitude towards class distinction and sexuality in the late 19th century. What makes Gross Indecency work is that much of the intolerance of Wilde's time still exsists to this day. Much of the content of \\"Gross Indecency\\" has yet to be learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece of Junk","review":"I had a couple of Zebco spincast rods and reels similar to this when I was a kid. They were generally reliable, so I thought one of these would make a good first rod for my 5 year old daughter. But I picked this model up for her last weekend and it just doesn't work. Sometimes it will cast as far as 4 or 5 feet. Most of the time it locks up and does nothing at all, even though I am operating the thing properly.This reel is unfortunately a completely piece of junk. Literally, you'd be better off tying some line to a flexible stick."},{"rating":"2","title":"All of My Kids Want this Reel","review":"We bought this fishing reel for my 4 year old daughter. We recently went on a fishing trip and she caught more fish than anyone. I think this reel it is great for a young child and now my 16 year old, 12 year old and myself want one when we go fishing again. It is very lightweight and easy for anyone to detect when they have a bite.It did lock up on us a little, but this was after catching a lot of fish. My daughter was the only one catching two fish at a time and she did so 4 times. I think the reel started locking up from all of the weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clapton / Townshend / Winwood / Wood","review":"I bought the original release on vinyl that included only six songs.

This is a Historic concert, and an adequate concert, but not a great concert. Eric is a little rusty, and the rest of the band only have a basic knowledge of most of the songs. We can be very grateful however, that this CD doubles the size of the woefully short original LP. This is a nice Four Star live album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was disappointing at the time; still disappointing","review":"When they released this album in 1973 it was panned for being technically not very good, and it isn't good technically or otherwise. There's really not much to say: good to see Clapton return from heroin addiction, though his then girlfriend Alice appears to have been less lucky, but really he was lackluster that night (I was sitting second row). Of historical interest only to Clapton buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"sublime crudeza......","review":"dejando de lado las especiales circunstancias que rodearon la creacion de este concierto, la musica reflejada en esta edicion realmente es muy buena.....muchos podran argumentar que hay pifiadas, que clapton estba nervioso, que hay desinteligencias, desprolijidad...bueno, puede ser cierto..lo indiscutible es la polenta y fiereza que existen en los temas.. el arranque con layla es desgarrador, el sentimiento se puede palpar a lo largo del cd, con un veradero selecionado de musicos...en fin, un trabajo digno y altamente recomendable, con excepcion de aquellos que prefieren los sentimientos guardadosen comodas bolsitas de nylon....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"WowI was really shocked at the quality of this CD to say the leastI'm a moderate Clapton Fan and I've seen him live 4 times but this CD I'm afraid to say is no good"},{"rating":"1","title":"too little - too soon","review":"Leonard Maltin put this book out too soon. It seems like a rush job.There are hundreds of films repeated from his classic and, what is worse, there are hundreds of available films that he skips.

It should be reworked totally as it is really needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leonard Maltin\`s Ripoff","review":"I heard that Leonard Maltin was putting 1960 & older films in a separate book so I decided to purchase a copy along with the annual movie guide. When I started looking through the 2006 edition, I noticed that there were still hundreds of 1960 & older films still listed. So I decided to compare both guides page by page. The same old films are listed in BOTH guides! I feel totally ripped off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Found Anything Better","review":"It's easy to have complaints about movie reviews, missing movies, and a few mistakes, but for something short, sweet, and relatively inclusive, Maltin's Classic Movie Guide stands up very well. Now that it's possible to see the films he reviews, it's easier to quibble, but his book helps in collecting and understanding the relative entertainment value of old movies. Thank goodness he doesn't just include \\"classics,\\" but also so many of those interesting B movies that sustained the studios and delighted pre- (and now post-) TV audiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Standard","review":"Good listing of movies, many not in his other books. My only gripe is: Why have these movies in this book AND in the other yearly books? Why not have a listing in the front of his yearly books of the movies in this book that previously have been in the yearly books? He can have the stars next to them but not keep churning these. OR maybe think about making a nice compendium of movies including all movies up to this year then doing an almanac for each year.

Highly, highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun to read, except for the guns!","review":"I agree with the last parent: It's a very fun book; Robert sneezes so much and so hard that everything falls down & so making the \\"achoo\\" sounds is good interactive fun. However, my 4 yr old understands that it's a bit unfair that Robert loses his job just for sneezing and knocking people over; she says \\"but he coudln't help it\\". So, I suppose there's a life lesson in there that much of life isn't fair. And finally the Guns! Oy, this book I guess was written when the idea that kids can play with guns is just okay. I skip over the text about how the guns go bang when robert sneezes. Buy at your own discretion; there are so many other good books without guns that I'd probably skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for a gift","review":"This was one of my sisters favorite books as a kid and now that she's 35 it's a great time to give it to her again for Christmas.

We are not even finished reading it (it is a long book) but each essay, with few exceptions, offers remarkable experience and insight from the author. While it is an anthology (and some essays were published previously) the editors have woven together an excellent resource for anyone interested in initiation models and spirituality in a psychological framework. While many of the authors are obviously Jungian, there are non-psychological offerings as well. I highly recommend this volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consequences For Looks","review":"I purchased a white one and it looked great.However, the only pro was looks and there were more cons.The hoodie is very thin and isn't worth wearing for fall nor winter.The inside cotton gets stuck onto clothing.

I thoroughly enjoyed the Anasazi series and expected a similar type product from these authors. The People of the ___ series seems to be the same story with the same cast of characters, same rapes and plunderings in every book. I am a big fan of series, and usually read the entire series once I start one; however, I didn't make it past #3 here. I purchased these at a second-hand book store, and am glad I only paid a buck each."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Good Thoughts On Life For Then And Now\\"","review":"The authors are archaeologists and convey a thought filled story of how people may have felt and acted thousands of years ago when they were just settling in the Northwest United States. This was a time just several hundred years after their ancestors had traveled across the frozen Being Staits.The authors' success in this good story is based on their wonderful way of using simple humans of that era and their simple way to deal with life to teach us lessons for today's life. We must know and understand our past in order build on our ancestors successes and not repeat their failures.\\"People Of Fire\\" actually changed one of my life long beliefs and reinforced another more currently discovered belief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never a dull story","review":"This is the seventh book I have read by the Gears' and I must say that their stories in the People series never let me down. There is a slight bit of repetion in the tales when it comes to situations but every character is different and their plots and twists seem to come out unique as well. This tale kept me quite enthralled and I just couldn't put it down at the end. For anyone who likes tales of Native Americans and their ancient folklore, this series is definitely a bulls eye for entertainment. Not my favorite in the series though, for that belongs to People of the Sea...or People of the Lakes? Can't decide; but those two are the Gears' at their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is the type of book I was looking for.

No such luck. Rarely is there a book I can't finish - this is one of them. I thought the 2nd book would continue with the characters of the first; but no...it takes up hundreds of years ( I think, it was never revealed) later with a whole new group of people that confused me. The writing is so choppy that the plot is difficult to follow. I was so disappointed as I wanted to find another series like Auel's Earth Children to captivate me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequel to People of the Wolf","review":"This book was even poorer than the already mediocre People of the Wolf. I had decided to give the series another try, but I'm fairly sure I will not read the next ones. Fire's weakest point: it is almost the same story over again as People of the Wolf. The characters are poorly developed, which is a surprise, the themes are very modern, liberal political agendas, which is extremely out of place for the kind of book this is, and the ending is very anti-climactic and poorly timed. The Gear's make other jarring mistakes, like throwing modern anthroplogical terms into the characters dialogue, and in other ways acting like anthropologists first and story tellers second (or even third!) The premise of the book was interesting enough that I kept trudging through the text, expecting it to pick up and get better. Finally, only dogged determination not to quit kept me going until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling tale","review":"In People of the Fire, the Gears bring us again into the ancient world of struggle, survival, and powerful Dreamers. The Dreamer, Little Dancer, is forced to choose between the woman he loves and the dangerous path of a Dreamer who walks between worlds. If he chooses his wife and children, the great drought may continue and the people will wage bloody wars for food and land. If he chooses to follow his Dreams, he may be consumed in order that his people may live. This second story in The First North Americans Series builds upon the legends created in the first novel. A compelling tale, I suffered and triumphed along with the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different Time, Same Characters","review":"I read the first of this series, People of the Wolf. It did not even compare to my other favorite prehistory authors (Auel, Sarabande, Sue Harrison) but I thought that I would read the second book and give the series a chance. I laughed out loud when I realized that the book is not really a sequel when it takes place hundreds to thousands of years later, but it had the same types of characters!! The old false dreamer, the young dreamer who must choose love or dreaming, the old wise dreamer that teaches the new one (whom everyone thought was a witch or was dead), the list goes on. Get creative and not keep the same type of characters!! I was looking for a true sequel, but instead got a whole new version of the same story."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:O},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],N={key:0},W={key:1};function R(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",W,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const B=d(C,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-b65cf366"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/6.md","filePath":"library/6.md"}'),M={name:"library/6.md"},P=Object.assign(M,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(B)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
