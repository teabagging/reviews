The steamer does not work, it is very small and not really user friendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed","review":"I have owned a number of espresso machines over the years, but had never before come across one without a switch allowing you to choose whether you want to make coffee or steam. This machine requires that you do both at the same time. Doing it this way, you have no control over how 'long' (how diluted) your coffee is, nor how much steam you have in your milk. And frankly, watery coffee with flat milk does not equal a proper cappucino. Even for a novice, a good coffee machine requires a small investment. Spend the little extra and find another model that allows you to switch back and forth between coffee and steam. This one will only leave you frustrated and disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I only used the machine once. It was difficult to get the cup of milk into the steamer because of the design on the frother wand. My last steamer used to release hot water or steam, this does both at the same time. I tried several times to get hot frothed milk, but the milk ended up lukewarm with a very disappointing amount of froth. Because I used this machine once I am not able to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative Review","review":"I would not recommend this machine. It has a flaw that it does not have the option to have the machine on without having the coffee brewing. Thus the coffee does not pour hot into the cup. It pours warm instead of hot. I personally enjoy coffee with a little foam on top from the actual brewing and this coffee comes out with no froth. I would recommend a machine with the option of having the machine on so it can warm up the water and then with an additional switch that gives you the option of when to begin brewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"I like this ok, but the steam wand doesn't really froth the milk very well. Sometimes it does, others it doesn't. Then I have to heat the steamed milk in the microwave because it is still cold. I guess I'm not having much luck with it.

I'm very pleased, especially since things usually get better with practice. I do wish the milk foamed up better, I love the stuff from the gas stations, but I think I'll get closer as time goes on."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a joke!","review":"Before I bought this \\"Espresso and Cappuccino Maker\\", I did my research and read as many bad reviews as I could. But, since it looked like such a great deal, I decided to give it a try, anyway. MISTAKE! I really should have listened and walked away. Now I am stuck and have had to warm up the milk in the microwave just to make a cappuccino, simply because the steaming wand DOES NOT WORK. This is NOT an Espresso and Cappuccino Maker I expected to get for almost $40 - This is really just a regular coffee maker and anyone can easily get one at Target for $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating to use the steam nozzle","review":"Like some other reviewers, I must say this machine seems to brew espresso just fine, but the design flaw lies in the placement and function of the steam nozzle. The steam valve must be opened as the espresso begins to drip, and the machine runs out of steam before frothing or warming the milk when brewing 2 shots of espresso. I have had some success when brewing 4 shots, as the machine produces more steam, but the placement of the steam nozzle makes it very frustrating to use. It is easy to bump the espresso carafe away from the drip outlets, and the milk container must be tilted in order to get the steam nozzle inside, making it very easy to spill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in less than 4 months of use","review":"I bought this product for our office end of October of 2010.My colleague and I were so happy that the espresso machine worked great despite some negative reviews.We took good care of the machine by performing the recommended scaling and routine cleaning.By the end of December 2010, the machine refused to work, as soon as the machine is turned on, water starts to spill out from the knobs, the frother, and any holes that would allow water to leak out.I called De'Longhi customer service and it seems that the customer service is backed up everyday for the past 3 days.No emails were replied as well.I tried to call the number available from a booklet that was sent together with the machine, and it seems the number is outdated as well.We are very disappointed with our failed espresso machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Espresso Maker","review":"This product was re-furbished and came in a bit dirty.

As stated before, purchase a frothing wand and you will be happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very big design flaw","review":"As some of the other reviews state, there is no knob or switch on the EC5 to go from Foaming to Espresso drip. Which means if you want a cappuccino you have to froth the milk at the same time as dripping the coffee. The problem lies in that the frothing wand is way too close to the machine and it's difficult to use while the coffee is dripping. Secondly if you don't put enough water and you estimate incorrectly the wand never produces enough steam to make a nice froth. If you put too much water you will make perfect froth however the coffee will be very watery because you had to add water to make enough steam.. it's kinda a double edged sword. And more hassle than it's worth too. I am surprised that every machine doesn't have a knob or switch to adjust between froth and drip. Very big disappointment, am going to have to go out and buy a new machine most likely."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid machine","review":"I just got this machine for Christmas as a gift.

I stood in the kitchen for an hour trying desperately to get this machine to steam my milk. I even tried running it several times in a row with just plain water in order to produce enough steam to froth the milk. As other reviewers stated, there is no option to turn off the coffee drip and use only the steam arm, which ends up not generating enough stream to do anything.

The steamer is not great, I usually end up having to microwave my milk after getting some foam on top but again for the cheap price I'm ok with that.

This machine is perfectly fine if you just want a cup or two of espresso, but don't get your hopes up about making great, frothy lattes and cappuccinos. I start my mornings off with a cup of espresso to get me going and the machine works fine, but on the weekends I occasionally like to enjoy a latte with my morning paper. I've tried about a dozen times to steam and froth milk with this machine and all I get is a few bubbles. The milk has barely a thin layer of froth and is still ice cold.

Three months later, today, it is not heating any water whatsoever. Time to go shopping for a new one. It DEFINITELY won't be DeLonghi.

However, that element is probably the best thing going for the publication.The manga art was sketchy and often difficult to tell what exactly was going on. The storylines tried to encompass too much and left the reader relying on narration to explain in long winded detail, what was happening. The characters were... just there. I wasn't able to get emotionally involved wth any of the characters because it seemed almost as if they were there only to break up the narration of the war updates.I think this would be an excellent publication if the authors devoted an entire graphic novel to each of the stories presented, and spent time developing the characters and plots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, solid phone...","review":"I purchased two of these, one for my home office and one for my son's room.

An adapter for wall display is only \\"extra\\" included; which is more than enough if you want a great-looking, high-performing phone with an incredibly low clearance price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice design but poor electronics!","review":"I ordered this phone based on the positive reviews I read here. The phone is really sharp looking and seems sturdy, but the sound quality is terrible. There is an almost constant hissing static (especially when I'm talking - it's like when it's transmitting out). I placed in the same location of my old GE cordless phone (also a 900mz and clear as a bell), so I don't think that's the problem. It's going back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just thought I'd mention","review":"Hey, just thought I'd inform everyone that they might want to reconsider a Vtech phone. I had mine for about 2 years, and over the last 6 months I had it, it wouldn't hold a charge for more than 10 minutes - and then shut off. I would charge it for over 24 hours and then use it - and nothing but 5-10 minutes. I recently got a new phone for Christmas, and we trashed the old one. The new one is a Motorola Disney Princess phone - which, if I can find on Amazon, I will give 5 stars to. The new phone is great - fits my face comfortably, has great volume and sound, cute ringers, fits my hand well, has caller I.D, and comes on a stand-up base that I never thought to be better before, but is really convenient to not have to worry about laying it down against the charger correctly (no clicking it into the right spot in the dark). My phone was in the mid-$$ range at Target, and well worth it. I recommend my phone - or any Motorola - over than a Vtech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good quality phone","review":"I bought this phone almost exactly a year ago. It had some cool features and yadda yadda, it worked alright when I got it. There is constant static. Now when I get too far from the base (about 30 ft.) it makes a horrible clicking noise. It worked just fine before (except maybe the static). It is a poor quality product. I don't recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"I first bought the vinyl edition 40 years ago.

It will take you on a remarkable voyage that you won't forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"before its time","review":"I recalled this record from a brilliant summer decades ago when the BBB version of \\"Work Song\\" played on Nuri Nuri's Sunday Morning Blues Hour. Memory often serves music from the sixites better than digitalization. Most of the recording is difficult to listen to, but \\"Work Song\\" and \\"East-West\\" speak to the higher level of aspirations of the time and the musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ground breaking original","review":"The first PBBB album and John Mayall's 'Hard Road' album turned me onto the blues. This album was ground breaking with its long solos and 'improvisation'. The 'I've got a mind to give up living' track is my all time personal favourite, with Mike Bloomfield showing a never since repeated depth of feel and talent. The other tracks worth the price are 'Work Song' and 'East-West' although time as diminished their impact. Personally, the first album stands the test of time better and shows what great talents Paul Butterfield and Mike Bloomfield were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mike Vargo was kind","review":"He's right on the mark regarding the 2nd rate material.The US version of this is very sorry indeed.Finally a CD that sounds even worse than well worn vinyl.Electra should be ashamed of ever putting this out in the first place without remastering.

I came up in Texas in the traditional Blues tradition. (T-Bone and the 3 Kings, Freddie, Albert and BB, Lightnin' Hopkins, Johnny Winter etc.) I bought P. Butterfield B.B.'s first album because they had Howlin' Wolf's rhythm section with new guitar players. Wow! They knocked my socks off! Particularly, Michael Bloomfield. I remember when this album came out, everyone was primed to buy it. All my guitar picking friends wore out a couple of copies straight away. Those Michael Bloomfield solos became \\"The Encyclopedia\\". I never get tired of hearing Mike Bloomfield's solos. East-West kicked off a whole Raga rock thing in midst of the oncoming wave of Psychedelia. The Harmonic minor scale existed well before that but not the way Michael played it and connected it to the Blues. This album was and is a very important album in grand scheme of Popular Music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Progressive White boy Blues at it's Best","review":"A classic from some of the great young white blues players coming out of Chicago in the early sixties.

An all time must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album from one of the sixties best blues bands.","review":"I've never heard a bad Paul Butterfield Blues Band album.He was an unsung hero of modern blues.The bands All-Star guitar players Mike Bloomfield,and Elvin Bishop \\"light it up\\".And Pauls harp playing firmly places him in the top ten list of chicago's best.Wish he were still with us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creamed Corn is an excellent CD. I highly recommend it.","review":"Anyone who enjoys innovative, energetic music will love this CD. It has a wide variety of sounds and styles that only mildly reflect the nature of their live shows. DJ Kevlar is a master on the turntables and adds so much to the overall sound as does Raunchy P. The originality is very refreshing as is demonstrated by the lyrics of Interrupt and Matosphere as well as the phat basslines of Ripcord.

In spite of having balanced the wheels and having installed and carefully aligned machined cast iron V-belt pulleys, my Delta bandsaw still had an annoying vibration. Since the belt was old and worn and had taken a bit of a set, I figured that had to be the problem. So after reading the gushing reviews here, I bought a Power Twist belt. No dice. If anything, it made the vibration worse. Since it's still a functional drive belt, I'll give it two stars, but it certainly fell far short of expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slam Dunk -- A Great Product that Works!","review":"I have a Rockwell/Delta Table Saw that had always shuddered on start-up and shut down, and had a little vibration at operating speed.

More than willing to pay a little premium for such an improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vibration killer!","review":"These belts are the smoothest running belts you will ever find. It won't take a set if the equipment isn't used for a while- no thump-thump like other belts will do.I have PowerTwist belts on my Jet drill press, Jet jointer, and Jet bandsaw. The only reason I don't have them on my tablesaw is that it's a Ridgid, and they use polygroove belts; I had PowerTwist on my Craftsman tablesaw before it was destroyed in a wildfire three years ago.I bought a 25-foot pack a couple of years ago, and it's been enough to do my shop and my Dad's. Much more economical than buying five feet at a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated","review":"99% of these reviews are written by people who replaced the OEM belt with one of these. Which means they're comparing the cheapest belt the OEM could buy to an over priced thing.I've compared these belts to GOOD v belts and don't see any advantage in terms of vibration dampening.A Gates Cogged Hi-Power belt runs about 1/4 of the price of these and produces the same amount of vibration. In addition to this at the same tension (ie not stressing the motor) the link belt was more prone to slippage when the tool was loaded down than the Hi-Power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep the old girl","review":"I was ready to get rid of my saw, and buy a new one. Even with a new belt, it vibrated so bad, the pullies would come loose. I put this belt on in a couple of minutes, and it was smooth as could be. I definitely recommend this belt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I installed this item in place of the factory-supplied belt on my Powermatic 64A table saw (excellent saw, by the way). The saw was already running quiet and mostly smooth, but I was enticed by the thought of it being even smoother. Installation: The belt kept riding up on the pulleys, though I hadn't changed the alignment, and I had to mess with the motor mount, and mess, and mess, for about an hour till it spanned well. When it was mounted, the belt seemed no smoother but a LOT louder -- a high-frequency whine the saw never had before. I held off buying this item for a long time, because of the cost, and I should have left well enough alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did I wait so long?","review":"I heard about these belts from some articles that I had read in some woodworking magazines. I thought, maybe someday, but not right now. After my last project, out of frustration with my machine, I decided to buy one. I have a Grizzly contractors grade table saw. Nice machine, just shook a bunch. I didn't even read the instructions for sizing the belt. It took less than 2 minutes to remove the old one, size the powertwist to length and install it. It was that easy. I stood both a nickel and a penny on edge and threw the switch. I just stared in amazement as they both just stood right where I placed them. Don't wait to buy this belt, or you'll be asking yourself \\"Why did I wait so long?\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended for Furnace Blower","review":"The belt was easy to install, as recommended by others. However, this belt should NOT be used on a furnace/HVAC squirrel-cage blower. The vibration echos through the ducts throughout the house. It was so bad I made a special trip into town on Saturday night to replace it. Be sure you install the original OEM belt in this application."},{"rating":"2","title":"After the second time through, you'll be addicted","review":"When I first tried this video I was scared. I do a lot of Pilates and wasn't really into aerobics. On top of that Denise sounded and looked like she was on speed for most of the video but I changed by tune after trying it a few times.

It is easy and acurate to use, no slipage when drilling and very durable. I have used and own some of the pocket jig knockoffs but after getting this tool my other one just sits and collects dust in the shop. My only regret is that I didn't invest in the larger Kreg Pocket Jig kit. Kreg is a little more expensive than the competition but well worth it. The old saying you get what you pay for and in this tool you get the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"everything i was hoping for","review":"First of all, the recording quality is great. The playing is top notch. Etheridge puts on really good interpretation of the bundles songs. The musicians sound very inspired throughout the whole set. I was frustrated that there were no live recording from that period and finally i got exactly what i hoped for. The only minor complain is I don't think I will be able to sit through a 10 minute long drum solo again...I think bundles is one of the greatest fusion albums of all times and softs is not all that bad either.

By time the book arrived, I'd had already outgrown the material.If you have never programmed before, this book would probably be useful, as the first 200 pages cover basic programming techniques; loops, data types etc.If you are already familiar with programming, then there is not much useful information. There are only a 50 pages on 3d programming and only a few of the relevent funtions are covered.Mostly the book is fluff. There are shots of every screen that comes up during the install of Dark Basic.(7 pages)\\"Figure 1.60 The Setup Status screen, which displays the installation progress\\"I realize that the book says 'Beginners Guide', but I thought that meant it was for someone who was new to the language, not new to computers.If you know the difference between an integer and a float, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book by Jonathan Harbour!","review":"I'll read any book by Jonathan Harbour, and this one did not disappoint me.

Everyone who says that this one is not as good as their self-titled is wrong no matter what they say. Don't get me wrong, their first cd was awesome but as the title suggests this one progressed. By the way, DO NOT buy their first cd, make it instead so that you can put their rare song \\"Asphixiate\\" on there. All the songs on Progress are enjoyable beyond belief, my favorite song by far is \\"Click,\\" it is the most eclectic-sounding song on the entire cd. If you are looking for an album you can headbang to, you found it. Their song \\"Jackass\\" is definitely the heaviest song on here, it's not as heavy as \\"Asphixiate\\" but it comes damn close.

Glass somehow gets sort of dry (but not really), but anything plastic doesn't dry at all and I have to wipe everything down when it's done.

It has a very different tone than the movie and is overall much more thought-provoking.

It was not bad in the least, especially considering the price of free! But, that said, after all of the excellent reviews, I found it lacking. There were a great many words written and tangents taken, to seemingly no avail. The ending I found exceptionally anti-climatic after reading thru all of the previous pages to get there. There were no twists, no plot revelations, not much of anything. I would not read this book a second time, but, I truly think the author has great promise and will keep an eye out for further works from this individual."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh...","review":"studiodude wrote the best review of this book imo. check it out when you can.i am glad to have downloaded this book for free. i spent the better part of reading skimming because the passages were more than a bit bogged down with descriptive text. i liked the protagonist but did not buy how he ended up where he did. the sinn fein references throw in toward the end? um, ok...O_o perhaps if i watch the movie version and then re-read the book i will develop a different/better position on what i read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting","review":"I purchased this book from Amazon.co.uk.I liked this book. It's well written, and unpredictable. Several times I thought I knew what was going to happen but then the plot turned the other way. I like how the characters don't correspond to the tropes of fiction. It's suspenseful and exciting.The excitement and suspense in the book stem from not knowing what the main character doesn't know, and finding out through him. He needs to find out what's going on, whom he can trust, and so on.Unfortunately, some of this suspense is killed with scenes showing what the other people are up to. This means the reader knows a lot of things the main character does not (for example, whether \\"The Father\\" is a good guy or a bad guy) and this ruined much of the excitement for it.If the story had stuck to a single point of view, this book could have been a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"good storytelling","review":"I took a chance on this novel and was pleasantly surprised. It is well written, good vocabulary and grammar, creative and well thought out story line, and nice character development.The tale is in the vein of \\"Lord Of The Flies\\", following the main character's arrival on an island penal colony. The inmates have been left to themselves, and have broken into different factions according to their preferred social order. The story is told in a logical and believable way, with enough detail to allow you to relate to the different characters.It may not become a literary classic, but it's definitely a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much better than that godawful movie!","review":"The first time I read The Penal Colony was 1998 or so; I spotted a well-used paperback copy in a pile of abandoned belongings at a college dormitory. I took it, began to read, and was instantly absorbed. I was blown away by the story, the characters, and through it all the language: sometimes sharp and precise, other times poetic, always compelling and memorable. I consider myself a fairly well-read person, in terms of classic literature as well as modern best-sellers, and without hesitation, I put The Penal Colony on my \\"Desert Island List\\" of ten books that I would take with me to my own exile on Sert.Up until a few years ago, this book was hard to find: out of print (at least in the USA), and precious little information available on the internet. Now it's available as an e-book here on Amazon, and it's an absolute gem of a book. The ideas, situations and characters will stay with you for life."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is great!","review":"I don't usually write reviews, but I really want to get the word out about this book.

The characters were all interesting and engaging. The most enjoyed part of the book to me was the attitude change of the main character, as he became more in tuned to other people in the colony. It was interesting to see how the social system evolved and the how resourceful the prisoners became just to survive.

These guide are a bear to set up. The micro adjustment knobs bind up and have way too much play. When you tighten up the bearing screws to lock it down it throws the bearings off. The whole set up is a joke and defeats the purpose of the micro adjust to begin with. Called Carter and little to no help. I am sending them back.Also purchased Carter's ultra blue tires. These tires are not wide enough to cover the width of the wheel. Where the tires are seamed together there is a defined ridge the runs across the width of the tire causing vibration in the saw. Beware they are sold individually and not in pairs for around $30 each. Go with the orange tires which cost $30 for both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Guides, but be careful!","review":"Don't get these guides if you're planning on using 1/8\\" blades. These guides are great for resawing and heavy cutting where you're going to use a wide blade, but you can't use thin blades on these guides, so you can forget making really tight turns (as in cutting a bandsaw box or when doing tight scrolling). Plus, the price of these guides will leave a sore spot where your wallet used to be.These are GREAT for specialized purposes where a wide blade can be used, but for general bandsaw work in a small shop where different blade widths are used commonly, I'd rather have a good set of cool blocks and pocket the difference in the cost!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vagina = Basement","review":"I was grooving along pretty well with Rainbeau until she got to the Kegel Exercises and began referring to our vaginas as \\"basements\\". She was instructing us to squeeze tighter and tighter and so said \\"Basement, First Floor, Second, Third...\\" Maybe that's petty of me to get all torn up about that, but it really did ruin my yoga groove.

I am a little familiar with yoga, but have never practiced it before and I found it fairly easy to follow. There are a few parts that I think could have been explained a little better, but after trying it out a couple of times I found them easy to get the hang of. I really liked that Rainbeau had 2 other women with her, and that each of them was in a different spot in their pregnancy so there are different variations shown for each trimester. It wasn't like some cheesy yoga videos I've seen before, but very calming and relaxing. I would definitely recommend this video to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a favorite","review":"This video falls into the category of: seems like they did it in one take. The main problem is the instructor. She makes numerous grammatical mistakes, doesn't explain certain things well, and makes \\"off-the-cuff\\" remarks that seem staged. I don't know if there are better yoga videos out there (I bought this one since its reviews were better than most), but this is NOT something I happily reach for. One caveat: this may be the snobbery of someone with several yoga studios within walking distance. If your fitness access is limited and you're not picky, it is certainly better than no yoga."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a dissapointment","review":"this video was such a disappointment. rainbeau was not a very good instructor - her instructions were so vague and she didn't give very good breathing techniques. if you've never taken yoga, don't buy this dvd. the poses were very hard to follow especially when you're head is not facing the tv screen. also, it got to be boring toward the middle of the video. i recommend getting \\"fitmama with leisa hart\\" - it has a 20 min. salsa/cardio section & 20 min. fat-burn yoga section, it is more fun and motivating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Basic Video","review":"This video is probably good for those who want a nice relaxing stretch. However, if you are looking for more of a workout going through a number of postures, this video is not for you. I got bored about halfway through and turned it off in the end. Did not provide me with a workout at all, just a good stretch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I don't mean to be too negative, but I found this DVD to be truly useless.

I've done yoga for 7 years, so I do know what I'm doing, which maybe something to think about if you're a beginner. Check out a local yoga studio for prenatal and do this at home. I usually throw in some of my own challenging poses in between her instruction, but it's a good workout. And, unless you're used to doing Ashtanga, I guess we are supposed to take it a little easier when we're pregnant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good workout","review":"I really enjoy this dvd. Rainbeau Mars is charmingly goofy and the workout is a good one. There is nothing in here that stresses my mind or body - I just feel good when I do it. The only problem with the dvd is that the audio track is off in the beginning which is really creepy to watch - I just avert my eyes. Otherwise, it's a good stretch with a gentle workout; highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"too west coast for me, and i live in seattle, strange","review":"i like yoga and do it weekly, but i found rainbeau to be a different breed. the workout does not seem inspired by the pregnancy, it is a traditional yoga routine with very little information to help create safety and awareness for the safety of the mom and baby to be. I didn't care for this style of yoga and don't think this is a very well thought out video routine. FitMama by Leisa Hart is so much better, weird how the names are similar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Video","review":"I really enjoyed this video. I am five months pregnant and haven't been very active so far in my pregnancy. I was looking for something to help me gradually build some strength, flexibility and endurance without over-doing it and I think this is just what I need right now.With soothing background music, Rainbeau moves from pose to pose very slowly and talks directly to you. She stresses the importance of listening to your body and working at your own pace. She does a great job of describing the positions and gives you lots of alternatives to suit your own needs. Having 3 people to watch (one for each trimester) was very helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad sequence, unprofessional instructor","review":"This is the poorest quality prenatal yoga DVD I've purchased. I did yoga for a couple of years before I got pregnant so I can compare to some good teachers. This young woman is constantly out of breath, she rushes her talking and postures as if she is late for something. It gives a very restless rhythm to the whole work out. Also her comments about anatomical and physiological processes in woman's body are either erroneous or don't make sense. And the work out itself is not well designed and doesn't engage all groups of muscles."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to follow","review":"This DVD is very hard to follow because it is lack of flow. Not recommended if you have some experience doing yoga before getting pregnant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great yoga session, sometimes annoying instruction","review":"If you haven't done yoga before, this might be a tough workout - it's not too strenuous, but her instruction can be confusing (eg. \\"Move your shoulders up... down towards your back\\") and she doesn't explain the poses in-depth. Still, it's not watered-down and has more \\"true\\" yoga poses, unlike some of the other options.I do this video as part of my fitness routine, but each time I cringe at some of the more annoying chatter - problems with grammar like \\"the femur bones is the bone,\\" or telling us that chest stretches along with a good oil are great for preventing stretch marks (to which my dr. said she sounds like an enthusiastic, first-time mom.) The good news, if you have the DVD, is that if you're distracted by her instruction but want the thorough workout, you can select the video with music only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed on bedrest","review":"I'm a regular exerciser who wasn't looking forward to slowing down when I got pregnant, but figured I'd buy a yoga DVD and do my best. At first it was interesting but a little slow. Then I started having premature contractions and got put on modified bedrest. My doctor said I couldn't exercise at all but after a week of that my muscles (and my brain) got very twitchy and restless.

Upon reading through the various chapters and coming across traits in others, I could point to it and go \\"Hey! So I'm not just wierd, that's normal for being ADD!\\" I also liked her attitude that ADD didn't actually mean one had a disorder or a deficit, as every individual who I'd told up to that point that I'd had it had relayed to me just how sorry they were for me that my brain was \\"that way\\". She did go a bit heavily on the emotional damage caused by being \\"differently brained\\", but her spiel is obviously on the damage done to self-esteem because of this inability to operate \\"normally\\".

For example, consider these two back-to-back contradictory sentences: On p. 113, it says, \\"Do not do for the person who is not holding up his or her share of the work load. If that person's unpicked-up clothing litters your living space and causes you to feel pain, ask him to pick it up and if he doesn't, either do it yourself or pay to have it done and send him the bill.\\"The book does include some useful appendices.

Delta's 800 number is of no help, their only solution being to take it to a service center. I am now stuck with it as I have had it over 30 days waiting for parts to arrive that were supposed to solve the problem, but didn't. It appears the hole for the shaft screw on the main grinder housing has been drilled at other than 90 degrees from the side and the 23-715 attachment will never align properly to allow the blade carrier to parallel the grinding stone."},{"rating":"1","title":"23-710 - save your money","review":"The biggest problem and this is beyond the general low quality is the fact that it provides one with no built in methods for repeatable grinding angles. I found that the time spent setting up for grinding the angles I wanted was better spent sharpening by hand. Mine went back the same day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unworthy of the Delta Name","review":"I think [$$$] is a lot of money for two wheels, a bit of cast iron and a motor, so when I paid that much for the Delta Sharpening Center, I thought I was buying a good tool.

The machine should be taken off the market, and all of us who have been \\"taken\\" by Delta given a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort required to lift the box it's packaged","review":"I purchased this item from my local Woodcraft store, it was on a Manager's special (now I know why). All of the negative comments already posted are true-poor quality control (the drip tube on the resevoir had plastic shavings lodged in it, although not a big deal to clear w/ a little blast of air, how could this have passed a quality inspection prior to shipment?), the tool rest doesn't even come close to being low enough for half of my chisels (Stanley & Marples), excess vibration, & on & on & on... I recently purchased a new Band Saw, I passed up on the Delta & purchased a Jet because of the poor fit & finish on the Delta. It really makes me wonder what Delta is doing-or is not doing!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre product","review":"The Delta 23-710 sharpening center would probably sharpen tools OK if the parts were made as designed. The wet grinding wheel was out of balance on the unit I received (causing the entire tool to shake) and the tool rest could not be placed at 90 to the axis of the small grinding wheel as shown in the instructions. I contacted Delta service about this and they said they would send me a new wheel and tool rest. Over 2 months later, I received the tool rest but still no wheel. I sent the product back for total replacement, but the same problems were present in the replacement. Finally, I sent it back as well. If you need steady, smooth operation in a sharpening tool with precise settings on the tool rest, don't buy the Delta 23-710 sharpening center."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"Delta should discontinue production of this item. For sharpening, you can't get away with having sub-par tolerances. I spent hours trying to adjust this sharpener with no luck. The wheels were out of true and the tool supports were poorly designed. I eventually removed the horizontal wheel and added a buffing wheel, basically leaving me with an expensive bench grinder. I finally robbed a bank and bought a Tormek. There is absolutely no comparison. Either sharpen by hand or buy a Tormek."},{"rating":"1","title":"its not worth the time... its not worth the money","review":"I purchased this item thinking that I could get it to do what others could not...believe me, it is not worth the money, and it is not worth the time to try to make it work. I got the machine, set it up, and turned it on. The wet wheel was grossly inaccurate, with a wobble that would turn a square plane iron into a dull angled iron. I thought that there was something I could do to adjust it, so I called the manufacturer, who claimed a \\"certain amount of wobble was expected\\"...actually Delta said \\"1/8 inch was within tollerence\\". Have you ever tried sharpening a tool with an uneven stone? Delta suggested that I send it in for repairs under their warranty. The only problem is that there is an 8 week backlog or warranty repairs...any idea why such a there is an 8 week backlog to fix this? This is junk, its not defective, it is poor design...don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the sharpest knife in the drawer...","review":"It is difficult to set this machine up such that you get acceptable sharpening results. The guides/supports do not offer much help in ensuring that the item being sharpened aligns with the horizontal stone. Also, you cannot set the guide low enough to match the grinding angle on short tools. And finally, the holder portion of the guide has an alignment bar that is on the wrong side of the holder since the beveled edge of a chisel will not engage with it.I own a significant number of Delta tools so I am not biased against Delta. I give this tool a strong \\"DO NOT BUY\\" recommendation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John's take","review":"My sharpening needs are primarily chissels and hand plane irons. This product meets my requirements completely after a half hour of shimming to true up the horizontal grinding wheel. The tool rest could be a bit easier to adjust but is adequate.

This book repeats the classic error of all academics in assuming all metal is Motley Crue or derivates thereof, and consequently, the book is completely obsolete in the current time.

It's not an epic film, or a particularly big one. Just something that's worth watching and thinking about.I liked it well enough to order the music CD (something I hardly ever do). I cannot now find the CD, something I'm very disappointed about, because I really enjoyed listening to it.

Easy to adjust, good grooves for hold downs, nice surface...what's there not to like? I even like the color!I put a plywood shelf about half way down. I'm also thinking about boxing it in on the sides and back to catch any saw dust that the vacuum doesn't get.I ordered all the bells and whistles with it and glad I did.Oh, one thing. This package is almost 100 pounds. The first time they delivered it via Amazon, it must have come apart in shipping. I only got one of the three pieces. Returned everything and a new supplier via Amazon got it all right.

This was a very straight forward assembly. Extremely sturdy! I put four locking casters(not included) in place of the leg leveling adjusters. No missing parts, no damage to any items. No more clamping a straight edge to a bench and then clamping my project to that.You can always come up with some \\"jerry-rigged\\" method to get the job done, but it is sure nice when you don't need to. Having the right tool for the job is so much easier and pleasant. I chose to buy the router table combo vs. making my own setup because I wanted to spend more time on my projects and not on making jigs/tables/setups in order to make my projects.Thank you Kreg"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Router Table for the money!","review":"If you are a serious woodworker, this is by far THE best router table to buy. I bought the complete table, fence, stand, casters & micro-adjuster. Every little piece of hardware was accounted for and very neatly packaged. The reliability and accuracy of the fence make it very easy to use. And if you don't want to drill the insert yourself, for 3o bucks, Kreg will drill it for you, shipping included.The assembly instructions were written in simple, easy-to-understand English and not like the 'Chinglish' from other manufacturers who outsourced their products. This router table examplifies American ingenuity & workmanship.

However, it was quite the enjoyable experience for me to take it all in at a slow pace.I will not summarize the plot, as that has been done by other reviewers. Let me just say that _The Sea_ was deserving of the prestigious Booker Prize and perhaps one of the best Booker-winning books I've read.

I had a hard time connecting to Max and his surrounding characters. I'm curious if any of his other novels are better and more engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great writing......about not much at all","review":"There is no doubt that Banville can write. But good writing in and of itself does not necessarily equal a good read. Even appreciating Banville's expert turn of phrase, I still found reading this novel somewhat of a chore. The novel is narrated by way of the thoughts of an elderly(?) man recalling significant events in his life. Unfortunately for the reader, neither the man nor his life are particularly compelling or even interesting. If a book captures my interest then I naturally want to pick it up at every opportunity and immerse myself in the story. My sole reason for continuing to pick up this book (over too long a period of time considering its length) was to finish it so I could start a new book that I would acutally enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conned by Booker Prize","review":"Story is about Max, a middle-aged Irishman who loses his wife. He goes back to a seaside town where he spent his summer holidays as a child to cope with his grief. Narrator not likeable. Story sways back and forth in time. Story about grieving, death, love and memory but in a meandering and most confusing style. I was \\"conned\\" by the Booker Prize Award."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying","review":"The book hinted at character development to come but, with no beautiful use of language and an absence of any gripping narration, I gave up after 40 pages.

You must allow yourself the luxury of time to enjoy and savour at leisure the exquisite choice of epithets and oneiric description that makes this little masterpiece a gem. John Banville succeeds in capturing the process of ageing, the intensity of youth and the inevitability of death. His understanding of the onset of juvenile sexual awareness is sensitive and so accurate.He deals with the most important crises of life in the most sophisticated and sensitive way.It is a work that is transporting with a wealth of insight.It is a joy to come across a work of depth and perspicacityin less than 300 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book - surprise ending didn't work","review":"Banville is a master of the English language. Each page of \\"The Sea\\" contains magnificent passages, poetic in their cadence and brilliant in their insights. Banville displayed superb skills in shifting the narrator's thoughts to different points in time.That alone makes the book a must read. It is a shame that Banville felt compelled to wrap up the story line with an explanation for everything. I didn't think the sudden explanation fit with the information the narrator had previously provided the reader. It somehow diminished the satisfaction of sitting at the foot of the narrator. This was the only reason I didn't give \\"The Sea\\" five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was All At Sea","review":"Trying to figure out the point. Language is good...but content Zip.

It is the only book I have never finished and I read probably a book a weak. How do books as boring as this get any kind of awards.

It is like a miniaturist painting, one person coming to terms with his own life and his own longings and, most of all, his own mortality. A wonderful, meditative read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratching my head","review":"For much of this book, while enjoying the line by line gems that Banville throws our way -- he does have a masterful command of language -- I was left wondering if it was all worth it.Max seems like a nobody to me. He seems like a nobody to himself. No one in the novel is the slightest interesting. What is interesting is watching how a man's thin life dissintegrates near the end (although he's not really that old). He's caught up in memories (notice how in most of his memories he rarely says anything -- but memories are like that). So Banville does take us into the psychology of a pretty boring and empty person very, very well. But, all along, except for the ending which finally involved me emotionally -- I finally cared a little bit for Max -- I was left scratching my head why Banville would ever write such a novel. Pity the people who he was modelling his story on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I found this book disappointing. I teach writing, and the novel reminded me of an assignment in which students must write essays using lists of vocabulary words. The extensive vocabulary employed to describe such a narrow existence and set of circumstances made the novel, at times, appear an odd parody of itself. Certainly no A la recherche du temps perdu, although it moves at about the same speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exhausting","review":"This book wrung out the last bit of energy and desire I have in me as a reader to read.The book gave me the impression that the writer invested hours in assembly of many of the sentences; in fact, most of the sentences. Who talks this way? Who thinks this way?I just finished it, five minutes ago, and I am exhausted. Exhausted from trying to understand the point of the book, and tired and bored with trying to understand how each word, sentence and thought associates with the ones before and after.It is a hard read and doesn't make you want more. Unfortunately, I purchased this book and Ancient Light together. I just read the first two pages of Ancient Light and guess what? The character is already talking about life as it occurred fifty years ago, along with the fact that he was in love with his best friend's mother. I don't know if I will ever have it in me to tackle this second book. It will take weeks before I can even think about getting to page three."},{"rating":"1","title":"just floats there...","review":"John Banville has a great ear for prose, both his own and others (in his outstanding literary criticism). However.Humbert Humbert and Charles Kinbote SHOULD be insufferable. But they are not. Unlike Banville's narrators, who truly ARE insufferable. I did like The Untouchable. The Sea is saved somewhat by the last ten pages or so. But this (very short) book nonetheless begins to get unbearable about halfway through -- many, many descriptions of light glinting off water, many, many sinister hints and diabolical erudition from the narrator, etc., etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I really did not like this book. There was no dialog at all, just a recital of what happened. The main character kept going back and forth from youth to present day from one paragraph to another, very confusing. Also, I am not a stupid person, yet I had to keep referring to the dictionary for so many words because I did not know their meaning. I see no purpose in using obscure words to describe events. Do not bother reading this book it's not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Becalmed Sea","review":"I'm trying to get into this book, but can't seem to do it.

I am so glad it's all over."},{"rating":"1","title":"You know a lot of really big words. So what?","review":"My book group selected this and, while we haven't yet discussed it, I did talk to two of our group and we found this book a very painful read. I have to admit that I stopped half way through when I talked to another reader who told me it never gets better. I really expected to like it. I was immediately grateful to have the Kindle edition because I had to look up words in the dictionary about every other page! How annoying. There wasn't one likeable person in the story, so I couldn't get emotionally connected to any of them. Then when I found out about the tragedy I realized the book was not going to have any redeeming qualities. I quit 1/2 way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Indulgent Male Noodling","review":"Admirers of the novel or movie \\"Evening\\" will probably love this book. For all others: BUYER BEWARE. Mr.Banville has a deserved reputation as a crafter of fine prose, and this book does not negate that reputation. What I object to is the mushy male chauvinism disguising itself as adoration of the Eternal Feminine. Unsanitary and unsavory. Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and Overblown","review":"I enjoy novels of lyrical prose and non-linear narrative, but I can't stand this book. What many are praising as imaginative and hyper-observant I just see as contrived and distractingly metafictional. That is, I sense the author's hand in every line I read from this book. So for me, no matter how profound the author's statement, I can't enjoy the reading because it seems to me that the author wants so badly for us to know that he is being profound. For lyrical prose, I would recommend the obvious, Nabakov. For nonlinear narrative, try Amitav Ghosh's The Shadow Lines. Both authors have a far more natural and therefore enjoyable style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Masterfully Written, Difficult to Read","review":"At the recommendation of a friend, and after reading the many glowing reviews of Banville's work, I ordered \\"The Sea\\" and eagerly awaited its arrival. When it did arrive, I hastily tore it out of the box, and headed to my favorite place to read -- the bathtub. Twenty minutes later, I had set the book aside, and just enjoyed the bath.Several times since then, I have valiantly attempted to find some sense of compassion or connection with the characters in the book, and it is impossible for me. When I say \\"The Sea\\" is masterfully written, I mean that the sentences are carefully constructed, and the vocabulary is rich and varied. But this is one very cold example of writing for the sake of writing, rather than to convey a moving or necessary story.I have set this book aside for more fulfilling books..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read ... and I read for a living","review":"Banville's \\"The Sea\\" is the best book I've read ... and I read for a living.His prose is a siren song, luring you ever closer to the edge of the cliff ... and you go willingly, ready to fall into its abyss of perfectly crafted sentences ....

Banville gives us here a profound meditation on aging and death, and seldom have I ever experienced such beautiful prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was eager to read this book since it won the Man Booker Prize, but I was disappointed. The prose is elegant, but there is not much of a plot. This book did not hold my interest and I would advise others to be aware of the flaws of this book. The language was a bit too flowery for my taste. It seemed like every sentence was carefully written and rewritten to contain a simile, a metaphor, or some fancy word when a simpler one would have sufficed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Momentous Nothing","review":"This is a typical sub-200 page book where the author clearly cares more about sentence structure, obscure metaphors, word-of-the-day vocab, and page after page of descriptions of hair and clothes and the sea and the trees and the weather, than about a good story (or any story at all). To top it off most of the characters (who receive considerably less attention than a barrel of water, the inside of a house, the benches and the beach) die. Not only boring but depressing, \\"just another of the great world's shrugs of indifference\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Language but a Terrible Bore","review":"I agree with other reviewers in that Banville used beautiful language when writing The Sea. His descriptions of characters and setting were strong, however, the story did not keep me the least bit engaged. I didn't feel as though I knew his characters, and didn't really care where his story would lead me. This book was a completle bore until the end when a few surprises are revealed. In my opinion, a story about his days growing up near the sea would have been much more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful experience","review":"Someone suggested this to my book club and like a fool I took her up on it. When she didn't show up that particular night we were all ready to string her up for putting us through this total drudgery! This book is dull, dull, dull. The main character is nobody you can care about. He plods through his life and you keep waiting for something to happen to him but nothing really ever does so that at the end you feel robbed of all that time. The prose in the story that has been mentioned by others must have been hiding because I didn't find it. I'd like those hours of my life back please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Could not get past first pages!

His descriptions of locales and people all seem unkind and harsh. Even the description of his youthful crush is raw. However, by the end of the book you find yourself almost liking the man and thinking maybe this is someone you could spend time with.John Banville writes an extraordinary novel and weaves a world so real you can almost smell the ocean and hear the waves. It is not a happy-ever-after story, however it is a redeeming human story and well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"The temporal layers of the story make it a little bit confusing in the beginning, but by the end you understand this man's grief and search to find himself by going back to the town where he lived as a child, trying to make sense out of his life and who he has become. My book club read this and we all enjoyed the writing and story. Some people will not like this book. It is not a fast paced story, but it is a story full of emotion. Soo.... go read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Booker choice","review":"Up until the last quarter of this book it would barely have rated 1 star. The denouement made the book interesting. I agree with previous reviewers that the Booker was awarded for all the \\"big\\" words. Sadly Kazuo Ishiguro was ripped off, as \\"Never Let Me Go\\" was a much better book. Then again, \\"Atonement\\" also missed out a few years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Won An Award?","review":"I eagerly awaited the arrival of this book, but was sorely disappointed. Granted, the language was challenging at times (I kept a dictionary close by), but I just couldn't empathize with the main character, Max. The story dragged on. I couldn't wait to finish it (I swore I would). What a waste of time. I'll be giving this book away at the next yard sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Like I'm Stranded In the Ocean and It Never, Ever Ends","review":"...and I mean that in the most excruciating way. I believe some writers get lost in the words and the construction of sentences before they realize that they don't have a plot. So, with about 25 pages left, they throw in a twist, the pay-off, that has been projected, painfully, for a few hundred, tedious, ponderous, and stupefying pages. I had just read 500 pages of Margaret Atwood's \\"The Blind Assassin\\", another Man Booker Prize winner with incredible writing, an unlikable narrator and a missing plot, before I picked up this John Banville novel. Thankfully, it was, at least, short. Ostensibly about death and the nature of memory, I found it to be meandering and confusing. Obviously a terribly gifted writer, with sentences that beg to be read again and again, I just think that being able to manipulate words isn't enough to garner the praise it deserves, much less a Booker Prize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one.","review":"This book presents what is becoming the Myth of Rachel Carson.

The item lasted until last week (week before Thanksgiving) when she told me that one of the wheels was not rolling good any more and the straps had torn off at the bottom so she couldn't even put it on her back. The wheels are too small and it looks like they got worn by the concrete. One of the leg props fell off within a couple of weeks too. This is not a strong enough backpack to be put thru the day to day travel of a 6th grader. I wonder how they tested this item before they started selling it.

Then you will like this, but I was expecting the Como era depicted on the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN IMPORTANT BOOK!","review":"In this book, Sonia Nieto clearly makes known to the reader a thorough understanding of what it takes to teach in multicultural contexts. It is very rare for me to be so attached to a book that is embedded heavily in research and educational theories, without putting it down for a few days. Nieto was able to hold my attention with easy, readable language and personal narratives of other teachers, in addition to her own experiences as a Puerto Rican educator. In my opinion, Sonia Nieto demonstrates her ability as a leading theorist in the field of multicultural education and critical pedagogy in this text that is presented with wonderful clarity and expertise. If I were ever in a position to teach a college course on multicultural education, I would definitely select this book as required reading, an excellent choice for a textbook in multicultural education."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Inspiring","review":"I read this book for one of my elementary teaching classes. The author insinuates if you're not a minority, then you should be ashamed of your success. She discusses a class she teaches, where she helps a white female student see how unfair it is that she doesn't understand what it's like to be oppressed.I was looking for this book to suggest ways to reach all students, where all students are valued. I'll keep looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant Read","review":"I bought this book only because I had to for a class. It was not my cup of tea, seemed rather lackluster and repetitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read it unless you'er forced to","review":"The book is full of to many excuses for the failure of students of color. This book links academic success more to a students lack of color and gender then to a students effort. The book is more propaganda then research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reference","review":"This book is an excellent reference. It covers all of the MFC classes with the technical detail that is hard to find in the electronic help files that come with Visual C++. This book should be used simply as a reference. You won't want to buy this book if you are trying to learn how to program the C++ language. This book is perfect for those of us struggling to learn the new MFC technologies but still like having real paper"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to pull this bi-atch out again!","review":"This thing is very powerful.

Pop!","review":"In my home, we call it the Minister of Destruction. My property backs up to a nature preserve, so you can imagine how my home is covered in bugs constantly -- mosquitoes, stink bugs, moths, etc. I then hung the device underneath my deck and within moments, SNAP! CRACKLE! POP! Its was like BBQing. A few bugs even were so large that they caused a plume of smoke. No worries though, the minister took it like a champ and kept on going.I have mounted mine sideways. This is especially useful because of the large volume of bugs. Mounting it vertically would cause me to have to empty the tray. Horizontally mounted, the bugs fall right through the mesh outer layer and onto the ground. Cleaning is non-existent.My only concern was putting taking it apart to put the mounting brackets on and then reassembling it -- hope you got some strength."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not kill mosquitoes","review":"Bought this to get rid of the pesky year round south fla mosquitoes. Been using it for a couple of months now. It kills everything except mosquitoes and that really sux.I'm not very impressed by the build quality either. The top plastic cover does not fit correctly and is held by a single tiny off-center screw. If you hand the unit by the provided hook, the whole weight of the unit would be on the tiny screw and I don't think it would take very long before the whole thing comes crashing down to the ground.Definitely would not recommed this unit against mosquitoes. The two stars are just because it kills everything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally junk peeler !","review":"This has to be sorriest excuse for a peeler I've ever owned.

The extended version of Gold, with over two and a half minutes of synthesizer-induced strings, bongos and percussion in the introduction is required listening for any 80's music fan. Only When You Leave also received a nice remix. These two songs on the disc are definitely Spandau Ballet classics in style and sound. The extended version of True didn't expand much beyond the original song. Similar low-keyed treatments for Lifeline, Round and Round, and I'll Fly For You left me wanting more. I did enjoy the remix version of Chant #1 even though there was not much variation from the very well made original mix. I plan to buy another copy of this CD as mine has been listened to and handled so much, that the scratches are starting to impede continuous play."},{"rating":"2","title":"OVERLOOKED...BUT STILL THE BEST IN GOSPEL","review":"VANESSA BELL ARMSTRONG IS ONE OF GOD'S FINEST VESSELS.

I regret ordering this as it arrived damaged (but still shrinkwrapped!) It looked like the cutting board separated along the gluing of pieces. Hmph! Don't buy this. I am going to try to return this without losing free shipping on the entire order but you should bear in mind the hassle of returning this very flimsy collection of toothpicks before you add it to your cart.p.s. Mercifully, Amazon is allowing the return of this item without losing free shipping.

Because I had a large roast to carve the next day, I kept it anyway, and sanded it smooth myself -- then sanded the entire board, because what I had sanded looked better than what the factory had done! Even though I hand-wash all my boards and knives, this one began to warp right away. Also, the channel is not deep enough, and because of the slight warp, meat drippings run toward one edge, then overflow. I now rarely use this, and will probably let it be firewood at some point. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It only lasted 2 months","review":"I liked it at first and then after only after 2 months it started to seperate.

The larger of the two splits is large enough to allow juice drainage from the well under the board onto the counter. I might as well use my plastic veggie board that doesn't have a well, because this well is useless now and the wood doesn't stay in place as well on the corian countertop as the plastic board does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started to Crack","review":"like the others, i found that the board looked nice when i received it, but then after a few months, it started to crack. this is even after i maintained it regularly with mineral oil. and of course, you can't use it anymore even if the cracks are small, because the meat juices end up leaking all over your table or counter.even during the time the board was functional, the juice well wasn't deep enough with meat juices overflowing, and making it even more difficult to transfer into a container or pot to make a sauce.unfortunately, this is a terrible product, and i'm having to buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow River Carving Board","review":"Very satisfied.

I loved this book!. It is clean, emphasizing relationships, and the dialogues both spoken and in thought are really funny and insightful. I was touched and felt honored to have come across a book as honest, sweet and full of self-discovery as this. I recommend this book highly!!!

Nevertheless, the Canon Snappy LX II is an unbelievable value for the money, and, as of this writing(Mar. 2002), there's NOTHING in this price range by way of \\"value\\" digital cameras(less than 60 bucks) that can touch a true 35 mm point-n-shoot camera for picture quality. With auto-loading and auto-rewinding, the Snappy LX II is practically idiot-proof, ideal for the person inclined to throw away the instruction booklet and then figure it out(but keep it to operate the timer).

You will also find yourself re-reading most of it for the remainder of your life. But \\"Nigger\\" is just the start of something much bigger. Gregory became arguably the greatest man who has ever lived. Tune into his website ... in conjunction with ordering and reading some of his books available from amazon.com. Mr. Gregory made a lot of mistakes during his childhood and as a young adult, but he found something inside himself that helped to change the world. Junior high school is a perfect time to begin reading this book. \\"Nigger\\" is funny and provocative. Gregory uses humor to get his message across in a one of a kind way. It should be required reading for ALL junior high and high schools."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"I did not like this publication. It had so much negativity. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I also would like to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Since I enjoyed reading Black Like Me by John Howard Griffin and Coming of Age in Mississippi by Anne Moody, I thought I would enjoy this book. I could not have been more wrong. This book is not of an honorable struggle for civil rights, it is a portrayal of a man that lied, cheated, and complained throughout. Never once does it appear to exhibit any balance of the author's character which only leaves me to believe that this IS his unfortunate character. The purpose of this book escapes me. It can not possibly inspire or encourage and I am sorry that I helped support this book by buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nigger","review":"Nigger by Dick Gregory *****Nigger is one of the most uplifting and positive books I have ever read. It is the story of Dick Gregory's life. From living in Squalor's in the south with no electricity or heat, no coats in the winter or backpacks for school, and a bed he shared with six other brothers and sisters, and a father who ran out. Being born a black man is hard enough but being black in the 1950's and 60's was impossible. Gregory took the impossible and turned shrugged it off. Becoming a world class comedian and one of the highest paid black entertainers in history.He would go on to fight for civil rights not just for blacks but for everyone. Color never mattered to him it was the 'impossibles' that did. Gregory is a true hero and \\"Nigger\\" is and essential read for anyone interested in a great read, or looking for a real heroin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comment to don't bother","review":"If the book offended you, then you deserved it.You are kind the person that is incapable of understanding what life was like for others of another race.What makes you holier than thou?

President Bush could lie to the country and thats ok right?And you don't approve of Gregory? Wow...Guess what, Mr. Dick Gregory is not losing any sleep over your lame comments.He has forgotten more knowledge than you could possibly ever know. The man has walked among giants in this society; Mr Gregory is considered an icon, while you my friend are considered a loser.Get a life and stick to reading manuals on anti-government propoganda, bomb-making and making your own currency."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"I first read this book over 30 years ago and found it sad and hilarious at the same time.

I found it at Amazon and was glad to have it back in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clarity Unveiled","review":"This book has helped me to see clearly how to have a true spiritual practice. I feel like the author G. BlueStone is talking to me personally; you can feel a very down to earth, sincere presence in the words. It is well tailored to those who are self motivated and willing to see for themselves rather than relying on someone else's words for how things are. The principles in the book can be applied to any Way: martial arts, calligraphy, yoga, meditation, Buddhism, Taoism. I am impressed with the universality of approach. The exercises are immediately useful. The book engenders a sense of deep questioning and offers a guide that is practical and real. I have read this book many times now and will keep it close for life.

What does it cost Porter Cable to make this accessory? $2?PC does have to cover the development costs and should charge a premium for a jig that is somewhat of a standard in woodworking. Check out the price of the Omnijig. Trust me, you've already paid for this accomplishment when you purchased the original jig. And the design of this jig hasn't changed in years and years. PC is way behind the times.I'm thinking (hoping) that there is a special place in hell for those individuals in companies, like Porter Cable, who decide to rape their customers, who have already paid a hefty tab for the jig, when they want to purchase an accessory for that jig.And the 24\\" jigs cost around $67?Shame on Porter Cable.

Extremely hard to decipher. I had bought several peices of antiques when I started working at an antique store. I wanted to know if what I had was worth anything. This book gave me NO help at all in determining this. It was a complete waste of my money. Nothing is organized. For example, I bought a pineapple shaped glass decanter and instead of listing them under one subject they were scattered all through the book all in different places. Most of the items do not have pictures and these items discription are so vague that there is no way a normal person could determine what it means. The pictures they do have are black and white except for one small section. I was very disappointed with this book. There is no way it will help me figure out if any of the purchases I made are valuable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start gone bad","review":"This so-called mystery starts off well with a main character working as a detective while attempting to work as an actress. But where's the murder? Not until about page 200 of this overly long light read. And then...well I won't reveal the end. Let's just say it's not a big surprise. I grew tired of the characters and especially the main character whose personality was decidedly wobbly. Was she tough or one of those women who faint at the sight of blood?

And \\"Better Man\\" sounds like a partial re-deployment of Carole King's \\"A Natural Woman\\". So I'm wondering about her originality.But as I said, she has a good voice which is very beguiling when she doesn't push it. \\"And Now\\" is a good example, but she ruins even that with the line, \\"Resource your life with ingenuity\\". That is a line Hal David would choke on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and informative","review":"This book is both interesting and informative.

This person has painful memories from the past. This person is sometimes fearful of the future, but always tries to give the appearance of confidence. This person likes to keep loved ones close by and sometimes seeks the approval of others. Blah, blah, blah.\\" I'll bet this person is you.

However, after trying this cable in all three of my HDMI ports and having the exact same issue, I then tested the Mediabridge cable I purchased from Amazon for my DVD player in all of the sockets and it worked perfectly.

If you need to connect HDMI to DVI but don't need an audio connection by all mean buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine Picture - Broke after 6 mos.","review":"When the cable worked it was just fine - I guess because it's a digital signal after all. Thing is, the plastic cover of DVI side broke after about six months, and soon thereafter the cable started not working at all. Even though I gave it 2/5 stars I'm thinking about buying again just because it's so cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect","review":"Works perfect.

I'm not much of a video-phile, but this cable will get the job done and things still look incredible on my 50\\" Samsung DLP. I was using this to connect my non-HDMI cable box to my TV.

I bought this cable to connect the graphics card's high definition DVI output to the HDMI input on my plasma TV to get better video quality. It dramatically improved the video quality of the video on my screen to HD quality.I was somewhat skeptical that this would be so, given the fact that this item cost only $12 and I had seen them priced at $40 and up at electronics stores.I am extremely pleased with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a digital signal, people.","review":"As an audio engineer, I understand the importance of good cables. I saw HDMI cables for over a hundred dollars, and I began to wonder why I should truly spend that much.With other A/V equipment that I've hooked up, the signals have been (mostly) analog. Analog signals are prone to outside interference in a much more obvious way than digital, mainly because most digital signals (including DVI and HDMI) include some sort of error correction and/or signal reconstitution technology.I spent MUCH less on this particular cable, and I have to say that I'm completely satisfied. The cable is short enough and shielded thickly enough that even my inexpensive TV is able to produce a clean, artifact-free image 100% of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for DVI ouput to HDMI input","review":"I was hesitant to purchase this at first because some of the reviews stated the product did not work for \\"DVI output to HDMI input.\\"After researching this on google and writing the manufacturer, this cable does work for \\"DVI output to HDMI input.\\"I did have to reboot my HD cable box after attaching the cable because it displayed the error message \\"your HDTV does not support HDCP.\\"No noticeable difference between this cable and the component cables though (I just needed to free up a component input for my PS2).$11.99 and does the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine","review":"Perfectly adequate, cheap (at time of purchase) cable.

I am a firm believer in not paying more than you have to for cables, and overpriced cables are nothing but a rip off. However this cable was a disappointment.The plastic feels cheap and britle, and the signal quality was worse than that of VGA. I compared a VGA connection to this connection using a top of the line PC with a high end video card, on a 46\\" 1080p LCD tv.

Nowadays, you will most likely find a HDMI port instead. This cable allows you to connect a monitor with a DVI connector to a computer with a HDMI port.The cable appears of good quality, thick yet flexible jacket, and the appearance of quality molded ends.

My installer was an idiot and said component cables into the TV which I was using for SD would be \\"just as good\\", they are not. For such a great price this cable was well worth the risk, and worked GREAT! Picure is crystal clear. Just remember that DVI cables do not carry audio so you'll need additional cords for that.

Note that I had been successfully utilizing this DVI output from the cable box previously (so I am sure that the problem was not with the DVI output of the cable box). Buyer beware that \\"HDMI to DVI\\" means just that.

No difference with a Monster cable I bought in a store for $60."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Don't Buy These From Retail Stores!!!","review":"Basic Purpose: A lot of widescreen computer monitors have only 2 digital inputs; HDMI and DVI-D. Most devices (like DVD players/xbox360/hdtv) have HDMI outs. With a standard HDMI cable, you'd only be able to hook up one source to your monitor. This cable allows you to hook up your HDMI-out sources to the DVD-D input on your monitor. This means you could easily switch between your two sources with no unplugging involved.Why You Should Get it: I don't know how they did it, but somehow these major electronic stores managed to fool the public into paying ridiculous prices for cables. Best-Circuit-Micro-Depot sell these things for $50-100 when they're easily available on the internet for $10.This cable works great and costs very little for what it does.

This cable is cheap in price and quality. The HDMI input was not very snug and had some trouble getting a solid connection. It also had some issues with grain, which I think had to do with the connection, but could have been something else.I upgraded to a Belkin cable and it was a world of difference. The Belkin cable cost more ($23), but the build quality of the cable is worlds apart; I have no issues with the Belkin on all accounts.I don't think it makes sense to spend $80 - $125 on HDMI/DVI cables, but spending $22 - $25 on higher build quality cables is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cable for a low price to connect an older HDTV to a PS3","review":"I used this cable to connect an older Sony HDTV with a DVI input to a Sony Playstation3.

From the very beginning Wake Wood has a truncated quality to it which makes it difficult for the viewer to connect with the poorly realized characters and their situation -- almost as if the film makers felt that the initial tragedy would be sufficient to buy the viewers interest and sympathy for the whole of the movie.Wake Wood inhabits an uneasy space between a mystery, occult thriller, and slasher film and manages to fail on all three counts though if it had simply focused on the occult thriller aspect there were a number of intriguing ideas that were barely explored and seemed to exist as window dressing though they were by far the most interesting aspects of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, creepy horror movie","review":"Solid acting combined with the look/feel and story of an old Hammer film = total success.

That is something there is a big void in nowadays and they are in a good position to make movies exactly like what they used to make. Hollywood started making Hammer style films in the 1970s and that is why they quit in the first place. I thought Hammer recognized this and was resuming from where they left off, but no.

For example, a chapter is devoted to fairly long interviews with various (mostly past) Tull members. The photo gallery was also replete with pictures I have not seen. Unfortunately, the writing is somewhat amateurish and the editing/proofreading is even worse. In my first ten minutes or so I identified over 20 typographical errors and mistakes in grammar. An example is the author's CONSTANT misuse of the contraction \\"it's\\" in place of the possessive \\"its\\". Overall, I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of an Excuse than a Memoir","review":"I did not like this book. It is a memoir that is more like a catharsis and 'atta girl in order to make excuses for a fairly valueless and vapid life.Fueled by the Womens' Movement, Ms. O'Faolain justifies her short-lived, alcohol-entrenched or extra-marital liaisons with no remorse. She claims that if her lovers are married, it's their wives' problem (and this from a soon-to-be feminist!?). She is also a name dropper of all manner of literati with some anti-semitic descriptions thrown in.Finally, we look at the terrible neglect and abuse from her childhood with narrow-visioned denial. She demonstrates this same denial when she minimizes the domestic violence in her relationships.I have to wonder if she's ever done deep reflection or if she has any capacity to put herself in someone else's shoes.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed feelings about this book","review":"Ms. O'Faolain is, beyond a doubt, a gifted writer. Unfortunately, this book isn't the best showcase of her talents. She seems to view herself as a witness to her own life; her academic accomplishments are ascribed to various \\"patrons\\" who helped her get scholarships rather than hard work on her own part. We know all about the men she slept with and the pubs she visited, but she never gets around to naming all of her siblings. And while she might feel that witnessing W.H. Auden eating an egg at Oxford gives her some startling insight into his character, the meaning escapes me. It certainly says nothing about her.For all her talk of freeing herself from the restrictive life that Irish women were expected to live until recently, Nuala O'Faolain comes across as an extraordinarily passive woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Great story that brings history to this fictional novel.

I initially really enjoyed the first few pages, but the author jumped around so much, I found the book confusing. She would start talking about something from her past, switch to some other point in time, and than jump back. It was only a little over 200 pages, but felt like it was 800 pages. By the end of this memoir I found the author downright irritating in her lack of self-esteem. I wanted to yell at her to get a hobby & stop whining. I realize she has been through some very very hard times in a dysfunctional family, and there are moments of clarity where I found the writing style quite fluid and beautiful. However, this book couldn't end soon enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Woman Should Read This Book","review":"This is a book every woman should read.

It is a very personal history of what it was like to live through the women's movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"Boy, when I picked this one up I didn't know that 215 pages later I'd actually believe it must have been \\"accidental\\". To echo the herd, McCourt got it right and O'Faolain just plain didn't...If you were drawn to this because you loved \\"Angela's Ashes\\",try Rick Bragg's \\"All Over but the Shoutin'\\" for another poignant memoir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some advice, Nuala - Get some Prozac!","review":"This memoir was deeply unsatisfying. While I like the way she writes and crafts words, I found her to be uninspiring and pretentious, to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Hard to Keep the Thread","review":"I found the parts about her family most interesting, and also depressing. Her alcholic mother and wayward father made for a sad upbringing. After about page 80, I scanned the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave on this book...","review":"after only 58 pages. Pointless, ponderous, self-indulgent, meandering...yawn.I deliberately stayed away from the reviews before picking this book up, but I could have co-written most of the \\"disappointed\\" ones.There are too many good books available to waste my time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"is she really honest?","review":"Nuala writes on about the poverty of her life a la Frank Mccourt, yet her father had a solidly middle class profession as a news reporter. In fact, she admits that another writer \\"outs\\" her as quite middle class, and others refer to her family as \\"bohemian,\\" not poor. She went to a boarding school-hardly a solution for a truly impoverished family. Her memoir would have been more poweful had she focused on what appears to be the more central problem in her family - alchoholism, and the ensuing emotional impoverishment that is the inevitable result. If I were to right a memoir as a 53 year old woman, I can't imagine that my sexual escapades would continue to be such a central part of my lifestory. I thought her continuing preoccupation with men and sex was immature, odd, or somehow disfunctional. Overall, she comes across as a very depressed woman. Very sad personal story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a winner","review":"I read this book as part of a book group. I found it boring and pretenious. The author would have done a much better job if she spent more time on a specific event, rather than racing through general situations. She skipped around a lot so it was very difficult to remember who was whom, or to even care."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss.","review":"I heard an interview with the author and decided she was quite an interesting individual. Although this book has received many over-the-top reviews, I was disappointed. The book has sections which are long lists of people she met, worked with, or admired. But often she provides no information about the individual. She clearly accomplished a great deal but how? There is a tone of self-pity throughout the text and she seems loathe to give people, including herself, credit for their achievements. Very Irish that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"We paid to be her therapist.","review":"Our book club read this book after hearing that it was so highly recommended. Though the author got her literary act together in the second half of the book and there were a scattering of beautifully written passages, we were not impressed. Here's our review: The idiosyncratic, disjointed ramblings of a self-absorbed woman looking to the public for the attention and love she never received from her parents. Tedious to read and lacking in any insight on the part of the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"A thoroughly depressing, pretentious book.","review":"Given the cover recommendation by Frank McCourt, I was prepared to enjoy this autobiography. Yet, several pages into it I put it down and wasn't sure if I could start it again. I was determined to get through the book and finally managed to read it from cover to cover. Why, I don't know. Nuala O'Faolain is pretentious, obtuse and depressing. Pretentious in the continual references to her \\"famous\\" friends and lovers, obtuse in her literary references (many in Irish which she doesn't bother to at least paraphrase so those of us not fluent in this language can at least make an attempt to understand what point she is trying to make) and depressing in leading us through her love life, much of it conducted in an alcoholic stupor. Angela's Ashes illustrated an impoverished Irish childhood with clarity and a degree of humor. Nuala O'Faolain's impoverished Irish early adulthood made me want to through her bok through the window."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtakingly Honest","review":"I was interested to see the range of reaction this book has gotten from readers. Although I did not find it consistently gripping (the parts in the middle that are long lists of literary and academic figures the author knew in the 60s and 70s for example, was probably more interesting to Irish readers who actually knew of these people), there is a vein of reckless, relentless honesty to this memoir that is astonishing and impossible to turn away from.Few have ever written better about the experience of being human. It is also beautifully written, but it is the book's content, not its style, that haunts me.It is hard to understand how someone who grew up the way she did, and by her own account kind of bumbled through life, drinking heavily and with no guiding ambition other than the elusive wish to be loved, had the guts to look so clearly at her own life and the world around her. It is a triumph of the human spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never quite got to the point in revealing what's her message","review":"Very hard reading and trying to relate to all the many men in her life, There were so many and only brief information on them all. Also, she never seems to share any in-depth feelings about herself and what she learned or discoverd through her journeys. Her book reads like a long boring recital."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't we vote with negative stars?","review":"Quite possibly the oddest mixture of self pity and self promotion that it's ever been my misfortune to read. Here's a quick tip for Nuala - being screwed up doesn't make you deep and mysterious. Or even interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat and boring","review":"I can't understand how this became a bestseller. It is not much of a memoir, but mostly a tiresome, pointless, self-serving account of the odds and ends of life; and the style is not strong enough to carry the weak material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the story?","review":"...Blah, blah, blah...stupidly I kept reading, waiting on the edge of my seat for the story of her life to get started...I was CERTAIN there was a story there...nope!I think she lived a bit too much in a haze hopping from one bed/bar to the next...only able to remember people's names (and that's probably only because they were supposed to be famous)The part that bugs me is that there probably is a REALLY great story there...she just needs to excise all the name dropping and add a lot of why's and how's...she needs to really want to share HER life."},{"rating":"1","title":"McCort did in better in Angela's Ashes","review":"I wanted to like this book but found it depressing and uninsightful. Angela's Ashes is the best of this genre. Her newspaper columns must be better. I had to force myself to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am confused by the accolades this book received","review":"Though this book didn't inspire a passionate response from me (I thought it was fine, at best) I am stunned by the unanimous raves it has received. I like the person, Nuala, very much, but as far as the literary attributes of the piece, this is no \\"Angela's Ashes.\\" There is no comparison between this work and any great intensely rich autobiography. Unfortunately, because I wanted to love it, I must lump this book with other reading 'lite' and suggest that it would be good summer beach fare or for a plane trip. It requires very little attention and contemplation to breeze through the passages. I know I am practically alone in my opinion, but as a seasoned reader I would suggest that if reading is your most beloved pastime this will probably disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not anybody I want to know about.","review":"If Ms. O'Faolain would stop name-dropping for a minute and talk about her actual life, I have no doubt this could be a readable tale. However, she seems to define her life by whom she knows, whom she hung out with back in the day, and long lists of literary works and authors she is familiar with. Now, I don't know a whole lot about Irish and English writers of the 19th and 20th centuries, and maybe if I did, I'd care more about what Ms. O'Faolain has to say about them, but I stopped reading this at Chapter 9.Semi-redeeming qualities: the author seems quite candid about her experiences, and especially her failings as a young person. She is not trying to gloss over things or paint herself in a better light. She looks back on herself from a feminist perspective and discourses on how women were just becoming able to have prospects for a life besides getting married and popping out a bunch of kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and self-pitying","review":"I read this for a book club and not a SINGLE person in our group liked this pretentious, self-pitying woman who can't write. We didn't like her book either!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whingings of a WestBrit wannabe","review":"Just another long winded whinge about the 'sins of our fathers'(and mothers). I'll give it 2 stars for the occasional artful turn of a phrase but there is no great read here. Do yourself a favor and spend your money on a Dilbert cartoon book, or the like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"This book came highly recommended to me since I seem to be drawn to Irish authors. Although I kept reading because I was waiting for the book to get better,I finally just gave up and quit! The author seemed to define herself by who she slept with. I was completely disappointed in this book and would not recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading","review":"I found this book worth reading. She writes well and has some interesting insights into relationships and life in general. I cannot understand, however, how a woman who has accomplished so much professionally and personally could remain so adolescent in her attitudes about men. She still seems to lack a firm sense of self -- perhaps a hold over from a miserable childhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need a Broom to Sweep up all the Names Dropped","review":"Being \\"one generation off the Bog\\", I purchased this book with some anticipation of delight. Unfortunately I found none. I found the book rambling, boring and fragmented. O'Faolain touches on her family's issues and relationship strains but fails to make them interesting enough to care about. She touches on her challenges as a female professional in modern day Ireland but fails to delve deeply enough for the reader to draw any conclusion. She bounces around the father-daughter conflict but so tepidly it made me think she was afraid to hurt his feelings. Each issue or topic she touched, she did so lightly, leaving the reader without anything to chew on.She occassionally has writing great moments, making it clear her writing is far superior to what she presents in this book. I am disappointed she didn't treat us to more of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and depressing","review":"Memoirs of more or less \\"ordinary\\" people can be interesting and involving as Frank McCourt, Rick Bragg and Russell Baker, among others, have proven.(I wish I could think of some women to add to this list). But simply naming obscure Irish poets and writers without fleshing them out for the reader leads to an attitude of \\"who cares?\\". There was not a single character in this book who was not a victim, predator, petty, repressed, deluded, or in some other way unlikeable. Unfortunately, this includes the author. I give an extra star for the occasional beautifully written passage; I wish there were more of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I also was quite disappointed with this book. I'm one of those readers who never aborts finishing a book once I've started, but I really have had to force myself to continue with Are You Somebody and it's taken forever to get through it. The autobiography is extremely dis-jointed, I thought, with no apparent attempts by Ms. O'Faolain to provide context for the events she describes. This frustrating style made it impossible to connect with the author. Not an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely disappointing","review":"For all her laundry lists of books she has read and famous people with whom she has hobnobbed, the author's own writing is sadly lacking in insight. I might have enjoyed reading her newspaper columns much more, but none were included here. I found the tale of her youth and schooling vague, disjointed, and scattered. A professional critic might use words like \\"undeveloped\\" and \\"immature.\\" Sorry, I just can't understand all the hype about this book. Readers would do better to return to Joyce's \\"Dubliners.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I could barely finish this book.","review":"After reading pages of pages of description(too much details at times) of author's acquaintances(4,5 people in one page!) of who they are, how she came to know, etc., I just get tired. It also seems like the topic jumps around, and I found it hard to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"turgid and meandering","review":"Nuala O'Faolain is one of Ireland's better journalists, but her memoirs are so dull. Why did she think anyone would be interested in her fairly average life? The copy of the book I bought (because I tend to love all things Irish)included some of her regular columns - which were brilliant and are the reason I gave this book one star instead of none."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get through...","review":"I found this book's subject matter to be interesting (growing up in Ireland, growing up in general) but I found the narrative disjointed. A tracable story line, connectedness for characters throughout the book and explanatory notes on just who some people and what some places are (I'm sure I'm not the only one who didn't know) would have helped this book a great deal. I think that the author is a good WRITER...but the book to big, sprawling and disconnected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"After being completely charmed by 'Are you Somebody?\\" I was expecting at least a well-written decent read. Instead this book was disjointed, rambling, went into highly irrelevant personal details, and didn't seem to have much of a point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have to agree with one of the other reviewers that the work is tedious and the constant namedropping is a major distraction.

It measures 5 1/8\\" long and has a low-profile 3/8\\" thick head. The direction switch is thin and sits in a shallow recess so it doesn't get in the way and has firm enough detents to keep it in position while in use.

I wouldn't want to ruin any of it for you by telling the story. The H&H are good people, with very different and exciting personalities. The story builds up into passionate love. I enjoyed all the supporting characters as well. As a romance story, I had to give it 5 stars. It's a happy and satisfying read; I was never bored and never scanned any parts of it. The hero is very tall, handsome, masculine, enticing, & rich and I ALWAYS WANT the men described as such. BUT, my only change would be to make Devon not sooo tiny. Can't ladies in romantic stories just be regular heights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Inconsistent","review":"This book was a mixed bag for me. At times, the author was able to create some surprisingly engaging and witty dialogue between the characters. And at other times...well, the language was so insipid and contrived that I couldn't quite believe it was written by the same person. Furthermore, there is absolutely no logic affirming any of the main character's actions. Everything (especially how they \\"fall in love\\") sort of \\"just happens\\" as if it were a miraculous occurrence. No explanation (at least no plausible one) is offered. We are left assuming and guessing about what happened behind the scenes, which is an absolutely dreadful literary conceit for this genre. Romance novels, as they are, are already absurd (it's what makes them fun). Samantha James didn't even bother trying to address these logical fallacies. Incredibly frustrating albeit brief read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes entertaining, sometimes embarrasing.","review":"Both this book and its companion, The Perfect Groom, require a little more work.

Just checked out the previews now, hasn't lost it's appeal. Real distinctive sound, a perfect match to the name. White Birch was also good but Frigid Stars is definitely the one to get. There was so much great music back then... blows my mind. People compare this to Slint but if you like this you should also check out the mighty Bitch Magnet and Seam (Sooyoung Park's next band). Some real similarities there... Such cool and unusual music. Good times!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollow repetitions","review":"2 1/2Pretty unnecessary for anyone but the most devoted to all things \\"slow-core\\"- they sound similar to a second rate Idaho, with more distortion used to drown out less melody. The band's attempt at entrancing through underwhelming, heavily-and-hardly-strung chord changes and depressing vocalizations almost always come across simply as a redundant burden rather then a pleasure.

Some of the dialogue gets too technical thus making the film lame and boring. Next the special effects are weak and action is little in this film.

It would be easy to write off Beat Happening as amaturish or \\"cutesy,\\" but there's something rather refreshing in their simplicity. The innocence of the lyrics and the hypnotic guitars are so passionate and joyful that it proves this band utilized their strengths to maximum effect and truly believed in their art.

As usual Lyn McDonald has made fine use of first hand accounts and draws you into the story from the very beginning. I found the book to be well researched and presented and it sits proudly in my library along side 1914, 1915, the Somme and the rest of her great books.

The plot skips from one heist failure to another, but delivers little in the way of action or witty dialogue. Val Kilmer is given little to do as our bad guy and Christian Slater isn't cool enough as the good guy. The film suffers from a poor script and horrendously uninspired directing. Watching it is kind of like watching someone go through their morning routine. It does all it needs to do, but doesn't add anything interesting.

I don't know who found this director, but they should have left him in Yugoslavia. I sure hope this isn't the best Yugoslavia has to offer. No, seriously. This director has no real talent. It seems that someone just taught him how to use an editing system. The director had no concept of what transitional effects to use, so it appears that he tried them all.

Slater and Val Kilmer were both in \\"True Romance\\", which happens to be one of my favorites. My hopes were extremely high. To say I was disappointed, would be an understatement. The dialogue was hokey, the car scenes were hilarously bad, and the movie in general is awful. Do NOT buy this movie, do NOT rent it, and your time would be wasted if you watched it anywhere.

There was just too many characters to keep track of, characters that were not central to the whole storyline and it just made the whole story muddled and over-complicated.

I live in Arizona where this book is based, and actually felt like it was some kind of travel manual. There were far too many details and not enough story line.The first chapter of any novel should grab the reader and leave them wanting more. In this case, the reader has no clue what the 1st chapter has to do with the story line until long into the book. In fact, the book's description is completly misleading to the real story. The author did a poor job of giving the reader enough clues to keep the story moving. It begins with a double murder, but that isn't even the main plot.

Compare the two products-Leigh: ..., does adjustable pins, through, sliding, and hlaf blind - all included.PC 7116 - $329, but you need several hundred dollars in additional attachments to make the same sets of joints.I'm not one to cut corners, and I don't buy tools because they're cost-effective. I buy tools that do their jobs well. In the case where two tools work equally well, though, buy the one that is less expensive, very well made, and takes up less space in your shop.I've noticed a perponderance of \\"rave reviews\\", without much commentary on the shortcomings.

I will NEVER forget the wife who melted down the soap scraps for the help to use and recycling aluminum foil, and those wigs so stupid but funny in that 80s way.

Call it \\"Lionsgate Syndrome.\\" The studio dredges out this film from their vast resevoir, a film in slight demand from a sentimental audience (I do love the 80's), and just-well, transfers it. No clean-up whatsoever. The original film stock in all of its grainy, fuzzy-looking glory are presented here, available for public purchase for the first time on DVD (as of 2002).The fact that it's available on DVD is obviously not to amass consumer respect, but rather to make a speedy dollar; there are no extras (not even a film trailer!), no actor biographies, no movie stills, none of the cheap-o extras one expects from a cheap DVD-just the badly transferred movie.

There is a lot of space between the sides of the case, and if you drop the case, it pops open 100% of the time (even from 2 feet above the ground). When I test dropped it, I could just feel the psp getting damaged. I'm telling you, it stinks!!! If you want a great case, get a Playgear Pocket. 99% of all psp owners who have a case have a Playgear Pocket. It has the shape of the psp and is a lot less bulky. You can charge the psp while its in the case!!!! It feels like you are just holding the psp, except you have a full proof protection around it. You can even put pictures inside the Playgear pocket so you can see them. It's basically a decal thing. Do me a favor, just don't get the Intec PSP Safe Case.

This happened twice to me. AVOID BUYING THIS!!! But my psp fits in here so maybe those other peoples cases are different. GO RED SOX!!! Also the strap is just plain terrible and it's really short when it's strapped on. The case keeps hitting you side when you walk so that's definetly a minus.

Other than that it is an OK case as long as you store a umd in the mesh area to keep the PSP snug and in place. (ONLY PUT 2 UMD's in the mesh part, Doubling them up to store 4 will put excess pressure on the Screen.) Im sure you can find a camera bag that will work better but this seems to be ok till something nicer comes out.This case will hold 3UMD's (4 counting the one in the PSP), cleaning clothand your earbuds allong with the PSP.All in all this is more of a replica of their case for the Nintendo DS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Case For Butter Fingers!!","review":"This is a definately a must purchase with your psp purchase.

Less number of games available, and they are costlier than V-smile games.I got this Feb 2009 for my kid, before mar 15 the right pedal is broken, it lost its threads. We have to throw it.

But that was one day. After about 30 min. of use it quit working, changing batteries, reassembling, nothing worked. I would have chose to return it for a functioning toy except for one fact: IT ONLY OPERATES ON BATTERIES!!!!! I do not know what madman at Fisher-Price made this a design choice, but they must be getting kick-backs from the battery industry. It was a nice toy for the age group, but the expense of maintaining battery power is crazy, they should have at least an option of a power adapter. Stop and think about it. Who would be able to get a X-Box, a Playstation, Wii, or even a computer if your only power option for it was D-cell batteries?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"Santa brought this toy to my then 4 year-old son because we live in an area that snows heavily for 6 to 7 months of the year. He saw commercials and thought it looked fun and we thought it would be good exercise for him. We put it together and after about 15 minutes of riding it, one pedal came off. We were able to put it back on and the other fell off a few minutes later; and it happened immediately again. Time got away from us before we tried to put the other back on, again, and now it won't go back on and it's most likely too late to return it. He literally got about 20 minutes use out of it and it's not the cheapest toy on the block!

The graphics are terrible, and gameplay is slow and much more simple than initially expected. And, as other reviewers have mentioned, the lack of ability to actually save progress on games played makes for frustrating repetition.Over the past 9 months my son has probably played with this toy about 5 times, at no more than 15 minutes each.I can definitely see where some children would actually enjoy this bike, but it seems to be more of a novelty than anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly Dissapointed","review":"THis toy must have Battereis to operate.

He's 3, knows all his letters and numbers, so I wasn't sure he'd really be that into it. He jumped on the bike, was so excited, but he couldn't get the pedals going. He rides a regular bike with no problems whatsoever (and has been for nearly 2 years), but couldn't maneuver the pedals very well at all. The metal parts holding the pedals are too short and make their movements difficult. If you have a child with average to long legs, I would not suggest getting this toy for them. I think educationally it is great and I think the idea of getting kids moving some while playing video games is great, but it needs some improvements for taller kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"For All Parents of Preschoolers","review":"My 4.5 year old boy needs a little more resistance than the pedals give. He likes to push hard and def. makes the pedals work hard. One of the pedals fell off after 2 months of use, but easily fixable. He not always chooses the most educational programs but at least he is being physically challenged while watching TV. He is addicted to TV, like most kids, so this was a great middle ground for us. I also like the fact that he has learned how to use it himself so his technological skills are being utilized. It was worth the purchase and I feel 4-5 is the perfect age. It is def. too complex for my 2.5 year old. It was relatively easy to put together. I would recommend this to all parents of preschoolers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea....poor execution","review":"My wife purchased this toy from Walmart. I assembled it for our 4 year old daughter Christmas morning. I was impressed with the quality of the bike itself however I was only able to get the electronic game part to work for several minutes before it stopped responding altogether. Our daugther was thrilled to try the bike but was obviously disappointed that the games did not work. We returned it for another and this one only worked for about 5 minutes, literally !!! The problem seems to be the on/off switch. The game will boot up and play and then in the middle of a game it will just shut off. I will fiddle with the on/off switch and can sometimes get the game to come back on but what a disappointment for both us and our daughter. We're bringing this piece of crap back to Walmart.

We wanted her to be active indoors because the Florida summer is too hot to be outside. It was easy to set-up and she loved peddling it, but the games were slow, jumpy and didn't keep up with her. She is somewhat advanced in her intellectual development and is accustomed to fast moving games on-line and this just bored her. We turned it on and she wouldn't last 5 minutes, then she would tell us she was bored. She would sit on it and peddle it while watching TV. It's VERY sturdy. We had NO concerns about her safety, but she didn't like the slow games. We just didn't think it was worth the money to keep it. We had it less than 2 weeks, then returned it to the \\"major toy retailer\\" where we had purchased it on sale for $20 less than the current price on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped","review":"This is sad because this should have been a great toy. The concept is brilliant. But the graphics are horrible, the games are boring, and I spend time trying to talk my son into playing it just to justify the money I spent on it. The idea of cycling and playing is wonderful and my son prefers riding it just as much when it is not hooked up as he does while it is. He played it a few times when he first got it, but after the first month, never even asks for it even though it is right by the TV ready to go.

Since then we have replaced batteries twice more. (It's been a week since it arrived at our house).Why did Fisher Price build this without an alternate AC/DC feature? I'd pay extra for it.

He simply has not had much opportunity to enjoy it, as the batteries only last about 1 day. I refuse to keep buying batteries so we are trying to decide whether to pass the problem on to someone else, or wield a soldering iron and add an AC power adapter.The gameplay itself is not really that stellar either. We were not expecting PS3 or XBox type video, but perhaps close to PS2 or Wii quality. We purchased two games and the graphics are really blocky, worse than I remember from the game systems from my childhood even.On a positive note I'm glad they used cartridges instead of DVD's, as small kids destroy them really quickly.I believe they should have built this as a controller for a better system, such as the wii or even the older PS2.

That's the reason I'm giving it such a low rating. You will purchase the toy, and get a less than a week of use before you have to go and purchase four more DD batteries for the unit. Just buying the batteries will cost you another 20-25 bucks a month if your child likes to use it often (an 8-pack of D batteries costs about 15-20 bucks, depending on where you buy it).It's such a waste of money-- a toy that costs this much already and then costs another $300 a year in batteries to run? Bad, bad, design. My son likes it, and I appreciate the fact that it's educational, but it's really short-sighted that the manufacturer didn't use A/C power. Save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy, cartridge could be sturdier","review":"My almost 5 year old son received this as a Christmas present.

So far it is one of the toys that has kept this attention the longest. it does not have an internal memory so your child must start at the first level again but at this point I have not seen it cause any frustration. I actually think that the repetition is good for him. He has the game cartridge that came with the system and the Dora cartridge (which seems to be his favorite) You can purchase this system from a local retailer much cheaper than here and the games are also cheaper.The machine uses 4 D batteries but it also has an auto shut off feature if it is not in use.I think this system will get a lot more use when summer hits (we live in south Florida) when it is just too hot to be outside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Poor Quality Fisher Price Product","review":"This toy did not work.

The concept is a great one but needs electrical hookup. But for me the deal breaker was that it really needs to be made more durable. It didn't last but two weeks and fell apart. They did not mind repeating the games which helped to build their confidence as they mastered more and more.

The first one my son was too young and it was year before he could use it.(my fault) He used it 3 or 4 times and then the games stopped working. I changed batteries and nothing helped. You could hear the game but not see it. I read some reviews that the electrical wiring sometimes messed up.Also the peddles kept coming off. Since I had it for a year there was nothing I could do. I bought another and he used it for about a month and the pedals kept coming off again. Now we have lost the screw on one and stripped the screw on the other. Guess I could make some pedals out of duct tape. I am out $250 for a cycle that my son loves but cant use. They know the pedals are a problem and they have not fixed them.UPDATE: I bought my kid a Nintendo DSi and he loves it only $120 plus some games of course.

My son is on the smaller side, but his feet are at least 5-6 inches away. Needless to say, I had to tape some of his blocks to the pedals.Another issue we have encountered is the key (game)- every time he bumps against it the game turns off.Suggestions for Fisher-Price-Allow for the pedals to adjust (not just the seat)-Somehow design the seat to adjust even closer to the pedals-Make the handle bars adjust according to the seat/pedal adjustmentSuggestions for Parents-If you have smaller children wait until they grow some more, or....-Tape some blocks on the pedals :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"my grandsons favorite","review":"I am so disappointed.

Would get a split blue/black screen, or it would get a garbled screen, or would just shut off all together. Blowing on the contacts of the game would work for a very short time, maybe the play of one game, and then it would do it all over again. This seems to be a common problem and after doing some googling, I found a couple of possible fixes. I haven't tried any of them yet to see if they work but intend to. [...] Either of the solutions I saw, the board and switch being loose and the contacts, need cleaning, seem like that would certainly work.

The troupe also integrated the audience into a few routines, which shows they could've toured if they wanted to, to great success.A final note: this film is remarkable in that it features more of Terry Gilliam on camera (a good thing), and has Eric Idle singing \\"The Lumberjack Song\\", instead of Michael Palin (an interesting thing).

(of course they are often coarse, but that's not the best part of them.) And admittedly if I were a Catholic or Anglican I might not feel the same about the sketch.

Her method of painting is a bit more time consuming but if you don't want to crank out paintings like a production line, this is the way to paint watercolor flowers. They will be worth the extra effort, believe me! My florals have improved dramatically and are worth framing now,so thank you,thank you, Susan. I also have her DVD and the combination book/DVD is wonderful. She isn't afraid to share her many tips and techniques that other artists don't.

She loves it and has played it so much I think she has all the answers on the mirror game memorized because they never change. She has other ones memorized but this one I have actually watched her ply the whole way through. That was the reason for the four stars. My 3 year old also loves it and seems to have a lot of the answers memorized also. They have some of the other games and play them all the same but this one is the only one they seem to have memorized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Other Games","review":"My 5 year old son understands the concepts of this game, but this game is not nearly as entertaining as other 6-8 year old Smartridges from Vetech like Aladdin, Spiderman or Batman. The problem with this game is in the Learing Adventure mode. My son must solve 10-12 spelling words before he moves onto another \\"path\\" or level. He gets frustrated because he is on the same board learning the same skill for an hour or so and then finally gets to move onto a new level. Much too long to keep his interest, so this one sits on the shelf a lot. I would stick with the other games I mentioned above to avoid frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Complicated","review":"I bought this game for my son. I am very dissappointed in it.

They prove themselves in the succesion of Warfield. Sproul, Gerstner & Lindsey devestate the school of Van Till. This work belongs on the shelf of both friend and foe.

The beauty of Lewis' book is that it succeeds as a reasonably thorough quick-reference guide for the major items of clothing and issue gear for the U.S. soldier from 1900-1945. Highly recommended for beginner and \\"expert\\" alike. Handy reference for dating, placing items in your collection or on auction. As stated in previous reviews, do not buy for specific areas - you will not find exhaustive treatment of any one item, but neither is this a cursory \\"quick buck\\" hash you will find on the discount aisle. Color photos would have helped, but probably made the price even more prohibitive. Very well worth the price.

She's four and loved the movie upon which this game is based. Although it isn't her favorite v-smile game, she quite enjoyed it nonetheless. As parents, my wife and I found this game a little more challenging for our daughter in terms of its education value.Probably the most educational game is in the market where Ariana must find different items on a shopping list and then count the number of each particular item needed. There are a number of other great games that involve counting and expanding a child's vocabulary. These are probably the two educational strengths of this particular game, as a child the age towards which this game is intended (4 to 6 years) is probably already familiar with matching and colors -- the other two strengths of this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"We really enjoy this 'smartridge'. It was given to my daughter as a gift. She loves princesses and this is total princess girly. The games are not too difficult for a young child to play.I will say though that I think there are two things that make this game maybe a low five or a very high four as opposed to a high five rating. First- this game is probably the least educational one that I have seen to date. For example, there is one game where you dress Ariel and this is supposed to teach color recognition and matching. Really, it is a form of vicarious dress up. Second- Many of the games seem to focus a lot on colors and this is something most children at this age already know. I would have preferred something a bit more challenging.Otherwise, this game is fun and educational. The games are easy and fun and very girly girly. My young daughter found it fairly easy to operate with little direction from me.Enjoy.Well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best v smile game","review":"I purchased this game, The little Mermaid for my 4 1/2 year old daughter.

He has no reason to - there's no illness or anything in our family, but it was becoming a real problem. And you can't say \\"It won't ever happen\\"!! I found this book and since I brought it home he hasn't put it down. He takes it to bed, reads it every morning and I found him the first day reading it with tears in his eyes. I asked him why he was upset and he said he wasn't, he was really so relieved to know that it didn't all end when you died. This gorgeous book, which tells such a gentle lovely story, has really comforted my son, which is invaluable. Pictures too, which led to a lovely moment where my son and I choose which worlds and which new parents we would have. It's only a small book, very simply written, and may be perceived as too young for kids 8 onwards, but my son understands the principles behind it and wants to explore those.

Years later, it was shown on the A&E channel (about 1992). Since then, I have tried to track it down on VHS or DVD, but no luck (I want it NTSC with English subtitles as I do not speak French). About five years ago, Costa Gravas was interviewed and he stated that its anti-communist message was not welcome in Hollywood, and that the film was being repressed. A bit of research that I did brings out the fact that the film is based on the experiences of Rudolph Slansky, and it is quite accurate as to Stalinist methods of repression. As a movie, it cannot qualify as \\"entertainment;\\" just too gripping and horrifying. It has been compared to the quasi-novel, \\"Darkness at Noon,\\" which was loosely based on the tragedy of N.

I thought it had impressive 3d grafics and all that other stuff but ultimatly all the rotation just made the game confusing. Some of your units don't even do what they tell you. I think all the game comes down to is another bad game like Tiberian Sun. They make it look cool when it isn't really fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"The game is good but the building and all units are the same color and it is hard to tell who is who and what is what. The graphics may look good generally but if you look closely the details on some things are horible! The guys who made that game made the units with diffreent shapes and lines so it make it even harder to see. Units and building are so covered with shapes and lines, that it reminds me of a low budget movie.Also when it is night in the game, You cant see anything! I have a 100% vision my friend and that game is nothing but poop."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST RTS GAME EVER MADE!","review":"I think that this game is the absolute best, and by far the best strategy game on the market. The fully customizable view is a cool addition and the tunneling feature is also very neat. There are also many unique and specialized combinations of unit weapons, shielding, and chassis types. Also, there are tons of research options. The only downside is the unit speech, especially with the Lunar Corporation. Their girlish and stupid voices can get very annoying after a while. Also, the LC's sheilding mechanisms seem to be a bit overly strong. The units also don't build very fast, forcing you to rely more on strategy than on huge troop swarms.

It's a great CD and I have played it many times over. You have to ignore the reviews that bash it because they are trying to compare the music to Led Zeppelin. Of course it sounds like Led Zeppelin. That's where the influence comes from. Is the music as good as Led Zeppelin? Of course not. But it is awesome music from a band that rocked. My big hang up with this new remastered release is the poor packaging, it is about as bland as can be. There are no album credits or liner notes anywhere. Doesn't even list the members of the band anywhere or say who produced it.

What a great c.d.\\"This Beat Goes On/Switchin to Glide\\" is worth the price of it alone but there were plenty of other hi energy pop-rock songs on this release. Have listened to a few of the \\"and more\\" cuts and they sound pretty good too. But i bought it for those Kings songs from original and they still sound great. Those crunching guitars mixed with the organ (a la early Stranglers but more fun) makes you want to get up and party! So get this, stick it in and rock n roll...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...pedestrain fomulae rock. What's the big deal?","review":"I didn't rush out and buy it when the ads hit Rolling Stone. I waited until a few years later & scored a used copy. I see now why they didn't last. Shoot, the guitars don't even have any \\"crunch\\" to them! This really might be fun if played overly loud & you are half-snockered...but other than that it's pretty much formula rock. So were the Ramones. But there was a reason why THEY were around a few more years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY TOO ADVANCED!","review":"This video is really just WAY TOO DIFFICULT. I've been taking 2-3 yoga classes a week for over a year now,,and consider myself to be very flexible. In this tape, you can barely understand the instructor, and she does things like complete splits, headstands, etc. Very bizzarre. I regret my purchase and disposed of the tape after one time using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fish is Back!","review":"After waiting four years for another Reel Big Fish album, it's natural that some fans would get overly excited to a point where no album could ever meet their expectations. What these people fail to notice is that, yes this album may be upbeat in many ways, but what ska album isn't? They experiment with punk a little more than before, and maybe it's a little catchier, but it's still an amazing album. With the exception of a few cheezy lyrics in the opening track, this is Reel Big Fish at their cleverest and wittiest. \\"Lust turns to disgust/A heart of gold into rust/A soft touch to a slap in the face\\". This is a fun, witty album that actually captures a little bit of Reel Big Fish's personality through their biting sarcasm and humor. This is Reel Big Fish's finest album, by far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Style but its better!","review":"For me, this was the best of thier CDs. If you like Turn the radio off, then this might not be for you, but if you liked Why Do They Rock So Hard? then this is right up your alley, only more rocking! Good thing is a great song, as well as somebody loved me, ban the tube top, and cheer up! i love this CD more than all of them. Its really rocking."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was A'ight","review":"This album was okay, but it wasn't great. There was a lot in it that was simply boring, and this CD went pop. I really don't have a problem with pop music, but bands need to stay true to their roots, and instead of simply growing, Reel Big Fish has complete jumping the genre. Ska may not be the best seller, but they should have stayed with what they did best."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheer up..more like grow up!","review":"I just don't understand how they could do this. After two wonderful studio albums, and a compilation of old recordings, I was nothing short of satisfied. Then, excited at a new album, I rushed out and bought \\"Cheer up!\\", expecting nothing short of amazing work from these guys. What I got was a new coaster for my room. Well, after I take off the last few songs on the cd, which were actually good, mostly because they didn't even write a couple of the last few. The feel of this album is fake, and the songs just don't seem like the type a band with members in their late 20's to early 30's would write. Come on guys, I know you can do better...I've heard it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great! (for people who don't like RBF)","review":"This is a great album for those of you that find rhyming strings of words like \\"dreaming\\", \\"breathing\\", \\"feeling\\" and \\"appealing\\" fun to listen to.I absolutely love their older stuff, but am completely embarrased listening to Cheer Up. I cannot imagine how the same band that was able to come up with such fantastic, fun lyrics in their older material could not string together a decent song. Who really wants to listen to New York, New York? I kept waiting for the joke. There's got to be a gag.Well the joke was paying good money for this album.If you like clean, pop music, and are thrilled at Dr Suess level rhyming, this album is for you. I will be waiting for these guys to \\"grow\\" back into something that I can listen to..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love ska but...","review":"i love ska but this cd isnt what i expected. it really isnt that great and i suggest u all save ur money and dont buy this cd"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reel Big Garbage","review":"It's really sad to see a band that could have been the best ska band out there to fall so fast and hard. I have all 3 of there major album releases and still contend that their first album (Turn the Radio Off) is one of the top 5 ska albums of all time. Their first album being so great is what makes this album such a bitter pill to swallow. They have sold out, but I don't know who they have sold out too. The music lacks direction, creativity, or anything necessary to keep your attention. This is uninspiring dribble."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOD AWFUL","review":"I love ska and punk and i love reel big fish. HOWEVER this album is HORRIBLE it isn't even really ska. There is no intragration between the music and the horns. It is just rock with random horns thrown into it. It dosnt sound any good. The only good song is \\"good thing\\" and thats it. Actually the cover is pretty cool too. Other than that the cd is not anygood. Turn the radio off, and why do they rock so hard? are SO MUCH BETTER buy them instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all worth getting","review":"The first two albums are really really great. \\"why do they rock so hard\\" inspired me to learn guitar! (I ended up being too lazy, but anyway...) This album is a major disappointment. It really is pop-ska and it is incredibly uninspired and uninspiring. Listen to the samples and you'll see! These songs are really cheesy, and not in the cool-cheesy way that some of their past songs have been. This is not nearly as bad as britney spears, but it's not really worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"In one word: Awesome.","review":"I don't understand the reasoning behind rating each song individually, and then putting a short little comment beside it. For example, contrary to popular belief, there is in fact a \\"reason for track 13, Sayanora Senorita- TO ENTERTAIN YOU. They are musicians, and this was a way to demonstrate their musicianship.Okay, enough ranting.Cheer Up is my favorite Reel Big Fish album. My main reason for this is that nearly every song relates to me, I can connect it to my life. \\"Valerie\\" is almost verbatim a bad relationship I ended. Cheer Up isn't all catchy horn riffs and clean ska guitar; it's a culmination of ska and rock, a sign that our OC ska buddies are growing as musicians. Take part in the growth and pick up this CD. You won't regret it, I promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISSAPOINTMENT","review":"ok so Turn The Radio Off is one of the best Albums I own, its been worn thin 2 times and repurchased each time. However when the Set Up came out, wow...not bad..not good, going down hill but still in essence Reel Big Fish. They are an awesome band and are amazing to see live, HOWEVER this new album (isnt great), it is total pop and so NOT RBF, there is no fast beat pump you up music, no guitar solos, no real horn section, it has become total pop music and i am extreemly dissapointed with this album. my advice: \\"Scotty DONT\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"New CD with Completley new style","review":"If you are a loyal RBF fan, I doubt that you will enjoy this CD. It is a lot more pop than it is ska. I got it the day it came out and I was sorely disappointed. Although it is good pop music I wouldnt recommend it if you are looking to get a ska album. The catchy lyrics are gone, the RBF style isn't there anymore and there isn't excessive profanity. The album does not make we want to sign along like the other ones either. Even though the style is not their original style the music is still good, just not what I liked in RBF"},{"rating":"2","title":"WORTH THE WAIT","review":"I love RBF! TRUST me they did not let me down with this cd! There's not much more to say, but this cd rocks! I love New York, New York, even though they didn't write it. Fav. songs: Drunk again, cheer up, syonara senorita, suckers, ALL OF THEM!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HOW do they rock so hard????","review":"Happy day! Reel Big Fish is back and they have proven they were not just a fad. Though the ska element of their music is played down in this album, they seem to have come up with a brass/rock hybrid style that is just as, if not more, enjoyable. This is a must have album for any third wave ska fan or anyone who is tired of the monotony of the nu-metal, teenie-pop, and modern rock drudgery that is current pop music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment...","review":"This CD is simply boring! RBF is one of my favorite bands and after seeing them in a couple of concerts which were extremely awesome,I can't imagine going to see them to hear the songs of this aweful, backstreet boys clone of an album. Its so full of pop that there should have been a warning label for us ska lovers stating simply that there was NO SKA. And don't tell me that a few horns in a song make ska music because then salsa music would be ska too.And talking about warning labels... Where were the swearing and the funny bad language to express a point through humor? They truly became an NSync that can play instruments. Soon they will be doing Chili's commercials.Cheer Up should be bought as a gift but not for yourself because you'll end up feeling cheated like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can I \\"Cheer Up\\" when listening to this album.","review":"It really suprises me when people say that this is the best album by RBF. Maybe this is my opinion, but i don't buy RBF CDs to get cheap sounding ska-pop, I buy RBF for the good ska, good lyrics. I don't really care for the cutesy, popish lyrics and this album is not one you can skank to, either. The guys in RBF are some of the most talented musicians out there, i just think that in this album they catered more to the mainstream pop instead of giving us old RBF fans something to skank to and enjoy like previous albums. I am hoping that the next album will be a return to a sound similar to their previous albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"i'm sorry reel big fish boys, i love you, really i do, but you've greatly disappointed me. what happened to the ska? this is by far the worst reel big fish album. when i first heard \\"turn the radio off\\" i feel in love with these guys. i was so excited when they came out with cheer up. i thought \\"a new album! it will be great!\\" well, i was wrong. this cd sounds like the same pop/punk stuff that's on the radio. there are hardly any horns and that's what makes reel big fish wonderful. but this record is just well, not so wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't even listen to this cd","review":"I love Reel Big Fish. I've listened to them for years. This cd is so bad I'm just going to pretend they never released it."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheer up","review":"I got this the day it came out and i wasn't too happy. Most of the songs sound way too much like the ones from \\"Why do They Rock so Hard\\" and but the subjects of the songs aren't funny like RBF usually is. Another reason it doesn't sound like RBF is because they don't use any profanity on this album. Even though I don't think it's that good, if you're a loyal RBF fan, you should still buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This cd would of gotten 5 stars but tracks 10 and 11 are just a strain on the album. I get really into this album and just noding my head and singing along all the way to track 9, and then I have to lose attention of the good songs in order to get through that achapelo and poor attempt to sound like and 80's hair band. I just wonder how they got on this label with such anti that label songs. Then again with other songs like \\"Sellout\\" I kinda saw it coming. Though like most other bands who sign big and realease a new album, this album dosent suck. Such as the case with Blink 182, The Ataris, and so on and so on. This is a great release that shows that they are holding steady to things and the fans that made them famous, not to mention they are some of the nicest guys around. Congratulations on making some money, but not for becoming rock stars. If you like this type of music check out The Mighty Mighty Bostones and Mustard Plug. Long live good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheer up........","review":"well...It been 4 years since reel big fish have released a NEW full length cd. And in this long waiting period, they have lose many fans, and their style has been changed. The new cd is Pop with horns. (THe SKA is lacking) In every song, they complain about how much they [stink], and how life [stinks]. Ok...I bought that theme for the first cd, and got tired for it in the second. But now it's just getting ridiculous. Some songs are good, but the cd is just plain ANNOYING. So even if you have always liked RBF, this cd is definitely questionable."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"this is my first album i bought from RBF and i must say that it literally kicks ass. i can listen to this damn thing front to back, track to track. even songs like \\"New york, new york\\" are tolerable. the horns are awesome, the guitar rifts are bad-ass, and the lyrics are catchy! git it, the album is amazing!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon review a complete joke!","review":"I can't believe the review for Cheer Up! from the editorial thing from Amazon.com. Saying Reel Big Fish now find themselves on the same record company as NSync and Brittany Speers is a complete joke. Reel Big Fish was on Mojo/Jive records way before Nsync and Britany were even signed to Jive. This person should obviously do some research. Anyways, as for the album, it's not \\"Turn the Radio off\\" or \\"Why do they rock so hard\\", or even \\"Everything sucks\\" but it is still a solid album. It is still amazing and shows Reel Big Fish will be around for quite some time. I give it 5 stars cause Reel Big Fish are amazing live and they deserve it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight Ska/Punk/Metal/Accapella/Pop Record","review":"With \\"Cheer Up\\" Reel Big Fish ceases to dissapoint. The variety on this record is amazing. You have classic RBF style songs (\\"Good Thing,\\" \\"Ban The Tube Top\\"), arena rock anthems (\\"Rockin' Roll Is Bitchin'\\"), instrumentals (\\"Sayonara Senorita\\"), and territory RBF have never touched on until this release (the cover of \\"New York, New York,\\" \\"Drunk Again\\"). In a way it's more of a mature record for them. I mean there's no songs like \\"Scott's A Dork.\\" This album shows just how talented RBF really is vocally and instrumentally. If you are new to RBF, I would reccomend picking up \\"Turn The Radio Off\\" or \\"Why Do They Rock So Hard?\\" before \\"Cheer Up\\" because you will appreciate their growth just that much more. I'm not the biggest fan of ska music but RBF will make you sit and listen. Pick up this record it rocks it off the rocking scale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheer Up is amazing!","review":"This is by far my favorite RBF album. it has a little bit of everything, and the Sublime cover of Boss DJ... so much better then jack johnsons version in my opinion. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISSAPOINTMENT","review":"ok so Turn The Radio Off is one of the best Albums I own, its been worn thin 2 times and repurchased each time.

Although i like goldfinger much better than rbf, i like this cd much better than Open Your Eyes. Sure, there's no more fast-paced ska songs such as Beer and All I want is more. But rbf does keep true to all of the energy they have put in their previous releases, unlike goldfinger. You wont be disappointed you bought this cd, but i recommend you buy their previous releases first (they're much better)"},{"rating":"2","title":"where have they been???","review":"cheer up kicks so much major serious [bottom]. it's rbf's best. i can't even review it, it rocks that much. i go nuts listening to the first five songs, they're all so amazing. nice covers of 'new york, new york' and 'boss dj'. the last track is a pleasant surprise as well. please, do us all a favor and purchase this. right now. when you're done reading this, throw it into your shopping cart. you'll thank me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braveheart","review":"This was a good movie - had heart.

I asked the developer, and they said it has nothing to do with the developing process. I am not sure if this is true or not, and Canon doesn't mention this default factor in the manual.

It may matter to some that when you remove a film cartridge, the roll is set to \\"exposed\\", so you can't switch film speeds without sacrificing the remaining shots on the roll being removed.

It just makes more sense coming from her, and whether or not you believe in God, a general higher power, or just the power of positive thought and what it can attract, you can still apply this to your life. The consistent quotes from the Bible were a little irksome at first, but it made the concept of Divine Right a lot more digestable for me. Even if you're a skeptic, give this book a try. Otherwise youll never know what you could be missing out on in your life. Its a beautiful book. Best of luck in manifesting! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Game of Life and How to Play it","review":"I found this book very delightful and fun to read.

Unfortunately, the description of the item is WAY off. It will not \\"fit a 19\\"-28\\" bathtub.\\" The smallest width it would fit is 28\\". Had it fit, I think I would have been extremely pleased with the product. But since I was not able to use it with my 24\\" bathtub, I had to return the item and seek a different bath seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent product","review":"The Carex portable bench is really a very good quality product. The finish of the bench is superior. The size was perfect for the tub. In fact you cannot use it for the shower as advertised but that you can tell when you look at the picture. I am very glad to have acquired this bench thru Amazon... the price was great even with the added cost for freight. I was also impressed by the delivery time, I ordered Sunday and it arrived in Mexico next Tuesday! Thanks for an excellent service, Amazon.com!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unable to use because of tub design","review":"The product itself is of nice quality, however I haven't been able to use it. This bench requires a tub that has a ledge on both sides. Most newer tubs do not have that ledge against the wall, so there is nowhere for that side of the bench to rest on the tub. My recommendation is to check to make sure your tub will accomodate this type of bench before you purchase it. I know now I needed a bench with legs on it. Just something to consider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"Although this product seemed sturdy enough, it did NOT fit my \\"standard\\" size bathtub. I called the manufacture directly and was informed that the \\"front\\" of the tube was too wide (3.5\\" to 4\\"). The bench would not adjust for this width. The advertisement did not mention this, which I think is an important measurement to mention. This is the first item I've ever had to return to Amazon.com. Which buy-the-way was very easy.

The main character is ten and still cannot ride a bike and feels like a failure. I think realistic books such as this one can teach kids that we all have our abilities and disabilities and that were are supposed to love each other based on who we are, not on what we can or cannot do. I reommend teachers and librarians buy this book for kids ages 8-11."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing Directions","review":"The other review is right. I bought this product specifically to do box joints and finally gave up after three hours. It is fairly easy to set up and nicely made. I have not tried the dovetail joint template yet, so maybe it is better. But please, someone at Porter Cable re-write those directions. They are not very clear. For example, there are six bolts used in the construction of the jig. Two are shorter than the others. No mention of this in the directions or where to put them. Also the lock nuts used to secure the templates do not move easily. I switched them with the regular nuts. But there is no mention of how to secure the template with those locking nuts in the directions. Had to figure that for myself. Most of the products in my shop are from Porter Cable but this item probably should not have been one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cut great dovetails in no time","review":"Purchased this unit 2 months ago based in part on review in 'Fine Woodworking'. Haven't regretted the decision. Followed instructions (which are very good)and was cutting great fitting half-blind dovetails in 1/2 hour! Note: Router guide bushing is NOT included, and must be purchased separtely. Further note: Correct bushing is NOT inluded in PC bushing set (go figure)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect joints, imperfect instructions","review":"Based on some user reviews on Amazon about the time it takes to set up and use the jig, I timed myself last night from opening the box to reading the instructions to assembling the jig to making my first dovetails to making my first drawer. It took 1/2 hour to assemble, and in under two hours I had completed an entire drawer, including cutting the dado for the drawer bottom and gluing the whole thing up.There are a couple of flaws in the instruction manual, but if you take your time and use common sense, you'll be able to work through them just fine.For those who are looking to get into dovetails for the first time, I would recommend this machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"setup and instructions","review":"Once the product was out of the box, the assembly instructions were fair, they weren't the greatest. I was making nice fitting joints in less than 30 minutes. Unless you have some decent mechanical skills, the directions for assembling the jig can be better. Once set up correctly I did encounter a problem with the jig's edge guide moving on me. To keep any settings from moving on you, I highly recommend that you use some Locktite on the bolts and the nuts since there is no actual mechanical locking devices there. Other than the corrected problems I found the jig to be dollar for dollar a fine value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed and manufactured!","review":"Well I bought because of the Porter Cable name. Problems appeared around the 5th drawer...the problem is due to the poorly manufactured left side adjustment bracket, it's only held in place by one poorly located screw, the bracket flexes enough to create a bunch of problems. The second problem with the jig is in the clamp down plastic knobbed clamps (2 of them stripped out) and the clamp is not hefty enough to hold work pieces in place...I suspect the plastic knobs stripped because the clamp flexed enough. Save your money and avoid this product. It's time consuming to setup and frustrating to keep it aligned. I've designed tools over my life time and this is an example of how a pretty simple jig can be messed up by improper selection of materials and poor execution in the manufacturing and test of a product. Oh, and my experiences with the random orbit palm sander by Porter Cable...uugggghhhhh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good beginner dovetail machine","review":"If you're looking for a good beginner dovetail machine this is it. It is well made and easy to use. The biggest thing they could improve upon are the thumb screws. These should be locking cams. That aside the instructions are the best thing. There are a lot of cheap dovetail machines out there, but the ones I've seen have horrible instructions... The instructions are very clear and even tell you how to adjust you setup if your joints are loose or too tight. A great buy that I reccommend to everyone looking for a good first dovetail machine. Once you master this then you can get the Leigh Jig."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera!

Can be fully automatic or as manual as you like. Currently three types of film available, ASA 200 and 400 in color, and black and white film. Print quality is comparable to 35mm for prints up to very large sizes (roughly 2 foot by 3 foot sizes.) Film is easily loaded, and can be changed from one roll to another midroll.

The previous two were \\"Amanda Miranda\\" and \\"Fair Weather: A Novel.\\" I disliked both tremendously, so I didn't have too high of hopes for this book. The summary of \\"The River Between Us\\" sounded intriguing and full of mystery, yet neither of those elements surfaced within the book. Peck's writing style is staccato and bland, and I couldn't warm up to any of the characters. I was often confused, and I had to reread the first chapter to understand the last chapter. I truly feel this book was an utter waste of time.

Cass, the main character's younger sister, has visions and all sorts of weird things. I do not want to expose my children to that. Another character also reads cards and supposedly has second sight. These things are occultic to me. Therefore I cannot recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WHAT Disco Band?

I DJ a wide variety of music for different parties and events and I know the past hits, as well as current hits of today. It really had a \\"Countdown Singers\\" feel to this one - and trust me it isn't a good feeling - and there seems to have been a reason why no one remembers this \\"Super Disco Band\\" in the first place. After listening to this group of 30-second samples, I was not feeling it at all. I personally would not recommend this one, for any one. Unless, of course, you mean it as a practical joke to drive someone crazy by having it play over and over and get irritating like fingernails on a chalk board.

After all, how tempting is it to have 5 seasons worth of episodes instantly available! So much better than buying individual episodes and cheaper than buying each year separately. It is an incredibly long stretch between seasons, and a 5-year set provides a lot of viewing!The downside, and the reason for 4 stars, is that at this point, it would be better to buy the series in Blu-Ray, as the HD format wars are over, and with the final season coming, it seems sort of weird to buy such a \\"so close but yet so far\\" set.

The songs on this cd are all entirely rechanneled, which really surprises me to find them like that here. Collectables goofed up very badly on this cd.

It amazes me that this author can write so insightfully on such widely diverse subject areas as he has in his last several books. The book jacket doesn't say anything about his being a lawyer, so I suspect he isn't, but his grasp of the state of justice in America today is downright uncanny.One of the reasons I love to read him is that I always come away learning something while having a rollicking good time. After reading this book, I feel almost like an expert myself, on both federal criminal law and the increasingly important topic of computer encryption, which I'd heard about but didn't really understand until now.Also as with his prior works, you can read this book on many levels: pure entertainment, an incisive commentary on our legal system, a surprisingly touching love story, or all at once.Either way, it's a gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"Unless you like reading technical manuals, you will not find much of interest in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Specification Size","review":"Which is correct the title size 9 x 14 or the specification size 6 x 12???????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda weak","review":"This is the first review I submit to this site.

It was easy to read,it really makes you think and possibly even change your mind about who you thought were Baseball's greatest players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting!","review":"This is an exciting book because it gives concrete answers about questions many fans have been asking for a long time, and it offers hard facts to go along with them. More than that, it shows exactly how far statistics can be used in evaluating players. For instance in the comparison of Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams, Barra shows us how far the numbers lean toward Williams but non-quantifiable factors favor DiMaggio. My other favorite chapter is about the 1986 Mets, \\"The Dynasty That Never Was.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too preachy","review":"The author, Allen Barra, is a stats geek. Which means he spends page after page (after page after page...) cherry-picking different formulas to prove that he is right and you are wrong. You think Mays was better than Mantle? NO, YOU'RE WRONG! You think Gibson was better than Marichal? SORRY, YOU ARE WRONG!! And so on and so forth.Why can't these guys ever just admit that they don't know the answer to the questions they pose? Just once I wish Barra would have said, \\"To be honest, I have no idea who was better, Mays or Mantle.\\" Because the truth is, Allen Barra has no idea who was better, Mays or Mantle.Anyway, this has all been done before (better, if just as annoyingly) by Bill James. At least James has a sense of humor and a light touch around the typewriter. Barra comes off sounding like a nagging spouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Daring Look at some longstanding questions","review":"Allen Barra deserves credit for taking a look at baseball's hard questions and making some unconventional stands on the issues. Barra's evaluation of Babe Ruth is particularly interesting and has already created the biggest stir. Yet, Barra uses statistics every step of the way to illustrate his points. In the end, Barra succeeds at what any book of this type aims to acomplish: he forces you to think. In order to disagree with his assertions, you must return with evidence to support your position. In a world where so many fans and sportswriters shoot from the hip with little understanding of what statistics are important and which are trivial, Barra's use of statistics is mostly credible and well-thought out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A New York State of Mind","review":"There is baseball outside of NYC but you'd never know it from this obnoxious one-sided book.

The interviews present invaluable information regarding parents and teachers inattentative to down right ignorant responses to gangs in schools. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in studying the complexity of gangs in suburbs, as well sociologists who are looking for a good take on why such children get involved in deviant acts such as gun fights and drug deals.

You'll Catch Your Death is unbelieveably bad with splodges, scratches, lines wobbling all over the picture making it almost unwatcheable.I would give the content of the DVD 4 stars but the quality makes this really 0 stars.Watching these episodes is definitely not time well spent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good stuff!","review":"I bought this at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland this weekend. (It's the source, per this DVD, of Don Kirschner's greatest regret, that being that he hasn't been enshrined there. He should be, and would be if he was more popular amongst his peers, but I digress...)The longest piece on this two-disc set has incisive comments by the greats of the Brill Building songwriters (Goffin and King, Greenwich and Barry, Weill and Mann, etc.), as well as rare comments from Mary Weiss of the Shangri-Las and many others. It's in must-see territory.The rest of the pieces on the discs are Biography-style (this being from A&E's Biography unit, after all) shows on Dionne Warwick, Bobby Darin, Burt Bacharach and Lieber & Stoller. All of them are well done, though not as incisive as the centerpiece.A&E skimps on extras, and they do so here again. A shame, as with decent extras I'd give this one 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"every penny's worth it !\\"","review":"The Music is sensational, could keep on listening over and over.

I watched it with my brother on New Year's Eve. At that time, we thought the movie was hysterical. I always had a great memory of that New Year's Eve, and this movie was part of that memory. However, after purchasing the movie and reviewing it 50 years later, it lacks the same hysteria of my youth. Granted there are some cleverly funny scenes, and the lack of continuity 50 years ago added to the hilarity. However, today, I understand the reason for the lack of continuity, and I can see that there is a bit too much filler to make this any type of movie of lasting quality. I'm glad I purchased it to try to relive a memory, but I really can't recommend the movie for someone who does not already have a nostalgia twinge associated with the film or the play. The low rating is no fault of Amazon or the vendor. The quality of the product is good. It's just that the content is outdated."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest","review":"I watch this film, and I can see where Ernie Kovacs came from. I also note that a lot of the gags and set up in the film spilled over into the Warner Brother's cartoons of the era, and much later, with references to the way the film is being used. Not the camera, the film itself (to be understood if you see the DVD).This was based on a Broadway play, it was a shapeless play, was different every night and before it became a movie had the distinction of running longer than any other broadway play.Describing it only tends to spoil the viewing you will have later. I knew about the movie as a rumor and as a \\"you have got to see this film!!\\" kind of introduction. Some of the best dancing you will ever see on film.Many laughs, much fun. Martha Raye is pretty good, though the \\"weirdness\\" of being a man chaser seems a little dated, and I met a few like that and didn't react the way it's placed in the film...(oh, never mind)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accuracy","review":"Mattel is starting to get things right with the above collection....all the details from ethnic features down to makeup and shoes.

I hesitate in posting bad reviews because I'm an author too and I know that bad reviews hurt. The trouble is this novel's lead character is not at all an accurate reflection of her period. If you haven't spent your life researching the nineteenth century like I have, you wouldn't know better, and the novel would be quite enjoyable.

I wished it would be over and skimmed some parts.","review":"REVIEWER'S OPINION:There was too much civil war history. I'd prefer less history and more character interaction - for a romance novel. Sometimes there was too much time spent in the heads of the characters. For example, Jesse was thinking about all the political and slavery issues about to happen before the civil war. Jesse and Kiernan loved each other. She kept denying it to herself and claimed she hated him because he was on the side of the Yanks. Even though she loved Jesse, she married Anthony, and then cried afterwards. I didn't care for her judgment and actions.DATA:Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: eight.

Finding this unforgivable Kiernen turns her back on her love and marries another. As the war goes on Kiernan becomes a widow and is responisble for her husbands brother and sister and just when things are getting real bad Jesse rides up and saves the day (or at least the Plantation).The story is strong and a lot of past history is woven in throughout between all of the characters.

The drawer barely went together as most of the predrilled holes are in the slightly wrong location.

It comes in kit form and requires careful study of the instructions before assembly which took about an hour with some help from another person. The resulting cart is handsome and sturdy. The black, full-size microwave countertop oven that I purchased to go on top fits so well that most people think that the two, cart and the microwave, were purchased together and made for each other.

Not worth the $140, i wouldnt even pay $10 for this, had I known how poorly constructed this cart is.

So, not only are you getting a book without up-to-date information, you're getting a book in the hyperbolic, judgemental style common to so many history books written in the 19th century. Unless you are a serious scholar of Dutch history, which means you need to read just about everything on the topic, this book is a waste of money. I spent five minutes flipping through my copy and returned it immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful!","review":"OH MY GOSH!

This was the first Jancso movie where his traditional long takes were first developed and perfected. Jancso teemed up with a fresh-out-of-school cinematographer, who was just as eager to break with traditional filmmaking. Indeed the end result is mesmerizing cinematography. Even if you don't get the complex story at your first viewing the movie still leaves with a great impact. If you want to learn about cinema techniques you must see this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silence and Cry","review":"This,Silence and Cry, has got to be one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen.

Sebadhoh's Bakesale is quite different than anything they have ever done before, but that is cool as hell!! First off, \\"Not a Friend\\" is one of the most heartbreaking and beautiful songs I have ever heard. \\"Careful\\" is powerful, especially the line, \\" And God only knows, I need a blance\\". The album is perfection from the first line Lou sings in \\"Liscense to Confuse\\", where he expresses, \\"I'm not attractive today, I'm not a sight for sore eyes\\". Lou Barlow is our generation's Lou Reed.

What that review does not share is how Graham Joyce has managed to update a familiar tale (Conrad's HEART of DARKNESS) and, in the process, completely and ravishingly made it his own.The plot, the graceful (writerly) style, the characters - each a 'person in full', although Dan Innes, the novel's core protagonist, really shines. Moreover, there is the novel's sub-text: Graham Joyce has important insights to share about our relationships with each other -- parent:child(ren), child:parent, friend:friend, lover:lover, etc. And that is not the end of the treasure trove Joyce has gifted us; many rewards await the discerning reader.SMOKING POPPY has so much to say and says it so well.

It was extremely interesting to work through and the size of it is not daunting whatsoever. It gives the reader a structure and a well-thought out process to work through to define what one's passion actually is - not an easy thing for many of us! In fact, it's a wonderful book to help you define yourself - especially if you have had life changes or feel stale and in need of a change.It's rather hard to find the perfect job until you define what lights you up on every level.

Out of the numerous videos we checked out from the library or borrowed from friends, Jack is the ONLY one that our son wanted to watch again and again.

The instructions were for a Fence that was different than the one I received. The dust port does not fit my Rigid Shop Vac nor can I find any adapters that will work.

Bigger routing projects take a lots of immagination on this table. 4- This tble should only be about $80. And that's for the decent extrusions on this table.I have given up on this.

Prior to buying VacuVin, my red wine bottles would last a maximum of 1-2 days if immediately re-corked, and white wine a few days longer if refrigerated. Now, my red wine is good for up to a week, and the white wine lasts even longer. The device is very simple - it pumps air through a plastic cork to re-create the original pressure prior to opening. Simple to use, and the corks are easy to rinse. Perfect for single people like me who don't want to drink a full bottle in one sitting, or who may switch from red one night to white the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed after 100","review":"The Concerto worked well for about the first 50 bottles then seized up.

Although the concept is spot on, there's a problem with the rubber o-ring inside the pump - it will slide out of place and jam up the pump so that it becomes unusable. My first one lasted about 9 months before that happened, so I was willing to try again. The second one, however, lasted less than a month before the o-ring slipped and the pump jammed.

These is nothing you can do with a half a bottle of oxidized wine except throw it out or settle for vinegar. If you want that wine to taste good in the morning, buy yourself a Vacu Vin Concerto Wine Saver. It will keep your opened bottles of wine fresh for days. If you called the cab, you won't have to share the wine. If you let her stay, the next time she leaves will be with half your stuff! The Vacu Win Concerto Wine Saver will save you a lot of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works better than I expected!","review":"Reviews were promising but I was skeptical whether the tops would hold their seal and if red wine would last longer than a couple of days.

Definitely worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An extremely successful scam","review":"I didn't think to question or research this wine preserver until after I received it. The principle SEEMS valid, but once I received it I questioned how effectively it actually evacuates air from the bottle. Then my research revealed questions about the stopper's ability to maintain what vacuum there is. So, I did a simple test. I pumped all the air out of a bottle that the unit was capable of and let it sit for a few hours. After only maybe 6 hours, the stopper was so easy to pull out (without releasing pressure first) there is no way there was much of a vacuum at all left in the bottle. At least it was cheap, but this unit is a complete scam. An incredibly successful and profitable one at that, it seems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't work","review":"This product, and those like it, simply don't work.

I have had 3 of these Concertos and ALL of them have had the pump arm freeze (lock up with no movement in both directions) within 2 weeks of owning them. When they worked they did the job and the new \\"click\\" feature seemed to be a real winner.... But needless to say the design is a real junker and needs major re-design. I would use the standard Vacu Vin device in lieu of this new \\"Bomb\\". I am a wine maker and sware by the vacu vin process despite this bad design."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Click","review":"I've been using the Vacu Vin for probably about as long as they've been making them, and still had a good one with plenty of stoppers before I bought this \\"Concerto\\" model. I bought it because of the \\"click\\" the user is supposed to hear when the right amount of air has been pumped out of the wine bottle, for the obvious reason that I didn't want to keep pumping when there was no need to. The problem is that after using this model multiple times, I have yet to hear it click, so I might as well have just stayed with the older device I had. Since this thing is apparently clicking away for most reviewers, my case is probably just an isolated one (or maybe in my advanced years I'm just not robust enough to pump to the click--though I'm skeptical that that's the problem)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"We have had this for a few weeks now, and works well.

It seems to have just wandered through the filming without any direction or motivation. Jimmy Bones decapitates two of his victims at one point, and the heads start talking in a pathetic attempt at humor that does not fit in at all with the genre. The legend is barely explained as JB wreaks his revenge on his friends who were forced at gunpoint to let him die, or die with him. He should have stayed dead.

The wild dances of the character with flaming neon red hair and the choreography are highly stylized. Francis Ng (A Man Called Hero, One Last Dance) is a stagehand with a long list of past loves. His newest is Tian who assumes the role, but his previous love was the girl who was killed.

Restore your vinyl before you buy this CD, as the quality is in poor fake stereo, sounds swishy & phasey, plus the rare 45 tracks sound like they were taped off of an old turntable with a remote mic. The material here is half & half, either quite good, or quite weak and ome are simply poor take-offs of \\"Oh How Happy\\". I bought this, yet will listen to my restored vinyl instead. Good to see this release, but you'll most likely be disappointed in the sound quality...maybe someday they'll find masters for this.A Dick Bartley CD has a new stereo version of \\"Oh How Happy\\" but I prefer the LP/original single version with substantially more bass/drums. It has a good beat! For some reason this mix has been overlooked by time and present oldies stations and they play a weaker accapella version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely needs updating","review":"As someone who teaches Blackberry usage, I found this book useful for some really, really, basic info, but it just doesn't go far enough.

What a mistake!!! The filmsy material the shoe is made from are already wearing, and since the manufacturer skipped out on putting metal rings where your laces thread through the shoe within two months my laces tore through the thin layer of material that held it!

They still give good arch support and the assembly quality seems okay, but only time will tell how they hold up to daily use.

AWFUL!","review":"I don't understand how this book got so many good reviews! It was awful! Let me list the things that I hate about this book..No battle at the end.No armies.Stupid puzzles.I actualy felt sorry for the bad guy, he just got tricked and creamed so many times, he's hardly a threat to the good guys! He keeps getting crushed by these pirates, his army betrays him to the pirates, and the 5 good guys show up in the end and totally destroy the rest of the bad guys army, the pirate's ship, and the bad guy himself! It was pitiful! In all, this book was terrible, I only gave it one star because it had a cool swordfight in the end. Skip this book! Read the other Redwall books though, they're good {except for Loamhedge, it's bad too}."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever","review":"When I bought this book, I expected a good Redwall story, and I was not disappointed.

In the group, there were two traitors who end up escaping from the ship with the pearls. The pearls finally ends up at redwall.Then the story unfolds from the captured abbot to the riddles of the pearls to the journey of a warrior mouse. Would they find the pearls in time to exchange them for their abbot or will Martin do something about it? you'll just have to find out by reading this amazingly well written story.First of all this was a great book, the way the story is written kept me coming back for more. The suspense found in the extremely clever riddles is only one of many factors that made this book a real page turner. Overall i think this book is great, but not the best compared to the other Redwall books i've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pearls of Lutra","review":"Pearls of Lutra is about an otter named Grath whos family was killed by corsairs for the six beautiful pearls called Tears of all Oceans.

Tansy has to find the pearls to ransom them to Evil Emporer Mad Eyes to save her Abbot, but it won't be as easy as she thinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed this book","review":"I am a fan of Brain Jacques and think he's created another great addition to the Redwall collection. Pearls of Lutra is a page-turning fantasy adventure novel that left me truely satistfied after I had finished it. A liked how the small animals in the story were just like humans. You really don't need to read the other novels in the Redwall series to understand this one. A great book with all parts considered!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This Book was great!!! Brian Jacques did a great job on writing this book!! The Holt Lutra Tears of all Oceans (pearls) were stolen and the Holt Lutra was killed all except one otter by Emperor Ublaz an evil Pine Martin.Join a quest of determined woodlanders in this classic book. A MUST for Redwall readers of all shapes and sizes!Great Job Mr. Jacques!!!!! REDWALLLLLL!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Highly Suggested","review":"Pearls of Lutra is not a very good book. Redwall fans should read this book, but I would not suggest it to anyone just starting the series. The characters are extremely shallow, no depth in charactarism whatsoever.The plot has no depth at all.The first attractive point about this book is the 'woodland creature' theme. It is interesting to have the heroes be mice and otters. The second point is that it will be on interest to veteran Redwall readers. It has interesting glimpses from the time of Mattimeo, and several characters returning from earlier books.I would not suggest reading this book to anyone but veteran Redwall fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pearls of Lutra","review":"The pearl of Lutra is a great book.

The author has a unique style of writing. As one who is writing a book myself I know that it must be hard to determine the character of an animal. To know exactly how they would react to certain things, takes skill. Jacques has a unique talent and he uses it wisely. The Pearls of Lutra was one of his better books I believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware! Grath is Out for Revenge!!","review":"A great story!! It is great because it has adventure and great for people who like battle. Grath Longfetch, of the Holt Lutra, and her family has been robbed by corsairs. They lost The Tears of All Oceans. She was the only survivor and wants revenge on the corsairs for killing her family. Meanwhile at Redwall the Abbot and a young bankvole have been kidnapped by corsairs. For ransom they want the tears because that's where they were taken. So they search for them while some of the creatures go to get the Abbot and the bankvole back. While trying they meet up with Grath. They decide to go with each other to get back at the corsairs. While on the adventure they meet up with shrews, otters, and some seals. Read this book and find out the rest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thriller for Young and Old","review":"In this book I liked how Brian Jacques, the author of the Redwall series, painted a picture of each character. I also liked how he mixed action with comedy and adventure. I didn't like how most of the characters from the Matthias and Mattimeo era have died. In The Pearls of Lutra this is everybody except for Rollo bankvole and Auma, the daughter of Orlando the Axe (who might be still alive). I also didn't like the part when Saint Ninian's, the former home of Gonff the mousethief, was burnt. In The Pearls of Lutra some of the main characters are otters. They are my favorite creatures in the Redwall series. This book gives a better perspective of their lives such as the otters' fighting skills, character, and even their dietary supplements. Overall, this was good work on the behalf of Brian Jacques. This is one of my favorite Redwall books. I give this book five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"LUTRAAA!!!!!!","review":"This was the first Redwall book that I read, and it got me hooked on them. I read this book in first grade, and seven years later, it's still my favorite, and I am now the proud owner of the first 14 Redwall books. The book tells the story of Grath Longfletch, an otter whose family was murdered by Emperor Ublaz so that he could have 6 beautiul pearls belonging to them. Grath sets out to avenge the deaths, and regain the pearls. Along the way, Martin the second joins her, as Ublaz has kidnapped the Abbot of Redwall after learning the pearls are hidden inside. As they journey forth, a group of Abbey-dwellers, led by Tansy, a young hedgehog, must solve 6 mind-bending riddles that will lead them to the pearls. It's a good book, but first-time visitors to Mossflower should start at the beginning. To all those who have been to Mossflower before, I want to say one thing: Redwallll!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece of uncomparable quality!","review":"This book has to be the best book I have ever read and trust me I've read a lot of books.

I like descriptive, long, action-packed books, and The Pearls of Lutra is just that.

It might be my imagination, but it seems like the Husqvarna chain stays sharper longer too. In any case, being able to get an actual Husqvarna chain for my Husqvarna saw at a good price, just seems right!As the other reviewer states - be sure that the chain will fit your saw.

I looked at the jigs but was always put off by the high price and big manuals. I read a review on different jigs and the Keller was deemed the simplest to use. I bought it and could not be happier. It took me about 5 minutes to screw the jig to a backer board, and 10 minutes later I was putting together the first joint. It was perfect. My only regret is not buying this thing years ago. It's so simple, you don't even need to keep the booklet around, because there is nothing really to set up. Bit depth is not critical, you just set it a hair deeper than the wood thickness. I now can buzz through a whole project's dovetails faster than I used to chop out one side by hand, and they look better too. I'd be surprized if anyone was disappointed with this jig."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive through dovetails with ease.","review":"I consider myself an intermediate woodworker and have been putting off immersing myself into learning to hand-cut dovetails. When considering the time it takes to become proficient at cutting them manually, it can be intimidating. I bought this jig for its advertised simplicity and ease of setup. The low cost is quite attractive as well. It is on the mark for ease of setup. The only issue is setting up the backing block. I can see that being an issue if you do not have a thickness planer. The manual says that you can use 3 pieces of 3/4\\" ply but I like the idea of a hardwood backing block. After I milled up the block and screwed the jig in place, I had a perfect dovetail joint in less than 10 minutes. I would recommend this jig to anyone w/ a small to medium shop (or home enthusiast)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keller Dovetail Jig","review":"This is my second dovetail jig. The first one was difficult to use and produced very poor half blind dovetail joints. My first time out with the Keller ( I made a oak box ) produced nice dovetail joints.

I do recommend this tool ."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Dovetail Jig","review":"The Keller 1500 jig was very simple to get into working order with the assrmble of the backer block. I cut the first set of joints in 3/4\\" scrap pine I had in the shop. Great fit - no issues. The scribe mark on the jig for backer board location makes great, tight joints right from the start.I bought the Keller to dovetail a 16\\" run of 1/2\\" thick baltic birch plywood for some custom boxes. I tried the jig on 1/2\\" baltic birch and the tear out was terrible. Maybe this jig is only good for non-laminated woods?It did work sensational right out of the box.

When comedy is written for a performer, the writer can rely on the comic to provide the proper delivery with flawless timing which will enhance the humor of the written piece.Not so with a novel. The writer must BE FUNNY in the two-dimensional pages of a book, without any performing aids. Most humorists concentrate on skits or slices of characters, puns, jokes, etc. Until the \\"Off-Islanders\\" I had never read a truly funny novel, one that made me laugh out loud like a fool, as I passed the pages.I saw the movie based on the novel -- after I read the book. The film was fine, but the novel, even on re-reading, was funnier. Of course,it helps to enjoy its humor when you have lived among the people depicted, as an off-islander yourself.It is a jewel. Highly recommended. Specially the outrageous scene at the dump! Glorious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Off-Islanders","review":"This was a funny and fast-moving book, a satirical comment on people's fears and over-reactions, illustrating that we are filled with misconceptions about the different and unknown, but underneath those differences we really are not that dissimilar from each other.

Like one of the other reviewers, I have also, for the last 6 or 8 months, had significant problems with my black ink cartridges. The print quality is horrid. I just put in a brand new black cartridge, and one day later, the print is awful. There are skips all through my words. I don't know if this is a problem with the printer or the cartridges. If it's the cartridges, it's a big problem considering each black cartridge is about 28 to 30 dollars. Either way, I would not recommend this printer to anyone.

After it powers up, shut it down one more time, plug in the printer and start it up. Seriously!!!Note: This doesn't always work. If you have an Aptiva, don't buy this printer.

Base at lowest height is approx 9 inch diameter, and a center leg has a suction cup at lowest setting so it grabs a nice flat surface and becomes anchored so you can do adjustments with out the base moving. I give it a four stars for construction because the legs dont have a locking type mechanism just relies on pressure to hold position, they do have a good feel when adjusting, maybe long run it will loosen up and become not so great.

Scott is fairly easy to follow, but I'm still not all the way through the DVD. I wish he went into some stretches, and how you're supposed to breathe and all a bit more; he goes a bit fast, sometimes. Which may seem a strange complaint, given he's moving in slooooow motion, but this is the very first time I've ever tried this stuff; I'm not just in it to learn the forms, I'm in a remote area and have no other way to learn this stuff.

I'm hoping that my daughter may get interested and learn with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"GreatWorkout","review":"This is a great DVD. I highly recommend it. Scott uses a mirror image teaching style, which is easy to follow. And you will learn several moves followed by 2 workouts that use the moves. Once you get the moves figured out you can skip the educational part and go straight to the workouts by using the menu selection. Also, Scott added about 6 additional moves in a special feature section. Very well done video!I tried a Tai Chi class and was very frustrated by an instructor that tried to do too many moves at once, but I actually got it figured out with the help of this DVD. Now I'm looking for the next one Scott does so I can learn more.Don't waste your money on the Joe Bond DVD. You'll spend 45 minutes on 1 move and not know anything that feels like Tai Chi. Plus the guy seems really stuck on himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A taste of tai chi for beginners","review":"This DVD does what is says. It's gives you a teaspoon of tai chi. It helps you discover if this is for you or not. That's it. Scott Cole explains well. I did not feel the chi or energy during the work out but I did feel calm and relaxed after doing this. Well made. If you want to go deeper and try to grasp the essence of tai chi then keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for beginners!","review":"First of all, I have NEVER learnt Tai Chi before. Recently, however, I have had some health issues and I was recommended to do more exercises like Tai Chi. And I got this DVD as a gift. So since last week, I've been practising Tai Chi every night before going to sleep. I can't believe that I'm hooked! And I must say, Scott is amazing!Yes, it has been only a week. But I've to tell you, I feel so much better already! Now I do not wake up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Also I do not have stuffy nose whenever I lie down on the bed at night (yes I literally had this problem almost every night before)! It is just soooo soothing! Although I think I still need to improve my breathing skills, I do already feel the \\"Chi\\" going through my body. So hopefully this will help cure my other health problems soon. Thanks Scott for his amazing easy-to-follow teaching skills, soothing voice, calming music and the beautiful beach scene!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice design, noisy pictures","review":"The good: the camera was well made and very tiny. The menus were well designed. The all-internal lens was a neat idea. The use of an industry standard SD card made this camera the choice over the comparable Sony T1.The bad: Picture quality was a complete disappointment. The photos from this 5-megapixel camera were worse than my old 2-megapixel Fuji. As another reviewer indicated, the pictures are extremely noisy. Unfortunately, noise is apparently a problem in ultralight cameras like this one (a friend also reported unacceptable levels in the T1.) I returned this model and will get a larger camera - while the tiny design was neat, I personally feel that it's not worth sacrificing picture quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice camera but very FRAGILE","review":"The Dimage x50 looked to be everything I wanted in a digital camera; compact-fit in my pocket, quick-snappy startup, nice picture quality-5 mega pixels, etc. I WAS very pleased with my purchase - until I dropped the camera.I simply fumbled it while sliding it in my front pants pocket. The camera fell no more than couple feet. But, that was the end of it. The screen went completely white and never recovered. I sent it to Minolta for warranty repair. They wanted to charge me $140 for \\"impact damage\\". I explained to them that I felt that a $300 camera should be able to handle a short drop without total system failure. They didn't agree.I would NOT recommend this camera. It design is too fragile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Camera","review":"This camera has met and exceeded all my expectations for portability and quality. However after 2 years of use, the screen stopped working, and with Konica Minolta no longer in operation, locating repair service has been troublesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"6 Months and Screen Already Broken","review":"I bought this camera and within 6 months the screen broke. I would not recommend buying this camera, the company does not have a warranty and there is nothing to do once it is broken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent but fragile camera, terrible warranty service","review":"I purchased the X50 and have been happy with it for the most part save its video mode which is sub par. However, I dropped the camera and even though there was no visible damage to the body the LCD screen was damaged internally with an odd shaped section of about half the pixels blank.I sent the camera in to Minolta warranty repair and it seems that to repair it they had to order a new LCD screen component from Japan. I've now been waiting 5 weeks (not including shipping time) for my camera. I find it totally unacceptable that the repair turn around is so slow. This is a current model with probably hundreds of thousands being shipped so why can't they have spare parts on hand in the US. Bottom line likely is that warranty repair is not profitable and therefor low priority."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lexmark z51 sucks","review":"The Z51 is an infuriating piece of garbage!

Performed well for one month, then all hell broke loose. Printed streaks and wavey images. The print head banged against the side of the machine. Cartridges are very expensive.

If you're not willing to spend an extra $30 for an IEEE 1284 cable (not suggested in the Lexmark manual) it will hardly run at all. I couldn't cancel print jobs before I got one, either through the pop-up monitor or the spooling monitor.It constantly detects a cartridge change where none has taken place, then crashes the system.The driver that comes with it won't run it on either of my computers--you must get the upgrade.All-in-all, a very unpleasant experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything we wanted.","review":"Printers have been the bane of our personal computing life. Since, 1987, we've never had one that printed quality, reliably. Then the Lexmark Z51 came into our life. Installation was a snap, just followed the directions and put in the CD. The Drivers loaded and we were printing. Paper feeds reliably and envelopes are a snap. The Lexmark ink level indicators are a real plus too. As for quality, it's hard to tell the difference between this output and a color laser printer. I'm recommending this printer to all my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also had driver and USB problems","review":"This printer made a bad first impression on me. First off, I inserted the CD, and my computer (Dell Pentium III 450 with DVD drive) was unable to read it. I had to download the driver from the web. However, even after installing the driver, I had to look in the appendix of the (so-called) User's Manual to try to set up the USB connection. After following Lexmark's instructions, the printer would not support USB. I, too, had to go back to the parallel connection.After finally getting this thing up and running, I found the text quality to be very good, and photo quality (with optional photo cartridge) to be good, not great. I also found that the Z51 REALLY grabs the paper out of the automatic paper feeder. My paper shredder treats paper more gently. I also found it difficult to avoid skew misalignments with this printer.Shop around. There have to be better printers out there for the same price."},{"rating":"2","title":"HDMI Cable","review":"This product is great if you are looking for an inexpensive HDMI-HDMI cable for your HDTV.

I used one to connect a PS3 to an HDTV. The cable ran out in the open to a tv in the middle of the room. After a few days of use the metal cable connector that inserts into the PS3 had ripped off of the cable, exposing the pins inside.

So I tried them, and after hoping they would work as I had hoped and read in reviews they would, NOTHING, no signal, weak signal, blank screen.So I called up Dell and ordered some very expensive Belkin HDMI cables and will see if they work.. (They better for that price or they go back)I am highly disappointed but like my father always told me (didn't take his advice this time)YOU ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, and he is right.Please, please don't waste your hard earned money for junk, because that is what this cable is, JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Looks like they were home made.Now I am off to buying some optical cables.

In fact the regular cables seem a little better but I still can't tell the difference. I had to try it and not sorry I did. Now I know.

First of all, I'm not a cable junkie nor an expert. However, according to my research, there's no difference in performance b/w the expensive version nor the $12, $15, $20 version when it comes to HDMI since it's all digital.. hole buch of zeros and ones. The durability of the cables... I don't know. But unless you're someone who constantly plugs and unplugs the cables for some reason, it wouldn't matter. Normally, you'd connect the cable and keep it that way for a long period of time, so the durability is not really relevant. Bottomline: This is as good as the expensive ones. I first tried out the expensive Monster brand which was $85. Then I returned it after purchasing this, for the quality was the same. Don't buy the expensive ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why pay more?","review":"These HDMI cables work just fine for me. Now I've not used any of the $100+ cables that are on offer (and all you can get in Circuit City/Best Buy etc.), but I would expect them to be of a higher quality in terms of how they're made and the picture and sound they deliver. BUT for less than $10 who can complain? They look and feel fine and deliver a better picture than the analogue cables I was using. After spending $750 on a new HDTV, I'm not prepared to spend another $130 on a cable! Not to mention I needed two of them (one for my HD upconverting DVD player).

I'm a big fan of cheap HDMI cables and have used several without problems so I'll just chalk this up to experience. I'm still $$$$ ahead of the game. However, I would suggest you think twice before going cheap if you are putting your cable in the wall. Its going to take me an hour or so take the TV down, move furniture, etc to switch out this bad cable which is making the few bucks I saved not seem worth it. I'd buy this again for an exposed cable since you can get 3 or 4 of them and still be ahead of getting one high priced cable but going forward I'm going to buy name brand if the cable is going in the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Price , Horrible Quality","review":"This cable definetly comes up short in comparison to higher end cables or even the free component cables i recieved from the cable company.

However, after the first 20 or so pages, I was very disappointed. The writing left alot to be desired on most of the stories. There was no real thread to connect the stories, even though the stories had been put into chapters that were basically titled by the content of the stories, but sometimes the stories didn't fit the category they were put into. That being said, there were some high points to the book. For example, there is a story about four WWE superstars traveling from North Carolina to Tennessee and having a wreck on the way. It may not sound (in description here) like it would be that funny, but the way it is told (apparently by Shannon Moore), the story is so hilarious that you feel almost as if you are listening to him personally tell you the story and the descriptive writing makes you feel as if you were right there when the event took place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic gift for a girl name Samantha!","review":"My daughter got the Samantha doll for her birthday.

Overall, probably the tune that could've substituted for \\"Like a Dog\\" on the album and is the bonus track on the Japanese version.\\"Odyssey #1 (demo)\\" is one of the best Powderfinger b-sides they have ever done.

There is no instrument or vocal panning on any of these as the originals were, like they took a stereo recording and made it mono. I personally will be getting the mythology set on vinyl and cd, but I've previewed the itunes version and it is excellent also, nice clean sound, panning is there.

I would recommend this product to everyone with a smelly washing machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for HE Washer Odor!","review":"We found Washer Magic to be very helpful with our chronic HE washer odor problem. Running bleach-only cycles gave us very short-term relief. We did 2 \\"magic\\" cycles (1 bottle each) and found the washer (and our clothes!) to be free of the musty odor that our front-loader had been plagued with. We have since ordered a case and use a bottle every month or so when the washer starts to smell again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleaned machine and used for another use! Pet smell.","review":"I had someone's pet urinated on my messenger computer bag.Later, I noticed the horrible smell and spraying it with the enzyme pet spray - would not get rid of the smell.In the front load washer I placed the empty bag (it was a red canvas-like duffle bag fabric, alone in the washer.First, I put laundry detergent in the soap tray (liquid detergent).Then, in the rinse fabric softener tray, I poured the Washer Magic, so the rinse cycle had the Washer Magic liquid deodorizer.It worked great. No smell. Not many cleaners work for cat urine but this did. Since this is NOT a clothing item that touches skin directly, I thought it would be fine to use and it did."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd give this six stars!","review":"We had tried EVERYTHING to combat the odor problem we had with our front loader HE washer. We were about to buy a different washer because of the chronic odor problem when we purchased this product. I can not tell you the difference this made. NO MORE SMELL PERIOD! I use this every month or so and it works GREAT! I'm glad I tried it. I was very skeptical that it would work but it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"It got the job done!","review":"We have very hard water, and the inner tub of our top-loading washer had developed mineral deposits after five years of use. It also had a buildup of this flaky gray stuff (that would crumble to powder when ground between the fingers), presumably in the outer tub. My main goal was to get rid of the gray flaky residue, as it was getting into the clothes as well as past the dryer's lint filter. After two bottles of Washer Magic (I used the extra rinse cycle each time), both the mineral deposits on the inner tub and the flaky residue were almost completely gone. Now I no longer hear that \\"sandy rattle\\" every time my dryer starts up; the clothes are residue-free. Five-plus stars for this terrific product."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE ODOR!!!","review":"Wow!!! This product made me dizzy without even opening the bottle...through a plastic bag. I have washed my hands 3 times, but the odor from the bag it was wrapped in is still lingering. I phoned the company who said it should smell only like lemon. No lemon smell involved at all. It smells incredibly toxic.I would love to give this product some minus stars. Now I am stuck with this dull headache. It feels like a very dangerous product to me. I find it hard to believe that this is environmentally safe, as stated. It is currently sitting OUTSIDE on the porch, waiting to be returned.....not soon enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo! NO MAPS!","review":"I bought a few guide books to plan a trip to Seattle, the city of my birth. With only a few days to spend, The title attracted me because it is the TEN BEST THINGS to do.225 pages on TEN THINGS?NO MAPS - all landmarks are the same print color, events tend to blend into one another. Also the book is large, not an easy fit into the purse.I recommend Access Seattle, which is a great guide full of easy to read maps, wonderful reviews and an easy to read lay out! Also gives you clues into festivals different times of the year. Not to mention, a good size to fit into a bag.I gave it two stars because the book is rich in history. So, it is an interesting read, but I would not plan a vacation around it."},{"rating":"2","title":"America's Emerald City","review":"This book has been very helpful in planning my first distance adventure by myself.

It is funny, scary, suspenseful, and has a great storyline. It is about a girl named Meg that throws a surprise party for Ellen, her old bestfriend, because she is coming to visit. But then Meg receives phone calls telling her to cancel the party or else. Then the party invitations get cut up. Then comes the note in her locker and then the red paint thats supposed to be blood in her lunch bag. Could it be that Ellen is coming to town? Is it just a prank? Or does it have something to do with the murder of Evan a year ago? Meg must find out. This book is really fabulous. I am certain that every pre- teen will love this book as much as I did.

Walk down the street and randomly choose people to \\"act\\" in this thing. Plus, it should've been filmed in Pawleys. It's a lot nicer here than the locales used in the film.

By the looks of the DVD cover this movie seems to be a really creepy, scary supernatural horror. However, the trailer reveals the same old tricks and effects that horror fans have seen a dozen times before... only on a much lower budget. Girl suspended in air, woman dragged offscreen by unseen force, etc. So happy I didn't jump the gun and rent without seeing the trailer first because it would have been a waste of money.You should also know that Im pretty easy to please in the scary movie department and will watch almost anything (except for the super cheesy, not-even-scary horror flicks) so for me to be writing this review has to be saying something. Low budget doesn't always equal bad movie (watch Absentia to see what I mean!)Proceed at your own risk. : )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't watch it...EVER!!","review":"I have a special place in my heart for ghost/exorcist films even though most of them fall short of being good. This certain movie has to be one of the biggest wastes of 65 min. Even at that short of a length the film was too long and too slow. Nothing exciting happened until the last 20 minutes and there was no way to salvage this film. If you've ever seen a movie about a haunting you know the story: new big house; creepy legend surrounding the house; little girl with an imaginary friend; etc. It's not even the fun bad, just plain terrible. I would not wish this torture on my worst enemy (which there are many).

I should have just lit three singles on fire.This paranormal investigator movie was under-produced, overacted, shockingly underdeveloped and horribly written. The plot had potential until the actors opened their mouthes and the dialogue came out.There are some amazing movies on the paranormal. This is not one of them. The only scary thing about this whole mess is that someone produced it and Amazon agreed to put it onto their website for sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Indie Horror Film","review":"I have to say I can't disagree with some of these other reviews any more. This was a good little film. The parts that are scary are actually very scary and the last 20 minutes of the film keep you glued to your seats. I like how the filmmakers did not cheap out by trying to incorporate some crappy CG like so many indie filmmakers do these days. This film knows its bounds and sticks to them. I honestly don't know how they pulled off some of the effects that they showed in the movie and that adds to some of the general eeriness of the film. The film is shot as if was an episode of Ghost Hunters and the quality is very good, its obvious that they are using some higher end HD ENG Cameras. If you want a fun indie horror film this should do very well for you just don't expect Cabin in the Woods or some other multi-million horror film."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've got to start reading these reviews before renting.","review":"I have a high tolerance for bad horror films and can enjoy even many stinkers in an MST3K way but this movie was truly painful. The only, and I mean ONLY, half way good scene was the 5 second one pictured on the ad. As another reviewer wrote, I and some of my friends could do a much better job with a cheap hand held camera borrowing my grandparents' old house out in the country. The \\"acting\\" was as inconsistent to the portrayed situations as was the storyline to reason.

They claim if you love those lame ghost shows on TV, you'll love this. Uhh...no. I'm serious when I say it's like your neighbors came over and said \\"hey, we've smoked a little homegrown, wanna make a ghosty movie?\\" and you reply \\"I have no acting experience\\" and they say \\"neither do we.\\" Okay, it just ended and we looked at each other with no words adequate to describe the pile of dung we just wasted our lives on.

The characters that populate the book are colorful and make the Russian migrant experience in Israel come alive. Rubina writes with a ruthless compassion for her people and their situations so that I came to care for Zaima and Writer N on deep levels. She has a way of working philosophical rumination in with the story that elevates it beyond interesting anecdote. I am amazed at the smooth translation, how accessible the story became to me!

Some characters more, some less: but I could identify with the feelings, and see them in my heart. These people I never met -- and never really met anybody who could remind me of them -- I felt as if they were diverse parts of me, broken off by life, by immigration, by the need to survive, by the constant search of belonging, as if it all happened to me and I simply forgot the details...

I can't get past page 16, where the author (in Lambert's voice) explains very clearly how Lambert is NOT GENETICALLY RELATED TO MENDEL at all - that means sharing 0% of his genes, Mr. Mawer. It's so strange that the concluding sentence is that Lambert IS genetically related, and it's supposed to be a piece of major irony in the book, not to mention the cause for the title of the book. It's worse that there may be a \\"sly\\" mention of this error in the acknowledgments, which appears just be to a way to (ahem) \\"cleverly\\" make up for this glaring error that any proofreader or junior editor should have caught from the very start.

Maybe because many times I've toured the Biltmore House, where much of the movie takes place. What makes this murder mystery memorable though are the bumbling sleuths, Tim Conway and Don Knotts.

I know I shouldn't laugh at these jokes. They are predictable, lame, and cliched. But I still laugh harder at this movie than almost any other comedy. Why? It is the men behind the jokes. Tim Conway and Don Knotts are made to act off of the other. These men are funny. They can take any tired line or dull gag and make it funny. That is all there is to it. They surround themselves with a gifted supporting cast who do their best to contribute to the laughs. This movie is just fun. It is not deep or complex, but it entertains.

The Private Eyes is a campy, contrived, and wonderfully silly movie. But you'll laugh as these old-school comedians bumble their way through a spooky old mansion in search of a killer, a la the board game Clue. You'll find all the expected players and a plot that has a comfortable--and predictable--familiarity. It's the interplay between the Conway and Knotts that makes this movie a winner.If you don't take yourself or your laughs too seriously (and if you don't mind watching comedians who get their laughs at THEIR OWN expense without the profanity and vulgarity that so often passes for comedy), you'll love this. Tim Conway has some of his finest moments as the dim-witted yet good-intentioned Dr. Tart.I have loved this movie since I first saw it on HBO as a young teen. It was an elusive find on VHS, so I'm thrilled to find it now on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"You know what my mother used to say to make you throw up?\\"","review":"That's one of Tim Conway's lines, which starts a bunch of gross notions that will make you giggle, big time. His silly sense of humor is all over this movie (he cowrote it).All I can say is, when you bring Tim Conway and Don Knotts together, you are sure to have fun.They are two of the funniest people ever.This was one of those flicks that, back in the 80's, came on tv on a Saturday afternoon and you'd watch it and laugh. My favorite running gags are the pigeons and the \\"alarm gun\\".This movie is right up my alley, along with stuff from Monty Python, Mel Brooks, Danny Kaye, Martin Short, Carol Burnett, Steve Martin, and also Woody Allen's early films.And the fact that it's a broad homage to whodunits is gravy. It's a great companion to Murder By Death, and Clue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Princes of Slap Stick","review":"Don Knott's big eyes and Tim Coway's slap stick, who could ask for more!

Don Knotts will be sorely missed, but at least we have his movies on DVD to treasure.The only reason I could not give 5 stars is beacuse the film is not in widescreen.

We laughed and laughed at it. In my opinion, any of the paid movie critics who have dissed it are morons. It is pretty predictable, as are most slapstick movies. Most of the funny comedy routines have been around since the early 20th century, so we already know the punchlines, but funny will always be funny.

You have to like the Tim Conway and Don Knotts humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy and Thrown Together","review":"Quentins, my first Maeve Binchy experience, was a big disappointment. Quentins is too long, with too many characters, and too many silly, insignificant story lines. The main character, Ella, is flat and utterly boring. Her dilemma is ridiculously far-fetched and in no way fits with the other bland story line, that of the restaurant Quentins and the film about it. Even the names of the characters are inane, not to mention their dull, insipid conversations. Very little about the real city of Dublin comes through in this novel. I am amazed that this book was even published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bernie from Virginia","review":"I love Maeve Binchey but this is one of the worst books I've ever read, and a solid disappointment coming from such a beloved author. It took me a month to get through it. Ella is a whiney, self-absorbed, selfish character and the book only picks up interest when she's out of the picture. I couldn't figure out why her friends were so supportive when she was so stupid, or why anyone would bother with her at all. The writing borders on childish and the characters too truncated to generate much interest. This is the only one of Binchey's books I have not thoroughly enjoyed. She should have taken more time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless -- wasted my time!","review":"I'm not sure why I finished reading this book -- I guess I kept thinking it would improve! However, the main character Ella was just too dumb to believe. The plot never got off the ground, and then it was disintegrated with these little short stories about how people resolved their conflicts or fell in love, at meals in the restaurant -- nothing really seemed to fit together. The people weren't as real as in Scarlet Feather. I felt this book was a waste of my time, wish I'd spent the time reading a better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maeve is back!","review":"So glad to see Maeve back in print. We missed her Irish vistas and enigmatic characters. While she was away I found Bridget Horan O'Mahony a fellow traveler and Kerry woman.

I promised myself after I read Tara Road, that I wouldn't read anymore of her books. But, I bought the book for friend for Christmas, and just flicked through it. So I ended up reading it. I feel that Maeve was realy desperate to write something and just gathered up as much as she could from previous books. I wrote in here after Tara Road saying that Maeve should just write short stories, and now I think that she should stop, completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-I-N-G","review":"I almost purchased Quentins because I have enjoyed Maeve Binchy's books in the past, but her last few books have lacked the energy her earlier books had. Quentins is boring, tedious to read & has way too many story lines going at once. If you really want to read it, go to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat dissapointing","review":"Quentins is not your typical Maeve Binchy book. Though I enjoyed parts of this novel, I finished reading it on a dissapointing note. In Quentins, we re-connect with old characters from other novels, like Simon and Maude from Scarlet Feather. What made this novel dissapointing to me was all the space Binchy spent re-acquianting the reader with these old characters. Instead Binchy could well have used the space to develop her new characters to a greater degree. I felt often enough that I couldn't connect personally with the protagonist, Ella Brady, with all the other reminders going on. It was like watching one of those sitcoms where the actors sit and reminisce about times gone by, when all you really wanted to see was the next episode. Instead of trying to draw on our nostalgia for characters in other novels, Binchy should have attempted to write a novel that we could be nostalgic about in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased as punch","review":"Well, after just finishing Angela's Ashes and Judas in Kilkenny, I was all geared up for another great Irish tale. I was not to be disappointed. Quentin's is a great read in my opinion. The characters are rich and story moves along easily. All-in-all I was very satisified with Maeve's new book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech!!!","review":"This is the fourth Binchy book I've read, and I was soooo disappointed. Evening Class was the first, and it was so charming. I then read Tara Road, which I just loved. Silver Wedding was next, which was pretty boring. Then Quentins. I was looking so forward to this book, but it was almost awful. Ella, the main character, didn't have a brain in her head. She was so stupid and sickeningly sweet. I couldn't stand how her married lover kept calling her \\"angel\\". Yuck. And then when Nick & Sandy, who were working like dogs in their film studio, sent Ella to Manhatten to stay in a great hotel and be wined and dined by the film's potential financier - puhleeze! They do all the work, but then they send \\"poor Ella\\" to have all the fun! The story line was poor, and the characters, except for Deirdre were not very likeable. I'll wait before reading another Bincy. Too bad. I thought I had found a wonderful author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Binchy keeps up with the times...","review":"As a big fan of Maeve Binchy, I was pleasantly surprised by her latest book. Quentins is skillful fiction; Binchy's changing Ireland is populated by characters facing modern dilemmas. The women of Binchy's earlier \\"village\\" novels have been supplanted by new heroines who recognize the importance of making one's own pedigree, to borrow the words of Cathy Scarlet. I really find the evolution of the film to be the most compelling part of the plot-- the anecdotes about everyone's lives as part of Quentins are tightly laced, as per classic Binchy, and the tension ratchets up as the stakes are raised in everyone's lives. The people of Quentins are various but remain very ordinary and human; their mistakes and pecadilloes are recognizable and smart. Keep writing, Binchy... we'll keep reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"I love Binchey's earlier books but this one is such a disappointment. I really couldn't care about the characters at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh? What?","review":"Let me first say, I love Maeve Binchy. I have not read all of her books, but I have read a lot of them. No matter how much I enjoy her work, I must say that a book should not be able to squeak by on the author's name alone. Maybe it would have been better had Binchy retired. This book is weak. I could go into a detailed discussion of the plot as others have done, but how many plot synopses do you readers need? The plot is weak. The characters, though familiar for the most part, are unlikable. And the ending is REALLY predictable. If you must read it, wait for the paperback or buy it used. There are far better books available. And for all of you reviewers who gave the book extra stars just because it is a Binchy book, you're messing up the star system. Stars are for books that shine."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"My aunt introduced me to Maeve Binchy with her book Evening Class. I hated to put it down! I felt as if I knew the characters and really cared about them; the story was delicious. Now I have read Quentins and I wonder'what happened'? While I understand (and enjoy) that I am not reading Binchy as if reading the Classics, this book is written on a 5th grade level. Character development was almost non-existant and if the author wanted to get from Point A to Point B, she rushed through the character's story to get there. I am very disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best of Binchy-Underdeveloped","review":"I really didn't think this book was all that great as I had expected it to be.Ella Brady wants to tell the story of a generation and a city through the history of a restaurant. She wants to film a documentary about Quentins that will capture the spirit of Dublin from the 1970s to the present day. After all, the restaurant saw the people of a city become more confident in everything, from their lifestyles to the food they chose to eat.And Quentins has a thousand stories to tell; tales of love, of betrayal, of revenge; of times when it looked ready for success and of times when it seemed it must close in failure.The book touched on stories of lives of people, but not enough. It really failed to focus on any characters lives at all, and just gave brief explanations of different people in the story.I really felt therefore, that the book lacked depth and meaning.Other books of Binchy are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but WAY too short...","review":"This book started wonderfully, like all Binchy's. I am a huge fan and have read quite a few of her works and loved every one of them, including Quentins. However, this book seemed to end very abruptly. It really should be classified as a short story, not a novel. Being a short story, it was still a good read...for a short story. So for the length, it was outrageously overpriced; hence the one-star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as engaging as her other books ...","review":"I could not finish the last 2 cassettes -- the plot meanders and the characters are stereotypical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely work by a skilled author","review":"This is my first Maeve Binchy read and it won't be the last. The characters in Quentins are extraordinarily vivid, especially Ella. Her struggles with the married man who cons her parents and breaks her heart are touching and real. Also, the short stories within the novel -- various tales that define the history and legacy of a Dublin restaurant called Quentins -- are compelling and poignant.This is a tale by a master storyteller. Even though I have not read Binchy's previous efforts, I identified with her writing and language. I consider myself quite fortunate to have ventured into this novel, and will read everything else by this skilled author..."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth reading","review":"This is a waste of time to read. It is scattered and boring. The characters are undeveloped. She brings in characters from her other more interesting and better written books. This is a cop out from someone who should have stayed retired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghost writer ????","review":"I am a huge Binchy fan and have read everything she has written. But she could NOT have written this book! Perhaps she did not come out of retirement and the publisher had someone else write this using a Binchy 'formula' (it would explain the resurrection of all the old characters)? The dialogue doesn't even seem like Binchy - I can't even hear the Irish 'brogue' in my head - it's all flat. The Ella character is 2-dimensional which is rare in a Binchy novel. And rarely is a Binchy heroine such a naive dope.If Ms Binchy truly wrote this book, then perhaps retirement is the way to go at this point in her life. Quentin's was a waste of my library privilege!"},{"rating":"2","title":"as good as it gets","review":"Not one of her sharpest but a lovely antidote to stress (finished it in 2 days); \\"Evening Class\\" was her most endearing. I found the usage of old characters a clever ploy but I believe that Nora's second time around lover (Aidan) had a wife (in \\"Evening Class\\") who worked as a cashier at Quentin's in that novel and no mention was made of that fact by the very astute Brenda. Insofar as her dear friend Nora is now working as a veggie cutter at the restaurant, it would have made sense to connect this fact -so what happened to the unfaithful wife of Aidan - was she terminated? Possibly to be revealed in the return of another \\"Quentin's\\" sequel. I can fully understand Ella's enchantment with the cheating Don; she was looking for a special love and found it but with the wrong man.Every woman wants to believe that she can change the mold of the man she loves given the right opportunity and profound devotion. Thank god she didn't get pregnant. I did love it and finished it at 3:45 AM."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I feel that some of the reviewers are being too hard on the author. I have read at least 8 of her book including the last 4. Quentins to me is more like a short collection of short stories and knowing that what she does well is longer books with detailed character development, then it is okay to not expect as much from this short title. I loved Scarlett Feather, Echoes, The Glass Lake and Light a Penny Candle, liked Tara Road and Evening Class... and was only amused by the London Transport... so for Quentins with its moving at a fast summer reading pace, I like it... As others have said it is not her best work, but it is cute and light more or less... So Start with the books that I loved, but if the page count is too high, Quentins is a good book too..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please...No More!","review":"Usually enjoy Binchy's books....but can see why she had to be begged to write another. She has run out of ideas. The main character, Ella, makes anyone with a brain or a sense of social responsibilty want to slap her silly. It's not just the old, boring, getting involved with a married man theme.....but to belive that you would not let the authorities know about \\"THE COMPUTER\\" that was \\"ACCIDENTALLY\\" left behind.....pleasssssse! To think that all these other interesting characters would leap to her defense and help, including her screwed over parents, is just more than can be tolerated. Kind of makes you think they all are dumber than dirt. Please, no more until you can really put your heart in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A far cry from Binchy's best","review":"Maeve Binchy is capable of much better work.Quentins' plot is formulaic at best. The characters are shallow and poorly developed. I have read all of Binchy's books, and have been dismayed to see the downhill progression in the quality of her recent output. Both Quentins and Scarlet Feather have been entirely disappointing. Fans of her earlier novels such as Circle of Friends and The Glass Lake should not expect too much of Quentins.Buck up, Ms. Binchy, you can do better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work","review":"I couldn't even finish it. It was disjointed and the characters were cardboard cutouts. I think Binchy is a great author and this book is nothing like her other, well written, entertaining novels. I hope the next one will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was NOT Maeve Binchy at her best","review":"I really looked forward to getting this book and I was terribly terribly disappointed. The \\"new\\" characters were tired and stale and the dialogue didn't add any value to the book either. Maeve Binchy's other books, like Circle of Friends, or Echoes, or Copper Beech, did a much better job of drawing the reader in. For me, it wasn't so much a matter of too many things going on - but the only character really developed was Brenda. I am sorry that I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"My First Binchy Read..","review":"... and it has all been downhill from here. If you are only going to read one, it may as well be this one, though so far, there is a distressingly appalling repetition of themes in her many books... Also, in this one, there are confusing references to previous tales, a trick which does not endear an author to her readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formula Driven","review":"I had never read a Maeve Binchy book before Quentins. I picked up a hard cover edition of the book at a library sale for one dollar. I am sorry to say, it was a dollar wasted. The writing is trite and formula driven. I recycled it with the Sunday papers. Big disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even if you are a Binchy fan, this is one to skip","review":"I've been a Maeve Binchy fan for years and was really looking forward to revisiting some old friends in her latest book. Unfortunately, \\"Quentins\\" does not measure up to Binchy's previous work. We meet our heroine Ella, raised by doting parents, and follow her as she strikes out on her own and into the arms of a married man, who - big surprise only to Ella - turns out to be a con artist. Meanwhile, Ella and her friends are making a documentary film about Dublin restaurant Quentins and the people who eat there. The main characters are poorly developed and the more engaging minor characters aren't given enough to do. Apparently Binchy couldn't decide whether to write a collection of short stories or a novel and instead has published an incoherent mixture of both. \\"Quentins\\" careens between syrupy vignettes of Irish life and a clumsy thriller subplot, all not-quite held together by the documentary theme. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and predictable","review":"The premise of Quentins was good -- bringing together characters from past books, but without Binchy's usual character development and plot twists this ended up being a very boring read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely read from Maeve Binchy","review":"Maeve Binchy has a way of creating characters you love, and characters you love to hate. The main characters are so well-drawn and their personalities are given depth and definition so that they stay with you and seem like family friends by the end of the novel.I could say those words about any of her books, however. Quentins is a particular treat because you see the beginning of it all, the restaurant that features so largely in many of Maeve Binchy's books. The story revolves around a documentary film proposal, a girl becoming involved with a married man, Brenda and Patrick Brennan's story, white collar crime and a number of other small stories, all wrapped up at the end in a neat package.This is a really, really good book and I highly recommend it to any Binchy fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and unconvincing","review":"Easy to put down, this is a far cry from what we are used to in a Maeve Binchy novel.

The whole thing just reeked of being fake. I sent it right back and ordered a different model (the Champion) which has more tools, works properly, comes with a users guide and only cost $1 more.

Both sides sniping at each other but when does sniping go too far? When terrorism and biological warfare rear their ugly heads.Hearts of Gold has an intricate complicated plot but strong characters and while blue and gold skins may be difficult to envision their motivations are not.I thought it was a very good book written with Miss Shinn's usually thoughtful characterisations but it didn't really touch me as much as her other books, her Archangel and 12 Houses series which I love.So I would say this book is mostly for Shinn fans who enjoy her writing style and would like most anything she writes."},{"rating":"2","title":"comfortable reading","review":"what I love about this novel is the confident, seamless style of the author. You don't need to make great efforts when reading this story about two different societies that have totally opposed, incompatible lifestyles. Even though the issues are clearly thought-provoking, the second half of the story is entirely predictable. In fact, there are very few surprises altogether -we know from the beginning who is going to fall in love with whom, as we know that the author cannot present us any of the societies (matriarchy and patriarchy) as perfect and has to make their defects stand out. Having said this about the plot, I think the characters are well fleshed out, we care about them and we see how they change throughout the story. The character of Kit, a girl who does not belong in any of the two societies and has a drive for rebellion, is especially likeable.

In comparison, Heart of Gold seems suspiciously simplistic. She writes about racism and sexism without adding anything new to the conversation -- one just feels lectured to.Indeed, to me, it seems almost as if the publisher approached her after The Alleluia Files and asked if there was anything hiding away under her bed, any old work that she could possibly dust off for them to print.It is a perfectly good book.

Quite simply, they have plenty of eligible bachelors in town, but not is single one is willing to settle down and get married....To Marry an Irish Rogue\\" was my first book by Lisa Hendrix, but it certainly won't be my last. I strongly recommend it to everyone, whether you like Ireland, humor, a good romance-anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable tale of love on the Emerald Isle","review":"This was the first book I'd read by Lisa Hendrix, and to be truthful, what caught my eye was the beautiful cover. By the time I finished, I felt I'd definitely gotten my money's worth.Ms. Hendrix paints an enticing word portrait of Irish village life as I remembered it from my visit to Ireland. She has also created a believable love story with a hero and heroine who possess human failings, but who also possess the ability to know when they are wrong and apologize. I enjoyed the interaction between Brian Hanrahan and Tara O'Connell and would have liked to have seen more focus on the storyline between Tara and Brian, involving Brian's business ventures and Tara's perceptions and prejudices about them and Brian, although the storyline involving the women of Kilbooly was entertaining.If you are looking for a way to spend an evening or two absorbing the flavor of Ireland and getting a warm, enjoyable love story in the process, then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"gear mechanism disappointing","review":"While I have owned the Pedrini salad spinner for at least a year and was fairly satisfied with it, recently the \\"teeth\\" pieces of the gear action started to break off.

Along with these stories, he expressed his theory or belief of why people committed crimes. I'm not interested in this kind of theory. I prefer to know when and how the crime was committed.

She seeks out kindly fisherman who's lost all joy in his life after the death of his wife. I was a bit put off by the \\"kindly\\" fisherman's sometimes violent actions although never towards the selkie woman. When he believes he will lose her, he trashes his own home in a fit of rage.

And these other reviewers say you \\"want to be in her shoes\\" and you \\"feel like your in Ty's arms when she is\\"?? Well, she shouldn't have BEEN in Ty's arms to begin with, and I would hope no Christian girl would make the decisions--correction, *mistakes*--that Pam makes.

It is very unrealistic and in the real world if you did what pamela did you probably would have ended up sleeping with this guy (to be blunt about it). Maybe not but I really don't think that the author took care in thinking about her message in this book. And the rest of the storyline in general is kind of unbelievable anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre writing, laughable reading","review":"Pamela's worth reading only if you want to have a good laugh at the standard romance cliches and mock Pamela and Ty for the duration of the novel.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend it","review":"As a sailor myself, I can tell you that Peter Nichols knows his stuff. He weaves a good yarn and keeps you reading. His portrayal of both Schenk and Boden was exciting and believable. (I am also a professional novelist and critique manuscripts regularly.) However, the book ends in such hopelessness and for no good reason that I actually slammed the book down in . . . well, hopelessness---so disgusted that I'd just wasted my valuable time.

This is a good mellow acoustic with blue grassy feel CD for those of you who like me are/were unfamiliar with these guys. One review said it wasn't a Nickle Creek CD.

First, the reviewer complaining about the mix must have a bad copy or poor audio equipment because this is simply not a problem on my stereo. This is simply put a great collaboration. Elements of both Toad and Nickel Creek are there, but blended. So often great talents working together do not turn out great work because of their inability or stubborness to adapt their effort to the particular project. Presently, Jazz is one of the few genres where the greats constantly play together and produce great works. It is nice to see that here. If you have a chance to see them on tour, I reccomend it. This record not only blends their styles, but advances music in general. It is nice to hear something so original and creative in a time of prepackaged uncreative junk.

Not that his voice was obnoxious but the fact that I could hear nothing other than his voice. I listened to 3/4 of the song and could not take it anymore, so I skipped to the next song with the hope that the producer was going for a certain sound for that track, and that the rest would be fine. I was wrong. Virtually every song on this albums was mixed the same way. I was trying as hard as I could to listen to the music underneath but to no avail. I can tell that the music would be beautiful if it were audible. I love Nickel Creek. They are one of my favorite groups. I also love Toad, but for heavens sake, what is this?

One hears them playing along hoping (against all hopes) that they'll really get going or that Sara will sing or Chris will jump in with an incredible mandolin solo or something but this never happens. Glen Phillips does all the vocals and faintly behind him Nickel Creek plays as if they don't want to upstage him. Especially disappointing is they have brilliantly performed several of these songs before in concert (namely, \\"Trouble\\"). If you are a bonafide I-Will-Buy-Everything-Nickel-Creek-Records fan, then go ahead and buy this cd; otherwise, wait until their next release comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Don't I Like This More?","review":"I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, but 6 Days is not enough time to record an entire album, that's more than a track a day! Have you ever recorded music? Then you would know it takes days just to get one song sounding right. For all the love I have for Glen and Nickel Creek I was astonished that they put out an album like this, there's so much potential here, and you can feel it, but they just needed more time. If James Joyce could give 17 years of his life for \\"Finnegan's Wake,\\" than I think these \\"mutual admirers\\" could've donated at least a week to an awesome idea like this, I hope they retry in the future and I'm sure the results will be just splendid, for now, stick to your Toad and Creek CDs and wait it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A serious disappointment","review":"This album was nothing like what I was expecting: I was hoping for more of Nickel Creek, a truly talented trio. Instead, I found a poorly mixed album of songs by performed by a mediocre vocalist, Glen Phillips, whose voice completely over-rode the instrumentals.I bought this CD when it first hit the streets, reserving a copy in advance. I've since played it twice, and will probably give it away in a garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Nickel Creek Fans","review":"After a Nickel Creek concert this past summer, I asked Sarah when another album would be coming out and she said this fall. I am really disappointed that this is the album she was referring to.This is not a Nickel Creek cd, they are merely a back-up band here. These are three brilliant musicians whose talent is completely wasted on this album. The songs are bland at best, it's hard to differentiate one from another. There is none of the magic of their first two albums, none of the intricate bluegrass instrumentals that showcaes their skills. If you love Nickel Creek, don't bother with this...you won't even know they're there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring disappointment","review":"I bought this cd without listening to it because I love Nickel Creek so much.

Big mistake. I was never a fan of Toad the Wet Sprocket but thought if Chris, Sean and Sara were involved it had to be great. But by using these talented youngsters as essentially a backup band for Glen Phillips, it wastes their abilities. There is none of the energy, passion, and spirit found on a Nickel Creek cd or live show on this recording. Overall I just found this cd extremely boring. And due to the fact that I love Nickel Creek so much, the boringness of this cd turned quickly to annoyance. Look for a (slightly!) used copy for sale on Amazon soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off","review":"This is a total and complete rip-off! This is NOT a Nickel Creek CD.

I compared the copy I made from satalite to the dvd and the satalite copy actually has a brighter film like look to it. There are no sub-titles or closed captioning which which would help us in knowing what is being said. There are no extras to speak of.

Very comfortable, the band quality is as fine and strong as you'll find on any expensive watch. The watch is small, not at all like the Invicta or similar watches. And Breitling definitely rates right up there with Rolex, Ball, and Fortis. As with great watches, you will not see this watch discounted much from its MSRP. Some, like Invicta (and many others for that point) , have unreal and inflated MSRPs. Quality watches, like the ones mentioned above just don't play this game. Buy the watch if you like the style and can afford it. The workmanship and overall quality (plus the good service and support Britling is known for) are second to none. Also look at Fortis and Ball if you want a watch in this price group that is also among the best available at any price."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"This game is perfect for a very young child.

If your kids are over 3 yrs. don't waste your money. The game that comes with it is a little difficult for her. I recommend Winnie the Pooh. Its very similar to the game that comes with the VSmile unit just a little easier. It holds her interest with frustrating her."},{"rating":"2","title":"My students love this game","review":"I recently received this game system with the Care Bears game for my pre-school classroom. We use it during free play times, and the kids just love it. For most, it's been their first exposure to video games, and they're learning the controls quickly. The letter and numeral recognition games are really helpful -- but an adult should enrich the gaming by asking questions or encouraging prediction. The adventure games are fun, though a bit difficult to get on moving platforms. We were glad to see that the characters are given unlimited lives - no one loses. While we would never rely on a game to teach our children vital concepts, this one does help them practice in a fun way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute game","review":"I bought this game because it seemed like the best game at the PX that both of my daughters could grasp.

She never hardly plays it because it is so simple. Chasing color balloons and stars, catching a falling letter. Chasing shapes that appear in the exact order you are supposed to put them in. If your child is having problems learning how to use a joy stick this game may help them master that, but it is not challenging for children at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Care for your wallet instead of this game!","review":"My 3 year old son absolutely adores the Alphabet Park Adventure game that came with the V-Smile. Seeing his excitement, I ran to two different stores to look for more games. The first was sold out, but the second had Care Bears. As soon as I got home and started the game for him, I immediately understood why the game was the only one available. My son looked at me like I was crazy, then ran off and played with his other toys. There is no \\"adventure\\" in the learning adventure portion of the game. The tasks are extremely easy and very repetative. There are no goals to reach (like how many power rings you can get, how many life hearts you can maintain) and absolutely no challenge to the mind or imagination. I am going to beg the store I purchased it at to give me some sort of refund, even if it is 1/2 the price.

He takes for granted the stated the ideology of science without delving into how actual practice differs from that ideology. He leaves scientific knowledge outside the realm of sociological understanding and treats those who approach science with a critical eye as anti-intellectual. For those interested in the historical development of the sociology of science, probably a must read. For those who actually want to investigate that field, a book to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"Merton's work has shaped much of twentieth century American sociology. His work in the areas of anomie and deviance are especially useful. His work on the sociology of science is not. In taking a purely institutional approach, he misses much of what occurs in the actual practice of science. He wholesale buys the ideology of science. In doing so, he ignores practices and universalizes the contemporary understanding of what science \\"is\\" across space and time. More than that, however, he treats the content of scientific knoweldge as though it is beyond sociological understanding.

This is even better written and isn't inundated with the personal opinions that plagued the earlier volume. This one hits the mark much better in that he tells the story of the making of this classic with well-researched information not disrupted by supposition.Revealing interviews with cast and crew like Nancy Olson are not only revealing in their tales of life on the sound stage but are actually legitimately informative. Staggs' narrative flows smoothly and makes you feel as if you were present at the interviews and during the research itself.In addition, this is a fun read.

It appears that the directors gathered some stock footage of the recent tsunami (and other types of disasters) that had both English and foreign language commentaries. When the foreign language commentators (probably from a news report in the native country) finished their monologues, an English translator then provided his interpretation. After awhile, this 'doublespeak' became quite tiresome. Also, there was absolutely no in-depth analysis of why these events happened. Or what can be done to help prevent them (if anything). There was no mention of hurricanes or cyclones in the flooding section of the DVD. Did you know that floods occur because too much rain falls and the rivers rise out of their banks? That is about the level of superficial scientific analysis in this DVD.

As to the notion that the Canyon conforms to the biblical creation myth, not much scientific evidence to support the belief. There is evidence of flooding within the Canyon after failure of damns formed when volcanic lava created natural blockage in the Colorado and the power of moving water caused these lava damns to later collapse. This is much different than stretching Noah's flood to the Colorado plateau. The Canyon was formed by geological processes over millions of years and not in conformance to religious documents written by King James scholars a few hundred years ago.

Second question, ever seen a coral reef? Corals cannot survive outside very specific ranges of salinity, visibility, and temperature; a global flood would have drastically altered all of these, killing off every coral on the planet.

The centuries have also presented us with an enormous numbers of cases of bodies being preserved by purely natural means - the most obvious example being the frozen corpse of a neolithic hunter found recently in the Alps and also the many preserved bodies dug up from peat bogs and the like.Heather Pringle examines these and many other cases with enormous humour and gusto and, it must be admitted, just a little bit of grue.

No matter how you adjust the font size, you will not be able to get the line breaks to occur as Melville intended them to. If you use larger type, it simply looks like a prose translation. In a smaller font, the line breaks are generally in the wrong place. In short, don't waste your seven bucks as I have, if proper poetic form -- rhythm -- matters to you.Through no fault of Ovid or Melville this Kindle book is not much use.

Not so. I like the option of having the built in grinder, but what a pain!The coffee machine is huge and is awkward to use anywhere near a kitchen cabinet. Additionally, once the brew cycle is done, you can't clean it without having water pooling around on the counter because of all the little compartments that build up the steam.For those who aren't real technical, stay away from this as well. There are two contact points on the coffee maker that must be in place or it will not run. Once is on the grinder lid (probably a good thing) and the other the hidden door which houses the filter.This makes great coffee and does a super job grinding the beans. I just don't have ten minutes each morning to spend cleaning the machine and the area around it.Bottom line, if you get this you'll be pleased with the coffee. Unfortunately, it's a real pain in the rear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too high maintenance","review":"This machine is simply too high maintenance. The necessity of not only cleaning, but DRYING so many areas before (or after) is not worth the trade off of having freshly ground beans timed for brew each morning.

The boiling and pouring process suddenly seems like a breeze!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Performance Decreased Rapidly and then Machine Broke","review":"From the start this product was disappointing. It was difficult to clean the grinder after brewing. Then over the next few weeks, the coffee maker started steaming alot and thus brewed too little coffe and took an inordinately long time to do so. Then, it just broke. The grinder would no longer work. I took it to a Service Center for warranty work and was told that Krups does not fix these machines and will just send me a new one. Almost four weeks later I received a different coffee maker that did not grind and a seperate grinder. This is what I started with. Now I have two regular coffee makers and two grinders and cannot get anyone at Krups to talk to me, call me back or respond in any way. I will auction the new products on EBAY and will never buy another Krups product. It was not the lousy product as much as the complete lack of customer service that brought me to that decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"Added this machine as the decaf mate to my Capresso grinder/brewer. The usually reliable Krups name let me down. Really messy and pain to clean. So many parts to reassemble and the hook that holds the metal coffee strainer broken already!This would be bearable if the coffee were up to par, but unfortunately that was not the case.

I'm writing this after the grinder snapped (a cheap plastic attatchment holds the metal grid in place,so when this goes, the grinder is shot.) We've only had the machine for six months and usually make coffee on the weekends so this is far from significant wear and tear. Try pouring the first cup without spilling some; it's a great test of your hand eye coordination...I fail every time.

What a mistake! The grinder is the weakest point of the design. The beans do not feed easily into the grinder and become sticky because of the steam buildup in the grinding compartment. The machine is HUGE and will not fit under a counter. It is far too complicated an appliance for such a relatively simple procedure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good cup of coffee, but horrible everything else","review":"I had high hopes for this coffee pot, which probably led to my extreme disappointment. The only positive thing I'll say is it did make a wonderful cup of coffee. The negatives: it took way too long to make a cup of coffee (up to 30 minutes), put out an enormous amount of steam (leading to variable size pots of coffee day to day), and the product itself is comprised of cheap flimsy parts. The grinder plate broke on me within 3 months.All these plus the fact it was very messy. It threw coffee grounds into the water tank and I was constantly wiping up water and grounds off the counter.Krups was nice though and since this model is discontinued, they offered a new coffee maker (With separate grinder). They admited that this grind/brew model couldn't withstand day to day use.I bought a Cuisnart grind/brew now, and it's far superior, with loads more features, higher quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"smedley","review":"I bought this for my husband as a gift and it wakes the entire household (including the cat who is outside) on a daily basis. It is cumbersome and has way too many gadgets to enable it to brew coffee successfully. Filters plug up with grounds that have gone astray and the puring spout is too narrow and spills. I am truly surprised as one would think that after having a lock on the grinder business they could come up with a different design! Husband says it is a great cup of coffee though. I had 2 Toshiba's - one programable and one not which were far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed.","review":"I am very disappointed with this product. I was thrilled with it for the first 4 months, then it started to brew very slowly, producing more steam than water. It beagn to take 30-45 minutes to brew a pot of coffee, and the coffee produced was about half of what was intended. It appeared that the water wasn't flowing through properly.I brought the first one back to the store and exchanged it for another one with which I had the exact same experience. I know that the water I used wasn't the problem, because I used filtered water and the machine also has a filter.I contacted Krups and the customer service department said that they had never heard of this problem. Not helpful at all.I wont buy another Krups product. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for 6 months..","review":"then the heating element dies.

It worked well for about 3 weeks, not too hard to clean, etc. But then one day it wouldn't turn on, and the display went blank. Then it went to the \\"on\\" position permanently, only turning off when unplugged. Obviously, the design has allowed water to get into the electronics. Krups needs to redesign this model, and have a recall of all the appliances out there. This is a fire and electrical danger."},{"rating":"1","title":"We bought two and they both broke.......","review":"We bought two in the period of 8 months because we loved the grind and brew feature. We followed the directions and made sure that the grind area was dry. The machine first machine stopped grinding after 2 months. The second macine stopped after 5 months.

We will never ever buy another grind and brew."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment ...","review":"I bought this because of the Krups name and reputation. What a mistake. While the coffee brewer works fairly well, the grinder is a complete failure. It is noisy enough to wake the dead in the next county, doesn't grind the coffee well, and as a result, the coffee is weak. We gave it away and returned to our old grinder and our old brewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"I have owned the Fresh Aroma Coffe Grinder for approximately 5 months and have been extremely disppointed with the performance. As discussed in prior reviews this machine requires meticulous cleaning to work at all. Unfortunately, despite significant effort cleaning and drying after each use, we still have a constant problem with the water line clogging.

The atomic bomb used does not require maintenance and a special fuze.

Although it is a work of fiction, this riveting tale is inundated with historically accurate Middle Eastern occurences that informed and terrorized. At the very least, you will learn a little bit about the enemy. At the most, you will have nightmares. Lee Boyland has done his work well. Keep the lights on when you read this one and watch the headlines... time will tell just how prophetic his novel actually was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning - A Must Read!","review":"Frighteningly real!

However, she just barely describes each one, dedicating only 2-3 pages for each subject, which seems to take away from the effect. I finished each section wanting more and felt like I didn't learn enough about them to get benefit from reading it. I knew what I needed to work on, but she didn't tell me how to work on it.I also question Farrington's motivation for writing this book. It could just be how I interpreted it, but her tone just seemed so full of pride. I felt like she worships because it makes her feel good for being a Christian, but not because she wants to praise God. This was very distracting for me, and I had trouble not noticing that the author of this book seemed to be writing it more for bragging rights than to help people grow closer to God."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Yeah...

Then, when they finally got to the monster, you can't hardly see anything, and by that time I'd already decided that the characters were just annoying. I really didn't care if they lived or died.

For this and many other implausibilities that go beyond the realm of suspension of disbelief I take away one star.

It was slow to begin with, but when the action started it picked up. However it doesn't give you anything! Where the monsters came from, if they were destroyed, how they were destroyed... nothing.The only plot it follows through on is the romance. That plot was old and tired, same old, same old.Oh yea, the thing I hated most: Everyone dies! I'm not exaggerating. I mean everyone in the movie. Not only that, one girl is bitten by the smaller monsters, she begins vomiting and so the military hauls her away yelling that she's been infected.

There are some plot gaps and predictable but well-executed horror scenes. The FX are impeccable and shocking when the movie's budget is taken into consideration.

Cloverfield is likewise a more clever piece of marketing than cinema. The problem I have with movie fiction masquerading as real amateur footage is that it can actually seem less real. Because I know it's not real the fly-on-the-wall style intrudes on my ability to suspend disbelief and I'm constantly aware that I'm watching a work of fiction. Maybe I'm unusual in this but heck, I can't help that. Having said all this Cloverfield is better than TBWP.

This is somewhat of an interesting idea using the old video footage to tell the back story.However things go from good to really bad in the blink of an eye. Much like the Blair Witch the character is running with his video camera and the movie is shown thru his camera.

All the way through, the almost constant jerking, jumping, and swerving of the camera made my eyes hurt and my head swim. Half of the time, I couldn't tell what was taking place. The Blu-ray video transfer was not very good, but the audio was fantastic. Great effects from the rear channels.The best thing about this film are the CGI effects and the well-designed creatures. Hats off to their designer. Too bad, the director ruined the movie filming it in this fashion, as this was possibly the best giant monster-creature I have ever seen. The ending is abrupt and leaves one with a sense of dissatisfaction and no closure. What a shame! It could have been a great horror flick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, rent if you're that interested!","review":"This movie sucks! Can't really say it any other way. I saw this movie...low budget, not much plot, RENT FIRST if you really want to see it, otherwise you'll regret it. I don't understand why its in blu ray, you probably won't be able to see much of a difference since the movie is so dark...The movie does a poor job of trying to create a world of terror and horror with cheap movie tricks and bad acting. I wanted to enjoy this movie, because big monster movies are hard to come by these days, especially good ones! This one however, made me want to get a refund of the time I spent watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nausea-Inducing and Plotless - and Those Are Its Good Points","review":"Halfway through this movie, I went to the bathroom to throw up. That essentially describes both the nausea-inducing camera work and the nausea-inducing lack of plot, sensibility, or character in Abrams' movie. Some claim that the lack of explanation of the monster's origin, motives or character are a convincing portrayal of 21st century angst. Myself, I think it's just bad writing. And who cares whether these whiny socialites live or die - I was rooting for the monster the whole way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I rented this movie thinking that it was going to be spooky and suspenseful, considering how little they led on about the movie, I thought it was going to make it that much better. Well, just to rent the movie cost me less than a dollar, but I still want a REFUND! This is the only movie I'd say don't waste your time with. Don't even rent it. 2nd worst movie I've seen in my entire life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now that the hype is over, it can finally be said.","review":"This movie really isn't very good. The shaky-cam conceit is annoying, the plot makes no sense, and it's incredibly difficult to care about any of the self-centered yuppies that the movie revolves around. Sadly, it was the center of so much Geek Anticipation prior to it's release that nobody dared say anything bad about it. Still, the fact remains that I've yet to meet a single person that wanted to see this thing a second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad Godzilla clone, shot from first person perspective","review":"My wife and I saw this in the theater. The handcam viewpoint almost made my wife ill with the shaking and occassional spinning around looking for the bad guys. I just thought it was cheesy - an attempt by a usually good director to jump on a supposed hot trend. When you are shooting a monster movie where you are supposed to SEE and CARE about what they are running from, giving the audience a good shot of the monster for a few seconds TOTAL TIME is... lame (I have no better polite word for it).I would not recommend this movie to anyone except a diehard fan of the director or someone that just has to have every movie of a particular genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time watching it.","review":"Until I went to see this movie, I had never before witnessed half of a theater audience getting motion sickness from a film. Unfortunately I have now. I have to say this is the worst film I have EVER seen. For those who thought that Battlefield Earth was the worst movie in history, after you experience this film you will change your opinion. It is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEGATIVE STARS","review":"this has to be one of the worst movies I have ever watched. this will be my first one star review. the whole movie is shot with one hand held camera. it is hard to tell what is going on half of the time, when they run you pretty much just see there feet , alot of the shots you have to tilt your head to watch , 80% of the movie is just interviews , it has no ending it just stops filming , do not waste your time . I noticed that this movie only cost a dollar on Amazon , do not waste your dollar ! I checked this out from the library and I feel as if they need to give me something for watching this horrible movie. I didn't like the way the Blair Witch was filmed but this is much worse . the whole movie is you looking through the camera from what the annoying camera man sees . over 200 people gave this one star , the numbers don't lie !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTREMELY AMATEURISH & BORING TRASH FILM","review":"This is by far one of the worst movie ever made. The plot is extremely amateurish and boring. Don't waste your money or time with the piece of trash. The entire movie is a bunch of teens talking and running in the streets of Manhattan, away from a perceived creature that you only have a very fast glance at. Not even worth a single star !!What a TOTAL RIP-OFF !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"couldnt watch the whole thing.. hud was running around with a camera the whole movie and it was making sick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This film is good for vomiting!","review":"I decided to watch this movie on TV and not at the movie theater because friend had warned me about it making them dizzy and sick because of the camera work. They were right. I rented it last night and could only watch the first 40 minutes then I had to go vomit. This could have been a great movie, it had great special effects and original story but the camera movements kill you. Very dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE...","review":"This was one of the worst movies that I have seen in a while.Who, what, when, why... I DONT KNOW IT DIDN'T SAY! and that bothers me.AWEFUL. sorries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Without a doubt, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I thought Blair Witch Project was bad. Cloverfield makes Blair Witch look like a classic. The Director of this movies should not be given any more movies to direct. The actors should all report to the unemployment office and seek retraining in another field. This qualifies for the biggest rasberry of all time. I can't believe they charged money to see this movie. I feel as though I have been robbed. If this movie was a building it would be condemed; it's that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast forwarding avoids nausea!","review":"I was intrigued by the concept, but after five minutes fast forwarded through the whole thing in about 20 minutes. BTW, this also avoided the whole nausea thing. What a piece of junk. Can't any film maker working today in the science fiction genre realize that a GOOD story is a prerequisite for a quality movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been a TV Movie...","review":"There is absolutely nothing special about this movie. The acting (if you could call it that), story, and handy cam gimmick are nothing new. The movie is short and trite and has the feel of a bad TV movie. Sure they spent a few extra dollars on special effects but they are few and far between and have nothing that stands out. Most are dark half glimpses of the bland looking monster hiding behind a building. I cannot see why anyone would give this movie more than a quick glance, unless they are 14 year-old youtubers who think horror remakes are the s--t."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cloverfield","review":"This movie isn't what I thought it would be. Blair Witch Project was way better then this movie. I would advise everyone to rent it out before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to agree with the majority of reviewers....","review":"Cloverfield did not live up to its hype in my opinion. Maybe it's because I watched the dvd rather than see it the theater, but I just kept feeling that it was a leadin for another movie. Of course, watching the \\"extras\\" I got it that they had a very limited budget, and I have to give the production props for very good cgi work. I just expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Plot and Camera Shaking","review":"I would not give this movie more than a few sentences due to it's lack of real entertainment. If anyone watched The Blairwitch Project then you would know how anoying it is to watch a movie with the camera moving all over the place. Well that movie was not too bad but this one takes the cake. I almost left the movie theatre just like many other people did. I was born and raised in NY and this movie does not match it's locations as they are traveling up north in Manhattan. Gee the monster must have had it's traking device on these kids. When I was a kid we used to go to the midnight showings of scary movies. I used to go all the time with friends to watch \\"Night of the Living Dead\\". Those were good movies. This does not compare to ANY good scary flick. Don't waste your time or money. It does not even deserve ONE star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like playing a xbox game","review":"I thought this looked good but when I watched it, it just gave me a headache. It was like watching a video game on the xbox. This movie was plan horrible, even to rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun","review":"I liked it. I didn't mind the wobbly camera thing (I barely notice these things any more anyway). The thing that made me annoyed was seeing too much of the monster! The first couple of glimpses of him are enough, but instead we get this kind of idiotic American-movie 'got to see him over and over' and reach the climax we do. I was expecting the tricks to spook me and when they came I failed to get spooked because I had predicted how I would get spooked. Well everyday sort of hack filmaking - but still not a bad effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Clever Monster Movie","review":"I'm surprised at so many negative reviews.Loved how this was filmed. The camera does move a little too much, but it didn't bother me too much.Not showing the monster very much was EXACTLY the way to go. It made it more scary like in \\"Jaws\\", when you didn't see the shark very much.Loved how there is no explanation of where, what and how this creature came to be.And I didn't think the monster looked that much like one in \\"The Host\\".I thought \\"The Host\\" was terrible anyway!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cloverfield","review":"I just saw the movie. I donot like this movie. The camera angels where bad. It was not anywhere near as good as Godzilla. Not much action just a lot of running and seeing threw the eyes of the camera. You did not see the monster destroy buildings. You did see a little bit of the monster now and than. I think this movie was made to see just how bad a movie can be made. If I could give a negitive in the stars I would. If the movie was shown buy the Army or Monster point of view it would have been a lot better. Poor writing, Poor Camera angels. One long boring Movie. Save your money and get a real action dvd. Like anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time, money, and resources","review":"Over hyped, horrible movie, with a worse ending. That sums it up, do not waste your time on this, it is 1.5 hrs of my life and $4 of my video on demand I will never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"Imagine making a movie with a hand-held camera? Are these guys kidding? Don;t waste your time; How did they get this film on the market?"},{"rating":"1","title":"what the ?","review":"I really like the ideas behind this movie. i could really care less if we ever see the big bad monster but they picked the wrong people to follow around. next time they should just name the movie \\"retards with a camera\\" so we all know what we are going to be paying for. part of the time in this movie the the camera guy, Marmaduke from Carpoolers, has the camera pointing at the ground or they are running in the dark. nothing the characters do is believable at all nor are they even likeable. just save your time and money with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"by the time the first five mins were up I wanted everybody to die in this movie. I think the use of filming the the events as it happens by a guy wno never filmed before was overly exagerated. he never ran out of film or even batteries. and believe me if this kind of crap is going on I can see some of the footage could be filmed but not consistantly. and the video quality was far too good to say it was your average video camera. even the best cameras are not that good which is why 28 days later still rules as the best film shot on a digital camera ever. everything is crap.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cloverfield, far too hard to watch","review":"I tried to watch this movie twice but I had to turn it off after twenty minutes.It was too handheld which is too bad, because the story had potential and it could have been a good movie if it was made better and less jumpy. Didn't they have a stabilizer in the camera or something like that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gives Battlefield Earth a run for its money","review":"The second worse movie ever made. The first 20 minutes is a pointless idiot soap opera done in \\"shaky cam\\" which is impossible to watch, bad actors showing a fake New York stereotype yuppie ghetto wannabe lifestyle that never existed, interrupted by an improvement on Godzilla where-after the rest of the movie is running, screaming, yelling at each-other, all done in shaky cam. This movie gets in to the same arena as Battlefield Earth for sheer unwatchableness. My left mouse button was on fast forward 90% of the time.It may be that people who like fake \\"reality\\" shows on television or people who watch television a lot and like idiot low-IQ dialog that's done mostly in screaming will enjoy the movie, however the movie is *not* intended for people with even average intelligence, it targets the low-IQ \\"reality\\" television-watching demographic.Not worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cloverfield manages to be awesome and terrible at the same time.","review":"This movie has 3 major problems:1 - It takes entirely too long for the monster thing to attack, up to that point it's a How To guide for anyone who wants to write a pathetically boring Relationship struggle movie.2 - Once the truly interesting part of the film begins, it all ends far to quickly. And Even though the Idea of keeping the Monster largely off camera is pretty compelling, a lot of the shaking camera stuff failed to enthrall me as much as give me a migraine.3 - I guess I'm not allowed to share spoilers, so let me just say, the plot (besides the \\"Giant Monster in Manhattan\\" bit) is just awful and I'll leave it at that.However, visuals, audio, and the rest were overall entertaining. This is not a bad movie, but check your brain at the door."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad.","review":"Silly, stupid, not scary, if you watch the extra's (because I wanted to see what their motive was for making such a bad film was, Godzilla, since Japan has a monster the USA should have one, I ain't kidding! Also the monster was suppose to be a Baby monster that was scared and that's why it was running around crazy.) Do not waste your time or money, thank God I didn't as I rented this garbage from the Public Library for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like a commercial for Tylenol","review":"This is a simple review. See \\"The Mist\\" instead.Cloverfield is a boring one and half hour of headache inducing nothingness. There is only one good scene in the movie which I won't ruin should decide to waste money and buy or rent this.You see \\"the creature\\" briefly. Instead you follow a bunch of morons trying to be the next Blair Witch Project in New York.So if you want a great monster flick that serves on many levels do yourself the favour and see The Mist instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Blair Witch","review":"The moment I found this was a handheld camera movie, I didn't want to see it. Blair Witch was hyped up as an awesome movie, and it was dumb.This movie was probably the best action movie of the year. I thought that this is a realistic approach to how the military would react and people with panic, September 11th came to mind, but also, how cool it is that this monster is doing all the carnage, Godzilla style. September 11th meets Godzilla, terror meets bad A action. This movie makes you feel uncomfortable, unsettled and hopefully, makes you realize that living in a big city is a bad idea!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuppies screaming oh s*** oh s***","review":"The camera is irritating, the characters are annoying, and all they do is run around screaming \\"oh s*** oh s***\\" and \\"oh my god oh my god\\". Seriously, I watched this with closed captioning and you could predict what the next caption would read.The beginning of the movie drags with twenty minutes of boring dorks partying, then it consists of them lurching from one whammy to another while you hope for them to die.The only thing that saves this from being one stars is that some money clearly went into the special effects. It was entertaining to see New York City get smashed up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Rendition of Old Fashioned Sci Fi","review":"This was a rollicking exciting and different rendition of the good ole 1950s B movie Monster eats Manhattan movie. The vid cam (that was one excellent camera, and I want that battery!) film style added greatly to the suspense, and the acting was right on, realistic. A solid movie with a somewhat predictable, but yet touching ending. (Speilberg should take lessons from this film-making of scifi)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely loved it.","review":"Cloverfield takes a fairly unoriginal plot, mashes it together with an excellent cast of (mostly) Hollywood nobodies, and allows us, the viewers, to watch through the video camera of Hudson Platt.I loved the way this film was done. The same shaking camera that made a lot of people dizzy just made the movie seem all the more real to me. If anything, the first person filming style personalized the movie for me (rather than making me sick, as other reviewers have claimed. I never felt dizzy or nauseous at all while watching Cloverfield, but maybe that's just me) and made it easier to relate to the characters' pain. Also, the monster was totally awesome!This is an instant monster-movie classic in my book. I would advise renting it first rather than going out and buying it though, just in case you're one of those people who get sick while watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"First of all if you didn't know this movie was shakey before you saw it, you are an idiot. This movie had one of the largest viral marketing campaigns ever. Secondly, I have seen this movie several times, including the theater (which it was awesome at), and have not once gotten sick or even close to feeling like I was going to be sick. For one, it's only about an hour long. Have you not watched home movies that were that shakey for an hour??? Yes, it's kinda dumb the guy would be carrying around a camera during all this, but if he didn't guess what??? There's no movie. I thought it was creative, and a dang good entertaining monster movie. You can't help but get some chills when the monster first attacks and you see the statue of liberty's head going rolling down the street. I'm really surprised at all the bad reviews this movie is getting on amazon. I guess we just need another romantic comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Poster is better than the Movie!!!","review":"What others have said is true: this is a clumsy hybrid of Blair Witch and the most recent Godzilla film with Matthew Broderick, right down to the baby monsters popping up all over. There is nothing original here at all, actually. (Orson Welles used the same techniques on radio nearly 70 years ago - but his \\"War of the Worlds\\" was ground-breakingly brilliant!) This flick's poster is more rivetting than the actual film - yet even the poster is derivative of the closing shots of the original 'Planet of the Apes.' I also never knew any camcorder battery to last as long as Hud's does in this movie. The monster also looks totally fake and stupid. Anyway - a far better film in this same genre is \\"The Host\\" out of South Korea a few years ago. Now there was a well-made big monster movie with big human themes! Terrific special effects and music score, too. Lousy dubbing...but still a thousand times better than \\"Cloverfield.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One Fun Movie!","review":"Unbelievably great! I had an awesome time while watching this! It has intense suspense, and a \\"you are there\\" feel to it! There are some really good creepy-crawly parts, and there are some things that make you wonder what the heck-is-going-on, with a few unanswered questions that leaves you wondering! (Maybe answered in the sequel?) The effects are stunning! This one is a \\"must-see!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Scary Thrill Ride!!!","review":"This movie makes you feel like you are there when everything is happening. It makes it seem more realistic. It was a great storyline, but by the end of the movie, my eyes were hurting, and I had a headache, because of the camera shaking. Maybe it was because I was dumb enough to sit too close to the screen. Here's some advice: sit far back away from the screen. The monster was very creepy. There was a scene where the main characters are in a helicopter, and you see the monster being attacked and falling down, then there's huge smoke where you can't see it. Everyone thinks it's dead, then all of the sudden, the monster jumps up and attacks the helicopter, and it feels like it coming right at you. If you love thrillers, you'll love CLOVERFIELD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A different kind of monster movie","review":"I noticed most of the negative reviewers on here seem to be comparing Cloverfield to the Godzilla mess of a decade ago. That right there should tip you off to quit reading. I of course had to see what all the fuss was about after all the hype and monster concealment. The camera was too jerky, but it really didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. I liked how you felt as if you were in the movie the entire time. Even the end credits leave you feeling like you watched real events on a tape someone left behind. The acting was pretty good for the most part and the CGI monster/New York City destruction looked real.If you get motion sickness easily, avoid at all costs. Otherwise, you can't miss this experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgetful.","review":"This movie is so bad. When I say bad, I mean bad as in not cool and not good in any way shape or form.I read the reviews and I thought this could be a really great movie - only to be extremely disappointed. The camera action (jitter) was probably put in afterwards to hid the fact that this movie sucks. Its boring, the dialog is horrible and a waste of time.Thankfully, I skipped forward to get through it. Unbearable. Its a movie so bad the movie pirates skipped it. That's how good it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"If the jitter camera shots don't make you puke... the story will... i had such high hopes for this movie... skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blair Witch camera man gets drunk....","review":"and is hired to film Cloverfield. In all seriousness, I understand the director wanting to record how he feels someone would react to a crisis while attempting to capture it all on the film, but he really should have assumed that this person, although probably slightly inebriated, could use the zoom button on the camcorder. To say this film was extremely hard to watch and, in a theater setting, nauseating is quite an understatement. I give it one star, instead of a zero, because it actually had a very promising story line and could very well have been a very good sci-fi movie given another director."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cloverfield","review":"An UNBELIEVABLE terrible movie.

Well then you will love Cloverfield. This is the first movie I have wanted to pluck my eyes out over. This sucked SO BAD. I watched it for some redeeming qualities and found NONE (except when it ended; sweet relief). Don't even waste your time if someone gives it to you for free (they are just trying to get rid of the worst movie ever). Not even worth a look at $0.99 rentals. At least with Netflix it was not the only movie I got..."},{"rating":"1","title":"nausiating movie","review":"Crickey,I felt bloody sick within half an hour of watching this(vertigo from all the camera motion). Definitely a low bvudget movie - wish I had known before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 of the worse rental movie of my life","review":"I saw the trailer back in the theater months back and I was very curious about the movie. I even read the reviews of this before renting it and it seemed to be positive. WEll, I just finished watching this and I couldn't wait to put my own thoughts.I've seen a fair share of movies, and this was 1 of the worse movie ever made. The camera type recording was ridicilous and dizzy and the whole story was DUMB. This is NOT even worth renting and the ending is bulls%^t. I could not believe it was even made. Wasted my 80 mins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse movie ever!","review":"Special effects: very good. Plot, acting, story... Don't even bother, and the special effects don't make up for wasting your time.

I left about half way. My wife stayed. The entire movie was shot with a camcorder (or envisioned to be) so throughout the entire movie you are watching - constant shaking and upside down images, it was someone walking and running with the camcorder on. Not a good way to make a movie that anyone would be able to watch without getting sick. I tried to watch this movie and got sick due to the perceived \\"motion\\" of the camcorder. The story is poor and the actors are all novices. I thought the National Tresures movie I recently watchere in this same Cinema was bad, but this one is much much worse. Totally lack of story and lack of any conclusions. I would not recommend anyone with a sound mind to have to sit through this bad movie. It is not worth 5 cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"If I had known this was shot in the Blair Witch style of camera work I wouldn't have hought it.

I was attracted to this movie just because of its \\"good\\" poster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Play by It's Own Rules","review":"I notice that the raving Amazon editorial review starts off by saying Cloverfield doesn't play by the usual rules. Well, it doesn't play by it's own rules, either. The film is totally reliant on a gimmick that it doesn't even use properly. Supposedly the \\"cam corder view\\" is an attempt at hyperrealism, but all it succeded in doing for me was take me out of the moment time and again. There is nothing at all \\"realistic\\" about a hand held camera that always catches every important event and facial expression and that never gets dropped even when its operator is running through wreckage, dodging monsters and leaping from building to building.This movie was no better than any number of Made For Sci-Fi Channel TV movies I've seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"War of the Worlds meets the Blair Witch Project","review":"I had high expectations of this film but overall it was dull. Although different from most other films it left me empty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cloverfield","review":"Its a great monster movie for the times we live in since we dont see that many monster movies out anymore. Other than the camera angle its worth buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godzilla meets the Blair Witch Project","review":"Not the worst movie ever made, but the intentionally jerky camera work is annoying. They spent some money making it, and the special effects are good, if you can get past the camera work, I couldn't. At least the equally disappointing Blair Witch Project had an excuse (for the camera work, not the story line), no budget. I didn't like the lack of explanation for what was happening either. Normally, part of my enjoyment of a film is when they tie everything together and you understand what is happening. It's a cop out when they \\"leave it to your imagination\\", meaning they didn't have the imagination to tie it all together."},{"rating":"2","title":"kewl flick, but a bit nauseating","review":"i loved this movie and saw it in the theater as soon as it came out. i think the lost camera thing helped make it very realistic and entertaining. the only part i didn't like was when they were at the party in the beginning and swinging the camera all around madly. it has some crashes, gore, sprinting down manhatten streets covered in glass and rubble in just bare feet. yes, they all die except lily,and people say that's depressing. so what? people die.all in all, a good movie, though maybe not one you'd want to see with little kids or your grandparents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, done that","review":"Ok, I get it: \\"Blair Witch Project\\" (with a budget) meets \\"War of the Worlds.\\" Been there, done that. Yeah, the monster (from outer space, I assume) was cool but I kept thinking of the Zerg from Starcraft, which made me laugh. No plot to speak of (see: \\"28 Weeks Later\\") and I was disappointed by the lack of back-story.Overall: cool special effects but still a predictable and uninspired film.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cloverfield","review":"I didnt like this movie at all . Iwhich i would of seen it before i bought it . It dont make any sense at all. Iwas so dark you could hardly see anything at all. My husband even fell asleep during the movie.

Iwished i hadnt purchase this It not worth $14.99 . thats what i paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"Awlful, is giving this film more then it deserves. The first twenty minutes are spent at a party for a friend who is just being promoted and moving to Japan. It is observed and filmed by a member of the group who apparently has Parkinsons disease. The film will literally make your stomach upset and is really quite boring. Special effects are good ,but not worth the time. The plot in non exsistant and the acting is putrid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarey... but the shaky camera is SUPER ANNOYING!!!!!!!!!","review":"They made a mistake by using the handheld for the whole thing. It was scarey but I almost walked out near the begining because the begining party scene was too long. It reminded me of being at ground zero on 9-11. The acting was pretty bad too in some cases. Unfortunately the worst was the guy holding the camera- terrible actor. And it would have been deeper if we had a little more information about the creatures. The stupid jocks we're following around are too stupid to think much about it. They stole the running rat scene from 28 Days Later, and let's face it- they stole the whole camera thing from Blair Witch. This could have been a great film with normal cameras."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like this, I really did...","review":"But I really disliked the main characters. I found them to be very annoying, especially the cameraman. When you're rooting for the monsters to kill the cast off and the movie isn't even halfway over yet, it's not a good sign. The handheld camera view was also hard to endure. When it was over, I wanted an hour and a half of my life back. I don't think that the presence of the \\"MST3K\\" cast would've helped this film any."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very different than 99% of what you usually see.","review":"Yet enjoyable and worth watching. Lot's of people gave a bad review don't let that stop you from watching it. Of course the vast majority of people go watch movies like Transformers and the Twilight Saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been a great movie","review":"From all those trailers and commercials of Cloverfield, I was real excited to see this. It gave the intense feeling other monster movies use like Alien. However, many fall backs keep this (probably) great movie from reaching its potential. For one, the camera is very shakey; I understand the producers are trying to give the authentic point of view feeling, but they overdid it and made the camera bounce up and down and moving very rapidly. The beginning was horrible...party scene was tasteless and very long. As I said, don't watch this movie if you know you are sensitive to motion. I left early because I almost threw up, and I'm just giving you sound advice.

It gave me chills in back of my head that this could be really happened before viewing this film.However we all know that pausing/pretend this film as authentic/really happened events by shooting with hand held video cam does not convinced me as more realistic when I started viewing film. It just made me sick and I really wanted to walk out of the theater.It was very unfortunate for me because what underneath of this insanely shaky camera works I also saw something very great.......:("},{"rating":"1","title":"Cloverfield.","review":"Cloverfield is a terrible movie annoying and liable to make you dizzy thanks to someone's \\"bright\\" idea of moving the camera around. it's like blair witch yet worst(how that's possible I don't know).the movie is just a rip off of godzilla and plays off end of the world fears.I have seen B-movies ten times better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cloverfield As Good SciFi","review":"The movie story is interesting. The monsters are quite good and frightening. However, the method of filming is more than distracting. This is the first movie that gave me motion sickness.I read about this effect in the original movie revews. It wasn't until halfway through the movie that it hit me. This attempt at filming innovation get a big one star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary as hell.","review":"I've had several nightmares after seeing this movie. I've always wanted to see a movie about a nightmarish creature terrorizing a city, and this movie delivered admirably. Who cares what the monster is or where it came from? Not knowing just makes it scarier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short, annoying shaky cam, but ok monster","review":"This is 9/11 meets Godzilla meets Blair Witch Project meets Alien. The scenes of falling buildings and billowing smoke blowing up Manhattan streets like an avalanche are straight out of 9/11. The filmmakers are up front about their homage to the Japanese Godzilla movies. And the hand-held video cam throughout the entire 75 minute film is Blair Witch, but very annoying after awhile. I thought the little spidery monsters looked like Alien leftovers. There are almost as many extras as there is movie, but you won't care if you don't like the film. I thought it was ok, if a bit thin. The 20 something actors don't show much talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe the hype","review":"Film about giant creatures laying waste to New York, told from the point of view of one character who films it all on his camcorder. Human drama and monster mayhem collide in this genuinely scary production from Lost and Alias creator J. J. Abrams. The monsters in this film will freak you out. They sure did me, and although this film did not quite reach the heights I was expecting this is still a must-see film. Believe the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Best Movie of 2008","review":"This was the only gift my husband wanted.

The director ought to be horsewhipped! Apparently he decided that the premise was SO idiotic that there was no way he could explain why ANYTHING happens - so he doesn't. We never even have a hint about where the monster comes from, what it is, why it's attacking New York, what it's trying to accomplish.... Oh, yes. And why this movie was ever made. Apparently keeping the viewer in the dark PAST the closing credits is considered \\"arty\\" by people trying to substitute that for talent.And what can I say about the hand-held camera idea? Its spastic motion all over the place (as opposed to pointing it in the direction of something you'd want the viewer to see...) gave me a splitting headache from eyestrain. Other flicks have managed to use the hand-held technique WITHOUT showing us the floor 70% of the time.

I wasted two hours of my life on this garbage. I knew ten minutes in it was cooked, yet I continued to watch the whole thing , mostly because I wanted to see if it could get any worse.

It has the Blair Witch Project type of filming. With a guy video taping aliens attacking. Okay, I can by that, but when they are after you, you're not going to keep focusing on what's going on, you're gonna run like hell! Not to mention one of the females got bitten, and was supposed to be really injured to the point of dying, but boy did she have the strength to run fast, so fake. We let our kids watch this, and they even thought it was dumb. Don't waste your time on this movie. None of the people in it were big names, only strays for a low budget movie, and it really showed.

I could have dealt with the hand-held camera perspective if you actually got to see something. You never really got a good look at much worthwhile.

Not as original as it was made out to be, just the same concept as Godzilla on the loose in Tokyo with better SPFX. Creepiest scenes were those atop a tall, leaning residential building, and on a crowded bridge at night. How the actual story was told---via camcorder---was a nice touch. Has some good moments.

If you bought a car and it was a lemon you could take it back for a refund. A shame you can't really do that for bad movies as well. It instantly reminds me of movies like Blair Witch. If I'd known it was filmed to pretend it was real, I would have never bought it. I watched about 30 minutes of it before its weak plot and \\"artistic\\" shooting style was just to much.

This film totally sucked. Read all the other reviews and then read between the lines. There is absolutely nothing to recommend this movie.

I used to think BW was the worst to come out of Hollywood...but now its Cloverfield."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing at best","review":"The director does a facile job of creating tension. That's really the only positive I can assign to this movie. Most of our time was spent by a bunch of stereotypically irresponsible twentysomethings partying and then screaming, \\"Oh my God,\\" \\"What was that?\\" and \\"What's going on?\\" We didn't really see anything gelling until, oh, the last fifteen minutes. IMHO, Cloverfield ranks up there with The Blair Witch Project in the \\"much ado about nothing\\" department."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than expected","review":"Unfortunately, this movie missed the mark more than I had envisioned, even considering the poor reviews. The characters and the decisions they make are fairly unrealistic given the scenario at hand. There are MANY technical mistakes. The ending and key moments leading up to it are extremely predictable (e.g. the story leaves much to be desired). There are a number of \\"cheesy horror\\" moments that serve no purpose except to be slavish to the genre. At least the camera work was mildly interesting, though.In short, if you want to see a cheesy horror film in the vein of The Blair Witch project, and you don't mind turning off your brain, you might partially enjoy this film. I did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"ever see the Blair Witch story? Here it meets a big monster","review":"Ugh.I was completely disinterested in the loser characters.The monster is kind of stupid.They all die in the end.But it was watchable, kind of.

This is just over hyped, and not that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invincible Monster","review":"I personally think there were a lot of problems with this one. The person holding the camera for most of the movie was insanely annoying. Even during the disaster, he was making jokes and saying things like \\"ROB, ROB, ROB, ROB,\\" and \\"You guys see that?\\" The monster was continuously being attacked by machine guns, missles, and bombs and it never got a scratch. Throughout the movie, wherever the main characters were, so was the monster. How could the monster \\"know\\" where they were all the time? During the rescue attempt, the chopper flies close above the monster; how dumb can you be? Since you only see what the video camera sees, a lot of the story is left out and you only know what the person holding the camera knows; therefore, nothing is explained at all. The amazing thing about the movie was the computer graphics, which simulated new york city very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is a crime against viewers","review":"This movie made me very depressed, I had to go out to eat something: how inane, amateur and irritating it was all the way. It must be rule No 1: never make a movie from the point of view of a rolling camera; it becomes annoying within a few minutes. Is it some movie school student's work? Acting, plot, camerawork, everything seems idiotic. The filmmakers must be held legally responsible for this crime of taste and our, viewers', wasted time and irritation. Doesn't the latter cost anything??Don't ever waste your time for this film. If you want a similar kind of adventure, try The Mist, at least it's done more professionally."},{"rating":"1","title":"another Godzilla spin off that stinks","review":"Ok enough with the cutting edge cinematography!

Geeze...even Godzilla was better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful!!!","review":"Bought it instead of renting. Big mistake. It's like the Blair Witch Trials. The camera shakes the whole time, people running and screaming, and you have no clue what is going on. The graphics suck. The story part would have been great if more info was included. Who is going to hold on to a camera the whole time your running from a giant monster? Whether you are 50 feet in the air or being attacked in a dark subway while creatures is attacking you. Not to mention that the camcorder is like the tuffest camcorder of all time and with a super battery LOL. No camcorder is going to withstand that kind of drama and the battery would not last an entire night and next morning. Kind of stupid but just my opinion.

And apparently the creature couldn't find a baby-sitter as there are a bunch of nasty baby creatures running around.I smell a sequel coming and hopefully this time they will hire a steadier cameraman but then it will be just another Godzilla movie and Lord knows we could always use another Godzilla movie.The only scene in this film that had any impact was the Statue of Libertys' head careening down the avenue like a bowling ball-and I'm not sure if it was a political statement but that scene was filmed clear and with a steady hand.

Make up your own mind... see the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent Godzilla instead","review":"While this film has a lot to recommend it, it is a disappointment overall. I liked the idea of a video record of an attack by a monster from the viewpoint of one person's camcorder. The performances in the film are good and the special effects are very well done. However, the overall effect never really gets you involved with the story. The monster is only seen in quick glimpses untill the very end of the film. There is no clear resolution to the film's story, other than you know that there is a military attack on the monster and that the camcorder was found later on. (Spoiler alert) You only know that most of the characters that you are watching die, one in a very gruesome way.The films concept was a good one, I thought, but if you're going to see NYC trashed by a monster, get the remake of Godzilla. It's not a great film, but at least it doesn't take itself too seriously and has some fun to it. This film is a major downer and doesn't really hold together."},{"rating":"2","title":"love","review":"I loved this movie so I bought it. Where is part 2? I know it was filmed in LA a few years ago.

Although the idea of viewing everything through the viewfinder of a camcorder took a bit of getting used too, it added to the realizm. The action is a bit slow to get started but once it does (and it does quite abruptly and without warning) the rest of the movie is fast paced right to the end. The video and audio effects are great on blu-ray. If you like sci-fi thrillers where a huge creature wreaks havoc on a major city, you'll like this one.

It took fifteen minutes before something mildly intersting happened. I disliked all of the major characters, and since there is no story line per se, without characterization there is nothing left but some not-very well-done Special Effects.Basically, this is the sort of movie that a film student makes in their second year as an experiment.

The beginning scenes of character development were not only believable but very funny. I found myself sympathizing with this character Hud(son) and his consistently failing attempts to moor Marlena. Coming from somebody in this age group (twenty-somethings) the language, body and verbal from these characters was strikingly \\"real\\"....and then all hell brakes loose. It's a wild ride I definately recommend this to anyone. I didn't find the camera angles sickening, maybe I just have a strong stomache.

It gives a situation no one would have thought of. The monsters created by digital effects were incredible, completely different. The small monsters created by the large one were the worst. If you got bitten, you would seem okay but sometime later you will feel faint and explode. The characters did a very good job portraying the action. The scene at the end doesn't give you any insight except death so you have to see it and find out everything in between.

So summarize what i HATE about this movie:- I dont know if movie makers ever think of putting themselve into a dangerous situation but still filming.- A movie without content except the city was attacked by monster and people were running around seeking places to hide- Main characters are idiot folks- Special effect, well, is far worse than Gorilla- Movie is too shortSo recommendation:- If you just want a movie about monster, maybe it's for you.- If you want to get dizzy and vommit on your popcorn, hola, you get one."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAK.","review":"Cloverfield is not clever. It is not the first time that a film has used the gimmick of being shot by handheld camera. A better movie to have been done in this style would be The Blair Witch Project. At least The Blair Witch didn't give me a headache, and was actually creepy in the end.Cloverfield is not terrifying. I was not on the edge of my seat. I did not care about the characters. The monsters were not very frightening. It lacks intensity.Cloverfield is not worth your time or money. The whole beginning of the film is worthless. They wait way too long to bring in the monsters. There's this big part about this guy's girlfriend that is boring and you will not care about that takes up a long time. That beginning part should be introducing you to the characters and making you care about what happens to them, but it is not effective in doing that at all.I wish I had skipped this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retarded.

I don't like gore, and I don't like heavy violence, and there was none of that in this movie - it was PG-13 for a reason - but you see nothing, and you understand nothing. The lousy shaky cam nonsense is bad enough to make you close your eyes in parts, the acting is awful and the plot non-existent. If you are over 15, forget it, what a complete waste.

A poorly conceived mess with laughable dialogue, awful acting, completely unlikeable morons and way too many utter absurdities to even go into. Sounds like a review of Lost.

The shakey cam was so bad that I spent more than half the moving looking away from the screen. From what I could here the dialogue was mostly \\"lets get out of here\\", \\"Dude where are you going\\", and \\"Aaaaaa oh god oh god\\".I thought the big monster was goofy looking, and the small ones were rip offs of the bugs from Starship Troopers (another horrible movie).I wish I could give this movie negative stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can this be really called a movie?

I know it is supposed to look that way, but realy once the party is over, apparently there are only five people in all of Manhatten. Most of the dialogue is screaming, OMG! The Army had an almost immediate response to the event. They seem to have arrived en mass about five minutes after the scary spidery thing appears. Shades of 9/11 with buildings crashing down. It seems you can have an injury serious enough to bleed to death, but once extracated you can run several city blocks. This wasn't bad film-making it was the worst movie I may ever have seen in my 61 years! Too much unbelievable feats, too much reliance on main characters (apparently after these five can not escape the city, they are all alone--we know now how fast and efficiently you can evacuate NYC); why bother paying for extras to make it more realistic?

Unfortunately the \\"regular folks\\" are terrible. The movie starts off attempting to establish the characters but alas the characters come across as being one dimensional, for whom I have very little, if any, empathy for. The dialogue from the camera operator becomes annoying. And as each character dies there is a pervading sense of \\"oh well, no great loss there\\". Quite simply - the concept behind the movie is superb, alas the execution is utterly flawed, and to sum up my impression of the film then it would be \\"Terrible\\".

After about 30 plus minutes of BORING film about some one relocating for some reason, it starts to get a little interesting, it then actually proceeds to interesting - It could have been, dare we say Good, and then it was over. No who are these little monsters and where did they come from, no who is this big monster and why are they all here , and at the end a heliocopter crash and its over.

The other was busy playing with him self because he could not pay attention.But I still can't say enough good things about this, it is an all around great film, I have the DVD(Steelbook), but now also Blu-ray.

I felt like I was watching the Ferris Bueller remake of Godzilla from the standpoint of the people being squashed in the street.If I had seen this in the theater, I would have walked out.

Paramount should have learned its lesson from Sony Pictures Entertainment Corporation during their debacle of their Godzilla (1998) movie adaption. Their viral campaign showed very little of the monster until the day of the movie and it ended up bombing, not making much more than Cloverfield did.To make things worse, Matt Reeves took what could have a wonderful creature movie and turned it into a rollercoaster ride of nauseated dizzyness. Now, there's talk of a sequel filmed with a different point of view? Matt Reeves is making a mockery of the Movie Industry in Hollywood.Even the filming style was completely un-original ...If you want to see a real monster movie, stick with the originals ...

This is a movie that took itself to seriously and tried to make something out of nothing.3) The acting wasn't believable. IF you're going to make a movie like this and use unknown actors. At least get top of the line acting since this maybe their big break. Not the ones the movie used since this maybe and only movie they make.4) Not another Blair Witch Project.

I gave this a rating of 1 because they didn't have any numbers going in the negative direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst","review":"absolutely not worth one dollar, worst movie I have ever seen, no plot, no answers to any questions that were brought up in the film, the camera shaking all the time does not give a clear picture and makes one nauseaus,in a word the movie sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Odd","review":"I just did not care for the film at all. It was very strange and a bit odd. It was Sci Fi gone wild."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blaire Witch Remake","review":"Sorry, this movie had all the trapping for a good sci-fi, but fell flat on it's face. We fast forwarded through most of it to catch glimpses of the monster, which was really good when it was visible. Filmed like \\"Blaire Witch Project\\", we are forced to watch a group of bumbling idiots being recorded by a person with a nervous disorder. Over and over, we are forced to watch as the actors scurry away from the monster, not watch the monster. Each scene is drawn out to boredom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Movie all things considered","review":"First let me say that they did not have a clue as to how large the head of the Statue of Liberty was and second, the group constantly calling the lead actors name got annoying. That being said the movie was really good and very innovative. Many people do not like the hand held video effect a la Blair Witch but it give the movie a feeling of reality. Also, only catching \\"glimpses\\" of the creature made it all the more terrifying and realistic. the first half hour is slow but builds the story and makes the onset of the attack all the more intense. Stick with it and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least the monster looks cool!","review":"This movie at least has a decent monster. I just wish it would have been less Blare Witch. I got tired of the camera always not showing stuff and jumping from one time stamp to another and always bouncing around like a home movie. This movie does not even end in a concluding way. You do not know who lives or dies. You do not know if the monster lives or dies. I give it a two star rating only because of the alien's quality monster. It is cool and the Blu Ray has a sharp picture. Rent his movie or borrow if from some sucker like myself who bought it thinking the director of Lost would not let a movie this bad passes his desk. Oh well, guess we all make mistakes. Buying this movie was one of mine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop Hatin'","review":"I wish pple would stop hatin' on this! The shakiness isn't all that bad! And pple just keep on hatin' on it. The acting is believable,the monster is awesome and the gore is limited but this movie is awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a FPS movie","review":"If you are a gamer you probably have played a FPS (first person shooter) where all you see is what your character sees, and that is how cloverfield is shot,through the eyes of these people running away from the monster, it is a great thrill to see it through their eyes and i hope more movies are shot like this in the future. The only problem i had with it though were the first 20 minutes, too much talking.I recomend this movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"It takes guts to say it. . .","review":"I felt the military was covered well. Occasionally the group fleeing the monster encounter military personal fighting the beast and in their utterances we get an update on what's really going on, the big picture. It was probably unrealistic though, or at least some parts of it were unrealistic. 6 hours after Godzilla drops, M1 tanks (our main battle tank) and even heavier artillery pieces are fighting in Manhattan? Didn't earlier in the movie it show one of the bridges into Manhattan being destroyed? Perhaps it was possible. . .It was only after the movie was over, thinking about it, that I realized what the movie was about (odd that I give a movie I don't understand 10 stars, but I do - I think my date liked it as much or more than I did). I think Cloverfield is about the bravery of the characters. Each character in the movie is braver than I would have been but it is believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps your attention","review":"Interesting and just creepy enough to give me the chills. Yeah the camera could make you a little dizzy but it's not too bad if you watch it on a smaller screen. Not the best movie I've seen but it's entertaining. Worth watching once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Stupidest movie I've seen in a long time. Characters were shallow and unlikable, situations involving real-life things (medical conditions, etc.) totally implausible, had the potential to be a good movie and failed miserably. Don't waste your money or the hours of your life you'll never get back. Cinematography gave me a headache, didn't add any suspense to the story, just really annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captured confusion of an urban disaster","review":"I rated the movie 4 stars because it avoided horror movie cliches in favor of random mayhem.Having a big monster tramping through a city must be pretty confusing. Where do you go? What are those little monster-thingies falling off him? What happens if you get scratched/bitten by one? How big a pack of jerks are the authorities going to be?All that came across in the movie. Not great art, but not crud either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old News","review":"What a disappointment! I should have looked at the original publishing date. Probably at the time it first came out some of this information was new, but there was nothing in this book that hasn't been said in a thousand other places."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy for the New Zealand visitor","review":"I bought this book while in New Zealand and it was very handy for identifying some of the trees and ferns that we saw. It has the traditional (Maori) name, the common English name, and the scientific (\\"Latin\\") name for each tree. This is very useful because sometimes the signs in New Zealand list the Maori name and sometimes the English name.There are nice drawings of the leaves, flowers, and fruit for each tree, so it helps in identifying them at any time of the year. It is a pocket-sized book and was perfectly easy to carry and handy to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I bought a SDS Max impact hammer/drill, but there were quite a lot of SDS attachment that were nor available in the SDS Max size, this adapter solved my problem, so now I have quite a lot of choises when it comes to attachments, this is quite a high quiality product and is definitely value for money."},{"rating":"1","title":"3508MT 24-Inch x 32-Inch x 1-3/16-Inch Router Table Top","review":"The table top was recieved with a separation in the core MDF(?) material which is the main \\"strength material\\" between the top and bottom Laminate. The separation or crack was plainly visible in the area routed out for the router base plate. I saw the flaw instantly when I opened the package. How could Tommy R. (the inspected by person) have missed this? Anyway after getting over my initial disgust and not wanting the return hassel, I glued and clamped the flaw myself.Also the product I ordered did not have a miter gauge track embedding in the top. The one I received has one. I really wanted the one I ordered without the miter gauge track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"Precisely what we do not have is a real understanding of Sudan. We get a brief history; we get a sense that Petterson's diplomatic endeavours were futile; and we get information about the civil war which is available elsewhere. The fact is, Petterson did not have enough to write a book and should have spared us. If all the good elements were compressed, they would make a chapter in a real book. And the information on terrorism does not add anything new, if you are familiar with al-Qaeda. That was a ploy to encourage people post 11/September to buy it. I read it through, and was not rewarded by understanding Sudan. I will search elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book About the Sudan Conflict from a Diplomat's Point of View","review":"Donald Petterson was a diplomat for the United States during most of the 1990's. He discusses from a diplomat's point of view the impasse that occured between the United States and the Khartoum governments. Petterson saw things get worse but could not stop the drift in differences. He explains that Sudanese people are quite friendly, but political, religious and regional problems run deep and occured during British rule also. A good book to get a perspective on Sudan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and evocative","review":"No jazz pianist phrases better than Don Shirley. He combines power, range and subtlty. The Don Shirley Trio LP album that was issued in the mid-60s is a tour de force, and several of those cuts are featured on this CD. Why his music hasn't received more attention from jazz critics and anthologists is a mystery. I am grateful, after years of combing record stores and searching the net, that at least some of his music has been issued on CD. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"unique yet universal","review":"What strikes me as interesting is the universal chord Don Shirley's music has struck among his fans. Once you've heard him, there's no going back and there's no one like him. I was introduced to his music in the mid-60s, bought most of the \\"black(Cadence)\\" albums, memorized them. Then lost use of the player. A friend painstakingly taped all of them for me, then he discovered the \\"Golden Classics\\" CD which I bought for myself, another friend who'd met Shirley, and my father. I was priviliged to hear Shirley and the Trio in person in the mid-70s; my second best birthday gift. The thought that more CDs could be released is sheer heaven. I don't use this term lightly, but Don Shirley is as close to genius as it comes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don Shirley, \\"Instrumentalist Extraordinare\\"","review":"This CD has 18 cuts from Don Shirley & The Don Shirley Trio on it. I wish it had two discs so it could have another 18 cuts. From the first time I ever heard \\"Water Boy\\" in the early 60's I have been hooked, Don (piano and arrangements, Ken Fricker, bass fiddle & drums and Juri Taht, cello, have had me in their corner.If you like piano, pop, jazz or just instrumental aural magic, this CD is a rare treat (like a no-cal cheesecake).

This one is actually quite good -with perhaps 75% of the songs being ones that you would want to listen to again and again.

It is one of my top 10 favorites in world music. I slip this into my cd player and it stays there for weeks! I listen to hardcore music, goth and other world music. I highly recommend this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marcy R.","review":"I pretty much like all the songs on this CD. I would enjoy it more if it had more indian influence vs. the elecrtric/thundering bass sounds...but I am definately not complaining! The songs here stand on their own and are uplifing, goovin' and hypnotic. I listen to it a lot & liked all the songs right away. Maybe some of the songs go on a bit and are repetitious in the beat somewhat, but still it's something I haven't heard before. Most traditional Indian CD's I've heard have songs that are too boring and way too long for me--by the way, if anyone knows any other indian-like-upbeat cd's like this one I'd love to know what they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth getting but could've been much better","review":"Much like Stealth bombers blowing up their strategic civilian targets, these braindead techno beats destroy much classic Arabian tradition here. However about half of this collection is really spectacular and most dance worthy. My favorites are Katmarie, Ya Rayah, Telephone Arab, Sabura, and 1001 Dreams.This is well worth buying, you'll have to skip some tracks on the way but that's to be expected. Thumbs up here."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I guess it depends what you're into, but I was expecting 'real' Arabic music, and was disappointed with the majority of this album. Tracks 1, 5, 7 and 9 contain enough middle eastern flavour to enjoy, but the rest of the tracks are repetitious techno beat music which I imagine could only be appreciated on a dance floor while whacked out on ecstasy (not that there's anything wrong with that). The two stars are for Fifth Sun (track 1) and Acid Queen (track 9)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Traveler Fan Review","review":"Yawn!!!!!!!!!!!!

I think they need to call this CD something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"Clinton Kyle may be one the best unknown country singers and songwriters around. His writing style is versatile, from cry in your pillow ballads, to honky tonk hoe-downs, and everything in between. He sings with a genuine country feel, minus the phony vocal bends. This album is well produced, nicely mixed with solid Nashville style musicianship. Why he hasn't made it big time is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of missing pages from Ch.2 of the book","review":"Please check to see that you got all the chapters you paid for.

Starting from the very beginning, it develops the operator formalism with the Dirac equation, moves onto perturbation theory, then onto functional methods - and then to asymptotic methods. It's truly comprehensive.However, it's strongest selling point is the fact that it actually works out examples in incredible detail - where else do you find a complete computation of a two loop vacuum polarization amplitude? This is the ideal book for someone who actually wants to learn how to do calculations in field theory.It has two shortcomings - it was written in the 80's so it isn't very modern and it has no problems. But those pale in light of its advantages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors.","review":"This book is comprehensive, BUT ...There are 10 errata pages in the front with 121 entries, mostly in formulas.

It may not be appropriate for newbies to Tarot. It addresses the author's \\"intuitive\\" approach to reading the cards, but on page one, the author clearly states, \\"There are three ways to learn the Tarot...(1) tradition meanings of the cards, (2) the intuitive approach, and (3) underlying structures and patterns.\\" The author goes on to say there are plenty of books to teach the first way so there's no point in repeating that in this book.Well, I'm new to Tarot and I expect to find traditional meanings explained, in addition to whatever other approach the author could relate. I was disappointed not being able to find basic card interpretations. Now I have to find another book that teaches those.Of course, if you're an advanced Tarot reader and already are very familiar with basic card interpretations, maybe this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"wendav","review":"Directions are hard to follow due to picture diagrams not being very detailed. 3/8 holes were in short rails as indicated by directions and this attached top of table to legs with four screws.

It's impossible to draw even the most rudimentary objects on the pad. The graphics are pixilated and outdated at the very least. And as far as I'm concerned, the word choices are poor, too. C'mon, one of the words to draw on easy mode was \\"Double.\\" That's an abstract concept at best.

You can't even draw a stick figure successfully in the time allowed. If you have fun watching others drawing this poorly save your money and take turn drawing with your eyes closed.The way this works - you use move the pen around on the pad to move the cursor. you push down with the pen to draw.

I found this book to be very difficult to get through because it was entirely too basic. If anyone is serious about doing computer programming, the authors should at least assume the reader knows and understands something - this book's audience appeared to be for middle school readers, not people aspiring to be computer programmers. Beginning Visual Web Programming in VB.NET {from Novice to Professional} is far superior and doesn't leave me feeling like a fourth grader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some basics with lots of Visual Studio.net!","review":"If your looking for book that will start to make sense of the new .net technology, this book is the one to start with.It's a beginners level book that teaches both vb.net basics and the Visual Studio environment you'll be using to make your applications. Existing VB6 programmers will find this an easy read (100+ pages in a couple hours).Lessons are short, clear and goal orientated. There are numerous sceenshots to help guide the way and great charts in the places where you'll need them. Notes and tips are placed throughout the book and add real value to it. Differences between VB6 and VB.net are pointed out.I'd purchase other books in this series based on my experience with this book. It gives you the solid understanding of the basics you'll need when you go into more advanced programmming levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginners Start here","review":"This book is an excellent starting point for anyone who has never programmed with VB or is returning to it after a long absence (like me). It does not delve into object orient programming or drill down on ADO.Net. I does provide a lot of simple exercises that can be built on. After completing this book I highly recommend Coding Techniques for Microsoft Visual Basic .Net by John Connell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I'm a VB 6.0 programmer who was looking to move up to the .Net environment. This book is quite well done. There have been a number of reviews stating that it's not a great .Net resource. As is always the case--it's just not possible to please everybody. Obviously, a book that's entitled \\"Step by Step\\" isn't intended to be a guru guide to VB.Net. Anyone who thinks that you can learn all there is to know about VB.Net in a mere 600 pages should try writing a book. This self-help guide does a great job of touching on a lot of topics, and explains things well enough to give a decent and creative programmer everything s/he needs to produce powerful applications. I would suggest to take your time, and exercise a little patience to complete the book from start to finish--understanding shouldn't be rushed. Congratulations to Michael Halvorson on a job well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits the mark!","review":"Excellent book, albeit at an introductory level, to Visual Basic and the .NET programming environment.

All in all a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough .Net framework","review":"This book basically introduces you the the basic building blocks of VB.Net. One of the good things about the book is at the beginning of each chapter it tells you what changed between vb6 and .net. The book is way too basic, especially the first couple of chapters. And the examples are way too watered down. You won't have the knowledge to build anything beyond simple apps. Also the book barely discuses the .Net framework, so I don't much about how it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon Customer","review":"This book is listed first when you search for it, but it is an old issue and out of print.

Amazon should eliminate this problem by notifying customers that a later edition of a particular book exists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preposterous","review":"This movie must have taken place in a parallel universe where the laws of physics don't apply, because much of it was ludicrous. I know it's an action movie, and I can suspend disbelief as much as the next person, but some scenes were just insulting. Some examples: the way he removed the bomb underneath the car, using a jet-ski to catch a school bus, driving while straddling two building roofs, dodging many bullets, and the final showdown are just a few. But that isn't it - the movie also sports the most incompetent/stupid henchmen ever, with the cops (US Marshalls) a close second.I liked the first 5-10 minutes, and the \\"Lola\\" character was something different, though she could have been utilized a little more. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transporter 2...buy it","review":"I own the original as well as the sequel and if they ever make a Transporter 3 I will buy it. The fight scenes in this movie rock. The story is just ok, but who buys this kind of movie for the story anyway? The driving is cool, but where the star of these movies shines is in the fight scenes. Very well choregraphed, with things I have not seen in other movies ( and I have seen a LOT of martial art movies ).

This movie actually goes downhill from this point on. It had some pretty good fight scenes, but Statham takes liek 20 minutes to disbatch like 10 guys. He's obviously not very fast, but they he could have taken care of the baddies quicker. And I'm not talking about anything but the action, it would be way too hard to recall the story, I;m already starting o feel sick this of this stupid ass movie again.

However, if you enjoy supermodels in stilletos and lingerie packing some serious fire power....this movie's gold.This is an action flick and is fun to watch. 'The Transporter' is really only a chaeffeur with some quick witted MacGyver moves in this particular movie. However, there are definately plenty of high energy driving scenes (he is a very good driver). Amber Valletta was good in this movie as was Jason Statham. However, Lola was by far my favorite character in the entire movie.In conclusion, it is what it is....and that is an action film in its most realistic looking unrealistic form."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Transporter Needs a Better 'Vehicle'","review":"The previews for Transporter 2 looked so great, I couldn't wait to see it. However, it was such a huge disappointment because of the shoddy special effects and lame fight sequences. For example, there is a scene of a deranged model with smeared mascara, skimpy lingerie, and stillettos in a gunfight with the main character. He protects himself from the bullets by using a standard woooden door as a shield. Then in the next scene, she shoots ONE SHOT at a helicopter from at least fifty yards. THE CHOPPER DISAPPEARS IN ONE PUFF - LITERALLY A PUFF - NO SMOKE OR DEBRIS. Then there is a scene where she swings at him on a curtain, leg extended with pointy heel aimed at him. The swing takes so much time, but he just stands there.Jason Statham is so gorgeous, manly, and a great martial artist, but the story was weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRANSPORTER 2","review":"The movie itself was good, it was the quality of the DVD, it was verynoisy, I couldn't hear very well what they were saying.

You know, over the top action with impossible events and the ability to evade bullets along with bullet-proof doors and cars - when you need them most.If you have seen any of these films, then you will know that they keep trying to push this Statham guy on us even if we do not like him. I just hate stereotypical character like this guy. Not clean shaven,low voice, cocky and like Steven Segal - invincible!The Europeans clearly think that we want over the top, crazy action with impossible escapes and fight scenes. Of coruse, these action guys are so brave that they will do anything to get their target. This film is only good to watch to say that you saw it.

Little does he realize what is really involved.Last the first movie, this one is loaded with action. The plot is improved upon in my opinion but the acting isn't.

That said, star Jason Statham as Frank Martin has lost none of his charismatic appeal from the first film. He still amazes with his physicality in the action sequences. It should be noted that the director of the original film, Cory Yuen, choreographed these scenes. Terrific vehicular scenes most notably one where Frank pursues a bus with a speedboat and another where he dislodges a bomb from the bottom of his car with a crane. Popcorn entertainment at it's best.

But there wasn't enough plot to keep me really interested, and the movie couldn't decide if it was James Bond pushing the technical envelope, or a Kung Fu movie where the moves are a bit magical (and less than plausible).The acting was bland and the directing poor. It felt like an number of scenes were shot and chopped together to make a film. It is never really made clear why the evil one's patrons want all those people dead, and how the virus would really work.Using well worn cliche characters didn't help either: a beautiful tough woman wielding heavy weapons with not a soft spot in her heart or the tall, dark, handsome evil assasin.An OK diversion, but not good cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big dumb fun","review":"70s car chases in an 80s movie shot with a 21st century look.

The required hot girl of the movie isn't very sexy at all. The music is cool and Jason Statham is also. Like the first movie, The Transporter there is a lot of fighting. I think there is more action in this one. There are some laughs and comical characters.

What I really want to know is what was up with that woman running around in her underwear shooting up everything?! That was totally ridiculous! Then I found myself actually laughing during most of the action scenes because they were so stupid, especially the one where he was chasing a plane in his car.

You get what you pay for. No problem with router but the table is VERY sub-standard. The fence adjustment is LOUSY. One wing nut holds each sliding fence and is almost impossible to get it square to the working surface due to the slop in the design. Too much wasted time is spent both aligning the fences to the table and to each other. The lightweight construction (cheap) allows the table to move around quite a bit when running material thru...be sure to clamp/bolt it down before use. The miter slot is rough and the slide is sticky. The only minor positive is the dust chute works adequately when connected to the shop vac.In hindsight, I should have bought the router alone and looked elsewhere for a quality built piece of equipment. Now I'm forced to use it until I can build one that is suitable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Porter Cable Drops The Ball","review":"I am usually a big fan of Porter-Cable products, but this one is a dud.

The fence is hard to use, as it uses a simple L-bracket from the fence to the table with a twist-screw to tighten down - often changing the position as the screw is tightened.

Second, the darn thing only has two inserts. One with a small opening and the other with a huge opening. I think everyone that reads this should call PC and complain about that. How much trouble could it be to provide another insert with this table.

Being a weird sized plate means I'm now going to have to re-build the top of my router table to accept a better quality router plate. Spend the extra cash and get an aluminum plate with quality snap in rings. Also Rousseau's customer service is a nightmare. This has a lifetime warrantee so I called to get get a free replacement after I broke it. 3 months and numerous phone calls later I FINALLY got a new one from them ... with the same stupid problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"tablesaw router table","review":"I used the plate to add a router table to my table saw (ridgid 3650). The plate was very easy to install (w/o the template kit). It does require clamping a couple of shop made \\"L\\"s to the router table for the plate placement, which would be somewhat time consuming. I just clamped boards to the table and routed away with no problem. I would recommend the template for easier installation. The plate does not sag at all with my router installed, the installation kit ensures the plates does not move at all. Very good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"I have just made my router table and so far so good.

When I received the replacement fan, I installed it without any issues.The fan worked and moved a good amount of air, but the plastic blades were unbalanced causing a booming noise in the cabin when turned on. I took the blade off and noticed the blade itself was not true and wobbled a bit when spun. I reinstalled the fan and used it for a few more weeks when the motor suddenly stopped working without any warning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thriller and Horror Readers will Love It","review":"Is a must read book for any thriller, horror lover. If you haven't yet read this book, I totally recommend it!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but not good writing...","review":"OK! I read PSYCHO after I saw the remake & the original movies. I thought this book would be soooo good since I have been hearing it is better than the movie. So when the new printing of PSYCHO by Robert Bloch came out, I bought, read it, and was very dissapointed. This is a great idea for a novel, but Robert Bloch just doesn't write well in my opinion. I think this book was written in 1959, so maybe that is the reason for the poor writing. I am a HUGE fan of King and Koontz and I thought Bloch would be just as good, but to me if you haven't seen the movie at some parts it is kind of hard to understand because Robert Bloch doesn't give enough detail (like at the end)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insanity at its most entertaining!","review":"Inspired by the true crimes of mass murderer Ed Gein, Robert Block created a horror classic when he gave voice to Norman Bates and his beloved \\"mother\\". He managed to make the Bates character both sympathetic and sinister....the Hitchcock movie is an A plus, but lets not forget where the screenplay came from and give Bloch his due. This is a great, great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Classic !","review":"As the author of,The Gorge, this book had a HUGE influence on me as a kid. It was one the stories that began my fascination with all things horror. Psycho is truely an American classic and still holds a special place in my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloch's big one.","review":"This is the novel that inspired the film. 'Fans' expecting a gruesome bloodbath of a thrill ride will be sorely disappointed, for Psycho is nothing more than a brisk and smartly written fifties pulp mystery novel with a wicked sense of black humor and a pull the rug out from under you twist ending. An ending that still manages to surprise even if you know it going in (or, more than likely, have seen either film version of the novel prior to reading it) because Bloch is such a master at hiding the clues inside the narrative. Regardless of what those 1 and 2 star naysayer grumblers quibble about, Psycho is THE acknowledged high water mark of serial killer stories and a novel no horror/crime fan should overlook or be without. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"PSYCHO! No comparism between the movie and book!","review":"Now we all know Robert Bloch wrote the book a while before Alfred Hitchcock made the famous movie but even so, the book hardly compares to the movie. First of all, like many other reviews stated, it moves lightning fast and it gets really hard to keep up with the plot. Second, the death of Mary (not Marion) Crane is in one sentence (\\"And so was her head\\") in the version I read. I was very dissapointed. I was looking for a long, detailed, and bloody end to Mary that was in some part \\"similar\\" to the death in the movie. Unfortunatly, that's not what it was. Robert Bloch's \\"Psycho\\" is no match for the excitment of the movie Alfred Hitchcock created, is definitly not one of the best books i've ever read, and, plus, it is very different from the very different from the movie, so you might be dissapointed Nevertheless, though, if you want a fast-paced thriller with lots of action, Robert Bloch's \\"Psycho\\" is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic chiller","review":"It's true, what Hitch said: everything in the movie is already here, in Bloch's novel. There are no surprises to find out reading the book. But it is effective by itself, and through his barroque prose, Bloch builds an ominous mood, unescapable.So what are you waiting for? Buy it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Chiller","review":"I read this book twice. If you've seen the movie, it's very close to it. It's a relatively thin book. Even if it weren't it'd be a fast read. If you haven't seen the movie or had the privilege to find a copy of this, the book is claimed to be about the real-life serial killer Edward Gein from Wisconsin, but there are no similarities other than Mr. Gein had a little hang-up with his mother. The book is about Norman Bates, owner of the Bates Motel - a lonely place off the highway. Norman keeps his mother in her room in the house on the grounds, and Mother doesn't like Norman feeling any attraction toward women, so she does away with them. When Mother kills one young woman, people come looking for her and find out what Mom has done and the secrets Norman has managed to hide for many years. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most famous horror novel that no one has read.","review":"We're all familiar with the Hitchcock classic film that stars Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh, but how many of us have actually read the Robert Bloch pulp fiction?I went to see the movie \\"Hitchcock\\" last fall. It's loosely based on Stephen Rebello's \\"Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho.\\" It was a fun movie that got me curious enough to want to read both the Bloch and the Rebello books.Bloch created such a sympathetic villain in Norman Bates. The book surprised me. Even though I knew what lied ahead, I still found the book gripping and thoroughly entertaining.There are a few differences between what Bloch wrote and what Hitchcock envisioned. Hitchcock could never have produced Psycho as written. And that is what makes reading the book worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!!","review":"The book is just as good as Hitchcock 's movie. I was on edge and loved the story and Bloch's writing style."},{"rating":"2","title":"My god, my god.","review":"I just can't believe it.

King, his main influence. Blue enjoyed a somewhat succesful career, with just one hit, but it got him on the charts, and hsi records always have sold very well.Blue has a gutsy voice, a very appealing baritone, that sounds truthful and powerful. One of his more famous tunes is Shopping Instead Blues, however this whole disc is great, maybe just one dud, but otherwise all the tunes are gems, and Little Joe Blue can uplift even the most mundane arrangement. These 60's urban blues sides, are powerful and timeless, and a lot of fun. An overall great straight blues vocal cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure!","review":"I am so glad this book is back in print! Can you imagine how valuable a Bible commentary written by early Christians themselves would be? Well, this comes very close! St. Thomas Aquinas himself compiled this opus from sermons and commentaries on the Gospels written by the early Church Fathers. He arranged their thoughts in such a way that they form a continuous commentary on each Gospel, verse-by-verse. How I wish Aquinas had done this with the rest of Sacred Scripture as well! It's pricey, but well worth it for the serious Bible scholar."},{"rating":"1","title":"B.C. Hunt-needs help","review":"The video does a decent job capturing the spectacular scenery of B.C. It also does a very good job covering the goat and sheep hunt and explains what constitutes a trophy sheep. However, it does a poor job covering the moose hunt. Too much time is spent on packing the moose back to camp. The real turn-off is the corny music (sheep hunting song) that plays during a large part of the tape. It ruins the hunting mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skin Game","review":"I had been searching for this movie for my husband; he has since passed on, but I now have the movie.

The narator of the Program Ian Wright is very funny so he adds some real fun to your tour of the city. The program also takes you to a WWII concentration camp outside of vienna so you get more then just the city.

The places visited were important but the narration was difficult to understand and the flippant attitude of the narrator was very undignified. A video that to me reflects the social culture of lack of civility. Possibly respect for Mozart's piano would be in order not the narrators attempt at humor or silliness. Respect for the graves of the famous in the cemetery, not an Elvis impression. Very disappointed. The whole video is more about the narrator than about Vienna.

However, post-graduation as an engineer, I find that the method is neither well known nor happily accepted by engineers outside of academia.

As a mechanical engineer, I find that simpler statistical techniques, even if they include broad assumptions, are much more widely accepted. If you are an engineer, leave this up to the statisticians.

This vocalist even tries to sound like Weiland. In any case, don't buy this over-rated and unoriginal garbage. For all you teeny-boppers out there who just got into this style of music, check out the old stuff like STP, Alice n Chains, and Nirvana. By the way, if you're looking for a true alternative/metal sound and if your ears are worthy enough, check out TOOL's Aenima album, easily the best album of the 90's and light years ahead of this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isnt good music.","review":"This album and band arent very original.

The only bad thing about the CD is how incredibly repetitive it is. Some of the songs sound exactly the same. However, the cd does have some great songs such as Bad Religion, Voodo, Moon Baby, and Whatever. I would reccomend it to any fans of TooL, Alice In Chains, Metallica, and Coal Chamber.

I asked a young employee of mine what he considered this music to be. He said \\"It's industrial metal\\". I said I disagree, It is modern rock.

Every song sounds pretty much the same: grungy riff, gratuitous movie clip, and crummy lyrics. The songs are loud, but not exciting like RATM or metallica. The lead singer has no emotion behind his words. I have a feeling that after these guys have gotten your money they will never be heard of again.

I can't belive that anyone who's ever heard of Alice in Chains could ever take these dumbasses seriously. I have to sit through them at Ozzfest, so I'm not looking forward to that. How could anyone impersonate someone elses vocal style (Layne Staley) and then have the balls to acctually name your band after his song!!!

The answer should be, that they fall flat on their face and get laughed out of the music world.

I was a moderate Alice in Chains fan, but for a band to come along and totally rip them off..and put out songs that wouldn't even be considered for an Alice in Chains b-side...it is just an outrage. Thanks to the few corporations that run all of the rock stations in the country, they have decided to force feed people this regurgitation of Alice in Chains, and unfortunately, people aren't willing to spit it back in their face.

Unfortunately, upon second listen, the album still doesn't impress me. I can't really explain why, but the rhythm ought to be condensed and faster.

I was not aware that people as stupid as you all existed. Godsmack sounds nothing like TOOL, and they will never sound anything like TOOL. TOOL is one of the premier and elite bands in the history of rock. Godsmack is weak, frat-boy processed meat, that grovels at the feet of bands like TOOL. Godsmack completely lacks originality and depth, and is just another piece of the puke commercialism that is decaying musical standards in this country. So in the future, please refrain from using TOOL'S name in the same sentence as Godsmack.

Godsmack started out as an AIC cover band, that stated, you can all stop acting like you're too cool for Godsmack because you're stuck dry-humping Nirvana and STP's leg. The album is catchy, well written, and sounds blue-collar. The album was produced with very little money but came out sounding as good as any high budget recording session. The songs are very pacing, melodic, heavy, and apathetic. It's a great CD and if you're mad at someone or feel alienated, the lyrics could be quite soothing to you. Don't put down other music just to seem like you are just too cool to lower yourself to listen to this.

Heavy Metal riffs meets Hardcore crunch and attitude. However, few bands have been so successful as of late in putting together a entire album of the genre that remains as catchy throughout (someone say Sevendust?). Several reviewers have commented on the lack of originality of the lyrics. Perhaps, but other that Zach or Rollins, how many true lyrical poets have there been in this genre over the last 10 or so years.

After the first burn they work fine but any subsequent burn they are tempermental at best and often do not work at all. Although I can quick-erase (or do a longer erase) and then burn a compilation, the data verification fails most of the time. Ignoring that, and trying to use the CD anyway, results in inconsistent, but generally bad results. For instance, my DVD player (which has had no problems with other media) can kind of run these disks but other CD drives cannot.All in all a major disappointment.

They are expensive one-time use disks and certainly the most useless media I've used since I started disk burning back in 1999.Their quality would not be acceptable even if they were cheap (and they are expensive). They are honestly not worth bothering with if free because they are frustrating. I have some old Memorex 4x disks I've been using for a while and they have given no problem, but these are junky junk and among the worst products I've used in my entire consumer life, including crossing the boundaries into cars, mp3 players, etc. They simply do not work and the money is thrown in the garbage to equal benefit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Junk","review":"These discs were not recognized at all in my CD-RW drive.

For example, he mentions being \\"immunized\\" with your partner's white blood cells as a possible treatment for a specific immune problem, even though studies have shown that this treatment doesn't decrease the rate of miscarriage. If you buy this book, buy it to be read the personal stories of women who have overcome recurrent pregnancy loss, but don't rely on any of the medical information without first consulting a more up to date book, like \\"Miscarriage: What Every Woman Needs to Know\\" by Lesley Regan which was published in 2001.

I was quickly drawn into a receptive, altered state in which I began to \\"feel\\" the music. I then began to see in my mind's eye all sorts of magical and wondrous things (electric blue dolphins synchronized swimming, a UFO I was on board, and other things too difficult to put into words but equally amazing). Everytime I listen to it, I have a different experience, and while I already have some capability to have visions on my own, they are distinctly different and are very much stepped up with this CD.

She dies a week later, not without leaving a message that 'she would have reciprocated one's affection', that of a solid American, who 'had an old attachment for the little metropolis of Calvinism'.

It's not oversized and bulky like the Champion, yet it's still very useful and versitile. This particular model is even better than the one I had because it comes with the tiny eyeglass screwdriver (an absolutely wonderful accessory for anyone who wears glasses) and a little ballpoint pen. Granted, the pen isn't fit for lots of writing, but it will do in a pinch, and that's really the point of it anyway.

I particularly like the in line Phillips driver, and the magnifying glass. Also, I highly recommend the \\"Plus\\" scales over the regular Explorer model (which adds a straight pin, a very useful ball point pen, and a mini eye glass screwdriver to the usual tweezers, and toothpick.

The book was apparently somewhat controversial because this, of course, contradicts the standard view that the Panthers began as a worthy endeavor but was tragically destroyed by increasing criminal activity and mismanagement and illegal government meddling.Despite some awkward prose, this is an excellent look at the turn from non-violence to violence in the Black Community in the mid-60's.GRADE: B"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book!","review":"A great in-dept analysis on the rise and fall of the Panther Party and how Heuy Newton was responsible for both.

Even so, this book made me doubt the Kindle.In truth, it was not the fault of the Kindle, it had to do with whoever (or whatever) compiled this into the Kindle format. There are so many words run together that you have to slow down to decipher the individual words. Take a look at the sample (I should have). Words crammed together like MacCallisterwhen\\", \\"daybusiness\\", \\"constantlyon\\" \\"MacCallisterwas\\", and \\"settledby\\" can be found in the first four paragraphs of the PROLOGUE. It doesn't get better as the book progresses and you will also find words split like \\"often = of ten\\". I finally gave up and called Johnstone's offices to see if a better copy was available. They sympathized with the problem and let me know this format did not come from them and there was nothing they could do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood of Eagles","review":"Blood of EaglesWord spacing is terrible.

While Ms. Wanless doesn't endorse the brand, which uses a suspension system rather than a regular saddle tree, her explanations of equine biomechanics and description of the system spurred me to investigate it further on my own. I was pleased with what I learned and ended up purchasing one. I can't tell you how good I feel, knowing that I am probably not damaging my horse's back. My horse's movement also has improved as a result. In short, if you are a caring and thoughtful rider who is willing to sit down for a serious read, this book is for you. In fact, the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the book can be tough going at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every horse owner should read this book!","review":"This is an enlightening and beautifully written book which Mary Wanless did an amazing amount of research to produce. I found the chapter on saddle fitting especially interesting. In response to the \\"quackery\\" reviewer, the author by no means suggests that the reader should adopt every new treatment, therapy, or device for the horse. She presents a large number of options without making many recommendations at all--it is informative, but not a sales pitch. I don't find advice not to use cheap saddlery or untrained dental technicians suggestions that I leap on the newest bandwagon--it's common sense. Some of the chapters can leave well-meaning horsepeople feeling that we are not doing as well as we could by our horses...but we probably felt a little bit that way before, or we wouldn't have read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"bunch of quackery","review":"very disappointing book. From the title, I expected something along the lines of how to adjust your horse's environment and work to get a happier, more natural result. Instead, the book more or less claims that every horse is in horrible, terrible human-produced pain, and that the only way to get rid of this pain is to suscribe to every quack remedy that comes along."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned the book","review":"I can't believe this- I bought the book too and the CD didn't have the Demo version.

We have all seen 'ladies of the evening' and with a certain sadness we see them as victuums 'doing what they have to do.' This book discusses instead the white slavery market that has developed with the collapse of the Soviet Union. I can't think of any better way to describe the situation than the blurb on the back cover: \\"You can buy a woman for $10,000 and you can make your money back in a week if she is pretty and she is yound. Then everything else is profit.\\"The book is written by a multiple award winning Canadian investigative journalist. He reports on numerous incidents, numerous interviews with the people involved. This includes the women themselves, the organizers, the police, and various international relief agencies that are addressing the problem.For those of us who are parents of daughters this is a most disturbing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first to expose this major human rights issue","review":"The sex trade is a multi-billion-dollar, global industry, so it's strange to think there's been no comprehensive expose book until now. Victor Malarek's The Natashas: Inside The New Global Sex Trade is the first to expose this major human rights issue, and comes backed by the authority and expertise of one of Canada's leading investigative journalists. After drugs and weapons, women and girls sold for sex is the third most profitable commodity in the world. The problem isn't limited to a specific region: Malarek gathers the stories of women from all walks of life as he reveals the experiences of women kidnapped into the sex slave trade in an eye-opening shocker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Received the wrong merchandise","review":"I ordered a product for an iRiver Clix and I received a product that fits a Samsung Cellphone.

In a country whose poetic voice was governed by the genius of Yeats for so long, Kavanagh comes along as a genuine alternative; of the common man, or the country village and the pub and the field. Kavanagh is no mere realist though; his poems are sometimes mythic and beautiful as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irish to the core","review":"Pat Kavanagh's work shouts 'Irish\\" in every line.

Each compartment is labeled and I know that the exact item that I am looking for is in the \\"screw\\" bucket. It has eliminated the boxes of stuff from piling up on the workbench.Better yet, when I go off to a craft show, I just take the bucket with me, and I know I have everything in hand that I could possibly need. Plus, when the supply of a compartment gets low, I know it is time to fill it up, rather than hunt through the various boxes on the work bench hoping that I have more.I do have to watch the amount of hardware I put in the containers. Too much weight tends to make them a little \\"too flexible\\" and difficult to handle.A great \\"investment\\" and time saver for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what the box says it is","review":"I had this movie given to me, and have to admit, I am glad that I did not pay money for it.The back of the box makes it seem like some kind of sex triangle, with 2 women trying to seduce her. But the reality in this movie is far from that.In reality, the main subject is the victim of a vicious and sadistic rape by the two other characters. There was absolutely nothing in this that I found interesting at all.Even movies like Silence Of The Lambs and Wild Things (which the box tries to compare this movie to) were riveting, because of the unexpected turns and suspense.But Jaded has none of this. It concentrates on the rapeists and the sick relationship with the boyfriend of one of them. And the persuit of a videotape that may prove the victims story is true.While it does show that same sex rape is possible, it is not a movie worth watching.If at all possible, pass this movie up at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"Apparently, things like pacing, character development, suspense, and logic are no longer required."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Aftermath of Rape","review":"A strange movie about a particularly horrific rape, JADED unnecessarily plays up the male-oriented eroticism associated to rape and voyeurism as the woman's victimization is show progressively over a series of disjointed flashbacks. Interestingly enough, the rapist(s) and victim are both female, also feeding into another series of male fantasies. The conclusion is rather forced and, sadly, unclear ... leaving the viewer wondering about the true consequences against those who perpetrated the deed. Certain scenes, particularly of the rape sequence, are not for the light-hearted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty well put together story.","review":"Considering the storyline evolving around a woman seeking justice on two other women for sexually assaulting her, I'm going to say this film was well put together.

As \\"Hamlet\\" described in his/her review, it \\" is loosely based on one of the greatest novels of all time, Le Comte De Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas, and given a contemporary spin\\". For every woman who was raised to oppress her shadow side, this drama gives liberty to embody the potential, and hauntingly graceful, mad avenger in each of us. The only disappointment is that the producers hesitate to produce more and faster. It's a travesty to pause in the first season of a new venture that is on the cutting edge........10 episodes do not equal a season.

I was 18 years old. I ate psychedelics. I sat through it three times. I didn't want to go home! It set me off on a lifetime of film enjoyment. I've seen it countless times since. Although a little dated today, it always has something for me to re-find. Young filmmakers should see it for it's no-holds-barred attitude. It reveals how film can be used to reflect the times you live in. Brewster and McCabe & Mrs. Miller are my favorite Altman films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wacky, inventive, if scattershot early Altman","review":"Completely off the wall, absurdist story of young man who wants to fly, and the women in his life, wrapped into a murder mystery.It's almost Monty Python-like at times in it's bizarre surreal humor. There are some great moments and scenes, even if it doesn't add up to a lot, and some of the humor is repetitive or juvenile (endless bird-poop jokes), and there are lots of unanswered questions and holes. Still, in it's weirdness one could argue it's more cohesive and truly, deeply subversive than MASH."},{"rating":"2","title":"When is this coming out on DVD","review":"I saw this movie after it was released on a double bill with Catch 22 in a small art house movie theater in New York's Greenwich Village near NYU. It is one of those movies that is over the top and over the edge and could have only been made with the alienated and questioning sensibility of the times. This is one movie I would own on DVD if it ever came out on DVD. Robert Altman knew how to make a movie and this was one of the greats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert Altman at his weirdest","review":"This film is evocative of the quirky, madcap Robert Altman at his best and worst. We got it because we have a Bud Cort fan in the family, and just to see him makes it worth it. But the story is strange, resolution less than satisfying. If you're really a big Altman or Cort fan, then you must see it. Just be aware that THIS IS NOT A WESTERN! (I had it confused with John Wayne's \\"Rooster Cogburn\\" and the Dennis Weaver's \\"McCloud\\" and kept waiting for it to start, thinking I was seeing more previews.) The storyline combines an oddball who lives in unauthorized apartment in the basement of the Astrodome who is trying to fly, with a murder mystery and detective story. This is one of Shelly Duvall's early roles -- don't miss her upside-down false eyelashes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"satire works most of the time","review":"Introverted man builds a self-powered flying machine and is protected from harm by supernatural beings.

Revealing any of the story would be useless because the film is so utterly absurd it wouldn't make sense. The comedy ranges from bird poop on dead bodies to a supporting character who's a direct spoof of Steve McQueen's 'Bullitt.' Weird, silly, oddly sexual, and hilarious. Not for all tastes, but worth a look if you're up for something very, very different. A DVD release would be terrific, especially if Altman gave a commentary.*** out of ****"},{"rating":"2","title":"ring","review":"I am stationed in Germany and am surprised as to how quick this ring was shipped to me.

But one should always remember that beauty in any philosophical text comes not from the words itself, but from the ordering and structure of the words and ideas (Descartes himself emphasised a similar point).True, Heffernan is committing comercial suicide by adhering so closely to the original text in order to produce a literal translation, but this translation is exactly what a serious student of Cartesian thought needs.

Keeps jacks from wearing out.","review":"I use several different headphones, and plugging them in jacks over a period of time is bad. You'll break the pc input, the headphones themselves, or maybe even the wires.This reduces that with a press of a button.Perfect for workstations, or other situations where you'll be changing inputs throughout the day.Another interesting note is that you can double these up on each other. Stacking one media hub into the other and you get multiple buttons for different variations of inputs and sources. Not something everyone would need.

I also like that this unit provides a volume control."},{"rating":"2","title":"does the job","review":"I use this to switch between some desktop speakers and headphones. The headphones are 5.1 so I'm only switching between the speakers and my headphone's front channel. The headphones use 3 3.5mm jacks which plug into the back of my PC.

Anne Marston is a fantastic author and will most definitly become a fantasy legend. I love how in Kingmaker's Sword she dosen't make the women all meek and docile, they are just as strong characters as the men, sometimes better. Not that the men aren't great, all the charcters are. Marston really has a good, unique style that lets you get to really know the characters, feel their emotions, think what their thinking. That helps mix the suprise and that,\\"Oh! Now that you point it out, I knew that was going to happen\\" detials, she made me laugh in one paragraph and bite my nails in frusteration the next. It was absolutly a great book about very heroic people who didn't know they were, trying to save a land from destruction, while at the same time dealing with everyday emotions, saddness, confusion, frusteration, joy. Just an average day. But NOT an average book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"There are a lot of things good about this book including interesting characters and an okay plot even if it is a little formulaic (noble born child kidnapped into slavery so he doesn't know who he is). Ms. Marston does have skill as a writer, particularly in description. However, this book is BADLY in need of an editor. Redundancy, sometimes in back to back sentences was particularly annoying. The characters lapse in and out of their accents more than Kevin Costner did in his infamous \\"Robin Hood.\\" There are pages and pages of build up but then the climatic scenes are over in a few paragraphs. Nothing a good rewrite wouldn't fix. Perhaps the publisher had a deadline. At any rate, I'm not going to take a chance on the rest of the trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kingmaker's Sword","review":"I hope you will excuse me for my English, I don't speak it very well (nor write it!). My suggestion is: don't buy this book!It is not worth the expense. I think this is almost the worst fantasy book I've ever read (and the following ones are just the same). It is boring, the characters are really poorly developed, but above all, if you go through the whole series, you'll realize they are ALWAYS THE SAME! The men are always big and strong, the women brave and with a saucy tongue... I cannot distinguish them one from the other. So if you like soft readings and replicants, this is the item for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant but not great and a little cliched","review":"This book is sort of the paperback version of the hit TV show \\"The Highlander\\" in that the main characters are sword swinging celts saying \\"Aye, wee lassie\\" and \\"I dinna know.\\" The book is narrated in first person, and perhaps that accounts for why most of the characters are so flat. There isn't much world building and description either. The one female character fights, of course, all the time with the man, of course, whom she will marry. Along the way she threatens to \\"box his ears\\" and her \\"lips drew a thin line,\\" and all the other cliches of characterization. The book is not bad but don't expect something along the lines of McFarland or Jordan.

This is quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever read. It was just dull. It was uninteresting, cliched and it just never picked up. It never became REAL for me. It was just a book with paper pages - far from the new, intriguing world that beckons me to enter when I read Fantasy.I felt as though I was reading a book that took a bunch of great ideas from other popular Fantasy books and recycled them into one. I have no problem with that, if something interesting is the result. This was not the case with _Kingmaker's Sword_.

I thought the name sounded pretty catchy and was interested to check it out.When I finally got around to reading it, I found out that it was basically some guy telling stories about his growing up and going to Marshall to play football. He wasn't even a very good football player and the book got it's title from a conversation with one of his coaches after they crossed paths years after he graduated form Marshall. He tells so many boring stories about him and his friends growing up together.

Covering the time mostly between 900 B.C. and 1200 A.D., the themes these ancient poets deal with are the same most of us contemplate driving to work in the morning (if we turn off the radio), or lie with as we drift to sleep at night.I found the poetry a little slow at first, but it gets more and more interesting the further one reads. I recommend it for the middle aged or older reader, or for anyone else who has time and inclination to seek the examined life. Food, romance, long-distance marriages and friendships, gender discrimination, the joys and frustrations of military service, the joys and frustrations of bureaucracy, fidelity, infidelity, births, and deaths, humor, sorrow -- it's all there, and speaks to us through the millenia.A great collection at a bargain price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FIVE STARS ~ for Thunder and lighting !","review":"Chi Coltrane only had one hit song!

However, if you are intrigued by the 3-D idea then forget this one. Not one second was actually shot in stereoscopic 3-D at all. What the makers have TRIED to do is exploit something called The Pulfrich Illusion. This technique can give the impression of depth in a flat movie if the camera and background move in different directions. This has been tried, usually without success, in Super Bowl half times, music videos, cartoons, even sitcoms. They did not understand how to do do it and even with the glasses on there is very little if any depth to be seen, and certainly not anything which should be advertised as being \\"in 3-D\\".

The combination of the two pieces is enough to bring a tear to the sternest of individual. The vocals are clean and clear, and at the same time haunting.

Scenes that are supposed to be funny turn out to be tiring and exasperating to watch instead. The scene where Kate throws the dining plates at her hosts after going into shock while meeting her ex was too much and really not funny. Although the movie tries to nail the character Gemma as the dumb one most of the other cast make a wonderful fool of themselves instead with those tiring long scenes. In fact the character Gemma offered some respite.Full points for the camera work as the beaches look beautiful with the lovely blue waters.

In the journal Patricia, our heroine, makes sweeping generalizations about Brits, Irish, and Americans, and then goes on and on about the individualism of the woman in the Vermeer painting. Whew, this art historian needs to work on removing her head from the sand. I got quite riled up about the ending, too, (which I promise not to reveal). It's a bit of a trick that is in contradiction to the form of the novella--a confessional journal. I was surprised to see no hints of the ending until the last page.However, that scathing review aside, I have to admit I did get riled up. And I like when a book riles me up.

She has a keen sense for looking at one's inner self, and can gracefully script bedroom scenes which are naughty without offending the reader. Even the most avid of mystery lovers will never foretell her rich surprise ending.This novel is a jewel."},{"rating":"1","title":"IRA redoux","review":"Can an old caper be brought up to date?

With the hot topic of art history, and re-examination of the dutch master Vermeer, whose works have been recently mounted in celebrated exhibits, and other books about this painter, notably Tracy Chevalier's wonderfully satisfying The Girl with the Pearl Earring, the author involves us in personal tragedy, self-redemption through love and scholarship, all with sex as an easy bedfellow. From there it's a quick slide into crime, via politics, Irish-British ones at that. Was I the only one to guess the ending of this book a chapter earlier? Seems like deja vu to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish-","review":"First of all, I must say I did not finish the book, despite its minimal size.

Girl attempts to get in touch with her rootsby a sojourn in a small Irish village, where she becomes embroiled inan IRA-related plot that (surprise!) her new boyfriend/relativeis involved with. All the heroes are women; all the wretchedthugs are men. Result: a contemporary mystery story for women, with someheavy Irish whipped cream mixed in.

I can even read them with my eyes closed because I know them all so well.I have to say that I found myself very disappointed with this book. It was partly the storyline (capturing and hunting down the animals), but it is mostly the pictures. I am not someone who is easily offended at all, but the pictures in the book of Asians and Africans were so stereotypically horrible. I realize this was written in a different time, but I just don't feel it is truly appropriate to the children of today.

Not recommended.","review":"I bought this to give to my niece for Christmas but it contains several highly racist bits as the boy travels to different countries to collect animals for his zoo. He goes to Asia where he meets \\"helpers who all wear their eyes at a slant\\" (accompanied by WWII propoganda-style caricatures of Asians). When he goes to Africa the animal he captures is held aloft by two tribal Africans illustrated in the typical minstrel show/early 20th century racist exaggerated style. And he goes to Russia to collect a bird \\"whose headski is redski and belly is blueski.\\"Yes, the book was originally printed in 1950 and maybe it was a less enlightened time and my niece is going to encounter society's racial stereotypes soon enough.

This book does encourage a child's use of his/her imagination, and the fantasy is rich. However, there are elements in the book that disturb me. I understand that it was written in 1950, but I don't know that young children are capable of comprehending the difference. For example, Asians are quite stereotypically depicted, including this line, \\"With helpers who all wear their eyes at a slant.\\" Africans are depicted in an even worse way; they look as though they were drawn in blackface, and they have enormous nose rings. The message of hunting down creatures (and taking pleasure in it) so that they can be caged in a zoo for display is also bothersome.

It does protect your leg. Thats in itself makes it superior. In addition you get extra storage in the side pockets. Kind of like having a mini bucket boss right there in front of your tool bags. It's still not secure enough for me though. I hate when my drills take a dive. They get dropped enough as it is. Who has the patience to strap a drill in every time they use it? I've been on a lot of jobs and have seen hundreds of drills in holsters. I've seen about two that were actually strapped in.The only holder I trust completely is the Prazi Big Lugg. It is far superior for keeping your drill stuck to your side. Just drop it in and you're good to go. Bend over, lay down , jump , It doesn't matter. It's still there. Impossible with a holster.

Spartacus has had several revisions and the version on this recording has apparently undergone a few cuts that do not do the music total justice. A few portions just don't quite flow as smoothly as they should and feel a bit chopped. These will probably be noticed mostly by those fairly familiar with earlier versions and don't ruin the recording. That aside, this is a very decent recording.

I will say though that I thought the font on the paperback edition was too small, and I share this here just in case anyone else is really annoyed by small print. Bosworth's accounting of Il Duce was complete and fascinating. His narration skills are strong although his contempt for Mussolini definitely comes across in these pages which is really the only criticism that I have. Clocking in at around 430 pages, this text packs a serious punch and provides a brimming overview of the man and his times. The panorama he gives on Italy and the Italian people also made it well worth the money.

The bags pull into a bunch in the middle on the belt and puff out excessively to the sides. Some stiffing material along the belt sleeve would help this. It seems to me that too many of the pockets went to speed squares but not one for a carpenters square. I could use more places to store tools and only a couple speed square pockets. There are a few pockets I will miss when I can afford to replace from this belt.

Besides the obvious choices, my favourite song on this album is \\"If Only You Believe\\". This tune was also covered by Gayle McCormick (ex Smith) as the \\"B\\" side of \\"It's a Cryin\\" Shame\\".

The quality of the rubber is poor. The images are cut very shallow and ink invariably gets on the rest of the stamp and leaves marks on the printed image. I've tried several brands of ink and markers, all yielding poor results. The wood mounts are thin and do not provide enough gripping surface.

It is entriguing from the beginning where a lonely cowboy is looking for a place to call his own, and then when he finds a girl staying in his homestead, uninvited!! The story that unfolds is huge, with the characters growing older with the story.

LOVE HUNTER was the first Jon Hassler novel I had the pleasure of reading, and with it I discovered one of my favorite authors. Mr. Hassler has a special way of developing characters so you somehow feel connected to them. In the case of Love Hunter, the reader can sense the anguish felt by Chris as he witnesses his friend Larry's losing battle with MS. Chris also struggles with his growing love for Larry's wife. Together, Chris and Larry attempt to continue an annual tradition which will soon cease to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ordinary People, Extraordinary Passions","review":"Hassler breathes fresh life into two of literature's weariest clichés: the lovers' triangle and the suffering of mortal illness. Because he handles these subjects with a lightness of touch and firm structural craftsmanship, the result is realistic yet never maudlin, insightful though not preachy. An honest read with delightfully quirky characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do we need to know all this? Get on with the story","review":"This is one of the worst books I've ever read. It takes forever to get the plot line moving because Hassler seems to have to describe every little thing that isn't necessary. He has an interesting idea for a book but executes it very poorly. Much of the book is just a summary of what happens rather than putting us directly into the scene and letting us see what happens. It's sort of like reading a summary of a book rather than the book itself. It was a real struggle to finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strangely compelling but tedious, not for animal lovers","review":"The story line was atypical, but not necessarily a true characterization of people in the midwest.

Mostly, because I was born in Iran and remember watching films as a young child. I loved this movie because of it's vivid color and poetic dialouge. It's unlike american films because it shows every possiable detail and has a slow pace. It's not a fast pace action triller. But it is a delightful story about a girl and her adventure to buy a big goldfish. You won't find american films that pay this much attention to such a simple topic, but that is what makes Iranian films standout from the rest of the films made around the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A high level film!","review":"Through this curiously simple story, Abbas Kiarostami displays a breathtaking exploration around the social body of the Iranian nation, about a seven years old girl who, in the eve of the New year- 1374 according the Iranian calendar- in her desire to buy a goldfish, loses her money on the way.Meanwhile, two dervishes, a gentle old lady, a distracted tailor, a talkative soldier, her brother and an afghan refugee will accompany her in order to help and comfort her, around that unpleasant fact. Apparently, it's a comedy, but there is a lot of nestled issues around, becoming a true beautiful story loaded of peerless humanity.The main highlight is the overwhelming natural performance of this actress Aida Mohammadkhani who really stole the show all the way. After you watch it, you will agree with the fact this movie deserved Camera d' or in Cannes 1995.It's absolutely incredible how this film has not been translated into DVD format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated","review":"This films scenes of Iranian street life were very interesting, but I couldn't enjoy the visuals at all. The pace of the film is crushingly slow, and the little girl got on my nerves. I hate to sound mean, but the way she lost the money and the way she always looked like she was about to cry got under my skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute","review":"It's not anything I would see twice. I guess that it was a movie aimed for the Nickelodeon channel. Unfortunately, most children would find it boring since most of the film centers on how this little girl is going to get her money out of a gutter. And unless you are an adult who looks at many things at an artistic perspective, you would rather wash dishes. If this movie wasn't set at a foriegn country, I don't think I would have watched it for as long as I did. I soley liked this movie because of the adorable and whinny little girl starring in it, not to mention that I learned that \\"Vali\\" or \\"Bali\\" means \\"yes\\" in Iran. I especially enjoy the conversation she had with the soldier and the way she questioned everything he said to her. Cute girl, but the movie is too empty and, except for the dialogue between the little girl and the soldier,it was a little too dim witted and simplistic for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Boring.

They had great chunky melodic basslines that chugged along allowing the guitar to swoon over the top and then take control at the right moment for full on power pop with great hooks and choruses. All there stuff is good, 'Burning in Water' has the best songs, but 'Fall' is their most consistent album in that it works well from the instrumental start to the finish and i can imagine it would be fun as hell to skate to. If you like this sort of music it might also be worth seeking out bands like Mega City Four and Drive both from England who continued this lost tradition of powerful pop songs without turning into wackey pop punkers with c-razy facial expressions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobel Toilet Reading","review":"Yes, I'm serious about the title of this review. Nobel Prize winner Kawabata's \\"Palm-of-the-Hand Stories\\", a collection of 70 mostly 1-4 page stories makes for excellent toilet reading, reading of the highest order. Don't lie to yourselves, we all do it - even the ladies. So instead of reading some junky magazine or playing a hand-held video game while on the throne, read this book; its stories are of the perfect duration. The stories range from slight observations to deep expositions on human nature. Coincidentally, one of the stronger stories in the book is titled 'Lavatory Buddhahood'. Go figure.

I suggest you read this wonderful book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ideal coffee table book","review":"When I read my first of Kawabata's palm of the hand stories I can't admit that I was hooked, but I was definately intrigued. On the edition I own there is an entire story on the back cover, and after reading it I could pull NO MEANING from it what so ever. I thought, like one of the other reviewers put it, that the story was pointless. I have come to learn a harsh lession however. If there is one thing that Kawabata's works are not it is pointless. Every part of every word is overflowing with meaning. The truly pitiful part about his work is that to someone ignorant of Japan and Japanese culture it is sometimes hard to grasp what the meaning is. The simple enjoyment I received from reading the stories helped to inspire me to learn more about the country. I am by no means saying that you can't realish every word of this collection without knowing Japan, but I am saying to attempt to fully UNDERSTAND some of them it is truely a desireable asset."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"the dvd is a fairly good description of the plight of the black americian in the amount of time allotted by a dvd but as a history of the blues i believe that it comes up short. the musical performances are definitely geared toward the jazzier side of blues as is the focus of the majority of the film. folk blues, chicago, new orleans, texas, apilachian, ect, either barely get a mention or no mention at all. also cronologically it seemed to jump around a bit they didnt seem to be consistently foloing a time line"},{"rating":"2","title":"History of Blues","review":"\\"The Essential History of the Blues\\" is just exactly what the title implies.

Maybe it was the hype of Tom Hanks' kid finally getting into a movie. While the theme was one that is worth exploring, the love-hate relationship with family and close friends, the hometown blues and the high-school angst the movie did not delve deep enough into these themes, it was too superficial.

The stereotypical party animal is something that I've seen time and time again, and don't need to see again unless they add some kind of spice to it.Another general problem with this movie is that the jokes weren't funny. They tried to push the laugh so many times in this movie and I felt myself chuckle a little, but only because I was trying to laugh.What I did like about this movie was the whole idea of trying to escape one's surroundings to become a writer. You kind of find yourself pulling for Colin Hank's character to make it.

I'm really glad I didn't pay to see this movie in the theater, because JB is the hilariously shining superstar on this DVD - much of it not in the theatrical release of the picture. Anyone spending the time and money to view the DVD should do themself a favor and check out the special features menu. The deleted scenes and trailers (called Interstitials) are all hilarious. Some of the deleted scenes (including snipets from the trailers) are the funniest scenes, and would have made the storyline much better as a whole. The young Hanks does an OK job on his first outing, but JB steals the show (ala High Fidelity). In it's entirety, this could have been an entirely new and fresh kind of teen comedy. The screenwriter has worked on TV's \\"Freaks and Geeks\\" and the revolutionary \\"Pasadena\\".

If you ever want to watch a movie you can just sit back and enjoy then this is it. Sean (the very charmig and likeable Colin Hanks) wants to go to Stanford, but the school guidance couselor(a hysterical Lily Tomlin) sends the wrong transcripts, therefore Sean goes out of his way to get accepted. Of course the movie then has many differnt obstacles Sean has to face to do this, like his alcholic mother(the always great Catherine Ohara), his druggie slob brother(Jack Black, in one of his best and funniest roles, and his sweet and loving girlfriend Ashly(the very talented Shuyler Fisk). Many things go wrong which make for a very funny and entertaing movie.

Along the way, his parents reconcile, his brain-dead stepfather recovers, and his two slack-jawed surfer buds fall in love. Expansive, sweet, almost heartwarming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost good","review":"This is a light, fun, dumb movie that could have been good. Colin Hanks plays a young guy who wants to be a writer and not a surfer. His family is crazy and no one understands him, but his girlfriend is supportive. The jokes are unoriginal but dependable --- people in wheelchairs slam into moving cars, someone flips out during a dinner party, eccentric teachers act weird for comic effect, someone accidentally takes drugs and does something crazy, etc. Jack Black stands out (as usual) as a stoner brother with a healthy slacker attitude. He's usually in his underwear, telling everyone to chill out.The only really good moment is at the end, with a cameo appearance by a famous actor. At that moment, the movie suddenly becomes interesting. It's a moment that emphasizes just how mediocre the rest of the movie is. I recommend this to anyone who likes mindless entertainment. You'll laugh a little, you won't feel ripped off, and you'll forget the movie a week later."},{"rating":"1","title":"kooky fun, but never really takes off","review":"Seemed like a great premise: some nearly-deserving guy losing his mind to get into a top-tier university. The problem from my end was that they shouldn't have scripted that thing about the mixed-up transcripts. That spoiled a lot of the hijinks that ensued, since you kept thinking that Stanford would surely made an exception in that case and reexamine his admissions package. Failing that, litigation would likely have saved the day. So I really didn't buy the kid's craziness because I never found his desperation convincing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orange County","review":"I hate teen movies. Absolutely hate 'em. They're generally cliched, dorky, poorly acted and written, and painfully unfunny. That said, \\"Orange County\\" is a peach. Occasionally crude enough to attract the adolescent boys in the audience, it's still sweet, funny, and just, well, downright enjoyable. The cast is fine - Colin Hanks and Schuyler Fisk are fine young actors, Catherine O'Hara and John Lithgow shine as Hanks' wacky parents, and Jack Black is...Jack Black. Well written by Mike White (\\"Chuck and Buck\\"), with plenty of funny gags leading up to (believe it or not) a worthwhile message, \\"Orange County\\" is not too sweet, not too sour. It's just right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"Watching Orange County was the worst spent 83 minutes of my life. We only watched the whole movie out of morbid curiosity, or maybe we were hoping it would somehow redeem itself. It never did....Jack Black made a poor decision choosing to play in this movie. He was the only saving grace that I could find. (Jack, I have found you to be a comic genius in the other movies you have been in, i.e. High Fidelity, Shallow Hall. You are even good in Enemy of the State. Do not lower your standards again. You deserve better.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was no fun.","review":"I liked Legally Blonde, loved Varsity Blues, and generally enjoy the type of comedy Orange County is patterned after. I cannot say enough about how lame this movie is. Colin Hanks doesn't have a funny line in the entire movie. And as the dorks on the commentary point out, he's in every scene.I can't really fault Hanks because the material is so poopie that the movie can't help but be awkward. Maybe the problem is that the writer and director just aren't funny to me. The commentary is worse than the movie. They talk about how funny things are in monotone. If it's funny, they should be a little happier about it.The trailer is funnier than the movie, and they cut the funniest part of the trailer out.I would not recommend buying this without seeing it first. And I wouldn't recommend seeing it. Do something else with your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"tHiS ThE BeSt MoViE EvEr!!!","review":"Orange County is my FAVORITE movie ever!!!

I didn't even know that Tom Hanks had a son, much less that he was an actor. In Orange County, Colin does display some of the early comedic mannerisms of his father such as his high pitched banter and facial expressions. Hanks does a decent job as the male lead but the story line is weak. As a film, Orange County is rather bland family entertainment. The only two characters really explored are hanks and his girlfriend. Jack Black, who was heavily touted in ads as having an expanded role is scattered throughout the film at best. Every town has it's own version of Lance, the kid who doesn't work or go to school, parties hard and has no ambition. Some of his lines are funny and he truly carries the film in the scenes he is in. But they are few and far between. Clocking in at just over 82 minutes, Orange County is a journey to be taken only by the cable viewer. Not Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"america's critic","review":"funny was it suppose to be cuz i didnt laugh,,, poor jack black maybe had a funny moment ,,, uhhh just didnt like this one dont pay for this one borrow it from a crackhead or dopefiend cuz they prally have it and cant sell it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Orange County Rocks !!!

As a victim/survivor of clergy sexual abuse, the book offered a critical understanding of the psychological dynamics of both personality and relationships that create at-risk environments for boundary violations to occur. The exploration of empathy and empowerment and the gift/burden of our unconscious and subconscious operatives are well done by the author. My recovery and healing is testimony to the powerful dynamic of empathy and empowerment when experienced as a healthy interaction complete with restorative qualities which then, in turn, offer insight into the evil nature of the abusive relationship.

No matter what the heroine never felt worthly, loved, beautiful, bla bla bla. So she had red hair and freckles. Since when did that make you an ugly duckling? Up to the VERY end of the book she was worried her man didn't love her when he never once did anything to prove otherwise. Also I'm sure she was meant to come across as strong willed (which I love when they are not weak) but she just came across very unlikable. I kept wondering why he did like her so much! I also usually love the secondary characters but just didn't feel anything for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"One hit wonder.","review":"I made this purchase for one song \\"Do It Anyway You Wanna\\". \\"Nursery Rhymes\\" is okay.

This is a trip trough music. This is a trip trough your own life!This album is great. This is metal combined with classical music and with operatic pieces. The music is so emotional, so melodramatic. I have also never heard a voice like the voice of the male-singer. It's haunting, it's complete. This album will make you think, this album will make you cry, this album will tear you apart.And do not fear if you are not a gothic-metal lover! I am also just getting in this scene! It is no hardcore metal!! This is faboulous A+ quality music combined with great metal pieces! This album can make you cry. Listen to 'Stumme Worte'. It's just stunning.

It also gives a good background in the economics of electricity and liquid fuels.It is however already quite dated. The book was published right before the price of oil started to soar, and completely didn't see it coming. Many statements support the idea that oil will be cheap for many decades to come. They certainly were not alone in not seeing this coming, but it is sometimes hard to take them seriously on other subjects when they keep referring back to the low price of oil."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"book was good, clean and nicely packed when shipped, received it in two business days and had no problems at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty useless book","review":"Unfortunately, I bought this book for a class before realizing that I could have managed just as well by getting all the information that I needed from the internet and saving myself $70.

I would have liked to seen more heavy duty stitching but I haven't broken any yet. As advertised, there are numerous pockets of varying sizes and shapes. There are pockets that will fit larger tools, such as hammers, pipe wrenches, etc. on the inside part of the bucket, but become useless for those larger tools if you insert one or more of the tote trays that are made to fit and stack inside a five gallon bucket. In other words, don't buy the tote trays if you need the inside large pockets. Overall, it's a good system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was good but now ...","review":"I have been using this product for many years and loved it, but they appear to have changed the interior pocket depth and now the tools fall out.

The bottoms get holes when awls, saws, and chisels get poked into them. The bottom of this is a bucket. Anyone who has enough tools to fill this with has a bucket, 5gallon of paint, 5gallon of mud, 5gallons of omni grip.. something. Buckets are water proof, so if it's sitting on your garage floor and rain starts coming in like with my poorly graded 100 year old barn-garage, your tools will be protected. The canvas is thick and sturdy with good seams, thicker than Ryobi or Milwaukee bags. There are a huge amount of pockets, and they are all on the outside. This is good because it spreads your tools out so you can actually see them. Interior pockets are just places for tools to get lost. If you are a sissy man like me who doesn't like a wire bucket handle digging into their hand, make a duct tape handle grip, or use cloth tape w/e."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Than a Tool Box","review":"I have used one of these for several years and purchased one for my S-I-L for Christmas after he saw how pleased I was with this item. Not only is it durable, but will hold practically anything a person would need to carry with them for most jobs.

I have to replace them every 1-1/2 to 2 yaers due to the abuse I put them through - No problem. However, when this particular batch came in and I put a new one on my bucket, I found that the pockets were much shorter and my longer tools (ratchet, chisels, etc..) were falling over. While the Bucket boss seems constructed the same, I find myself yelling at it in frustration for not holding my tools like the older ones. So in short, if you are going to keep short tools in it, no problem. If you need it to keep normal tools in it, be wary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the man who you thought had everything!","review":"I got the organizer, the bucket and the special handle for my dad for his birthday.

I wasn't interested at the time. Recently, I came back, and read the whole thing from cover-to-cover. I was thrilled. It was great.Going through the aisles of my local bookstore the other day, I saw this book. I didn't even know there was going to be a sequel! I bought it immediately, went directly home, and read the book until I finished it, at about 2AM.It was a great book! Even better than the first. I loved it. It didn't have that \\"I am invincible! Rarrgh!\\" theme from the main characters as lots of novels do, either. I thought it was a great yarn, if a very unrealistic view on the future...... Well, I hope so, anyway.I definately recommend buying this book. Don't forget to read 'Stark's War' first, to get the whole story.

How is the 'his' army going to continue as a combat effective unit without officers? However, the answer to the last question seems to be the first one where an answer is determined, because the 'Enemy' Multinationals have just begun a major assault, and Stark's front line is crumbling . . .

This author also writes the excellent Lost Fleet series, but under a different name - Jack Campbell. Lost Fleet deals with space naval battles and emphasizes fleet manuevers, whereas the Stark series is viewed from an individual soldier's perspective at squad level. At least to start with in the first book. After initiating a rebellion and assuming command of the lunar base, the grunt now discovers that being in charge is not easy. This book is long on self-doubt, unpreparedness to counter enemy aggressions, and a bit short on action. There were just a couple of action sequences surrounded by a lot of dialogue. As I am nearly done with the third book in this series, you could almost skip this second and proceed direct to the third and not miss much. Overall, a bit slow and the stumbling style of the lead character is a bit tiresome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching","review":"I felt touched by this little book.

A yakuza type woman takes control of all the gangland killings in her town using three kung fu killers. But the plot throws so many exploitable characters and situations into it, it plays like a fun mix of \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and a Road Runner cartoon.There are cops, gangsters, karate teachers, lovers, bikers, and bartenders. The action sequences are varied and bizarre like the one where the three killers whip out a karate school full of students. Or when one of the killers fights his way out of a police station. Or the three of them take on bikers in a roadside cafe.There is a hero. A guy who gets his hand cut off in the karate school and goes after the killers. There is even a psycho style ending. Too bad this obviously lower budget film didn't have any stars in it.

The story has this Yukuza woman who hires 3 bad dudes to take people out for her. One of the first scenes is when they go to this karate school. Now this is where i have to stop. Only the action in Swordsman with an umbrella could be compared to the badness of this. But then I somehow made it through(fastforwarded) to the end, and OMG i am I sorry I did.

If you need a long set of jumper cables that will start your car, and you don't expect them to last too long, these will probably do the job for you. If you expect quality components and a lifetime of service from the tools you buy, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Cables are crimped to the clamps. They should be soldered.These are fragile at best. So I'm looking for a better setfor our work vans.Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite jumper cable","review":"i got this one back when my old car used to die on me all the timewhen i finally got a new car i was almost upset that it always starts by itself thats how good this cable isi also have another ( even more heavy duty 2 gauge ) coleman cable but that one is TOO heavy and clamps are too hard to compress. this 4 gauge one is ideal IMHO for a mid-size car. clamps operate smoothly, the cable itself is not too heavy or stiff and power transfer is good.i had a cheap cable literally MELT on me once and wouldn't start the car because it was too thin. don't use cheap jumper cables - go for a nice solid one like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Heavy Duty Jumper Cables","review":"Normally you don't need jumper cables, but when you do you need a good set that are long. These are heavy duty, long and very durable. I bought these to go in my pickup truck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cables","review":"Only had to use them once, but it was well worth the cost of having them. I keep them in the back of my SUV coiled inside the original box -- that way they are kept neat and ready for use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, High Quality Starter Cables","review":"I purchased the 12' feet long cable set and they arrived in a retail cardboard box with handle, which could be used as a storage and carrying case for these cables, although I will not need to store them with the carry box. These are high quality long cables of high grade materials and I believe worth the price I paid for them. They will store in the back seat storage compartment of my truck easily. Recomend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to write home about","review":"These jumper cables are not very good. The wire is Aluminum and the battery clamps are poor quality(steel teeth on one side). You really have move the clamps around on the battery post to get a good connection. The two times that I have had to use them I had to grab a DC current meter to check for current flow and then had to playwith the clamps to get a good connection. Best thing that can be done to this cable set is to cut the ends off and solder on a good set of jumper cable clamps from Napa. By the time you do that you could have just spent $100 on a much better set of jumper cables."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slight disappointment","review":"The weakest link in any booster cable is the clamps. If the connection from clamp to terminal is even slightly weak then the amperage is critically limited (even 1 ohm is too much at 12 volts). I chose these because of their fairly heavy gauge to maintain amperage despite their length, but (and you can't tell from the listing) the clamps are not as impressive as I would like -- they are the sort where there is copper on only one side of the jaws and I would prefer both. Most of us have had the experience of working clamps into corroded terminals to try to get just a bit more power. I haven't used these cables yet but assume confidently they will work fine. The cables are fairly flexible and appear sturdy and well-insulated. Don't skimp on cables, you get what you pay for, and I think these are merely a fair deal in light of their much higher price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coleman jumper cables","review":"Good price for heavy duty, and long cables.

The book is well written and edited but the content is lacking. It is disorganized, over wrought and chock full of disassociated thoughts, approaches and ideas. As a professional investigator in the private sector for 30 years and the author of a number of books addressing this topic, this is one of the least useful I have read.

The first two CD's are early recordings, contemporary with the writing and when the young Noel could hit those high notes. Also included is a disc of contemporary recordings by other artists of the time. I admit that the sound is scratchy and muffled. I don't care. It's worth it for the authenticity and sincerity. (Two strange words to use when talking about Coward.) No one was better at creating rhymed wit than N.C. Not even Cole Porter. If you are unfamiliar with Coward's work and want an introduction at little cost, here's your chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Cover Televak Video who really started MTV in the 70s","review":"This was a let down because it didn't cover the guys from Televak Video who really introduced MTV back in the early 70s who met up with all kinds of problems from industry insiders who tried to keep them out and succeeded keeping it as a monopoly for Warner/Amex Corporation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit!","review":"I was looking for a case for my Dewalt nailer.

The picture is accurate of what I received; however, the description, and the majority of the reviews here are describing a previous/alternative version of this bag. A simple web search will reveal a photo of the actual \\"gatemouth\\" product (with a hinged top), but i can't seem to find any venders on line offering that version of the bag. This is still decent bag, but probably not worth the $30 price tag. I'll most likely RMA this product.

The bag is of very nice quality and has a very heavy duty zipper. It comes with a shoulder strap and two handles to carry by hand (I am surprised it did not have the velcro strap that will keep the handles togeather. The picture is a little misleading though, from the picture it looks as if it has a stiff bottom and wil sit upright, well I'm here to tell you it wont! I think the photographer filled the bag with lightweight foam when this picture was taken, not a framing gun. All and all I am happy with it, I just wish it was a tad bigger and the bottom was more riggid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"This is an awesome deal as far as the power wire goes, It did come with a AGL fuse which sucks, the fuse was designed to handle 8 AWG wire so beware, if you buy this you will still need to purchase a inline fuse that will work with 4 AWG. I'm not exactly sure what the actual footage of the wire was but it is a bit short, if you plan on using distribution blocks or wiring more than one amp you will need some additional wire. I used this kit in a 2009 Accord LX Sedan and ended up needing a couple extra feet to be able to run the power wire neatly."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is missing the first 2 seconds of the first song.","review":"The first (and best!) song on the CD starts very herky-jerkily as they left off its first two seconds. What a rip off! It's going back and I'm never buying anything off the collectables label again. Album-ruining mistakes aside, this is not one of JGW's better albums anyway. He sounds a lot more produced and formulaic in this outing than on earlier works (Lone Ranger, Ain't That a Bitch, Real Mother For Ya-I suggest you get them on vinyl). \\"I Don't Want To Be President\\" and \\"Mother in Law\\" are pretty decent tracks, and \\"What the Hell is This?\\" is one JGWs best pieces when the beginning of the song is there. The rest of the album is somewhat weak (but still Johnny \\"Guitar\\" Watson).I really hope another label reissues this with a better (and hopefully complete) CD transfer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good book","review":"This is a pretty good book about American Indians and their difficulties in going into an urban environment. This book can get tedious at times because all the problems the Indians face seem not to be their faults at all, which is hard to believe sometimes. Yes, white society made it difficult for them, as did the urban environment, but the author places most of the blame on these two entities and not even a little on the Indians themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Known Grave","review":"My first read by author Evelyn Berckman which I purchased in the Fingerprint Series format. Really enjoyed and look forward to reading more of her stories. No Known Grave is not a war story as the title might imply.

I came across this book while researching for a unit on Ancient Greece. The book has pictures that are vivid and exciting and follow young Eratosthenes throughout his life until the time in which he \\"measured the Earth\\" . My students will find its words complex enough to keep them interested but simplistic enough to follow along. This can be integrated well with math lessons dealing with angles and circumference. I found the book to be extremely enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"ancient math history made accessible","review":"This picture book gives a history of the first man who figured out how to measure the diameter of the earth. It makes the mathematics accessible as well as showing that you don't have to be a mathemetician to use math."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book to read on Eratosthenes","review":"I read this book in order to write up a reading/math lesson related to circumference. I thought that the book was very informative, had terrific pictures, and was a fairly easy read. I think that the children (6th graders) would enjoy reading it in class, if given the chance. I would have liked if the book went over, in more detail, how he determined the equation. (The children tend to ask how he got it!) It would have been useful to know the equation he used, but it does not matter because one's lesson can be modified to use the information provided in the book. I tied in the reading to a circumference lesson and had the children find the circumference of the earth.Overall, this is a terrific book. I thought that it was a fun read, and is a great teaser when going into a circumference lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Need More Books Like This!","review":"I'd just like to repeat what the other middle school reviewers are saying about this book--namely that it works with kids. Beautifully illustrated, concise, great for a multi-disciplinary lesson. It covers history in an engaging way and makes students think. I wish publishers would get more books to us history teachers like this one. Teachers who liked this might want to check out Joy Hakim's new science \\"textbook\\" which covers early science and math. Every time I look at it I like it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Marred Effort","review":"This could have been a great book. John Vernon obviously expended a lot of effort to weave the known facts into his novel and to create memorable impressions of each character from the small body of available historical knowledge. But John Vernon's easy slide into vulgarity as he creates the personalities and interactions of the characters was a big disappointment to me. I compelled myself to finish the book, mostly driven by my fascination for the Colorado River basin and its exploration. But being unwilling to contemplate that anyone else might wallow through the salacious bogs offensively dumped into this story, I threw the book in the recycling bin as soon as I was done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"This book was terrible.

Not being the type to easily give up on a book, I decided to give it 100 pages to see if it improved; I gave up on page 44, but before I did I scanned pages further along to make absolutley sure. Now, some would argue that I hadn't give the book enough time to develop, but to be frank, the writing was so bad, I had to stop for the sake of my sanity. I was going to put the book up for sale on Amazon.com, but there appears to be a glut of used copies of this book.
