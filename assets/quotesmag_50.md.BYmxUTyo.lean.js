Note that it's called 'Zizanie', but 'de Fragonard' is not mentioned. In fact, no manufacturer or country of origin is on the bottle (just that the essences came from France), and the product isn't listed on the House of Fragonard web site.

(Although, it serves me right for buying a new album from an artist I like without previewing.)Regardless, even pretending that The Orb does not exist, this is a purely mediocre folksy-rock album with nothing that stands out as very good.

Installation was very difficult on a standard Windows 98 Gateway computer. The technical support line (free support) kept disconnecting me. I finally reached HP through their out-of-warranty #. Bottom line, even though I was replacing an existing CD-ROM (which should have been a 10 minute exercise as others have commented), I had to make numerous jumper changes, changes to the systems bios and had to reinstall other devices after the initial installation caused my machine to refuse to boot. I spent a total of 2 hours on the phone working directly with HP tech support (who were really trying to help) and at least another hour on hold when I was disconnected, trying to get back through. At one point, the Tech Support person acknowledged that this was \\"a new product and may still have some bugs in it.\\" My recommendation -- proceed with caution and choose a product with a little longer history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just because it's different doesn't mean it's bad...","review":"The previous Dog's Eye View albums had a more acoustic, mellow tone, true. They were also written and released a long time ago, and times have changed and musical styles have evolved within that time. On Peter Stuart's weblog I read that he's currently listening to Deathcab for Cutie and other eclectic/electonica-rock bands, which is bound to influence his own music writing.What has remained constant, on this album and the previous, is that his music tells a story, and if you listen to the lyrics you can get inside the man singing them.I recommend catching the live acoustic shows that Peter Stuart plays. He has lots of personality, and he shares stories about his songs and his past relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I enjoyed Dog's Eye View's first and second discs as well as Propeller, Peter Stuart's solo. This current cd is way over-produced with a lot of electronica and syn-music. Not what I expected, esp. given the acoustic/straightforward rock/pop on the first two discs.

It combines two previously out of print LP's and plays for a solid 70 minutes. Fans of straight-ahead jazz/soul-jazz/blues will definitely find something to like on this disc.

(Even Tony Curtis's paintings aren't bad, in a hotel-room-art kind of way.) McCartney doesn't have it. And the interview with McCartney in front of the book is pretty bland. So the book isn't even worth getting for that. Of all the talented artists alive now who will die unknown, and here's an untalented artist getting national exposure.

I would not recommend this unit to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems like a great filter but too costly and not sure it works","review":"Beware that the cost of the refill filter is $50.00. You could buy another filter for that. I bough 3 of these filters after developing severe sensitivity to pollen and mold and had it in a room at work that turned out to have toxic mold in the air. I had the filter running at slot to high 24 HRS a day and I don't think it killed any mold. I developed a severe allergic reaction to the mold even with the filter running all the time. Then I found out that it costs 50 dollars to get a new filter at a discount place. I am throwing the filter out and keeping my old ones that I think work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like it","review":"This HEPA filter puts out air which smells funny and exacerbates my asthma.

The item was packaged very nicely with easy instructions for setup.The Auto setting works quite well with the air quality sensor. This is a feature I highly recommend. Scrape your feet on the carpet in front of the unit and the sensor detects the lowered air quality and increases the fan to a higher setting. It even works for food smells and local foot traffic.On the lowest setting the unit is very quiet. I leave mine on Auto and turn it off when I go home at night. I also own a Honeywell air cleaner which works well and moves a lot of air but doesn't have all the nice features of the HB unit. I have the 04161 positioned to blow the clean air across the front of my chair where I sit.Summary: Good value, great features, nice styling, small footprint.

Songs range on \\"Unholy Cult\\" from fast tempo to dark heavy bursts of crushing riffs. This album has their old drummer Alex Herrera, their current line-up contains mastermind Steve Shalaty as the skinsman. I adore the lyrical genius Ross puts forth on EACH Immo record. Bob the guitarist has his own style with constant progression and dark breakdowns which is evident on \\"Unholy Cult\\". This album compliments 2007's \\"Shadows in the Light\\" very well.

Somewhat like Ohgr, somewhat like Peter Gabriel in the early days, he came out in a shriner's outfit with fake t*ts underneath, then proceeded to basically strip on stage while chewing on a pin microphone (the microphones you see hanging from news anchor's collars).No instruments, just a Sony Vaio laptop and a mixer. Quite an experience... if you like the blip-static experimental electronic stuff. Can't really dance to it, can't really sing to it. Nice beats, a couple good melody loops. Over all, an eye-opening show."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got 2 of these plasmas and they both died!!!","review":"Buyer beware!

The replacement part I was told would take two months, at least, to receive. The store I bought it from eventually refunded me my money! BUYERS BEWARE!!! DO NOT BUY!!!! Also, I called HP and turns out they messed up in making these tv's... it will pull in any channel over 1000 (where I'm from all HD channels are over 1000), but you cannot manually punch in or manually scan for setup any channel over 999.

After trying to figure out the problem ourselves, we called HP. It was going to cost us $629 for them to come out. If they didn't fix it, it would still cost us $369. I think that is crazy for such a newer model of TV. We could not order the part or take it to another place to fix it. Our local TV repair person said that HP does not give out their diagrams to repair places. You have to go threw HP. So now we have a worthless flat screen that is to new to just throw away. We can almost buy a new TV for the price they want to repair it so we are kind of stuck. So DO NOT buy HP! The good reviews are from people that haven't had it go out yet but it will.

Finally, after finding a spot on the HP website regarding this apparently known issue I gave HP service a call. Well, to my shock they would not come and fix the plasma because the serial number was not within a certain range.

So, in effect, it was going into stripped wood, rather than an anchor like it should have.My boyfriend originally put it together and he complained about all of the screws not really fitting into the holes properly, and consequently the hall tree has always been a little crooked.

My sons, currently aged 4 and 6, have only recently started to like this book as much as I do. The illustrations are absorbing, and I always wish I would take the time to read this by myself so I can scour them for their elaborate details... but I am always too busy making \\"homemade bread and lots of it\\".

But there's also a heaviness as each child joins with its own fussy behavior, which threatens to slow the river down to a sluggish waterway; when along comes a change of pace --and voila! A wonderfully surprising ending, that makes us think of a strong river, in full flow... Marla Frazee's illustrations add to the words, are a perfect match, and flow beautifully with the words.

Wood ramps were sturdy, but it was VERY difficult to line up the ramps for assembly. As soon as you get one peg in place, the other pegs popped out. Took about 30 minutes to finally put it together.

And it doesn't work with Cars movie cars. Two replacement cars are $8, and you have to send a check directly to M&D. A big hassle--not to mention, an added expense. I was a big fan of M&D products, until this. Not a great experience overall, from product to service. I also question whether M&D are going downhill (no pun intended). Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing Enough","review":"We bought this second-hand which is probably why we're pleased with it. I don't think it's worth the price to buy it brand new unless they start including more cars. Our son is vehicle obsessed so it holds his attention probably longer than other kids who don't like cars as much. He really enjoys watching the cars go down and setting them off at different times. We often use matchbox cars on this but most of them flip over by the second ramp and finish on their hoods. Our son doesn't seem to mind this, he doesn't have a perception of how they 'should' go down so it's part of the fun for him. I'd say if your kid really likes cars it's a good toy, otherwise skip it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality for Melissa & Doug","review":"While the ramp racer looks great, I have to agree with many of the previous reviewers....it is not up to the standards of a Melissa & Doug product. It was difficult to put together, taking my husband and I over two hours because the screw holes were not properly lined up. One of the cars kept flipping on its side so it could not go down the ramp. The car release level on one side broke almost immediately (and this is with my husband trying it out -- before the grandchildren played with it). This would only be a good toy for a display item as it looks great....as a toy that a child would actually use, it is very poor quality. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, Its Not That Great","review":"We were excited to get the Melissa and Doug Ramp Racer Game for our children 2 and 4. Unfortunately, it is just not that interesting, amusing, versatile or educational. After watching the cars go down the ramps a few times, the kids are totally uninterested in it. In addition, part of one of the ramps broke off within a few weeks of getting the toy. While I love many Melissa and Doug products, I would not recommend this ramp/racer toy. Ours will likely go in a spring yard sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Superb!!!","review":"I don't think you can buy a better band for this price.Caddy Bay Collection's service was excellent.Will buy again from them.

It should reach a wide audience and of special note is his translation of Book IV of the Masnavi, Rumi's masterpiece (and previously available only in Nicholson scholarly and stilted version). Barks has a way to make Rumi's rich imagery come alive in a natural American diction. In this volume Barks own natural voice is brought to the fore with acknowledgement of his own limitations and appreciation of the guidance he has found along the way, making this the most fulsome account of his own interpretations of the Persian poet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I find it absolutely amazing that those who claim to be admirers of Rumi, online reviewers and editorial reviewers, do NOT even know where he was born! Persia, not Afghanistan, was his birthplace. Afghanistan did not even exist until the 19th century, thanks to the British.The land that is now called Afghanistan was part of the Persian Empire and remained so for centuries AFTER Rumi's death (500 years to be exact!). Rumi is a Persian poet, has been and forever will be. His poetry exemplifies pure, eloquent Farsi (language of Persia/Iran). The utter ignorance of this fact on the part of some reviewers, nonetheless, does not detract from the brilliance of the poet and the excellence of this translation. An absolute gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find Rumi's Essence Elsewhere","review":"Rumi is one of my favorite poets but Barks does not do him justice.

In this bizarre little film he portrays a Viet Nam veteran with dreams of opening up a worm farm. Escaping from a mental hospital he hooks up with Sally Field in her pre-Oscar days and finds a Viet Nam buddy along the way, played with genuinely spooking intensity by Harrison Ford, the film's only bright spot. Of course Winkler is carrying around ghosts, but he lacks the acting chops to draw us into the story and make us care about him. Eventually his eide eyed performance becomes over wrought and finally ridiculous, which is not I suspect, what was intended. A curiousity piece at best. Made the year before Coming Home and The Deer Hunter, it was quickly and mercifully forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fonzie Can't Act!","review":"Ho-ly Cow. Henry must thank his gods every day for landing his TV gig. Every one of his movies are proof that he has ZERO acting talent. In this gem, he plays an obnoxious, \\"crazy\\" vet, traveling the country in seach of his old army buddy. For the whole movie he's carrying a shoebox of worms that remains in pristine condition despite Henry being soaked by rain. He tries to pull off a Fonzie kind of toughness with some rednecks, but without the greased hair, he comes off as laughable.We're also expected to believe that his character could land a babe like Sally Field.

Now I see from the other reviewers, that the song was removed from this DVD version of the movie, which changes the ending considerably. If the song is credited to the group Kansas, why in the WORLD would they take it out? I will pass on purchasing this version. Thanks to everyone who alerted prospective buyers to this ridiculous alteration to the movie in this DVD. I would like to know if anyone knows if the original movie version is available on DVD or VHS (with CC- English captions for the hearing impaired).If anyone finds one, I would appreciate finding out the name of the company that released it or where it can be found.

Saw it in 1977 at a drive-in (a place where you park your car & watch a movie on a really big screen). The next day I bought the Kansas album with Carry On Our Wayward Son. Excellent album. ok so it was a disappointment that the song was cut from the movie- but guess what? There's somethin called CDs and MP3s that replaced the 8 track people. At the end of the movie I just crank it up on my bose speakers & break glass. Beats the heck outa the 1st time I heard it at the drive-in with scratchy noise coming out of a tin speaker hangin on my car door window. Don't cry. Just gotta be smarter than the problem thats all.

Buying it will only encourage Big Media to think they can get away with selling cheap ripoffs instead of the real thing.

What was a powerful climax has become a fizzle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly bad DVD","review":"You'd think it would be easy to convert a movie to DVD; but this movie didn't do it. I remember this movie ending with the music from Kansas' song, \\"Carry On Wayward Son\\", yet, Kansas (while appearing in the end-credits) is no where to be HEARD on this DVD. NO WHERE.

Other books and messages in churches often seem reluctant to really pose these questions and express doubts. Michael Wakely, who has worked in countries with absolute poverty and has had good reason to question God, asks these questions and many more without providing glib answers or dismissing them with the answer 'just have faith'! He is open and honest and expresses his doubts without hypocrisy. He is also inspirational in his continuation with his faith in God while believing that it is perfectly compatible to have doubt and faith together.

When this product was delivered, I had made fish the night before and the odor still hung in the air. It was never removed by this purifier after having it on all night and having to suffer through the loud blowing fan noise.My Kenmore was extremely quiet and that is something that I now appreciate in a unit.

I'm fairly certain that I'll order another two of these units: one for our upstairs bedrooms and one for our basement.So... why not five stars?

After a full week of use on average speed, I still can't stay in that room for more than one hour. When I use the air purifier on automatic, the sensor says the air is perfectly clean.

Figure it will cost you near the price of the unit each year in replacement filters and bulbs. Higher line units may have an initial cost of 2-3 times the price of this unit... but if you operate the unit for 3 or more years you have reached the pay-back point.

The purifier picked it up right away and increased the fan speed automatically and then reduced to the lower level again when the smell dissapeared.On the down side - even on the lowest fan speed (they call it Whisper Clean) it is MUCH more then a whisper. You will have to get used to having a sound equivalent to a medium speed fan in your bedroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"An effective device","review":"The Hamilton Beach 04163 works well in all respects, is more aesthetic than many other purifiers on the market, is reasonably quiet on low speed, and is a great value. I have mind in my bedroom. If I even slightly shake my comforter, the purifier's sensor quickly detects the dust fibers that are released. I checked the carbon filter after about 2 weeks of nightly use and could easily see on the filter where the purifier had trapped a great deal of larger dust particles and fibers. My only criticisms are that the purifier does not \\"remember\\" the UV light on/off state.

The shortness of this album echos the complaints of \\"Barry Sings Sinatra, \\" the songs are beautifully arranged and sung in full voice but if you are going to contract a full orchestra and sub contract a recording studio, take advantage of both elements, please!!A longer version of \\"My Favorite Things\\" would have been enjoyable, not that it isn't now; I would have liked more of Rogers and Hammerstein meeting West Side Story.

This Cd is full of what is great about the holidays. From track one to track eleven you are compelled to move and grove to the sounds. Manilow takes the classics and makes them his own.

I read somewhere that the cds have to be completely dust/dirt free in order to burn at all, so I started to clean my cds before burning, making sure that they were clean, and I have had much fewer errors since...I read other reviews and I understand other people's frustration. I have a few cd coasters myself, but it works fine if you make sure that the cd is clean before inserting into the burner.I used multispeed/highspeed cds, but I don't think that is the problem. Cds have to be 'pure' if they are empty and about to be burned. I mean 'pure' from dirt.

I would stay away from this product and just go with Plextor. Study the reviews for the Plextor PlexWriter 12/10/32A CD-RW at cnet.com and save yourself time and hassle.

I have had Windows 98 compatability issues as well at times, but for the most part, everything has worked well considering it is a USB connection.

Excuse me? All I could think was: what kind of promiscuous idiot does that? Throughout the rest of the book, I couldn't shake the feeling of being sorry for the bodyguard, Matt, for ending up with her. I don't think this author writes women well. Her character Matt was okay, but Lili? Even after this beginning, when things could only get better, you never really get a feel for her. And even when the author writes from a woman's point of view, she sounds like a man. Hint: when writing a romance, don't describe the blunt physicality of making love.

The devil was doing his work during the time of the Holocaust, but through grace and goodness we defeated him. At the end of the screenplay, the survivors shout \\"We won!\\" Why?

I started being very meticulous about cleaning it and I'm still having the filter problem.My previous complaints were that it is too loud, even on the Quiet Mist setting, but I've gotten used to that noise (high pitched hum). It also does not put out enough moisture. I leave it in a closed room and it barely gets in the 30-percent range.

I'm sure it won't, but we do some things because it's the RIGHT thing to do, not just to increase the bottom line.

Please release more seasons!!!!","review":"This is a truly superb series, eloquent and beautifully acted. It takes on sensitive issues and deals with them with insight and grace. Kate is a wonderful mother, really the epitome of television mothers, and someone whose serenity I would be delighted to emulate. The only thing wrong is that the studio is being inexplicably slow in releasing more seasons. WHERE ARE THEY? Given the large number of five-star reviews posted here on Amazon, I am astonished that more seasons have not been released.

The storylines are still relevant and evoke such a feeling of warmth, unlike those \\"in your face\\" reality television shows of today. All of the actors, especially Sada Thompson, are top notch.I find myself looking forward to the seasons 3 - 5 release dates so I can purchase them as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Series","review":"This was one of my favorite TV series of the late 1970s, and when I got the DVDs from seasons 1 and 2 recently, I enjoyed so much watching them after all these years. IMHO, it is hard to find top-quality programming of this caliber today. Since this DVD set was released in 2006 and the remaining seasons haven't yet been forthcoming, I am afraid that I'll never be able to have those remaining episodes. However, I truly hope I'm wrong.

I really started missing her and then saw this product. Perfect. Now I didn't really like this show when it was out because I was about her age and it seemed pretty slow paced and boring but as an adult it really is good drama and Kristy is perfect. I never had a kid sister but if I did I would want it to be her. Also, Meredith Baxter came out recently and is also in the cast. What are the chances? I also had a little crush on her too as a kid. Funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gr-r-r-eat !","review":"I watched this show,\\"Family\\" when i was 8 or 9 sometime in the 70's just because I had a crush on Kristy McNichols.Didn't really listen to the story lines, just watched the scenes she was in."},{"rating":"2","title":"when is season three coming out??","review":"I always loved this show.I just can't understand what is taking so long for the rest of the series to go to DVD.What is the hold-up?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Stands The Test Of Time","review":"This is my all-time favorite series and the issues, writing and acting are as fresh and interesting as they were 30 years ago.

I was so happy to see the first two seasons out on DVD, and I haven't regretted my purchase of the set. The quality of both audio and video transfer is beautiful and the show - what an absolute treat! It's every bit as wonderful as I remembered. Intelligent, well-written scripts, fully-developed characters, lovely score, fantastic acting, good stories - what more could you ask? Sure, at times it's dated (not a cell phone in sight, and that Ford Maverick - ouch) but that's part of its charm. I'm eagerly awaiting the release of the remaining seasons, and I admit I'll be a little apprehensive until I hear that they're actually being released - hopefully there won't be bad news similar to that of \\"St. Elsewhere\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful...","review":"I am so enjoying watching the DVD of Family.

I bought it on Amazon and found that 5 of the 6 discs had a strange residue (probably some kind of cleaning solvent from manufacturing) which marred the disc surface and prevented reliable playback.Careful and proper cleaning has made two of the marred discs playable, but the other 3 are a lost cause. There are no scratches or any other mechanical defects, just some faint streaky marks which prevent the DVD player from reading the surface. I have tried to read these on a Toshiba, Panasonic and Sony DVD players -- all with no luck.Be sure to check your set as soon as you receive it. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very shallow, and very much a facade","review":"I find it interesting that the author would make such a wonderful effort to help children, after having murdered parents. I wonder if he sent autographed free copies to the children of the people he murdered.I also find it interesting, that in over 20 years on death row, he was only able to write a handful of \\"children's books\\".That these books would find their way into our public school systems, where this man takes on the role of Martyr and Folk Hero, speaks volumes about our schools.The book is as shallow as the man who wrote it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended For Educators","review":"I am a gang and youth violence expert working with the San Diego County Office of Education, Safe Schools Unit. I have alerted many of our schools about the series of books by Stanley \\"Tookie\\" Williams. I do not recommend the purchase of this book. The content of the books are not appropriate for young people. The images of gangs are not accurate (Too much negative sterotyping). The book is written in a simplistic style that will quickly bore young students. Youth need to critically examine information not be talked down to. You may email me for alternate suggestions for gang prevention books for youth."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's going on?","review":"I purchased and read Winess Chase by RJ Jagger, a Nick Teffinger novel, a few of which I read and stopped because all the cases were very similar. So, I order this book by Jim Michael Hansen, a Bryson Coventry police procedural, and it is the exact same book with names changed. I saw some small notice on Amazons website, that this was previously published as Witness Chase, but under differt author and character name? Whats the deal?

It involves giving each student a card from a jumbled list and sorting themselves into a queue. However, in the photocopiable pages there are two places in the queue that repeat themselves. I only discovered this when it was pointed out to me by some of my students, causing some embarrassment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grab a trash can...","review":"While reading this, I felt physically weak at the stomach, the ramifications of what we, as a country have done and are doing is mind boggling. I feel that everyone should pick this up and read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book, and disturbing","review":"A 'must-read' for people who want to think about where we are and where we may be headed as a nation in the next decade or so. As much as there is a lot of Bush-bashing in this book, I'd like to point out that Clinton does not get a free-ride either. Lots of food for thought.Johnson compared the US to Rome, but missed another ancient democracy/empire with even more disturbing similarities - Athens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recommended by Janeane Garafalo!!","review":"The back cover of this book has a blurb by one of our great political theorists and commentators on current events, Janeane Garafalo!! Don't waste your time. Johnson see conspiracy and greed behind ever every action in US foreign policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling","review":"Not to belabor the point, this is the fourth worst book I have ever read in some 45 years of reading a book a day. _No_ other book has had the distinction of having either a falsehood, greater or lesser, or an negatively emotionally charged irrelevancy on _every_single_page_. It is simply disgusting. Without merit. Foolish beyind compare. Vile and execrable. Trash of the purest kind. I would award negative stars were that possible.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOL LOL LOL How big was that fish?","review":"A very tall tale, that speaks to all the conspiracy buff's in the world. People love this stuff the same way they love scary campfire stories and UFO's. It is good page turner but should definitely go in the historical fiction section of your home library. Personally, I sold mine to a used book dealer after I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Priss","review":"This little priss said on cspan, in so many words, that our solders, fighting for his right to free speech, are doing so because it is the best dead-end job that they can get.

Help to his captive students."},{"rating":"1","title":"insulting to people with a moderate level of intelligence","review":"This is without a doubt the worst piece of social science ever produced.

The history and implications are just fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Indispensable Book for These Times","review":"I couldn't put down \\"Sorrows of Empire,\\" by Chalmers Johnson. It is a contemporary history lesson made meaningful because it finally focuses the backstory on how this once-great country lost its way in endless wars and interventions. It's a spy thriller and reveals facts about our secret actions and interventions on a global scale that will leave you dumbfounded and quivering. It's required reading for every patriotic citizen, politician, leader and regulator who seek to lead the last superpower back to a prosperous, secure global role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I have owned three malamutes in the past, when I lost my last dog misty I switched breeds to standard American Eskimos of whom I lost my boy last summer also due to old age. Now I have Katia a Karelian who is my new dog. I pretty much agree with the information presented here and found some new info too. They are different and people need to know. By the way they have no dog odor though may have to wash bedding as sometimes transfer to that. Also on aggression am glad that was brought up and addressed.

If you're into Digital Hardcore, agressive breakbeats, and a touch a Black Metal, this is the disc for you. Doesn't hold back the blows where lyrical content is concerned either.

The blend of slow and heavy guitar riffs mixed with distorted vocals creates an aggressive atmosphere for a hard rock/experimental fan.This was the first release for DTrash, and they have done so well that this record was picked up by Digital Hardcore Recordings to be distributed, hence why you find it here.To those who enjoy guitarcore digital hardcore, I recommend this to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the other Arco books","review":"I bought this book ... when I received word from my dad that GM was taking referals for Industrial Mechanics and he turned my name in. I needed to quickly brush up on my mathematical and mechanical skills before taking the pre-employment exam. This book really let me down.First - It didn't cover anything about how to do any of the shop mathematics until after you (the reader) had taken the practice exams. NO formulas, equations, NOTHING! And they DID explain it at the end of the exams, but not well enough to understand where you the reader screwed up.Second - There were so many errors I lost count and closed the book never to read it again. Several of their answers were wrong; there were many typos and miscalculations. I don't buy a preparation guide for errors all it will do is confuse you as to if you are correct or forgot how to do arithmetic. I checked several of their calculations with a TI-90 calculator and the answers I received were not the same as theirs. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous folk!","review":"This CD is one of several incredible collections of the most beautiful folk songs on earth.

I'm really not sure what they were thinking when they decided to release this to the public. It is cheap and flies like [...]. When I threw it, it first of all turned over too easy but there was that \\"something\\" that happened in mid flight. It had to be the dumb wiring [...] in the middle of the disc that made it rock or tilt very strangely. It's hard to explain. It was the biggest waste of money. I thought I could take a chance on a disc for a little night golf or when I was caught out on the course near dark then I could use it. It is not worth having. Stick to LED lights and tape. This review is not coming from a professional but someone who is an intermediate to advanced level who plays disc golf a lot (usually minimal 8 times a week)."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for this awful price","review":"Why on earth is this priced so high here? $24.99???

But for anyone else, this book is a waste of money. I was hoping to get specific advice regarding networking with other businesses, best practices for marketing, and what challenges to watch out for. This book barely touches on those. And for anyone hoping to grow their concierge service into a big company, this book fails to talk about how to set yourself up in a way that will facilitate large amounts of growth. I got better advice from books related to starting a small business than from this book. (Entrepeneur's book \\"Start Your Own Business\\" is great.)

She really does love the movie, but here's my big problem: there are NO LESS than three minutes of crappy Disney and Disney-partner advertisements at the beginning, after putting in the DVD, and you are not allowed to fast-forward nor skip through them. You watch about five or six of them, then get to the menu where you get to finally push play, at which point you're treated to three more before the opening credits begin to roll. It's worse than a rented movie from Blockbuster, and at least with those you have the option of skipping through them!Overall, though my 19-month-old daughter loves watching the movie (in short segments), I loathe having to load it up for her because by the time the opening credits are rolling, she's usually lost interest and is playing with something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"this grandmother is pleased!","review":"The dvd was purchased for my granddaughter and she just loves it! the action, color, and animation is pure innocent entertainment value for little eyes and ears.101 Dalmatians (Two-Disc Platinum Edition)"},{"rating":"2","title":"101 Dalmations","review":"I received this DVD in a very timely manner, and am well pleased.

Their mistress has a - shall we say - eccentric \\"friend\\" by the name of Cruella DeVille who takes an immediate fancy to the darling pups - she wants to get a hold of them - and many more - in order to make herself a lovely Dalmation Skin coat. Will Mom and Dad find their precious kids in time to rescue them from this heartless witch? This is a good - though not great - film for children and young-at-heart adults alike. The character of Cruella deVille is alternately funny and frightening. The animation itself was newly 'xeroxed' and done very well; some we see today aren't as good. Pongo and and his family are sure to delight future generations of kids world wide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leonard...You're Way Off","review":"The Review above discusses the inferior remake.

This tank has a regressive \\"quarter-turn\\" design rather than the traditional screw-on cap.d) Turning the fan off tripped my GFI outlet, revealing poor fan motor circuit design.On the lighter side, this unit is an excellent example of great ergonomic design. It has a water containment tray (so you dont need to place one underneath), removable/dishwasher safe water tray, and the fan unit and power cord are modular and completely/easily removable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive!","review":"This humidifier works well and is very quiet for a humidifier. However, here in Texas at least, the filter gets moldy in 3-5 days. So if I kept using it, I'd be spending more than the cost of the humidifer buying filters in less than a month. If there was a filter that could be cleaned and reused, this would be a great humidifier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive filter and no control","review":"Filter is made of the paper and you have to change often, otherwise it melts down. It is a $6.99 each. Even if you buy a cheap machine, it would turn into expensive machine. If you don't change the filter, this machine mists stinky water. I use a filtered water however, I can smell it. Also, I noticed that...When there is no water, it doesn't stop automatically. It will work forever when you don't stop. For example, the fan inside rotated more than 24 hours without water. I didn't know that. After that, I often check if there is water inside or not. I still have 3 more filters.

That's probably because the roaches in DC are exposed to ultrasonic noises everyday. In rooms where there was minimal roach infestation, the devices did a good job. However, the roaches still hang out in the kitchen. As a matter of fact, roaches were even crawling all over the repeller. It wasn't until the exterminator came and laid down some gel did the number of roaches in the kitchen decrease. The exterminator will be coming back in a week to check the progress.However, I will still keep the devices since many have said that they do a great job repelling big critters (like rats, mice, etc).

One of the two I own has something loose in the motor housing that results in a metal to metal bell tone when it's oscillating. Probably something I can fix but at only about three months old, something I shouldn't have to deal with.Bottom line: a good fan with a great look but a little pricey relative to comparable plastic fans (so is everything with high steel content lately).

Well some are; this Western is only liberal to those Natives who agree to the white subjugation of their land - those who refuse are murderous, anti-family transgressors.That's what the script says, and the cheerful narration and dazzlingly bright colours seem to confirm it. Us old Western hands know Wild Bill Wellman, though, director of bleak critiques like 'The Ox-Bow Incident'. The chilling climax, therefore, refuses to simplify the tensions between community, family, and the violence needed to protect them, and can be now seen as foreshadowing the complexities of 'The Searchers'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the River ?","review":"I bought this movie thinking it was a classic.

Maybe this should have been obvious from the price, but I was still very disappointed that I spent $50 on something that was more appropriately made to be a play tool kit for a child than to be used to actually do any kind of repairs.

The seat is much more confining than the one I used to have, and the baby is far less comfortable; he gets all smushed up inside. Also, it sits up v. high in the car instead of tilting back so his head is always hanging forward, despite the head roll, which is utterly ineffective.

Worse, the disc both lacks the purity of production of \\"Simple Gearle\\" and displays in at least two instances another classic second-disc problem: never, but never, let artists into the control room or they will start using production effects (dub, maxi-reverb) on their songs. Singer-soulmates Iris DeMent and Gillian Welch both waited forever to deliver second discs, with great results.

Easy to buy refills for the filters online too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This unit WILL leak all over furniture and rugs","review":"We have had many great humidifiers, both large and small, cheap and expensive, and NONE have been as poorly designed and constructed as this Hamilton Beach model's water tank. The water tank -- no matter how carefully and delicately you fill it and move it about -- WILL eventually (every two months or so) develop dozens of hairline cracks, both at the bottom AND at the top of the water tank. These cracks soon create a water leakage and overflow condition that cannot be stopped (which damages our furniture AND our carpet). But that is not the worst part to these models: While Hamilton Beach is very responsive in sending us out new tanks every time ours begins to leak, EACH AND EVERY new tank ALWAYS begins to leak within the two month period. We baby these water tanks to prevent this, but all to no avail; believe me, this all gets very old, very fast. Stay away from this model, or any other Hamilton Beach unit that uses this same water tank design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere","review":"In need of a humidifier and having read some of the reviews, I decided to purchase the Hamilton Beach Humidifer.The pros: 1. On the \\"quiet\\" setting the water usually lasts 24+ hours before needing a refill.The cons: 1. The machine is far from quiet on any setting.2.It humidifies far less square footage than specified, even on the highest setting.3.It eats filters, which are difficult to find by the way. If you decide to purchase this item, buy several replacement filters.4.The tank cap is difficult to remove and appears to have been designed for the hands of a small child, but a child with the strength of an adult.5. It is relatively expensive. I have a warm mist model that works just as well and requires only a bit more attention to maintain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet,safe,easy to clean","review":"I have been looking for a humidifer for awhile and this one is perfect. First off its a cool mist which for me is great especially when you have kids that could get burned by the steam. Automatic shut-off when moisture level which you set is reached and most of all very easy to clean and quiet with 3 speed settings. I suggest to anybody thats buys a humidifer with a filter, buy alot of filters, ($ for this one) so you can keep using this machine for years to come. I change filters about once or twice a year. It all depends on the type of water you use and the amount of time you use the machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great! Just what I wanted...","review":"After reading all the mixed reviews on this product, I bought it anyway as it seemed the best deal for the amount of space I needed to humidify (1100- 1200 sf). I was pregnant and it was winter and I was getting pretty dehydrated from the drying heat in my apartment. Within days I was sleeping soundly waking refreshed and no longer having headaches. I would have given this 5 stars but it's the first I bought and I cannot make any comparisons.I am not sure what the reviewers that reviewed this product badly expected, having to refill it often just means that it is putting a lot of moisture into the air, the noise is not overwhelming and is similar to any white noise often used to put and keep kids asleep, I had no problem refilling it, my 2 year-old even liked to help, finally if you turn the filters faithfully once a week 2-3 filters should last the season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well but fragile","review":"Product works well. Fairly quiet as far as humidifiers go. Design of the tank is poor. You must turn it upside down to fill. It does not stand on its own when upside down so it's awkward to fill. Tank developed cracks after 3 months because of where he pressure points are during fill up. Filters are expensive so total cost to operate should be calculated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one I've found so far","review":"I've been through a million humidifiers and this is the best so far. Although you will have to fill it every day or two if you live in the desert (as I do), it lasts longer than the others and the filters seem to work for a long time too. I wish all of these humidifers were easier to fill, but this one is pretty typical and the cap or whatever you'd call it has an easy grip handle. Another bonus, the filters are cheap compared to other models that I've had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works good if you can open the water reservoir!","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS HUMIDIFIER!

Then, after only a couple of weeks, we noticed that we didn't have to add any water into the container anymore -- the water level in the container remained constant. In other words, it was not humidifying the air. We followed the instructions completely, but it just didn't work.One additional problem is the filter.

I can't understand why the previous reviewer gave this CD a rating of 4 stars. This is one of Tolliver's (and jazz's) masterpieces. It is a live recording from 1972. On another occasion, Tolliver recorded with another quartet with Stanley Cowell on piano, and some critics prefer that quartet. However, this quartet is the equal of that one. I think John Hicks did a masterful job of piano playing here. Hicks equalled Charles in energy. The bass playing of Reggie Workman(who was John Coltrane's bassist) is equally smoldering. Drummer Alvin Queen is a perfect match for the other 3.By the way, Alvin and Charles Tolliver still are active in jazz to this date, and continue to make contributions to the jazz lexicon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"The sound from this CD is more of a 'traditional jazz' feel rather than the usual bossa nova stuff that is coming out of Brazil these days, more upbeat and played at a slightly quicker pace.

The sound seemed like it was recorded using a cell phone microphone, tinny and variable in terms of pickup. This is my absolute favorite opera, and was the first opera that I purcased on Blu ray. I would have put up with a lot just to be able to watch it in HD. Unfortunately, even the video quality was not great.

This film is more a prequel than a sequel to the first, with what should have been the finale of the first film rather awkwardly tacked on to the last 10 minutes. Though some of the continuity from the first to the second is really really off, as well as the general feel of the film. While the first movie was all about goofy entertaining action this movie tries to make you genuinely care about the relationship of the two main characters and it really doesn't succeed as you already know them from less serious material, resulting in a jarring change of tone. Poorly paced and with not half the energy and action of the first film I'd say one might be able to enjoy this if they watched it before the first, stopped when the transition from prequel-to-end-of-first-film starts (about 15 minutes before the end) then watched the first movie and finally finished this.

It's amazing! I started trying a few things out immediately and can not beleive how easy this is to do!

It took three weeks to get it, but the seller apologized for the delay. I'm happy and would recommend the product and seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice knife","review":"This knife is the purple version of the classic red pocket knife, we all know and love. Victorinox makes a tidy, small, but mighty knife which is durable and useful, especially the small scissors tool, which cuts surprisingly tough materials. I have owned a Victorinox for 25 years, and it performs well, even after many years of service. This knife is definitely a thumbs-up product. If you look around the internet, you can find them in fun, unusual colors, and the company makes replacement sides (called \\"scales\\") if the knife body becomes damaged or you wish to change colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"use daily","review":"This little knife was a gift to me. At first I thought, what the heck am I going to do with this little thing? Now, it is one of the first things I pick up every morning before work. The knife I use frequently. The file screw driver blade I use often. The scissors I use to trim my moustache. The toothpick is the item I use the most. If I would lose this I would purchase another today. The tweezers I thought were useless.........until I had a small metal splinter in my finger I could not pick it out with my fat fingers. I'm sold. Buy this knife, you will not regret it. Ask McGiver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swiss Army Classic Pocket Knife","review":"I think this is the best of the bunch of small pocket knives you can carry. The sissors cut most anything from paper to fingernails to small wires quite well and the knife blade can be kept very sharp. The fingernail file is not too useful except as a small screwdriver. The removable tweezers and pick work well also. It comes with a small key ring which barely can hold one key, but you really need a small chain to keep it with several keys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small is beutiful","review":"This is the smallest Victorinox knife with a scissors, single pen knife blade, and a combination screw driver nail file. It is small enough to carry in your pants pocket without wearing a hole in it. The blade is sharp and the screw driver will work in both slotted and Phillips head screws. The tooth pick and tweezers are functional and seem to be included with every one of the better Victorinox knives. I paid over $20 for one like it at a hardware store many years ago. This one was a steal at under $14."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small and exquisite","review":"You can take it to anywhere because it's so small and portable ,you have a lot of chance to use it.what's more,black is a cool colour ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Pocket Knife","review":"Everyone should have this knife in his pocket or her purse; another one on his / her keychain!1) The blade is very sharp.2) The scissors is vey functional.

It has gone in and out of my pocket a million times, dropped, thrown, and downright abused. While the outer housing is scuffed, gouged and faded, there are no cracks and the entire knife functions perfectly. Victorinox uses great steel on every knife they make and there isn't a trace of rust or chips in the cutting surface. The blades hold their edges quite well and only need sharpening every few years as is the case with any metal knife. This knife is made in Switzerland and is a great testament to legendary Swiss quality.I love Victorinox products. They are affordable, functional and bulletproof. I would easily classify this knife as one of the best products I have ever owned. I can't imagine not having it handy on my keychain.Note: The scissors are absolutely superb for cutting your fingernails!"},{"rating":"2","title":"keen replacement","review":"I had a silver dress pocket knife but after it sliding out of my pocket too many times it finally was lost, and this fits the bill just fine for me at a much lower price."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE VENDOR","review":"Gave good quality product for the price.

They are great knives to have on a keychain and I can't tell you how many times it has come in handy. Especially the scissors. My only complaint is that Victorinox REALLY needs to start putting the toothpick and tweezers on the end with the ring!! I've lost 3 toothpicks cuz they've fallen out when hanging from my keyring. I know this is a small complaint but that simple little change would make this knife perfect! And it really can't be that hard to do! I'm surprised they haven't done it yet. Other than that I've had no problems with any of the ones I've had over the years. I use them until they wear out and the plastic sides fall off! I'll continue to buy them and hope that Victorinox with listen up!

Every so often I just lose one. But like socks, I use this knife daily. Not as a knife proper, but to pick on things, open this or that, fasten or tighten a screw. I finally learned not to use my teeth to rip on packages and find this knife in my pocket instead. The small jeans pocket. This should be a standard issue, everybody should have one and the TSA should lay off. Nobody is going to highjack a plane with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy little tool","review":"I love these little swiss army knives. I always keep one on my key fob.

Can't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pocket Knife","review":"I am use this little guy all the time. It's small enough so that it will easily go on your key-chain.

Go figure.The vendor was great, never had to contact them. Highly recommended!Z."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic for a reason","review":"Each year, I give these little classic knives as gifts to an assortment of people. With the restrictions on knives on aircraft now, they are always appreciated. Since owning and using these on a daily basis for many years, I have yet to have one break or be problematic. I do oil the hinges every year or so at least, more when the knife is used often. It's the most basic knife without bells and whistles and I love it. They are offered in a wide variety of colors and patterns and usually can be found for $10 or less. The Victorinox Swiss Army Classic Pocket Knife is the best in it's class and at the low cost, it's not heartbreaking when one is lost. It's also nice to have a couple on hand in the gift box for the times when someone compliments mine -- I give it away and know that I have a replacement at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift item!","review":"I gave a few of these little pocket knives to co-workers as gifts.

The file is used the most by me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Wouldn't Be Without It","review":"This knife is a \\"must have\\" item in my pocket ever day. I use mine every day, and I do mean every day. Because of it's size some will think it is a joke, but that is only until they have had one for a while. The knife blade is very sharp out of the box. The toothpick and tweezers are very handy to have, and the screwdriver is beyond handy. Because of the size of the scredriver tip, it can almost always be used in common phillips tip screws as well as standard slot screws. It is true that this knife is way too easy to lose. I have owned probably upwards of 10 of them. I have also given out 10 or more as presents they are always appreciated. Get one, and keep it with you at all times. You will only be dissappointed if you forget to put it in checked luggage when you go to the airport as did I. The Will Rogers World Airport Security lady liked getting the gift. It was that or give it to TSA and I wasn't going to do that. A great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Knife for a Cub Scout!","review":"I bought this knife for my son who is a Cub Scout.

We got screwed. Careful people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just right for the smallest jobs.","review":"I recently forgot to take my beloved pocketknife out of my pocket before visiting the Statue of Liberty and had to surrender it before boarding the ferry boat. Going for a while without my favorite knife was getting to me and I simply could not find a small replacement with the features I wanted most--until I found this little gem. It has a small blade, screwdriver/nail file, scissors (wonderful!!!) a toothpick and tiny tweezers. This very slim and compact package is just right for my pocket and it not noticible at all. Larger pocket knives tend to stick out and causing wearing issues on my slacks, but not this little guy. It's really a perfect gift too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic at a great price...","review":"This is a good starter Swiss Army knife.

Price varies depending on color and emblem desired. These factors are not important to me so I chose the one with the lowest price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Woman Needs This in Her Purse","review":"Regardless of what color you choose, a Swiss Army knife comes in handy for everything. I can echo each reviewer on this item and tell you how many times I've had to use it or a funny story on how grateful I was to have it. Just like a woman's wallet, keys and emergency items or even lipstick, this knife is a must in every woman's bag!! I had one for years growing up and when I had to leave on an international flight, I was asked to throw it out. I was crushed and never replaced it until recently. It could have saved me headaches!! Seriously, get this knife!! Just don't bring it with you to the airport ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleek and Sharp","review":"I carry either a SOG Aegis or Spyderco Tenacious everyday and love them. However, they are rather large to pull out in a restaraunt or crowded place. So I purchased the Classic SD as a non threatening alternative and I'm glad I did. Perhaps now when I'm out to dinner with my wife and want to cut a string off my shirt I won't recieve my wife's wrath. The gentleman's knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really well made and great looking","review":"Very crisply made. The metal and finish is much better than cheaper small knives I've bought. I was actually surprised at the difference in the comparative quality. The translucent shell is also very aesthetic. And the steel seems good quality, well machined, and sufficiently sharp. I highly recommend for a small tuck-away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brought another one","review":"I have a couple of these and wanted another one for my car and office desk. It holds an edge well -- works well as a pistachio opener, pulling staples, and upon occasion I use the other tools. The vendor was a little delayed with shipping, but included an extra toothpick - still a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite","review":"I have 5 SAKs, and the classic has always been my favorite. When I wake up in the morning it's on my bedside table and goes in my pocket as soon as I get my pants on. The blade is perfect for opening letters and packages and is small enough and sturdy enough to open everything I've used it on without damaging the contents or me. The nail file and cleaner is a must have for a father with youngsters. The remains of mudpies under my nails does not impress my wife. The tweezers are perfect for splinters, and the scissors, are amazingly effective for something so small. The first time I took them after a heavy zip tie I was sure they would break, but they got the job done and still do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of tiny Swiss Army Knife.","review":"It wasn't clear (to me) that this was a miniature knife.

Maybe could give to my 3 year old grandson but I don't think his fingers are strong enough to pull out attachments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described.","review":"I already own the little knife that I just received, only with a red handle. I paid $8.00 for it last year. But the new white one I just received, that I paid $15.95 for, was described as having six stainless steel tools, instead of just four like my $8.00 one.The item description is wrong. The white model that I just received only has four stainless steel tools, instead of six, and there is no screw driver end on the tip of the nail file.The item description of the one I purchased is at:http://www.amazon.com/Victorinox-Swiss-Classic-Pocket-Knife/dp/B00004YVB2/ref=cm_rdp_productThe review I made is lumped in with others that have a different description."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact, Very Useful and Must have","review":"One of the very useful products I bought here.

They also are small enough to not bulk up your pocket."},{"rating":"2","title":"What, no saw blade?","review":"Kidding, I've had the Classic SD for about 2 weeks now and am in love with it. I bought it as a set along with the larger Tinker. All tools function well. My favorite is the toothpick. The fingernale file comes in at a close second. the little blade is sharp and workes well for its size. This would be a usefull peice to add to a first aid kit, but this one travels in my pocket as my mini EDC. Funny how quickly a small multi tool can become indespensible. I rotate all my other blades, but this one is my constant companion. Now if only they would add a corkscrew."},{"rating":"2","title":"best knife you will ever own!","review":"this is so far the best knife i have owned in my entire life. this is a great knife to go camping or fishing with. this is also an awesome knife for EDC and self defense. i feel prepared and safe with this knife in my pocket.my favorite thing about is that it's made in Switzerland. this is the best knife you will ever own!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these knives","review":"I probably use this little knife a half-dozen times per day.

I open packages, scrape price tags off glass, clean file and trim my nails on a whim, turn tiny screws, you name it. It's so useful because it is well made and I always have it with me on my key ring. After years of use it still functioned perfectly. Unfortunately my key ring broke, not the one this has but my larger d ring one and I lost my trusty knife. I bought this as a replacement that same day because I didn't want to be without it! This one is just as great as my old one."},{"rating":"2","title":"WMD","review":"I have been carrying one of these as long as I can remember, at least 20 years. It is the most usefult single thing I have. My wife always raises an eyebrow when I say that. I call it my WMD (Weapon of Minimal Destruction).This is the Victorinox version. There is also a version made by Wenger. As I understand it, Victorinox and Wenger are at odds about who is the \\"original\\" swiss army knife. I don't care who is right about that, but I think the Victorinox version of the knife is nicer. It's a bit thinner, operates more smoothly, and is finished a little nicer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little knife","review":"There is nothing fancy about this Victorinox knife except maybe the translucent color. It contains the tools you'd expect, and they work as well as you'd expect for this brand. For some reason mine arrived a bit scuffed; it almost looked refurbished. But it wasn't enough to make me mad. This is my third or fourth one of this make and model (thanks to TSA for relieving me of the others ... I keep it on my keychain, and it's hard to remember to remove it when preparing for a flight), except my previous ones were not translucent. I am happy with it. I'd buy another if I lost this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality","review":"You can't go wrong with this little guy!

Blades seem to stay sharp forever and all love the scissors for coupon cutting etc. Easy to clean and maintain as always.

Service, Quality, Style, Features, and Dependability make this little knife one big gift for anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product","review":"This little gem is so perfect to go on your keys. The one I bought was the hot pink one. With this little knife attached to my keys, I can find my keys anywhere in my purse! I have used the scissors over and over again, they are very sharp, yet compact. I have not had need for the file or the toothpick yet, but the little knife is also very sharp and useful. I have used the tweezers, and I love that they found a way to squeeze them in the side of the knife.

It's true that there are lots of gadgets on each Swiss Army Knife, but it's also true that none of the gadgets work well. I've never had a Swiss Army Knife that held an edge for a considerable amount of time. The toothpick is too large, only good for someone like Madonna with that huge gap between her teeth. The scissors are so tiny they become unusable. And, have you ever tried to open a bottle of wine with the corkscrew? Good in an emergency, I suppose.I prefer Gerber or Leathermen multi-tools to the classic Swiss Army Knives. It's time to move away from these relics. When's the last time the Swiss Army were successful in battle, anyhown? I doubt they'd win a war with this antiquated knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but not perfect","review":"I thought I had lost the Victorinox Swiss Army Classic pocket knife I keep on my keyring. I ordered this one because I liked the finish on it. It is everything advertised. Unlike the plastic sided Classic pocket knives, these do not come with a pair of tweezers and a plastic toothpick in the end which I find very useful. I eventually located the lost little red Victorinox and put it back on my keychain. I'm giving this one for a Christmas gift because it's still a great pocket knife. Just read carefully and don't assume all Classic pocket knives are made the same. This is my error, not Victorinox, but I was disappointed they are all not made the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small... too small","review":"I bought this item expecting something about the size of a small water bottle, but this is ridiculous!

It is no larger than a toothpick - one could have purchased it out of a bubble gum machine for a dollar and I like a fool paid eight dollars for it - what a jip!!! Anyhow, I have it in my car - I might need it someday. I do not want to say anything negative but want to forwarn my buyers out there if you want a flimsey knife as big as a toothpick then this knife is for you. However, I think I wasted eight dollars on the only item I have ever purchased from Amazon that I did not care for and I think I had the wool pulled over my eyes.

Before an airline trip this summer, I mailed some personal items along with a couple of knives to myself at the destination address, except the post office took it upon themselves to confiscate my package. Undeterred, I am purchasing another of these handy little knives. Good for cutting off a cuticle or broken fingernail, price tag of an item you want to use right away, or even using the toothpick; this little knife is handy for tiny tasks and holds up well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good little knife","review":"I've carried one of these for years. Just bought this one to replace one I lost. These are high quality, small and easy to carry. I use everything on it. The scissors come in particularly handy.

I lose them occasionally and have them taken away from me by airport security when I forget to pack them, which is why I had to buy a new one now, but I am never without one. I use every piece of it including the tweezers...well not so much the toothpick but still it's part of the whole Swiss army knife thing. Perfect size and perfectly useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive and Incredibly Useful","review":"Although this pocket knife isn't indestructibly built like the much larger multi-tools, its price and convenience make it a daily pocket item. It's incredibly small but manages to pack in a practical assortment of tools that I find myself using regularly. In fact, I can't think of a day when I don't at least use the knife to open a package or letter. But I also use the scissors for small cutting jobs and, combined with the file, nasty hangnails. I even pull out the tweezers now and then for a splinter. And although I thought it'd be nasty reusing a plastic toothpick, I do actually use it in a pinch (and let's face it, who has toothpicks or floss around when you've eaten that jumbo bag of beef jerky or corn nuts?).What's the best part? When (not if) I accidentally bring it to the airport, having it confiscated only sets me back a small amount. I usually turn around and order one as I wait for the flight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy keychain knife","review":"I had never had a pocket knife before, but I was constantly finding myself in need of a nail file or something to cut a tag with, etc... This knife is perfect. It's very small, about 2.25 inches long, just over .5 inches wide at the largest point, and about .5 inches deep. So, it's perfect for a keychain. I got this in November, and it's now January. I use it all the time. The tweezers are amazing for sewing jobs. I have also used them in bathrooms when I see I missed an eyebrow hair, etc... This knife is perfect for a woman who just wants something small around for odds and ends. It is so worth the 10 dollar price tag. You will not regret the purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good knife, but not the one I ordered","review":"Although it came in a plastic bag in a bubble wrap envelope, the knife itself was the same high quality knife that I expected from Victorinox.

The two halves of the scissor bind and only open partially unless you manually assist it each stroke. So I ordered a new one. It arrived, incorrect style, quickly corrected by Amazon customer service. But the correct knife arrived and was a continued quality disappointment. The scissor feature on the new one is as bad as the old one. I have many Swiss Army knives and have previously believed their quality and customer service were first rate. I contacted SA and received a response stating they would look into my quality concern. A couple weeks went by and they replied that their scissor spring had not changed. Period. Hardly addresses the poor performance I reported to them. And the spring was never the problem anyway. The two cutting faces of the scissor are too tight.Bottom line ... Poor or deteriorating product quality and sadly poor customer service to match."},{"rating":"1","title":"too small.....","review":"I purchased this for my 13 yr old son and it is so small he can barely open up the parts.

Both previous knives got lost. Between 1st and and 2nd ones I've tried a cheap Chinese knock-off - thrown it away myself.This knife is the best in its category, though, I must say, Swiss Army products carry reputation that generally exceeds their quality.

The craftsmanship of the entire knife is superb, with smooth opening action between the blade, file, and scissors. The scales are transparent green which gives this knife a really cool appeal. The toothpick and and tweezers are also easily accessible however, they may require you to have atleast a little bit of fingernail to get them out. It comes with a keychain ring which is how I have chosen to carry the knife. Its small size and light weight allow the knife to be carried around unnoticed. I have just recieved this knife from Amazon(in timely fashion) so I haven't had a chance to use it just yet but, I can tell it will have countless uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But...","review":"Excellent materials and quality production. The only thing it didn't have was the tweezers and tooth pick. Yes, the tooth pick is not very important/useful, but the tweezers have come in handy many times.

I really do love the light weight/solid material making this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swiss Army Classic is Classic","review":"Just a pleasure to gift someone with the same brand of my first pocketknife.Call it nostalgic but it's still a nice thing to be able to pass on a tradition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little pocket tool","review":"My father gave me a knife like this about 10 years ago. It held up great and was used very often. However the spring in the little scissors finally snapped one day and I needed to replace it.

That other review gave this knife 2 stars, which I think is rather unfair. True, it's pretty small, but it is definetely well made, and it is useful for doing little jobs, like slicing cheese or whittling a s'mores stick.

Pictorally, it is easily rated as a 10. It's a mini-book measuring only about 5\\" x 5\\" and every couple of pages begins with a new artifact or item. Well done, again with excellent photographs. This is not an in-depth study of the Celts, but an excellent overview for those with a beginning interest in what their culture was composed of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, If You need a Coffee Table Book; albeit a tiny one","review":"This book is...well...tiny! Don't let the designation \\"Hardcover\\" fool you, it is miniscule. While the pictures are nice enough, there is no real depth to the information given. Only one page (about 3\\" x 4\\") per picture, so what can you expect. Also, for many of the pictures, the sources are either not given, or incorrect as I found out by looking the same pictures up in more extensive works. This book is fine if you want a very tiny coffee table book, but don't expect much in the way of scholarly, historical enlightenment from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celtic symbols and their significance","review":"When I first saw this book, my first reaction was that such a small book certainly couldn't contain any useful information whatsoever. The book is a mere 5\\" by 5\\" by 76 pages (if I counted correctly).However, after opening it up, I found that it is absolutely masterful in what it does. Most pages contain a picture of a symbol, and the accompanying text explains the significance that the Celtic peoples assigned to a specific symbol. Among the symbols covered are the triple head, the ram, the stag, heads and head hunting, and much more. As an introduction to Celtic symbols, this book probably has no peer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but short","review":"It was great, and just as described.

This tent is huge, my 2 and 4 yr olds had plenty of room to run around and play. We easily fit 2 queen sized air mattresses and i think you could fit a 3rd if necessary. I love the fact I can stand up straight (I'm 6'2).We had rain on 2 nights and both times we got wet. During moderate rain water seeped right through the walls and during a downpour the 2nd night, the water dripped right through the seal over the cool-air port. We used 5 towels to wipe it up and moved the mattresses into the middle to sleep. It wasn't too bad considering how hard it was raining, but it was definitely annoying. The floor held up great and not a droplet got in through the floor. The little covered area over the door is great to store folded chairs or firewood.I still give it 4 stars, as we stayed mostly dry and the easy set-up and huge interior are great bonuses and I have yet to meet a tent that really is completely water-proof."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colour Haze - 'Los Sounds des Krauts' (Electrohash Records) 4 1/2 stars","review":"Very well produced,written and played heavy/stoner psychedila from this German power-house trio.

Even with proper use, it may break sooner than expected.The sound is DEFINITELY heavy on the bass, which makes my music sound great. However, as the previous reviewer said, it makes commentators on talk radio sound a little funny, though still very understandable. The sounds fills my small bedroom.

It bubbles and gurgles a little, but it's very quiet.I have not had to clean it yet, but I checked it out before I filled it, and it looks very simple. I am very happy with this unit's performance.

Besides that, it worked well for me for one or two winters when I was using very purified water. I moved and started filling it with plain tap water, and shortly after that it broke.

Now each to his own, I guess, but anyone who like me thought that the poked out tongue on the cover meant that the this was going to be a hindi version of 'radio yerevan' rock is going to be as wildy disappointed as I was. There's no point in trying to assess each track because essentially, no, literally, they are all the same - two cds of devout religious chanting is what you are about to buy. You have been warned.

Unfortunately, I was rolling my eyes before I'd even finished reading the first page! What absolute rubbish. The author did show some talent in telling a story, but I didn't care about the characters, and the dialogue was way too modern for a 19th century tale. I also feel that excessive, porn-style sex was used to keep the audience interested, rather than to enhance the relationship (what relationship?) between the main characters.

I know it isn't my usb data-fax-voice modem because when I plug that directly into a wall jack it works fantastic. But doing that is not an ideal option for me.I don't fax very often so I guess I'll have to make do.

Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work Well","review":"They may be good in theory, but they didn't work in practice. The idea is that the systems sends telephone signals over your home wiring. Unfortunately, that means it gets interference from everything in your house that's plugged in. Microwaves, TVs, lights, computers, clocks, vacuums, washing machines, stereos, you name it, it will kick up some interference. I found that the remote unit would have a barely audible signal on about half the plugs I tried, and it wouldn't work at all on the other half.

Robyn puts some holds on his lyrical obscurities to make it a little more graspable(sic) to the common head.

These guys are in thier 50's so it cannot be expected that they would play with such fever as they did.It's like a reunion that sounds like Hitchcock more than SB."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neo or retro?","review":"The psychedelia-lite of this album, with proudly raspy, utterly English vocals, emphatically enigmatic lyrics and duelling guitars, calls to mind nothing so much as the mid-90's pilferings of Britpop. But of course the grave that the likes of Elastica were robbing was that of great defunct bands like...The Soft Boys. Revisiting these revisitations seems strangely appropriate for the ultra-arch Hithcock and pals, and they don't really bother with the authenticity worries that their long hiatus might engender, but get right down to the business of putting together stretched-out poppy/punky/new wave guitar tunes with a surprisingly strong backbeat. There are a few clunkers, but generally it's a joy to listen to, and if some of the songs sound like they're made by a convention of Andy Partridge, Mick Jagger, and Ray Davies, well, you could do a lot worse. You can almost hear Blur's Damon Albarn taking notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye catching Style","review":"This watch gleams in the sun beautifully, but the styling on the face makes it elegant not gaudy.

More likely, he made the footsteps that Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and Mother Theresa later walked in. This is a book on politics, power, and pacifism.

We use the humidifier all day and night in our very dry apartment which is only 500 square feet, and after even 1 week I start smelling the moldy smell. This is despite cleaning the tank and tray every 2 days (they recommend once a week) and turning the filter over every day. And you have to keep all the windows and doors closed, or it won't work at all. That makes for very stagnant air quality. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hamilton Beach Filter- WASTE OF MONEY!","review":"I can't believe that Amazon actually requested that I write a review for this item as THESE ARE THE ABSOLUTE WORST FILTERS and the actual TRUE AIR unit was a COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY. You are lucky to get 2 WEEKS out of each filter before it falls apart. The unit never gets up to the desired humidity (and all I ask for is 50%). The description says to change the water once a month- We have to refill the thing TWICE EACH DAY. We are currently looking for another unit (different manufacturer, of course)I suggest you also find another unit before you spend another dime on these filters!!!! also please note that a previous reviewer said she/he purchased 3 filters to alternate- THESE ARE DISPOSABLE AND ARE NOT MEANT TO BE DRIED OUT AND REUSED!... unless you are trying to kill yourself or someone you \\"love\\" with Legionaires Disease..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad filter","review":"I got my humidifier a week ago.

Quiet and easy to look after, I have not had any problems in two seasons of use.If you have hard water, the filter will only last about 3 weeks. I have found that I can rejuvenate them overnight by soaking them in dilute hydrochloric acid, but you need to know what you are doing with powerful acids. As an alternative, you can probably get more life out of the filters with conventional kettle defurring products such as vinegar, but I haven't tried them.Keeping up the humidity in winter allows a lower comfortable temperature. Helps if you have dry skin and is essential if you have delicate wooden things like a classical guitar. Well worth the trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice perfprmer","review":"The humidifier i have is delightful, you can wash the parts in the dishwasher when they need cleaning and the filter lasts quite a while if you turn it over every week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short-lived","review":"The filter lasts for about two weeks, after which it turns completely useless: it stops soaking up water more than two inches from the bottom (the rest of it remaining dry as the Sahara desert), thereby rendering the humidifier totally useless at any speed.

The water absorbs into the filter so it does get moldy, but that's the nature of the design. I mainly used it in the hallway between two rooms with the doors of the rooms open, and the humidity reading would always stay around 25% even when on high and I set it to go to 45%, but it could never get there. The humidifier that this filter fits into is just not that powerful unfortunately. The filters are what they are, it is the humidifier itself that can only handle small to medium sized rooms. The high setting on the Hamilton Beach unit is very loud. I recently lost this unit in a house fire and I wouldn't buy it again. I'd go for either a filterless system or a unit that can handle larger rooms even if they cost more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series","review":"I have purchased a lot of the yogafit cd's and this slow flow series is the best!

If they had toned down the use of that annoying electric guitar and used more keyboards and the like it could have been astounding.

If he is complaining about something, we'd better listen.I'll give you a little taste of this book. These are some of the lies that we are told by our media:1.

More interesting than you might imagine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny...","review":"Gehry may be an architect who happens to be behind designs as unique as Gehry himself, but a very approachable, likeable and funny dude. This is a very entertaining production which not only will give you a glimpse of one of the finest architect's of the century and his approach to his designs and life but it will entertain you every second of the DVD with humour since it comes from no other genius other than the master director, Sydney Pollack. Entertaining, educational, funny production which is a good representation of Gehry himself. Bravo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight into Gehry's approach to design","review":"This documentary is very a entertaining and insightful record of the way that Frank Gehry works. Gehry comes over as a very modest person although his work is just the opposite. I was fascinated with his approach which is more that of an artist than of an architect. I was a student of the late Louis I Kahn and his approach to the design process was very much deeper and philosophically driven than is Gehry's. The documentary, however, gives a frank and clear view of his design approach and any architect who is remotely interested in Gehry's architecture should have this DVD in his bookshelf. Gehry is, no doubt, one of the most influential yet controversial architects of our time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A letdown","review":"It is very hard for me to like this film after seeing My Architect. Pollock is in love with Gehry's work, which is fine, but it does not a good documentary make. In fact, I'm troubled that the only Gehry detractor in the film is a bald and effeminate architecture critic unable to articulate that as outrageous and weird Gehery's buildings are, many thoughtful people find them merely silly. Some years after Gehry's death maybe, just maybe, will his estranged son create a more robust documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"User Friendly Multicultural Magical Guide","review":"With so many anthropological books using a scholarly approach to understanding magical traditions of various cultures Judika Illes \\"Earth Mother Magic\\" is a welcomed addition for the practioner and novice alike.

So I use fans all year long. I know many Winter \\"Closet Fan Owners\\" who do the same.This one is a super air mover and great for the Winter us. It moves air, without too much noise and it small enough to put there where you need them. In Summer, again, even with air conditioning, I use them to direct the air flow.

I was not disappointed, and I can honestly say I got my money's worth. I mainly use it to circulate the air in my children's room when they take a nap in the afternoon. Their room faces the west, and in the summer it can get warm, but with the fan on (even on the lowest setting), it is cool enough and my girls can sleep all right, and I need that so I can get a rest too! I also like the small size of the fan, because there is no way I can have a big bulky fan in our small apartment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made to last","review":"I live in Florida. Fan motors tend to rust and degrade quickly down here. I bought this fan because it has a lifetime warranty. Although the structure of the fan and its switch is made out of plastic, the motor looks like it is much higher quality then other fans of it size.

This movie is really great. Unlike a lot of the other beat movies that have come out and will come out, this film actually challenges the myths and legends of Kerouac, Cassady and company. And isn't that really the best way to pay tribute?Amy Ryan is amazing as Carolyn Cassady. Glenn Fitzgerald brings Kerouac to life. But it's Tate Donovan who blows away here, creating an unforgettable portrait of a man trapped by his ego desires.The music is surprising and hip. The look and style of the movie is both classic and fresh. I was really surprised by this one. Best biopic I've seen in long time. But it doesn't even feel like a biopic.

People on various occasions get an urge to take a long unpaid break from work/city/chaos and see the world in its raw form. Most of them know the benefits of such exercise but rarely do they act of this urge.This book serves as a kick in the a** that can get you motivated to do something about your desire to travel.I haven't yet acted on it, but nevertheless, a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Anyone Planning a Sabbatical","review":"This book is a must read for anyone planning a sabbatical. We've used this with a number of clients wanting to take some extended time off. This book will help you plan out your request, devise a budget and make your sabbatical a reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I was interviewed by the authors back in 1994/95 as they were writing this book. When the book was published, I was blown away at what a great job they did accumulating and organizing the information. If you are dreaming about taking some extended time off, buy this book and you'll see how easy it is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Turn your living room into a jazz club","review":"Here's a great great album full of infectious melodies and toe-tapping rhythms. Coleman and Webster were considered old-timers when they recorded this live session in 1967. Maybe so, but boy do they swing! Put this one in the CD player, dim the lights, pour a drink and you'll feel like you're in a great little jazz club."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This was a Mother's Day gift for my Mother, the foutain came without tubing. She called and Yankee promised to send the tubing, instead another fountain without tubing was sent. It has been almost a month and the fountain still does not work. I am very dispointed especially since a gift should only require the effort of putting it together not waiting for missing parts. I delayed the review hoping the correct tubing would come."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I received this espresso maker as a gift and initially was very pleased. However, after using it for two months the screw that holds the silicon knob in place on the lid started falling out. There are no threads holding the screw in so every time I use the espresso maker and wash it the knob comes off and I have to fish out the little screw inside the pot. It does make great espresso, but it's not worth the aggravation so I am currently shopping for another stovetop espresso maker. I don't know if this is a common problem for this type of espresso maker or just this particular brand. At any rate, I won't buy another Primula."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beats a filter coffee maker and instant coffee","review":"A step up from the aluminum product, but I had expected more stainless steel. Not perfect craftsmanship, but still produces decent tasting coffee (much better than a filter coffee maker or, yuck, instant coffee - can you really call it that?). I still use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This wooden car FLIES","review":"I like these cars a lot. The wheels spin smoothly, and even on carpet, you can propel these cars a fair distance before they stop.Additionally, you'll probably find that these cars interoperate just fine with many of the tracks and playsets made for other cars. These cars' widths are comparable to the cars that you would typically use in those structures. The only issue you might have is if the track has a low clearance. These cars are a bit on the tall side.Note: I bought these cars as a Christmas gift for my two year old son. The packaging's recommended minimum age is 3. However, I intended to play with these cars with my son, so I didn't balk too much at that. I'm glad I bought them. We've both had a lot of fun with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cars do no fit the wood track!","review":"I purchased the cars along with the race track, they were offered as a recommendation by Amazon.

If you need gaft(stage tape), sometihng that will not leave a residue on your stage and cables then this is not it. This also has a gloss finish on it instead of a flat black so it will give off a reflection when under light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought this would be a less expensive gaf tape.. I was wrong","review":"I purchased this product to secure cords on the floor of events, as I do with gaffer's tape. Because I was rushing the shipment and had other expenses I thought I could save a few $$$ since this tape was less costly than the 4\\" black gaffer's tape; they looked like they served the same purpose and both had a cloth base.What I found is that this tape is glossy/shiny, and not matt like gaffer's is. This was a good thing in the environment where I wanted to draw attention to it on the floor.. wouldn't be so great if I wanted it to be discrete.My bigger dissatisfaction is that it does not tear nearly as clean as gaffer's tape does, and splits vertically up the run of the tape way more easily than gaffer's, making it a PIA when putting it down.I'd recommend spending the few extra $$ to get the gaffer's if it's in the budget."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can never be too richly orchestrated or too thin","review":"Check out the marimba and the mellotron and the pizzacato strings in CHILD KILLERS. Check out the electric piano in COMING IN FROM THE COLD. Check out Emma's abrupt segue into the brief bridge of COMING IN. Check out the full-tilt orchestral bombast in IS THIS A PLAN. Check out Emma's creepy filtered delivery of \\"some cold comfort will tell us what's true\\" in NEVER LOOK AT THE SUN. NEVER LOOK also includes a brief weird bridge in which the sextuple time is slowed down so that you can fully savor Emma's scrumptious catatonia. There's 1 dud track: a dreary waltz called FAMOUS. But all the other tracks are dreary in the best sense of the word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love and Hate","review":"John Peel promoted The Delgardos heavily, and with reason - they live up to the \\"unique\\" label. You can hear the influences, from Jeff Lynne (they did a killer cover of Mr Blue Sky) to the dourest moments of The Smiths, but they sound unlike any band I know recording today. It's hard to say why, but these mightily depressing tunes are great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"the song","review":"The Delgados. Once you listen to them you like it.

I admit they don't have the best voices or happy songs but it's still worth listening to over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Delgados record to date.","review":"With Hate, The Delgados managed to top their last album, the fantastic The Great Eastern. Hate is a beautiful album, full of great (can I say pop?) songs. The songs \\"All You Need Is Hate\\" and \\"Coming In From The Cold\\" are especially good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Delgados brilliant fourth album! One for the ages!!","review":"If you have never heard of the Scottish rock group The Delgados and are reading this, please STOP right now and just go and pick this up. A brilliant album, 'Hate' contains some of the groups most indelible melodies and hooks, and has a majestic sweep that is almost euphoric despite the fact that the album contains some truly dark lyrics. In fact, this contrast is what makes this such a great album. With each work, The Delgados have quickly burned themselves into my mind as my favorite group. They are definitely a band to watch in the future. Exciting stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aptly Titled","review":"The sound of strings, a choir, and thunderous distortion opens the Delgados' fourth release Hate. This is both musical motif and a distillation of the sweet-sour dichotomy the Scottish quartet has explored over the course of its short history. Alun Woodward and Emma Pollock's respective worldviews have grown increasingly more black or white (depending on the song) as their music's become more baroque, thornier. The results are split. Invective, like revenge, is best served cold. Woodward's blissfully nasty pop masterpiece \\"All You Need Is Hate\\" and the bottom-of-the-barrel anthem \\"If This Is a Plan\\" are aces. Otherwise, it's tough going. The lyrics have no focus. The musicians are all over the place. The songs escape their control. And I sincerely hope that whomever did the string arrangements was the inspiration for the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd is more Excellent","review":"I learned of the Delgados from the somewhat unlikely source (though not uncommon) of their one anime open The Light before we Land for Gunslinger Girl season 1. Such a beautiful and complex song like much of their work. That's what surprised me the most, for me this is an obscure band, from Scottland, on their own label (mostly) put that with a musical depth and complexity and it just blew me away. Wow!Now the title of this review is indicating the odd number songs on Hate - the ones sung by Emma Pollock (who is off now on a solo career) - I think are superior. She is quite a vocal talent. Can't say much more than what's already stated in the other reviews..enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Ben","review":"Most people who rave about Ben Harper are relating to the live experience. This CD shows why. It is solid and tight and captures the dynamic range of a Ben Harper performance. Costing twice what a studio CD costs, its worth it. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"The recording quality on a live disc is never great, but on this CD its horrible. I think that may be why it was not released in the U.S. I've seen Ben perform a number of Hendrix tunes live and they're always incredible, but the Voodoo Chile on this disc is a throwaway because you can't hear it at all. My grandmother's circa 1935 AM radio has about the same sound quality. The sound quality definitely improves on the last couple of songs (the songs are not all from the same show), but there are some much better live Ben CD's that show up on ebay from time to time. You're better off buying those. I had to have this disc, because I'm a chump and I buy every Ben disc that is available. But, you'll buy it, listen to it maybe two or three times and then never again. At least that's what happened to me. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but expensive","review":"I love Ben, and the songs on this CD are great. But $34 for 6 songs is an absolute JOKE. I bought it used for $15 plus shipping, and I still feel even that is a little pricy for 6 songs. Sound quality is not perfect, but not nearly as bad as the one reviewer makes it sound.If you don't already have Live from Mars, you should go with that instead...much more bang for your buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben Live","review":"Ben's live performance is well captured on this disc.

I tend to use them mostly for making bento lunches - they are great for keeping food items separated. I was able to easily turn a plain tupperware into a bento box using these, and they are great for real bento boxes as well.I just baked a batch of pumpkin cornmeal muffins with these, and the muffins baked perfectly. No crispy edges, absolutely no sticking to the liners (I did spray them with olive oil first), and the liners were easy for me to clean. They also store very easily because they stack perfectly with each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice cups","review":"I haven't actually baked in them yet, so I can't comment on that.

I bought them for use in our lunch boxes to divvy up snacks, the ones that aren't ripped with work for now but I won't buy these again. I would definitely not recommend them for any kind of baking. I'm sure they would just fall apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"History is a puzzle with pieces missing!","review":"I love this book as a way to introduce history to my children. It shows the difference between a 1st hand account, from the shade/ghost Geordie who lived at that historical time, and our historical account. The differences in the story show easily how history is not written in stone and depends on the available information and the slant of the writer. Even the best of histories will probably have \\"pieces\\" missing. It also introduces a newer perspective that the American Revolution was perhaps The First American Civil War since 2/3 of the population at that time were either loyalists or neutral. Besides all this educational talk, the story line is fun and my children begged me to read more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate depiction of 1777 action near Philadelphia","review":"As an author of 6 books on the Rev War, including 2 for young adults, I was very pleased to find that this book by Dorothea Jensen did not have any historical inaccuracies. So many best selling YA authors' novels are full of inaccuracies. Her descriptions of scenes/action/feelings in 1777, as related in conversation between the ghost Geordie and the main character Lars, were detailed, vivid and entertaining. I highly recommend this book for middle school students. The glossary at the back was helpful, and again, accurate. I would have preferred to have all sentences spoke by the ghost in italics, instead of only those that appeared in the final two thirds of the novel, to be consistent. - Gregory Edgar"},{"rating":"2","title":"riddle of penncroft farm book review","review":"this book had a great way of linking history and fantasy ina way that pulled all readers in.

It is also a very enjoyable book, fun to read, with a mystery to be solved before the final page. Many lessons are taught throughout and even the 'bad guy' learns a valuable lesson of the inaccuracies of his family's genealogy knowledge! Youth through adults will want to read more books by this author. I believe that this book is used in middle schools and junior high schools throughout America as supplementary reading while studying the Revolutionary War.

Basically this is a terrific CD with 20 songs at or near the top of the charts during 1956. However, this is not a compilation of 50's rock 'n roll--this is the gentler music your parents listened to on adult contemporary radio stations played on the kitchen or car radio while you were being a goofy kid. The sound quality is fine, better than through a 1956 car speaker. I don't understand why the Chordettes and Eddie Fisher songs were included, both deserving the lower chart positions as compared to the rest of the songs on the CD. The CD producer must also be faulted for the lack of meaningful CD notes. I initially gave this CD five stars, but maybe that illustrious rating should be reserved for a perfect collection--one with liner notes. Still, if this is the kind of fifties music you enjoy, this is one to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Haydn: Wonderful but not Jochum's best.","review":"This is the same performance of April 27, 1951 issued on the Melodram label. If you wish to read my review and suggestions, please refer to that version, also listed on Amazon.com. I have not heard this Archipel release, so I cannot comment on the quality of the sound. In sum: this is a delightful listening experience but ought not be one's introduction to Haydn's \\"The Creation.\\" John Eliot Gardiner's recording would be an exellent first choice in the German version, along with Jochum's later 1966 recording in stereo. For the original English version, try either Christopher Hogwood or Robert Shaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never arrived, so I canceled the order and requested a refund","review":"I ordered this book, but I never received it in 2.5 weeks, so I decided to cancel the order and got a refund from Amazon.

The hard edges give it a more structured look than many of the sleeves available these days. But it's still small enough to fit into a standard backpack when necessary. The handle and shoulder strap are both well-constructed and should maintain their integrity for some time to come.Be warned, you'll have to carry the power converter separately, as there is no room inside.

When I turn my older variable speed version to the lowest setting, I can still get a cool breeze and barely hear it at all, which is perfect for sleeping under on a warm night. The picture on the Amazon site showed the wrong (old) version. I can't imagine why Vornado quit making the continuous adjsutment version, but they did. I've been trying to find one unsuccesfully for a couple of months now, and thought I had hit paydirt based on the picture displayed on Amazon.To be clear, the fan did work as it should have, and Home & Beyond took it right back when I returned it, it just wasn't what as shown on amazon.

You turn it on, it blows air. It doesn't seem to blow air any further than any other fan I've had. It works fine in my average-sized bedroom. It is pretty quiet and is small, two features I like.

Both author and publisher are British. The text is easily read, and is organized on a park-by-park basis, following an introductory chapter. The reader is given a photographic viewpoint different from that of the usual American brand of telephoto and wide-angle pictures that leave distorted expectations. Most, if not all photos are realistic depictions of things a first-time tourist might honestly expect to see. The treatment of the Utah and Arizona parks, and Crater Lake is especially good.The book evoked many pleasant memories for me. I heartily commend it to all, especially persons who have never visited these wonderful crown jewels of our nation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality","review":"This disc is a collection of very old recordings.

It is everything that I have read about,easy to apply, and provides a beautiful, deep shine. Best if applied lightly, if put on too heavily it can betough to remove. I also found it goes on best with a fine, foam, wax applicator. Do one panel at a time, do notlet it sit too long. I removed it with a microfiber cloth. This wax will be my choice for now on, overother brands. It cannot be found in stores for the most part, which is strange. Sold locally in New York state (where it is manufactured), outside of NY you must order online (amazon.com) . I called the Collinite folks to see if any one sold it locally, their website lets you search your state for local distributors. None in my state, so ordered it here, received product in 3 days.

She is a very shy girl but reading this story in particular got her excited. I read it to her, changing the names to fit the wedding she was going to be in.

The lead character is a Swedish spinster with issues (constant flashbacks to her childhood suggest this even though the flashbacks themselves don't show anything particularly disturbing) whose sewing scissors disappear around the time the murders start. Is she the killer or a potential victim? Since this is a pre-slasher horror film the violence is pretty mild. Haunts isn't particularly suspenseful but it's a decent enough time-waster if you like 70's B movies. Then there's the transfer. This looks pretty much like a VHS tape. The bright scenes are watchable enough but the dark scenes are frequently so washed out that you can barely see anything at all. Keep your expectations very low if you decide to watch this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A haunting experience","review":"It would be nice to write a review of this DVD, however the disc was defective and would not read in either of the DVD players I have in the home, I would think that Amazon would at least check the product before it is allowed to be shipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"In The Trash","review":"I bought this product believing to be less messy than foams and polishes.

Even though I have a few things I do not like about this set I have to admit that this is a good basic set to keep around the house. The price was another factor for purchasing it. I do feel that this set would be better if the wrenches were replaced with a cutting knife and a pair of regular pliers. I would think that a wrench set would be better than just having four wrenches. The hammer handle is a hallow alluminum tube (not a very strong handle and hard to replace if it gets bent).

The music here resembles the garage-psychadelia music of the 60's with a modern twist. The landscapes created in these songs are amazing considering that not even one song lasts longer than 4 minutes. The great guitars of Far Side Off Your Moon and Space Travel in the Blink of an Eye are sure to leave you breathless while Trowerchord and Lucy Leave will have you jamming in no time to music that simply isn't being made anymore.

It is well written and to the point. However, the remaining section (250 pages) of examples was disappointing. The examples were shells only and had only a summary explanation of each. The same content was copied over and over in all the examples. For example, the \\"How to register the DLL\\" explaination, which took almost a page, was copied verbatim in the other examples. Instead of building on a concept, it was simply repeated. 90% of the examples were MFC generated code. It seemed to be more an attempt to fatten up the book rather than to provide content. In short, I think one would be better off with another book that can provide more in-depth examples that one can learn from.

Maybe I have real bells up there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spinal Tap Revisited","review":"I had high hopes for this film for two reasons: a lot of people I know liked it and I really like Wilco. I just couldn't believe how CHEESY it was. Focusing on the turmoil between Jay Bennett and Jeff Tweedy as a central theme in the film was a little much. Wilco overcoming the soulless, behemoth, money driven record industry was GREAT! But I personally just didn't enjoy the way that very noble and proud accomplishment was presented. A wee bit sentimental for my taste (but then again so is a lot of Wilco's music). I still think they are a great band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new.","review":"I'm having a hard time trying to figure out how people are calling this a great documentary. It doesn't reveal any more than the copious press surrounding YHF did. In fact, the one scene it SHOULD have had, it missed totally, that being the final falling out between Jeff and Jay. It didn't really show me a behind the scenes of making the record, and as I said all of the record company intrigue I knew about well ahead of seeing the film. I guess all the positive glowing reviews are a testament to the cult of Wilco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-done documentary","review":"The best documentaries just happen to be in the right place at the right time. This one was done at a very exciting and turbulent time in Wilco's history. They were tracking and producing their masterpiece album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. They were dropped by their label with the album in hand. A key band member was fired. And the camera caught it all. Lucky us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Film About A Fantastic Record","review":"I agree with what others here have said. I would just add that, the real strength of this move is that it doesn't exploit any false \\"good guy\\"/\\"bad guy\\" dichotomies. Both Tweedy and Bennett come across generally as decent and extremely talented guys, at other times they come across as insecure, pretentious jerks obsessed with money and/or attention. Given the record's eventually success, it would have been easy to cut this film into an inch-thin morality play. It's to the filmaker's credit that he lets us see everyone's ugly side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real life, Real music, Real people","review":"After seeing this movie, I was so blown away. What a way to make it to where they are. I think after seeing that movie, I found even more respect for Wilco. The things they had to go through to make it. The video is so real and shows them day to day life. From their anual stop to watch the Simpsons, Jeff calling his wife and talking with his kids, live jam shows where they just have the best time but sound amazing. The interviews are *fondominal*, from the reality of life to the reality of their lives. After seeing this movie I have made given as gifts for birthday's, etc. to all my friends. It is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. Best seen is when Jeff says well that was 5 thousand dollars of arguing ... something like that. If you have not seen this you must. You will find a whole new respect for the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great band, movie for all.","review":"I will tell you straight off that I am biased. I have been a Wilco/ Jeff Tweedy fan for along time. This is a great music documentary. I think that music fans (non Wilco fans) will enjoy watching this movie. The bonus features are great too. Commentary throughout and about an hour of extra footage - which is mostly live performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kudos to Sam Jones","review":"Sam Jones received full access from Wilco to film this documentary, and it pays off big-time. Sam's goal for his debut film - to be present during the making of a great album - is a treat for music fans. Highlights include an acoustic version of \\"I Am Trying . . .\\", a rocking version of \\"Kamera\\" (I prefer it to the acoustic version on the CD), \\"A Subset of Heavy Metal Drummer\\" (Chapter 9, I think), the band's great live performances, and the commentary from Sam Jones and Wilco. (The band's commentary is particularly amusing during the end of the band's live performance of \\"Misunderstood\\".)"},{"rating":"2","title":"corrections","review":"i am a wilco fan and i enjoyed this film.but i wished it had been more about the music and less about the industry.now i just wanted to point out two [things](...): first, the scene in which tweedy speaks of firing his stock broker is not a sign of tweedy's wealth. it is obviously a staged, comedic scene -- as the would-be interviewer to whom he is speaking is the musician/comedian fred armisen, formerly of the band trenchmouth and now of saturday night live fame, who in the scene is doing one of his sketch-comedy characters. second, jay bennett, who was fired from wilco in this film, was not tweedy's cowriter and bandmate of sixteen years. wilco has barely been around half of sixteen years, and bennett is not even an original member of wilco. perhaps that reviewer is mistaking jay bennett for jay farrar, who was tweedy's longtime friend and \\"original\\" cowriter before the band uncle tupelo, ummm, disbanded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilco yes","review":"I love this Documentary. ifu love of like or whatever Wilco, you will love this film. beautifully shot and created. yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best rock documentaries I've ever seen","review":"In terms of immediacy and accuracy, this film is tough to beat, in the all-time best rock-doc category.This document of Wilco's creative process is absolutely entertaining and the rehearsal sequences are priceless.(My only criticism would be that the DVD (at least the one I bought) is not in anamorphic widescreen, as the cover claims, but rather fullscreen.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spell Binding","review":"A great Documentary to go along with a great album. The story could not have been scripted better than the reality of the situation . . .A band records a brilliant album, which the evil record company wants them to change. They say no, and get the shaft. The band struggles, plays some gigs, kicks out a member, and finally finds redemption. Does this stuff happen in real life!!Any fan of Wilco, any fan of documentary filmmaking, and any fan interested in the workings of the music industry will love this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent workout dvd","review":"I love to do pilates.

Instead, I found a lot of \\"woe is me\\" and \\"misery loves company\\". For almost all of us, children after 40 is a hard earned choice. This book has a negative beat to it, maybe because the writing is so poor. Clearly the author's analytical skills are so rough that she had to rely on interview annecdotes.

It was the first Frosty movie my daughter had seen and she finds the older ones quite boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Legend of Frosty","review":"My family and I enjoyed this movie, especially our 8 year old son. It portrays Frosty and his magic in the background of a surburban fiefdom. The voice of Burt Reynolds navigates us into the lives of several children yearning for some magic and fun amoungst the rigidness of societal norms. By the end we remember the fun of snowball fights, sledding, ice skating and appropriately breaking the rules. I recommend this movie to young families."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Frosty remake","review":"I had just given our children the Hallmark recordable storybook of Frosty the Snowman when this came in the mail from a relative. We were all overjoyed and popped it in after dinner only to want it to stop. In fact, after 20 minutes we were so frustrated with the cruel and horrible parents and principal as well as the rebellious children that we stopped the movie. I have no intention of letting the children watch this movie again. It is a COMPLETE waste of money! It does not resemble the lovable classic except Frosty LOOKS similar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"great animation reminiscent of classic styles.

Maybe it will fit my next pan and if I have to fork over some bucks for the next one I will. I expect pans to last like my old ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Quality","review":"This is a very good quality pan and lid. I use it for baking and non-baking purposes because the plastic lid fits so well and is pretty much air tight. It is slightly difficult to get the lid off but not as bad as other containers I own. Corn bread, zucchini bread, and brownies all have turned out beautifully in this pan. I am happy with it and all my other Nordic Ware baking supplies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine Has Holes","review":"I bought this pan in September of 2010, and I've been happy with its performance since then. However, I took it out to use it today, and I noticed that there are holes in the side. I've taken care of it according to the directions, so I was surprised to see that it had those holes in it. It also has dark stains in it from cooking baked pasta in the pan (at 350 F - no crazy high temperatures or anything). Since that didn't affect its performance, it wasn't really an issue for me, but since I'm reviewing the pan, I figured that I would note it. Overall, for the price, I would certainly expect to get more than a year and a half's worth of use out of it, and I'm sure I could go through a return or warranty process, but it's still disappointing to have to do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"tarnished after being put in dishwasher","review":"Bought this pan a few months back and it looked like a nice strong pan. Finally got around to using it; made some brownies and they cooked up nicely. BUT, after putting the pan in the dishwasher, the pan looks disgusting.

The CD label even has a copywrite date of 2004, and the Amazon available on date is also 2004. But the software is very old and outdated. It generally works with XP (except for the talking aspect) but does not have a good interface at all. Furthermore, when I looked at the last modified date on the CD itself, it said September of 1999.

And they built on the standout brilliant \\"20 Cases Suggetsive of...\\" of of Discovery of World. Two singularly important bands come to mind -- the Ramones and the Jesus and Mary Chain -- which (mostly the former) have given rise to a whole string of great bands that I know little about, like the Donnas and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. The fantastic \\"Yore Days\\" reminds me of how much I'll be yelling for \\"Touch the Water\\" when the Apples roll in to DC. Hooray for the great American Apples."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a falling off!","review":"I was elated when I heard that Apples in Stereo had a new one. But I was not elated when I heard it. Before, I thought Apples were one of the best pop/psychedelia bands around. They were--but not any more. This CD is very different from all the rest. It is nothing but speed thrash. It has no variety, no catchy melodies, no abrupt shifts, no experimental use of funny instruments, no intriguingly odd lyrics.It just isn't the same Apples. It's the Apples trying to be the Strokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"rotten apples","review":"I love 60's garage rock as well as the White Stripes, but (try as they might) the Apples in Stereo just can't pull it off. Robert and Hilarie's voices are too bubbly, not enough snarl. And the fuzzed out production makes the record sound bland. \\"Please\\" might have been ok on it's own as a single, but a full album of similar tracks makes it all congeal together into a flavorless mush. The Apples in Stereo (a \\"The\\" band before it became marketable) should stick to Beatles-esque psych pop, or perhaps give gangsta rap a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apples in Dookie","review":"Yikes, I liked the record before this one, Tone whatever. And the singles they put on the Spinart samplers were amazing. I used to think, these guys copped a lot from the Beatles but were actually pulling it off! An innovative sound that was both retro and modern.But this record blows. The cover looked StereoLab-esque so my hopes were high. However once I started to listen, I actually wondered if I had purchased a defective CD where a manufacturing error put some other band on it. The songs bite and the voices sound like an episode of the Simpsons where they let Bart sing!Unless you're a teeny bopper you won't appreciated their new harder \\"let's sound like the strokes/hives/stripes\\" attitude. It's not genuine enough in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Apples I know","review":"After the Apples produced some of the best pop albums ever made (and they will long be my favorites) I feel that this album is a cop-out. It's getting some glowing reviews here, but after they produced a sugar-sweet single for 'The PowerPuff Girls' album, I feel they are reacting with this album with feedback and fuzz, as if to say \\"Hey guys, you know we're still indie and raw.\\" Well we know you are, you don't have to slap us in the face with it. Every song sounds the same. Static. Fuzz. Feedback. Headaches. Where are the delicious pop melodies? Where are the contemplative lyrics that you can sing over and over? Where's the subtle nod to the 50's and 60's? Apples, you now sound like every snot-nose teenage garage band, and nothing stands out. I've heard this sound millions of times. Nothing special about this album. Please let this be a one-off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pictures, so-so text and captions!","review":"For the police vehicle enthusiast, this book will be a real boon. The photos of police vehicles, literally hundreds of them, most in full colour, are magnificent. Most of the police cars shown are American, but there is a fair smattering from other countries as well. The photography is generally of a high standard, and the reproduction is exquisite. The text, however (what there is of it), is pretty generalistic. Then again, this is a PHOTO book. I did notice some of the captions, particularly in the model police car chapter, were totally inaccurate, as though written by someone who didn't know much about the models concerned. This compares with the chapter on old police cars, where the captions are highly detailed. Of particular interest is the range of unusual and spectacular police vehicles, such as the DARe cars (Corvettes, Camaros ... the works!). A great book photographically, that is pulled down from being a ten by some of the insipid captions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I'm not totally sure what a 6 inch ravioli is, but it certainly isn't an attachment for my dog's pasta maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Creative","review":"I am not a science fiction type of girl but once i started to read previews of this book it really caught my attention.This book is different,creative and interesting.It has a great chance for the movie screen.Cassandra DillonAuthor of \\"Reality Poems\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing Without a Trace","review":"The book, Missing Person, is a suspenseful mystery that will keep you at the edge of your seat.Carrie's mom is never around.

Blacklisted come out with some very quotable lines, some real heart, and some great guitar. These tracks are among the best released this year. 3800 is a highlight track, featuring a great pause in the middle.The second half, originally the demo, aren't quite as good. You'll sometimes find yourself going back to the first half of the CD. It shows some great growth for the band, and I expect huge things on their first full length. As it stands, these songs are still good, just not as good.What you get here is very hard guitar, some great vocals, and an excellent modern hardcore band.

Owning it, however, is a somewhat empty gesture. Most of the action consists of random b.s. film clips playing while a Bruce voice over plays. Like seeing random movie cowboys talk to a horse or a guy on a beach while listening to \\"Religions, Inc.\\"? Then go for it. When the footage is of Bruce, it's worth seeing. It's too bad that sequences featuring Bruce are few, far between, and oftentimes too brief. I would rather have an unedited tape of whatever Lenny footage one could scrounge up, laid on a VHS tape than to own this. I own it, though, and am glad I do. It's the best that can be done. There are some bits on here that I haven't heard elsewhere, and it is nice to see Lenny Bruce in action. It's just too bad there aren't quality products on the market that can accomplish this. I wish they would make a Lenny Bruce best of tape that is somewhat sensical. This thing is more like a lame head-shop film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Complete Video Companion","review":"Scandously overlooked in my native Uk, with no DVD's available and most albums out of stock, this is a great and varied collection of live performances,video extracts and interviews from their career 1978-2002.Video's from the early years that you seldom see on the vapid,useless commerical video channels are intriguing whilst the set of live performances shows how good a band they were.Its a shame they didnt include the releases in date order(vids and clips? was confusing as there were no clips...everything was its proper length).More chat about how songs were written would have been good but you can't fault this amazing collection from the best band in the world"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection of Midnight Oil sights & sounds","review":"Great DVD for the Midnight Oil fan. Includes 19 Midnight Oil Videos (clips as they refer to them down under) Also has the Oil's discussing several videos, Peters run for Senate as well as their involvment in the Clayoquot Sound issue. Also has 19 Live videos from different concert events. They even included discussions on playing live, their first album as well as the Exxon protest and several other issues. Sound and picture is fantastic as everything has been digitally remastered. Now I'll have to go find my Black Fella, White Fella VHS tape and watch that again as well. Includes bonus video of Redneck Wonderland. A must for Oils fans!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"Highly recommended for anyone traveling to Patagonia. The drawings are exemplary in comparison to any other available field guides to the region, particularly when used in combination with the de La Pena and Rumboll guide 'Birds of Southern South America and Antarctica'. I found Harris's illustrations and detailed descriptions to be much more extensive and truer to color and features than de La Pena. Particularly interesting was the inclusion of line drawings of mammal skeletons, which were much more common in the region than I ever imagined, and these drawings were extremely helpful in identification. However, a complementary bird guide is necessary when traveling south to the Beagle Channel, and toward the Andes, the route most vistors to Patagonia take. If you are limited to only one guide to the region, bring this one. If you have room for two, include de La Pena."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Guide to the Birds and Mammals of Coastal Patagonia","review":"This book has good quality pictures. Its strong point is the text for each bird and mammal.

If I could, I'd give it zero stars. Resist the temptation to see what this book is like, even if you are a die hard animorph fan. There are tons of things that this book executes poorly, but the largest problem is that it's more like finding out if you are lucky at guessing correct awnsers than seeing if you are good enough to be an animorph. No book can tell you if you could be an animorph or not. Besides, how do you know if you would make a good animorph if they don't give you a rating or a score? Another major problem is that this book is WAY too short. I finished it in less than hour! It should be as long as a megamorphs book or the Andalite chronicles, or maybe even longer.

The long version of P and P has long been my favorite movie, but this collection is a close favorite.

Aly was too perfect to be believable.I also didnt like Nawat in the first book and most of the second but i could see the changes in him becoming a man. although he was very likeable after he went to war, tammy just pushed it too far young girls to really enjoy Nawat's character because of teh crow-man thing.Overall this book was slow moving, but the writing was excellent. the twists are pretty predictable, but the book is still worth your time.

I was very curious of what will happen to Aly. And I was all ready to read book 2.The book had too much explanation and too much narrating. The story needs more diologues and actions. Lots of kids, even I who likes to read, would skip the pages that were explanation...Blah...Blah...Blah...The names and words they use were SOOO confusing and in the middle of the story, i would always say, \\"who was that again?\\"Other than that, I think the story was pretty cool.

(i'm only defining \\"Mary Sue, because i didn't know what one was for the longest time.)Then the book's a bit long. Like 150 so pages, too long. It could have been shorter, Tamora, way shorter. Then i would have liked it better. Books rarely drag on for me, i read fast, but this book i just read to finish it.Then the royal family was just a tad to stupid.And there's never a cloud in the sky, in less of course you need one.-Qoute taken from Walgreens commercial.

This meant I had to remove the nut and then thread it all the way down again. But for all of the other clutches on larger shafts, it fit through and worked perfectly.However, it would have helped if I put it in a vise, because it's hard to hold the tool and the clutch, and turn a wrench all at once.This tool does seem a little expensive, but I couldn't find a better price and it works well.

The songs are predominatly covers with some of Cash's own songwriting intermingled. The instrumentation is simplistic, predominantly acoustic; none of the songs are musically complicated, and some of the songs are probably weaker than the originals. But the ablum is carried by Cash's strong, but wavering voice that embodies a tired emotion. His singing on this ablum communicates his readiness to die.Cash manages to take songs such as NIN's Hurt, the Beatles In My Life, Simon's Bridge over Troubled Water, and the Eagle's Desperado, and wields them to churn out a very dark, somber album. The overall mood is that this life is tough, but paradise is just around the bend."},{"rating":"2","title":"It IS Johnny Cash after all","review":"You see, no one can rightfully write a bad review of any Johnny Cash recording (not counting his horrid \\"The Junkie and Juicehead Minus Me). His voice is very weak sounding on most of the cuts. And on some of them you wonder if he is going to collapse from lack of breath. And then again you wonder why he thought we wanted him to record \\"Desparado,\\" Tear Stained Letter,\\" and \\"Streets of Larado.\\" But please remember, Johnny Cash, at his worst is 100 times better than any body else who has ever recorded or will ever record at their best.Go get this and enjoy it, It is after all Johnny Cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"The instrumentation and guest vocals work exceptionally well with Cash's voice. They mirror the terrain of a hard-lived life. One that leaves Cash feeling tired, but wise and ultimately fulfilled. This album captures the joy and pain of letting go.

He left with something so fine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Country Music Fan -- But this Album is GREAT","review":"Ok as the title of my review states I am not a country music fan but this album is the best I have heard in years.

The songs that aren't 'standards' are pretty good, though far from Cash's best, but the old chestnuts are almost unlistenable, for me at least. I'd have thought a dying man might find something new to squeeze out of Bridge Over Troubled Water, In My Life, Danny Boy, Desperado, I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry and Streets of Laredo, something that would make these songs worth listening to for the nine-millionth time.

One of the reviewers sad that he never had much of a voice and thus the ragged pain of this performance was OK. I disagree, Cash had a vibrant moving style that that was deep and gravelly voice that could and did carry the melody faithfully and tell a story with energy and pathos. This was a very sad performance of a man I would rather remember in his prime not in decline at the end of his life. I miss Johnny Cash, but, I'll take a pass on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad ending for a truly great artist","review":"You got to be a die-hard Johnny Cash fan in order to like this CD. Johhny gives it his all, but it's a sad ending to a wonderful career. Johnny's voice is shaky, and he can only hit notes at a very limited range. Many times he's off-key, and background singers have to carry the songs. Even with the help of great sound mixers, this CD is pathetic. All-in-all, if you rate this CD as a tribute to a great star and a great career and ignore it's flatness, you will obviously love it. If you want to buy it for Johnny's singing ability, forget it.

He caught my attention back with \\"The Wanderer\\" at the end of U2's Zooropa. And I knew he was something special. But youth is arrogant, and I passed him by, even when he did the first 3 great Amercian Recordings albums, one backed by Tom Petty. But I came to Johnny when I picked up a copy of Essential Johnny Cash, about a month ago, and I realized what true greatness was. I downloaded the video-clip to the song \\"Hurt\\" and I was shocked at how powerful it was-it brought tears to my eyes. Flash back to a couple of days ago, and I heard he died. It was tragedy. I went out and bought \\"The Man Comes Around\\" today-its the Cd of the year for me, maybe the one of the decade so far. I can't express how powerful it is. Every song is killer.

This 4th of the \\"American Recordings\\" albums is as good as the others, though you can hear that his voice is weaker than it was before. His originals here are all excellent as always, especially the title track, however \\"American 4\\" is also cover heavy. He does the popular \\"Nine Inch Nails\\" song \\"Hurt\\", as well as songs by \\"Simon And Garfunkel\\", \\"Sting\\", \\"Depeche Mode\\", \\"The Beatles\\", and \\"The Eagles\\". As always, he seems to make each song his own. Overall I actually like \\"Unchained\\" better, but this and all of his albums are wonderful. It's the sound of cool country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't judge someone's art by their character","review":"Many people who have accomplished great things also have personal lives that would not hold up under the \\"white glove\\" test. Certainly this is true of Johnny Cash, who, by the way, also accomplished the *immensely* difficult task of rebuilding a life that he had nearly destroyed by being an addict.Those who believe that only squeaky-clean musicians deserve accolades should be sentenced to a music collection full of Pat Boone and Marie Osmond. (But, hey, wait a minute -- didn't she get divorced? Oooooohh, *she's* not going to heaven!)I'm not a Bible scholar by any stretch of the imagination, but this verse from the Book of Matthew, Chapter 7, Verse 5, says it all to me: Before tending to the mote in thy neighbor's eye, consider the beam in thine own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mike D.","review":"Johnny Cash, an American hero expresses himself in \\"the man comes around\\". I am a big fan of Johnny Cash, he always put plain old country sound into his music. He always held on to tradition, and didn't change much with the times. Songs like \\"hurt\\" and \\"personal Jesus\\" are my favorites in this album. When Mr. Cash died he left a legend, and a collection of great music with his signiture of approval in every one.

It is a double LP set, so the quality is amazing. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strength and Beauty","review":"Johnny Cash is a legend. Unlike many other musicians who have had long and legendary careers, some of his best music also happens to be his most recent. Teaming up with producer Rick Rubin, Cash has managed to defy genres and generations with his mix of standards, contemporary covers and originals that make up the American Recordings Series. His latest album is no exception. When the Man Comes Around features some of Cash's finest (the title track is an instant Cash classic) and weirdest moments - sometimes at the very same time (sincere and damn good covers of Depeche Mode's \\"Personal Jesus\\" and Nine Inch Nail's \\"Hurt,\\" anyone?). While some songs work better than others (Fiona Apple's duet with Cash on \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" is growing on me), the album as a whole is a picture of a legend who isn't slowing down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Man Comes Around","review":"I remember watching Johnny Cash when he had a TV show (hint of my age).Never was a big fan when I was younger, but as I get older I appreciate his music so much more, this cd may not be his best vocally, but is so moving when listening to the words, it will bring a tear. I have never heard CD in my entire life that could bring on tears except for this one. Powerful, moving, haunting, god bless Mr. Cash, an American Legend.Watch the video of Hurt, best Music Video ever made. Watching the Man's life go round in a couple of minutes, June Carter watching over him, to the last caress of his piano as the video ends is almost to gut wrenching to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought it for \\"Hurt\\"","review":"I was scanning the radio channels one day and came upon Johnny Cash singing \\"Hurt\\". After hearing his somber melodious voice for a few seconds, I couldn't help but to hear the rest of the song; it was so poignant that I remember exactly where I was at that moment and what I was doing. The song isn't originally his, but it was definately made for him. Later, I heard the Nine Inch Nails version of Hurt. Johnny Cashes rendition puts them to shame. Although I purchased the CD for \\"Hurt\\", the other tracks are good as well. If you like hurt, you will like most of the other tracks. My favorite by far is \\"Hurt\\" but I never get tired of listening to \\"The Man Comes Around\\", \\"Give My Love to Rose\\", \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\", \\"I Hung My Head\\", \\"In My Life\\" and \\"Sam Hall\\". One of the things I like about Cash is how he puts so much of his heart into his music and it's so simple with nothing more than his voice and a guitar. I'm not even a fan of country music, imagine that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album From the Man in Black","review":"I don't understand how people could criticize this record when you obviously don't respect the man, Johnny Cash. He is nearing the end of his life so do you really think he'll sing in perfect pitch and tone. This record shows an even darker side to the man in black that makes you want to sit down and listen to it again and again. I think the song \\"Hurt\\" is far better than the original and the cover of the Beatles song \\"In My Life\\" is excellent. Keep going Johnny, you're at the top of american musicians!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny Cash the musical god","review":"this is a fantastic album from beginning to end. Because of what he has done in his life none of the songs are hard to believe. from the cryptic words before the first song to the last song. Some of my favorite songs on this CD are bridge over troubled water simply because of what the song is, I hung my head. One of my favorite songs on the CD Hurt because it reminds me of someone i know and care greatly about considering which it moves me very much. This CD is worth the purchase and much more"},{"rating":"2","title":"Make no mistake, Cash is the man.","review":"More of the same raw offerings from the timeless wayfarer and producer Rick Rubin. Though hampered in parts by poor song selection, namely wayward renditions of the overcooked \\"Bridge over Troubled Water\\" and the Eagles mawkish \\"Desperado\\", \\"The man comes around\\" still manages to shake the soul to its core. Undoubtedly Cash is the only artist who can consistently perform songs in a manner equal or superior to the original. His rendition of Trent Reznor's \\"Hurt\\" is one of the more affecting musical moments in recent memory whilst Sting's \\"I hung my head\\" and Depeche Modes \\"Personal Jesus\\", seem as natural to the Man in Black as \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\" or \\"Hey Porter\\". Yet perhaps more remarkable is the continued quality of Cash's own songs, particularly the apocalyptic title track which stands alongside any of his best work.

The 1st song \\"The Man Comes Around\\" is maybe the BEST SONG I HAVE EVER HEARD, but certainly one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Capstone of an incredible career","review":"I have loved Johnny Cash's music for a very long time, from the gospel to the country to the silly. I have always felt he used his music to convey his deep sense of conscious and his connection to others' condition. Think about Man in Black, San Quentin, Ira Hayes and too many others. The Man Comes Around seems to be the culmination of decades of his earnest humanitarianism and genuine Christian concerns towards others. It is one of the most emotionally intense recordings I have ever experienced, in part because I believe him. The American Recordings and this album in particular are a fitting capstone to his brilliant life."},{"rating":"2","title":"haunting","review":"This is one of the best albums that I have ever heard.

With Johnny's great version of the Nine Inch Nails song \\"Hurt\\", his version of the oft covered song \\"Personal Jesus\\" (which was first done by Depeche Mode), and Richard Thompson's \\"Tear Stained Letter\\", this album has some of Johnny's best work. However, this album also has two nearly unlistenable songs, namely his versions of \\"Bridge over troubled water\\" and \\"in my life\\".

The honesty and integrity he has always tried to bring to his music is something reserved for only the greatest minstrels and troubadors, and Johnny Cash is one of them! Like Ray Charles he's always had the ability to make any song sound as if it was his alone. Being the stylist he's been since 1955 it's not surprising. Now, as he's entered the twilight of a spectacular life and historic career, there's something unsettling about the songs performed here (Has any rendition of Danny Boy ever sounded more sadly honest?) If Mr. Cash never decides to ever record another album for the rest of his life this one will serve his fans well if he decides it's his last. Hopefully it won't as Johnny Cash is a true American musical treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cash is awesome!","review":"This is my all-time favorite American Recordings CD.

I read that when Trent Reznor heard Johnny Cash playing Hurt, Reznor cried.

I was totally surprised and overwhelmed by those songs and reall didn\\"t pay much attention on trying to buy it until, one day a great friend and I were coming back from a fishing trip and he had the cd and played it and I asked him what the name was and he said The Man Comes Around , so I purchased it and listen to it alot."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"I want to mention Danny Boy. When I heard it I wept. hard to believe anyone could revisit that song and nail it. Some songs feel as thought they were picked for the irony of Johnny Cash sing them and they don't quite work. Personal Jesus espesially. one can see how truly weak a song it is. Even in Johnny's formiable hands it's still just a riff and half an idea for a hook that never finds its voice. \\"Hurt\\" is brilliant and \\"The Man Comes Around\\" may be the finest Johnny Cash song ever. I wish that he had done \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" on Unchained when his voice was stronger. It's rambling melody doesn't work for Johnny's voice. Message to Rick Rubin! Edit Fiona Apple's insipid \\"harmony\\" on \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\"! Get this record for \\"Danny Boy\\". I'm made breathless every time I hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lineman's Last Beauty","review":"It would be very easy and reasonable to include this album as best of the year just because the man died, and he deserves every imaginable tribute for his contribution to popular music. It may seem puzzling to some that an Argentinean like me would dig a Country legend as much as I do. Well, I've been hooked on Johnny Cash's voice ever since I heard Lay Lady Lay in Dylan's Nashville Skyline. Although his voice no longer has the power it once did, it remains able to express the deepest meaning and tone of these songs, in certain cases in ways not mined before. A voice, possibly, even more moving and vulnerable because of the strain audible in his voice, due to his illness. Listen to Hurt for the most stunning example of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclectic Cash","review":"Very good album featuring a broad spectrum of \\"covers\\" by artists as diverse as The Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel, Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails, The Eagles and others as well as some rare originals and traditional folk tunes. Cash has always been more of a stylist (along the lines of Bob Dylan) rather than a great singer. He takes these diverse tunes and makes them his own. His rendition of Nine Inch Nail's \\"Hurt\\" sounds as if he has written a follow up to \\"Ring of Fire\\" Other songs reflect his country and folk background. He also harks back to his later religious period on tunes such as \\"Personal Jesus\\". This album is a must have for fans of the late great man in black who appreciate the song writing talents of modern artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Mr. Cash!!","review":"Wonderful and powerful album. I saw the video for \\"Hurt\\" before I bought the cd (which contains the video). It is quite possibly one of the most moving pieces of art that I have seen. In 4 1/2 minutes, you span the career of a legend, which includes his greatest triumphs and his deepest \\"hurts\\". Many thanks to Reznor for writing the song and the director who captures the beauty of a life spent bringing unique satisfaction to the fans. You will be missed, but you left your gift behind....and music such as this, like you Mr. Cash, only gets better with age. Thanks again."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good as It Gets","review":"Why review this music when all the appropriate praise has already been offered? Because it is just that good. Because silence would be wrong. Because those who have given it anything less than five stars need to be outnumbered. Perhaps even sought out and questioned: what were you listening to? This is American music at its zenith. Simply presented. Pure emotion. Authentic. It is as good as it gets in this time, in this country."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Man Comes Around","review":"WOW!!! What a cd. Most cover CDs struggle for the artist to bring their own style to the music. This is not the case with Mr. Cash, each song is sung as though he owns it. It gives me chills to listen to his interpertation of some great songs. This is truly a work of art and I just wish there was a volume two to look forward to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay I gave it a title","review":"The man's last effort, he gave it all he had left, you can feel it in his voice. Profound, perhaps partly because it was his last, but profound nonetheless. This CD includes his version of Trent Reznor's Hurt, a song I had hoped no one would ever condescend to cover, but the song was almost written just for him, it's haunting. In the liner note he descibes how he spent the last few months of his life working on the title track, taking longer to compose than any other song of his life, like he knew it was his last and wanted to give it his all. If you only own one Cash album, especially if, like myself, you're not a country western sort, consider this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny Cash is classic.","review":"I popped this CD in on the way to Vegas from Los Angeles in the middle of the night. Johnny's haunting voice came booming through the speakers like a soundtrack to the desert. Full of stories and vivid descriptions this CD cant be described as anything less than epic. Moving along like a Steam Train up hill the music gains momentum and impresses more with each bar sung. If youre looking for a little dark night, outlaw country Johnny Cash's American IV: The Man Comes Around is just what you need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melancholic but beautiful","review":"This guy with his voice and a guitar can do more that an overblown orchestration + hordes of extra musicians. I cannot pick up just one particular song. It's as difficult as picking up one chapter from your favourite book. Impossible. All of them create one long story. Magic,beautiful ... what more to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best.","review":"The truth is, all 4 of his \\"American Recordings\\" are great, and though \\"Unchained\\" is my favorite, this is excellent too. It's definitely the album with the most well known covers, which are just as impressive as his originals. Included is the wonderful \\"The Man Comes Around\\", \\"Personal Jesus\\", \\"Danny Boy\\", and the popular \\"Hurt\\". However they're mostly all superb, with only a couple that are fair. I think after a few listens of this album, or any of his releases, you'll understand why he's not just a country music icon, but an american icon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny's Masterpiece","review":"Over the years, Johnny Cash has entertained scores of listeners with a brand of music that cannot be considered merely country. Which brings us to this album. This is not country, rock, or any other stereotypical classification of music. It is the sound of a genius putting the final touches on his masterpiece. There is hardly a weak track on this album, which is amazing for the fact that the genius here is over 70 and considered by some critics as \\"over the hill.\\" For those of you who haven't seen the \\"Hurt\\" video or heard the song, it is a cover of a Nine Inch Nails song. Not only did the video make my eyes misty, I cry when I even hear the song (which I play frequently). Johnny also performs a staggering version of \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\" with guest vocals from Nick Cave. I have listened to a lot of music over the years, but I have never heard an album that moves me as much as this one does. Go buy this CD today... and hide the razor-blades!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to the Words","review":"First time I ever heard Johnny Cash was when \\"Man Comes Around\\" played during the credits of a movie. I realized from the words that this was by a man who had a real depth of character and faith. I never liked music at all (never owned a CD), but within a month of listening to Man Comes Around I had bought 7 of Cash's albums including all the American Recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Series of Recordings","review":"After hearing so many people gush about the Johnny Cash /Rick Rubin American series for several years, I finally got around to giving them a listen. I started with the first one \\"American Recordings\\". The first listen was a wow moment. A few weeks later I bought the next three \\"Unchained\\", \\"American III: Solitary Man\\" and American IV: The Man Comes Around\\". I had a long day of data entry to do so I ended up listening to these three CDs in one sitting on head phones. Amazingly I did not get bored with them and the time just flew by.They did everything right on this series, from song selection to what seamed like the unerring production on every track. Be it Johnny with one guitar or a full band it seamed like no mistakes were made. Cash's voice was starting fade a bit on American IV but I found it to be an apt conclusion to his story in music. All four CDs are worth having and I will get American V some time soon.This is a very fitting swansong for Cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quiet and Soulful Farewell","review":"Tears streamed from my eyes in an unlikely emotional release the first time that I listened to this treasure from an artist whose \\"Ring of Fire\\" and \\"\\"I'll Walk The Line\\" had been etched in my memory long ago. This unyielding tremulous soul filled wail of a gifted man consumed with joy, awe, some regrets and the sheer wonder of his life's path is truly a gift to savour.Cash's rendition of \\"The First Time That Ever I Saw Your Face\\" will bring anyone who has ever had the good fortune to have loved deeply to the very brink of bliss. His \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" is expressive of a uncompromisingly sincere level of wizened, heart felt compassion. \\"In My Life\\" will rip your heart out.The pathos of it all is heard here; yes, the human condition, the living in it, the dying, the passing and all of our changes. It's in these grooves with all of its fullness and \\"We'll Meet Again\\" and \\"Danny Boy\\" will simply leave you limp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I hoped","review":"This is the first Johnny Cash CD I've bought. I certainly was not disappointed. The combination of his own songs and some covers was sung in a perfect way. I can't believe I didn't buy any record of him earlier.For your information I have not bought many country CDs earlier at all. What I have listened to earlier have been Dylan, Hank Williams among other artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another classic from a legend","review":"Cash strikes gold again with American IV. This is a terrific album, and one of the finest of his career. Sure, his voice is a bit weathered over the years but it still has the great character and deepness we've come to appreciate over the years. The cover of Nine Inch Nails' \\"Hurt\\" practically made me cry the first time I heard it. This is especially true after you see the video for it. I think the best original on this album is the title track, which might just be the best song on the album. On Johnny Cash Appreciation Day on March 14, I will be listening to this album quite a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, Deep and Personal","review":"This is a wonderfully personal album by a man who lived life to the full and who has met his demons face to face and still gone on to create some truly remarkable music. The first thing that strikes you on this record is Johnny Cash's unmistakable voice; a little older, but boy it's dark, deep and mellow. The second thing is the unusual choice of songs. They all work. This is a marvellous achievement. 'Sam Hall' sounds as fresh as if Johnny had recorded it 25 years ago. 'Hurt' is simply brilliant - made even more so by the video. I think we have all known for a long time that Johnny Cash would leave us a musical legacy, but his last four albums (and this one in particular) has raised him from an influential country singer, to that of an American musical icon. We would do well to look back at what Johnny achieved in his lifetime. This album is a fitting testament to that ability to deliver, even in the face of adversity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Johnny Cash returns with another beautiful, sparse, haunting album. As with everything since the terrific first \\"American Recordings\\" album, it's the small songs that are the most moving. While \\"Personal Jesus\\" may get the most name recognition on this album, it's Cash's renderings of \\"Danny Boy\\" (just Cash's voice and a church organ), \\"Desperado\\", and his duet with Nick Cave on Hank Williams' \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\" that really stand out.But most of all, there are the opening and closing tracks. The opening title song is based on the Book of Revelations and shows Cash's continuing strength in Gospel based songwriting. The closing track will be familiar to fans of \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" - \\"We'll meet again\\". The last thirty seconds are worthy of being played and sung along with at full volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny does it again","review":"Once again, Johnny Cash has put out yet another simply incredible cd. His cover of the Nine Inch Nails song \\"Hurt\\" is enough reason alone to buy this cd. This is one of the most emotional albums I have heard in years. If you're not a country music fan, it doesn't matter - you'll still love this album, as it is alternative in nature as well. It's amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hurt","review":"Johnny Cash is just an all around wonderful man. He shows what can be accomplished in a lifetime. How we all have pain and hardships, but must continue to do what is right. And although it took years for Johnny to see what was right he did see the light and wrote his wonderful song, Hurt. This song Hurt, was how I knew for sure that Johnny was saved and lives in heaven. Johnny is a great mentor and I know his legacy shall live on forever. May God Bless his family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better Than Africana and Beyond!","review":"This is one of the top releases in recent memory! Really great! If you are a Chaino fan you have to have this album. The other Chaino CD, Africana and Beyond, is great too but this one is better. It's more rock-n-roll than exotica, this time, but it's still wild and unique and is in better sound than Africana and Beyond, which was made off of the old records. Chaino was the best -- totally out of control. He gets lumped in with Las Vegas Grind and Frolic Diner artists, and some of his tracks have appeared on albums in those series, but he outclasses everybody else on those records."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underpowered","review":"As soon as I used this jump starter to attempt a start of my lawn tractor, it signaled that it needed to be charged despite the fact that this was the first use after it was initially charged until the green light came on.I recharged it until the green light came back on and tried again to charge the lawn tractor battery-still nothing.I finally used a plug in battery charger and that did the trick. I don't know how useful this unit would be if I needed it to jump start a car battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item is defective out of box","review":"Bought the item arrived fine, tried to charge the unit didn't work.

It is very well though out product it occupy very little space and very easy and convenient to use. Like they say good things come in the small packages ;-) Best thing of all it is always ready when you needed because it sits in the base charging pad and stays always charged. So grab yours and be ready to jump anything you will need to jump !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First Experience With Jeff Talmadge","review":"This CD was my first experience with Jeff Talmadge, but not my last.I find him to be a \\"storyteller\\", much like Harry Chapin, and Bob Dylan, although, perhaps a bit more rock oriented.This is a type of music I like, but it's probably not for everyone. I also bought another CD by him, which is also very good.All in all, if you like story's about life with an up-beat rock sound, you would do well to give Jeff a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm its biggest fan","review":"After the fan arrived this evening, it only took 5 nuts and bolts, 2 wing nuts, and a few minutes to assemble this sturdy air mover. The all-metal construction seems quite rugged, and the gunmetal finish appears durable. It stands a bit shorter than I expected -- it's only 5' tall from top to bottom.I really like that you can angle the fan straight up. In this position, it really circulates the air in our loft with 20-foot ceilings. While more noisy than smaller fans, it's bearable when you consider the additional comfort it provides.While the fan easily swivels up and down, you must physically rotate the entire unit (base included) to re-orient it from side to side. I don't anticipate that being much of an issue since I'm using this fan to circulate air through a large space rather than to waft a breeze directly on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific fan","review":"This is the best fan I have ever purchased. Fan works so well I bought 15 of them 9 (nine) years ago and they all work better than any fan including the 45 inch floor fans on wheels. I used these fans in my home, gym, and office. This is one serious air pusher fan. This particulr model has a 30 pound weight which attachs under the base which keeps the fan from blowing itself over. I wish to buy more of these new fans, but I think they are out of production. Over the past years these fans work the very best. I nick name my fans the turbine fans and as far as the noise goes I don't think they are loud for the tremendous amount of air volume they push! I'd highly recommend this fan to anyone who doesen't want a peewee fan!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it!","review":"This is my first EOTech and I'm very happy with it. I've always been an iron sights shooter, but this optic made me a devout believer in the advantages of red-dot/holographic scopes. I'm getting 1-inch groups at 50 meters and 2-inch at 100 m shooting 5.56 from rest. The scope seems to loose most of its effectiveness past 100 yds. The nice wide target window is crystal clear with zero distortion. The reticle makes target acquisition extremely easy, however, it looks slightly pixelated so I like the lower settings. The quick release mounts are bulky, but very solid, very durable, and very easy to mount/unmount. I bought this model because of the quick release mounts. The scope is night vision compatible, which, doesn't benefit me at all and I cannot review that aspect of it. Unless quick release mounts are important to you, you should probably go with a less expensive, non-NV EOTech scope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the films","review":"First, the idea of putting four pictures in one package like this has a lot of merit.

That is a good thing what RL Stine did, I mean another murderer would've gotten boring and damn why would everyone want to kill Jenny, that just would've been absurd. And the girl surely would have gone crazy for real. This story is so completely different and RL Stine added more supernatural stuff which made the book very scary and a very good read.

I returned it and had it replaced and had the exact same problem, but this time it stopped working after one day. Called the Honeywell customer support line and all they could tell me was that sometimes the units sit on the shelf and the motor collects dust and this might cause it to burn out. I agree that the motor probably burned out on both units but this explanation made no sense at all. I didn't want to pursue it with them, I just returned the second unit and am looking for a different air cleaner. Might have just been very unlucky but it is a very odd coincidence. Amazon of course was very responsive and helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this model. Honeywell screwed up!","review":"I bought this air cleaner in March of 03 and was pleased with the thing until it just stopped working in January 04. There was no indication that anything was amiss, I was changing the pre-filters on the recommended schedule and then one morning nothing; no lights, no sound, no activity. Am sending it back to Honeywell (on my nickel according to their warranty policy). We will see how long the replacement lasts. I have read several reviews here that don't give me much hope. Amazon was nice, said I needed to contact Honeywell directly but suggested I post a review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought two - both defective...","review":"I ordered one of these a few months ago, and after running it on \\"high\\" for 2 hours the fan stopped. The cleaner worked on medium & low settings after that, but would not run on high. I called the company; they said it was a defect. Amazon.com sent a replacement; the replacement ran for only 5 minutes on \\"high\\" before giving up the ghost. The medium and low settings are great, effective and quiet - but not being able to use the high setting is ridiculous, and 2 defective cleaners in a row seems like a pretty bad track record. This happened in the past 2 months; maybe it was a defective batch from the factory, since earlier reviewers don't seem to have had this problem. Anyway, food for thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honeywell Air cleaner","review":"The Honeywell filter was delivered promptly and works very well. I would sugest you use a surge protector with it.

I purchased 2 units - one for upstairs and one downstairs. One unit worked fine and is still working 2 weeks later. The other unit turned on for 5 minutes and then died. The manual said to return it if it didn't work. I returned the item for a replacement (hassle enough) and when I plugged in the replacement (different electrical outlet nonetheless), the new unit ran for 5 minutes and then died. Exactly the same problem as the first unit.Obviously Honeywell has poor quality control for these units. A single bad unit may be acceptable, but 2 in a row is more than coincidence. Not only will I not replace this second unit, but I will not shop for any other Honeywell products in the future.If you like hassle and disappointment, buy this item. However, if you expect a quality product for your money, stay away from this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 separate units just died","review":"I ordered two of these units.

I probably shouldn't tell this but have also used these knives to cut through plastic and rubber.

This is especially noticeable when you are cutting something hard like a carrot. Instead of the blade cutting straight down it cuts at an angle. I actually wound up cutting my figure because of it.

As you fill the drive up it gets more and more difficult to find a place to restore.Anyway, yeah, this drive is awful. It seems every time I really need to use it, it stops working.

She is quite indulgent about that and it doesn't make for interesting reading after the first few instances.

I have been trying to get it over with for a week but it's beginning to look like a losing battle. Still a third of the way to go but doubt if I can make it.

I thought this would be THE book for me, as I am wholly book-obssessed. It also didn't hurt that I enjoy the fantasy genre and that many of my middle schoolers loved this book. Unfortunately though, I did not end up loving this book. I can't at all say that I couldn't finish it because it's horrible, because it's not. The prose flows well and I must say that the audio book has an utterly fantastic narrator. I just couldn't get into it. I guess it didn't hook me and it kind of bored me. I think I got about halfway through the discs and gave up after several times I just turned it off then had to force myself to put it back on.

Mystery and fantasy blend to take the reader on a journey mixed with the past and present. The power of a writer's words bring the end of the story to a tingling climax. The characters are certainly the main theme of this novel. I would recommend this great read for 6-8th grades because the main character's age is 12 years old and the length of the novel - 534 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was decent but...","review":"I found this book to be interesting but not interesting enough to even bother with reading the other books in the series.

This book is too wordy and too drawn out to keep a child interested to the finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books","review":"Well, Inkheart is a very exciting book with imagination. Cornelia Funke does somthing with all of the books I have read by her so far. She makes two stories by having two different groups of characters. You see a story through certain characters eyes and then through others. The groups can change, they can meet or get seperated.

Don't get me wrong, it's a pretty good book, but there are many better books out there (including the author's own Thief Lord). The characters in Inkheart are a little bland, and the book drags in a couple of places. Overall, it is a good story, but not a great one. While I am anxiously awaiting the next King Fortis, Harry Potter and Unfortunate Events books, I will approach a sequel to Inkheart (if Funke writes one)with mild disinterest."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting idea poorly executed","review":"I'm sorry to disagree with so many others who found this book 'delightful' but aside from the idea, which is a very good one, there was very little else to like about this book. As someone else suggested, perhaps it was poorly translated, in which case the author is absolved of any guilt. But if not, then this was one of the most boring kids books I've ever read. I honestly didn't care much about any of the characters and at times almost hoped they'd all get killed off so the story would be over. At other times I just skipped ahead to get it over with. Of course, if you're ten, you may not have noticed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Ms. Funke, but...","review":"I bought this book because my friend said that is was \\"amazingly written and a beautiful story-line\\". Well, it was just plain BORING! That was THE LONGEST most RAMBLING book ever. She would just go on and on about things I didn't care about! Sorry, Ms. Funke, but I am a major reader and and I found my self watching TV because I was so bored with this book. And, I am not a TV watcher. Don't get me wrong, there were some interesting parts, but they were just too spread out. The down time made me want to hit my head with this book!Did I like it? Not particularly.Do I think this book deserves to be published? Yes, I will give you that. A lot of work went into this and I did like the quotes you put before each chapter (even though they rarely had anything to do with the chapter to me).Sorry, I can tell that you put a lot of effort into this Ms. Funke,but it had more potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and slow","review":"This book had too many descriptions and not enough action.

Also there is almost no way for Dustfinger to get back into the book because to be read back into the book, because you have to have a book to get read back into one.This book was to me too long and not enough action.

The characters were incredibly forgettable, and I found no reason to be attached. It is a decent book, with incredibly long sentences that go on and describe every little detail on a random leaf in the forest that fell from a chipped maple tree that was slightly bent at the trunk.However, despite that, it is nicely written. But, don't waste your time. The cover is nice looking, but, spare yourself a few hours and don't read this book.Look out for new fantasy books that are scheduled to hit the markets in 2006."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Adult Reader Who Loved Inkheart","review":"I read and thoroughly enjoyed Inkheart. Meggie is a wonderful protagonist: intelligent, courageous, loyal and outspoken.I recommend this book for preteen, teen and adult readers.

It's about a girl whose father, when he reads aloud,can read things out of books. Accidentally, the man reads some evil people out a book called Inkheart. There is one man who is sort of good and sort of bad. All the man, Dustfinger, wants is to go back into the book. But first he wants to look at his own life, and see if he dies in the book. When the girl's father reads the evil men out of the book he reads his wife and cat into the book. Now, the evil man is trying to summon a demon plus a ton of money from Inkheart.

Funke does an amazing job at weaving a story that is captivating and fantastic. Although my favourite characters are the supporting ones (I especially like Dustfinger and Elenor), the main characters, Meggie and Mo, are solid and enchanting as well. I love the length of the story; I was reading it slowly to make it last! I'm single and in my mid-twenties, and although this is technically a children's book, it can delight readers of all ages.

I fear I'm going to upset a good load of people when I say that this is one of the worst books I've read in a long time. The plot was unrealistic and weak, the characters mere shadows of what they could have been in more capable hands. 500-some pages of sludge. The idea behind the story is a good one (the ability to call characters out of books). I find, however, that the book was very childish and extremely boring. Two stars at most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This book came highly recommended, but I'm struggling to finish it. I found the plot is quite slow (escape, get caught, escape again, get caught again) and none of the characters were developed well. I just didn't really care about any of them. The premise of the story is an interesting idea, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. Also, I can't see how anyone could compare this book to Harry Potter or LOTR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Fantasy","review":"I read this book when I was 11 and I re-read it recently since I heard that they where going to make a movie of it. When I read it for the second time I found that my opinion of it hadn't changed: it's enchanting.If you're pre-teen or an early teen that likes fantasy books like Harry Potter, Uglies series, Twilight series, Eragon series... then trust me and read this- I'm sure that you'll love it and its wonderful sequel (which is even better!!!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is so awesome!","review":"Like I said in the title, this book is so awesome!

The third man, Dustfinger, is my favorite character because he is the coolest fire-eater ever to exist!Then, Dustfinger, Meggie, and Mo go to Elinor Loredan's, Meggie's mom's aunt.

This book intrigued me from the beginning, what an idea! But we haven't finished it yet, and we're not sure we want to. 100 pages in and we still don't care about any of the characters. There's not enough character development. There are lots of inconsistencies, including the \\"science\\" of how the magic works. It is as if the author didn't work it out before putting pen to paper. I'm surprised the editor didn't catch the occurrences when this statement conflicts with a previous statement."},{"rating":"1","title":"SEVERELY DISAPPOINTING!!!!","review":"I raved about \\"The Thief Lord\\" and \\"Dragon Rider\\" and I was overjoyed when Funke came out with this book. When I read it though, I was really, really, REALLY annoyed and disappointed. It falls utterly short of my expectations of Cornelia Funke and her other writing. The plot is meandering and I found it rather difficult to follow.Another thing that bugged me was the character names. Though this sounds stupid, I couldn't stand to read the name \\"Meggie\\" in print. It drove me nuts, seeing that annoying, babyish name on the page.I can only hope that the sequel will be better, though with a beginning like this one I don't really know where it can go.P.S. I really enjoyed the quotes from different books at the beginning of each chapter. That was about all I liked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Expected","review":"I thought this book was way better than most of the reviews portrayed it. I really enjoyed the concept of this book. It was definitely new and exciting. I'm not going to write a plot summary. Amazon and some of the reviewers do a way better job than I could. I didn't think it started out boring at all. It did get a little bogged down in the middle. I think it may have been from where this book was translated. I found it easy to get involved with the characters. I would really recommend this to young adults and adults who love fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A blot on Inkheart","review":"I loved Ms. Funke's previous work the Thief Lord (although the ending was somewhat abrupt) and that is what led me to this book. Given that she demonstrated a fine ability to craft likable and believable characters in her earlier work, I am going to have to attribute this horribly stilted and pedantic piece to the work of the translator. I tried many times to plough through this story but kept getting turned off by how trite and one dimensional the characters seemed and how stilted the dialogue was. The idea is a magnificent one but it cant get out because of how poorly this was done. The only other example of ruining a perfectly good story with atrocious dialoge that comes to mind is Lucas's final three films. The concepts are lofty and the vision is there but the actors deliver their lines without any feeling. Sorry Ms. Funke -- you flunked."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book That Died","review":"It could have been a great book. It had an interesting plot line, fun characters, and a great beginning. But the author choose to kill the book and it died a painful death.The book starts off well, introducing the mysterious Dustfinger. The mystery and descriptions are well done, and you are hooked. But after the first 90 pages or so, the book loses its magic. The characters fail to develop. The great descriptions at the beginning grow heavy and bog down the book until it drowns. This is one of those books that where you cannot wait for it to end so you can go read something else. There are few redeeming features after the first hundred pages; occasionally a good morsel here or there. This is not one of Cornelia Funke's best works; if you still wish to try this author, I would suggest The Thief Lord."},{"rating":"1","title":"STORY STEALER","review":"Cornelia Funke stole the idea of Inkheart from Carlos Ruiz Zafon's The Shadow of Wind. And her rendition of Zafon's book sucked. I couldn't read after page 100. She disgraces Zafon, and The Shadow of the Wind is an awesome book. When rewriting a book that is already written, the point is to mak it either a) as good or b) better. Funke has achieved neither, and it would make any true reader angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most boring books I've ever read","review":"This book was recomended to me, and it seemed interesting enough from the plot summary, but then I started actually reading it. I tried to like this book...really I did. I kept reading farther just in the dire hope that it would pick up and be a bit more interesting and it just never did. Maybe something was lost in translation, but it's longwinded about absolutely nothing, all the characters are dry and often times downright annoying, and it's descriptions of people and places are horrid. Being a book about books, it mentions them a lot, to the point of of being annoying. Reading it I was constantly thinking to myself \\"OK, I get the point, they like books!!! You dont have to tell us 5 times a page.\\" The main bad guy was supposed to be the most evil person in existance and was straight forwardly described as such over and over and over ad nauseum, and just....wasnt. Many parts are painfully predictable, and over all the book just falls flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inkheart","review":"This is a great book.

Though the plot and ideas are very original and interesting the book never seemed to end. I usually do not mind long books, but as a friend said,\\"It seemed that the adventure ended and started again too many times\\". I agree with this remark, and also thought the adventures stopped and started too many times. If you do not mind the kind of book I described above, go head (the following remark will not make sense untill later in the story) read the characters out of the book. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a review of the audio book","review":"I'll let others review the content of the book. This review is specific to the audio book, which is read by Lynn Redgrave. She does a beautiful job of defining the many voices in the story, and unlike some readers, she modifies the characters' voices when appropriate. For example, if the character has a cold, she speaks with a stuffier voice. Ms. Redgrave does an excellent job with both the male and female voices and is a pleasure to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inkheart- An interesting tale.","review":"Inkheart is a wonderful book that is hard to put down.

Then, she walks over to the window and sees a silhouette of a person outside her window staring at her. At that moment, she ran as fast as she could to Mo's room. When she opened the door to Mo's, of course he is lying in bed reading. But after she tells him what she saw, he gets right up and runs down the stairs and opens the door to a scar faced man named Dustfinger.Inkheart is a perfect book for you if you like adventure, fantasy, and suspense.

She's a great story teller, first and foremost. I found myself gasping when the bad guys dog-ear one of her rare books, laughing out loud, and being delighted and horrified by the characters. I love that the heroes are bibliophiles, and I love the quotations that start each chapter and references within the text from books I loved as a child.

From what I've heard this book copies off another which just shows this author lacks creativty which is what writing is about. This book really shows how dull this author is. From what I've read by Cornelia Fluke it seems like she makes a very good plot cable of selling like crazy like Harry Potter, but than gets lazy and writes unimportant things not relavant to the plot.I suggest you stay away from all her books unless you are having sleep problems and then this book would be a big help putting you to sleep.If you want a books get Harry Potter, Series of Unfortunate Events, Narnia books,and The Last Unicorn, but stay away from any thing by like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inkheart review","review":"This was an amazing book!

For those who want a well balanced fantasy book, steer clear. The characterization is Ok at best, the plot is endlessly repetitive with the main characters being caught and escaping several times without in any way moving the plot forward, and the fantasy aspects are more just references and teases than any actual magic. The forboding malevolence of the main villain is very well described before we meet him, but soon after encountering him we find there is nothing interesting to him at all.

He has tried and tried, but just can't read her mother back out! Right on the first page it gets you attached to the book! If you're a kid, or are a parent who's going to read it to kid in grades 4 and below, you might not want to read the first chapter at night(I did, but when my friend read it, she read it during the day, she got sooooo freaked out at night!!!)

(The storyline at the time reminded me of \\"The Never Ending Story\\") Generally those aren't good reasons to buy a book. But I really loved the book, I thought it had a lot of suspense, great characterization, a strong plot, and was very well written. The only drawback I personally found with the book was the characters over discussed love of books. It got a bit tiring for me. But that wasn't enough to ruin my enjoyment of the book, or not appreciate the author's amazing writing ablity. I did enjoy Inkheart, but I thought Inkspell it's sequel was even better, all be it incomplete. I would recommend not only this book but especially Inkspell as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest parable","review":"Consider your favorite fictional character from childhood. Now imagine that character suddenly appearing beside you in your foyer. Such is the premise of Cornelia Funke's eloquent, \\"Inkheart\\". As evocative as her,\\"Thief Lord\\", Funke's twelve year-old Meggie lives with her kindly father Mo, a man with the ability to read books to life. The duo face off with Capricorn, a villain Mo once read from an almost extinct book. Funke fills her story with characters both menacing and tragic. The pitiable jester Dustfinger, also read from Capricorn's story, wants nothing except to return to the world he loved. Though a well thought out story, at 534 pages the book is a bit lengthy. One could also quibble that the villain does nothing to instill the reader with real fear. Yet children who would love to meet their favorite book friends will instantly gravitate to this new and delightful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lynn Redgrave does a nice job narrating","review":"Like others, my children and I are much enjoying the story and the characters.But I wanted to add a plug for the audio version of this. It's a delight to hear Lynn Redgrave do the voices. She has such a beautiful voice, and to my surprise she was able to give each character such a different and perfect sound that when I close my eyes and let myself be carried into Inkheart's world, I forget that it is just one person.I do sometimes enjoy fancier recordings that actually get different actors for the different roles (\\"the Golden Compass\\" is a GREAT example of this) but a single talented actor performing all the characters is something special."},{"rating":"2","title":"a different world","review":"a lengthy novel.

Above it all, there is a point to it. obviously, you'd want to read it first before you see the movie, cause the books are always better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love books about books, and I was looking forward to reading this one, especially as it was recommended by several people who generally like the same books I do. But I was very disappointed. It's either clumsily-written or clumsily-translated: I was often more aware of the writing than of the story. But the overriding flaw of the book is that it is completely humorless. Many 'dark' stories demonstrate the strength, resilience and determination that come from the absurdity and irony in desperate situations, and the courage of laughing in the face of death. The Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter books, for instance, are very dark but full of humor. Umberto Eco wrote, \\"Laughter kills fear.\\" It's one of humanity's greatest assets, but there is not one such moment in Inkheart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, boring and pointless.","review":"As the title of my review suggests, I found \\"Inkheart\\" dull, boring and pointless. So dull, boring and pointless, in fact, that I will not waste much time going into depth about just how horrid it was. Although I'm sure \\"Inkheart\\" lost something in its translation from German, that cannot possibly take all the blame for the uninteresting characters, extremely slow plot, and general poor quality of the book. I must admit the premise of \\"Inkheart,\\" where characters are read out of another book called \\"Inkheart\\" within the book, is clever, and could have made a wonderful novel, but Cornelia Funke simply does not go about telling her story in the right kind of way. She writes as if she doesn't care an ounce for her characters or story. In short, every aspect of \\"Inkheart\\" comes across as shallow and poorly thought out. If you feel you must read something by Cornelia Funke, try \\"The Thief Lord,\\" which, although it has its flaws as well, is a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn, Don't read aloud.","review":"If you plan to read this to your kids, bring an oxygen tank.

This books comes very close. Eventhough I'm an adult reader, I love reading books in the 9-12 range. Cornelia Funke is a great discriptive writer. I can't believe she started out as an illustrator. I tend to prefer books in a series. I'm hoping the this book is a long series like Harry Potter, in which I can read more about these characters and see how they develop. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"In my Top Ten","review":"Bought this for my daughter and read it before she did, and it's one of the best books I have ever read, definitely in my Top Ten. It's a book about books, and about family. The characters are well wrought; you'll find yourself pondering their motivations long after you close the book. Highly recommended--it's not just for pre-teens!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and difficult to finish","review":"I found the idea behind this book to be rather intriguing, but while reading it was highly disappointed.The first 50 pages or so of this book were pretty good, but then after a few more, it felt like it was about to climax and end. However, there were still 300+ pages left to go. The book felt on the verge of ending almost the whole time. It tried to drag the high-energy level on for far too long, and you ended up exhausted and bored when you finally finished . . . which feels like a lifetime. The actual ending is very predictable, and the effort it took to actually get to the real ending isn't really worth it.Although this book originally showed promise, I found it to be dull, slow, and bogged-down in too much plot. A friend of mine who read this also felt the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was anyone else SEVERELY disappointed?","review":"I REALLY liked Cornelia Funke's previous books, especially \\"Dragon Rider\\" and \\"Thief Lord.\\" These were two M-AZING books, well worth the time, so I eagerly dove into \\"Inkheart\\"Unfortunately, I was disappointed.I felt that the story was shallow and disappointing without much seubstance. I never really felt anything towards any of the characters (except maybe Farid), and the only one I could almost relate to was the Aunt. I found Meggie irritating and shallow in her seeming perfection and innocence. Besides that, the name \\"Meggie\\" annoyed me.I spared the book an extra star because the idea of the quote at the beginning of each chapter was really interedting and fun - I went out and read most of them despite my dislike for the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a warning to authors everywhere!","review":"Authors, beware of the damage you bring forth without fear of retribution. Your thoughts may manifest into reality - perhaps not literally as in Inkheart, but in the despair written into the hearts of your readers. Also remember the Book lives on even as the author fades into obscurity.Inkheart is a suspenseful read and the characters are memorable. Meggie, Mo (her dad) and her aunt Elinor are flawed heroes who love books with a dangerous passion. King Capricorn and Basta are inky entities dripping with the evil (and more so, nearsighted stupidity) of men. Dustfinger is the anti-hero leaving the reader ambivalent to the end. An exciting and twisted read for bookworms of all ages - and perfect fare for ravenous readers 4-6th grade.Special note - the quote at the beginning of each chapter not only provides a unique clue on what is coming, but provides the reader with a menu of classic children's literature to pursue at will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fantasy!","review":"Inkheart is an excellent story based on the concept that a really fine reader can actually enter the story's world or bring a character in the story into this world by reading aloud. The setting is in our own modern times, so the characters from our world take their knowledge of things into the story world and story character bring their magic into this one. In the story world, the fine reader can alter the narrative by writing a character in or out of the story, or rewriting the sequence of events. This is the first of a three-part series. I've now read this book and Inkspell, the second and am awaiting the third."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inkstain","review":"I haven't seen the movie but the previews looked good and I always like to give the book a chance before the movies anyway. I had hoped for better, everyone seemed to rave about the book but I found it pedestrian and dull - or in English, boring and about as interesting to read as the menu at IHOP - which at least has good pictures and decent food to reward you. The only reward in Inkheart - and I kept at it to the bitter end hoping there was some whipped cream or strawberries somewhere under that stack of syrup - is that I was finished and now can only hope the movie tells the story better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inkheart","review":"Inkheart was one of the most amazing books I have ever read!

Read McCaffrey, Rawn, or Rowling before this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"After Cornelia Funke wrote The Theif Lord, I was expecting even better for this book. And I shouldn't have. Thief Lord was one of the better books of the new millenium. But reading Inkheart, I would've been disappointed even if Cornelia Funke WASN'T my home girl. Which she's not anymore.Meg and her father have barely any, if not, no special charachteristics. They each could be anybody. Somewhat like a fan ficition story, or pretending to be a rock star you know nothing about. If I was Cornelia Funke, I'd be writing a follow-up to the Thief Lord to regain my fans. Which hopefully, she's doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Not that good. It's a weak story. And what's with the Teen Top 10 award?

What if characters from books could come out of their story and into this world?

The quotations that begin each chapter are wonderful and set the tone for the next part of the story.

I have stayed up countless nights JUST so I could read a \\"little\\" more. I would tell myself that I would stay up until 8:30pm to read... it never ended then! I read and read and READ until almost midnight EVERY NIGHT! This book doesn't fall any bit short of perfectly written, amazing, captivating, and enchanting. While I read, (and read what Mo or Meggie would read,) I could almost hear them in real life and I could see the pictures the book painted with every enchanting word. It was as if each word were rare, never before seen gem , each one is to be careful observed a and dwelt upon so you won't forget a single thing you see. I absolutely, without a doubt, recommend this book for absolutely anyone who likes climactic books.

It really is too long for a standard square type of adjustable mount. This one was designed for a spcific type that is much wider than the square type. I cut its length and drilled in another hole for the locking pin. That took all of 5 minutes. It turns out the standard length locks are only about 3/4\\" too short. This one will work for you if you are like me and hate having to take off your ball mount to keep folks from stealing it. I like the locking mechanism too. Different than most and you don't have to keep the key in it after you unlock it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sound reminds me \\"be cool\\"","review":"While much of barrelhouse music is rhythm you feel energize your body, this is mellow-you-out blues. Well, okay, in \\"Boogie Woogie Minuet\\" Price plays a striding bass par exellence. \\"Keepin' Out of Mischief\\" requires only a bit of imagination to place you in a speak-easy. \\"Honey Grove Blues\\" puts you in a smokey, sophistocated bar - late, very late. In short, this is music that moves you. You can't not listen while it is playing.What is perhaps most surprising, however, is the apparent lack of ego of Sammy Price. He is as superb in a background role as he is as a soloist. He allows the band members' their own opportunities to shine. Most notable are the clarinet of Sandy Brown in \\"In the Evening\\", Ruan O'Lochlainn's guitar in \\"Hungarian Rapsody\\", and the close trumpet/trombone work of Keith Smith and Roy Williams in \\"Royal Garden Blues\\".Sammy Price is one of the best in blues piano and this recording showcases him well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bunnicula: Excellent Family Entertainment","review":"I loved this product.

The quality of the film transfer is excellent on all of them except for \\"Betrayed.\\" The picture in \\"Betrayed\\" is soft and blurry throughout, about equivalent to a good VHS tape.I also question the aspect ratio of this transfer. Warner's listing for this disc at wbshop.com says, \\"Screen Aspect: 4 X 3 FULL FRAME.\\" That would be a ratio of 1.37 : 1. And 4 x 3 is indeed what appears on my screen when I project this disc. But imdb.com cites an aspect ratio of 1.66 : 1. If so, part of the image is cut off on this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely bad transfer and horrible disc quality!","review":"This CD release of \\"Betrayed\\" suffers from image quality notunlike the worst videotape you ever owned.

If mankind is to have any hope for a future, scientists must examine the God question rigorously and scientifically. In their book Conscious Acts of Creation (Pavior, 2001) William Tiller and Associates have in my opinion taken the first step in that direction.This book is essentially a spiritual interpretation of quantum mechanics, and I believe it is the first attempt by mainstream science to explore the question of deity scientifically. Unfortunately, a great deal of the research described in the book is far too technical for the average reader, but the narrative summaries of their findings are astounding and easy to follow.The Authors tackle the God question as a legitimate area of scientific inquiry and deal with it as they would any other physics problem. We can only hope that Tiller and Associates will not be the last to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Course","review":"This is really a splendid introduction to Farsi. The pronunciation is clear, voices interesting and indigenous, and material pertinent to a commencement in Farsi. I really do not understand why this course's reputation is MUCH less than any other of Pimsleur respectable courses. Whatever Pimsleur teaches in one language, it teaches EXACTLY the same thing in each of its other ones. What you learn in Farsi is precisely what you learn in Italian, Spanish, German, etc. It is not illogical to expect that the ratings of each Pimsleur set should all be the same. Apparently I was mistaken in that regard. If you're interested in Farsi Pimsleur series and are skeptical concerning this course's efficacy, check the reviews regarding Pimsleur's publications in major languages (French, Italian, Spanish, German, and Japanese). The reviewers there at least know what they're talking about. Again, Pimsleur is a perfectly approachable and preliminary first taste of modern Farsi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I have been using Mace's Intro to Modern Persian, his Grammar book, and a couple of dictionaries.

It was easy to install, the only difficult part was crawling though my central Florida attic in the middle of summer. Our AT&T phones usually showed 0 - 2 bars inside the house, so I opted for the roof antenna mounting. By placing the unit in the middle of the house, we now have full service in a 15-20 foot radius of the unit and have not dropped a call yet, before zBoost we would have to either go outside in the front yard or be prepared to drop the call at least once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proper placement critical","review":"Works well, but you must follow the instructions for mounting the antennas. Proper placement of both the base unit and the external antenna is critical. You will probably have to try it in multiple locations before you find what works. Try running the cable through a window and test your selected location before you start drilling holes. Try the base unit in different places too. In my case, it was necessary to mount the antenna on the roof and run the cable through a wall, with the base unit near the center of the house.Finding an acceptable location for the base unit and the antenna will determine your success with this unit. The orange plastic part of the unit is a mounting bracket, so it can be mounted directly to a wall or even to a ceiling."},{"rating":"1","title":"It only works once a call is picked up.","review":"The unit is ok once a call picks up.

Great improvement without the booster kit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"The wireless extender YX510 PCS/CEL provides the added signal strength I was hoping for in my home office. Most of the time, say about 90%, the signal boost is solid. I sit roughly 7 feet from the base unit, and I have mounted the antenae in my garage for best performance. I do notice, that it doesn't extend for 2500 sq ft as advertised, but that could be because the signal doesn't go thru dry wall? Either way, I am happy with it, and I can now answer/place calls from my cell phone in my home office."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great when installed correctly","review":"I installed one at work. The antenna is way up on the roof and the base is in the office. Now the office has an excellent signal on all carriers we use. The range seems to be larger than what is advertised. Using A = pi r squared, the range should be 28 feet. But we found an improved signal at more than 50 feet.The only thing difficult is routing a cable from the roof to the base. Everything else is extremely easy.BUT, as many have probably mentioned, you need a good signal at the antenna location. Our unit was donated by an employee who tried it at home unsuccessfully. His signal was spotty on the roof, so there's no surprise it didn't work. But for an office environment where there's a good signal outside and the building makes it spotty inside, this is an excellent solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I bought this booster and set it up following all the instructions. I could barely detect a boost, if there was any, standing 3 feet from the unit, with the antenna mounted on a board sticking up from my roof.I contact customer support (who did email me back). They said the antenna has to be mounted 25 feet, vertically, away from the base station (this seems to eliminate any inside installation, and many outside intallations). They supply 35 feet of cable, so it is pretty tricky to find a way to get 25 feet of vertical rise, with little extra antenna cable. Of course, you probably need a big ladder and enjoy aerial work. I went back and saw that one reviewer mounted the antenna on the end of a piece of PVC pipe attached to the top of his TV antenna - seems like something most people are not going to try.I still couldn't get a signal after all that trouble, so I sent it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cell booster","review":"Not a very good review. Unit is hard to find a signal. Doesnt seem to keep a signal, or is always searching for one.

I have used it for 2-3 weeks now and find that is does indeed provide me better wireless service than before, but I do think you have to temper expectations and not expect to go from zero to 5 bars.We have service through ATT with Blackberry, iPhone, and a Razor. We were never able to receive or make calls in our home as we bounced between 1-2 bars. When calls were placed they typically dropped after about 5 minutes of use. I tried other carriers and that didn't make much difference so I decided to give this extender a try. It consistently gives us 1-2 addition bars. So we went bouncing between 3-4 bars, which is just enough boost to make service work. I give this 4 stars as it does work and is easy to install. The one drawback I see is that while it says it puts out a radius of 2400 sqft, the quality varies, which they tell in the instructions is based on walls, placement, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"zBoost YX510 worked like it should","review":"Wanted to get rid of the landline and just use our cell. It helps us go from 2 bars to full scale. As everyone says, just get all the distance you can between the base unit and the outside antenna. Positive for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, but cell zone is very small","review":"We installed this unit in our attic and it turned the lousy 1 bar signal we have in our home without the YX-510 into 4 to 5 bars and at least 3 bars consistently. We use Alltel and live in a very wooded area quite a distance from the nearest cell tower. The reason I did not rate this 5 stars is that the cell zone it creates in the house is very small, not any where near the 2,400 sq. ft. as per the product description. Our consistent 3 bar cell zone is only about an 8 to 10 ft. radius around the booster unit. To get 4 or 5 bars you have to be within 4 or 5 feet of the booster unit. Still we are very satisfied, as we have no more dropped calls and a decent signal at the location in the house that we wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great with Correct Antennae Placement","review":"When I first got this and hooked it up it didn't really work that well. Then I sat down and read the manual and now understand how critical antennae placement is. Followed the recommendations and now it works great. I went from almost nothing, to five bars back in my bedroom.I have noticed that it does lose signal for a few seconds randomly while I'm on a call. It doesn't drop the call completely, there's just a brief second when I can't hear anything. I think it might be the unit's signal competing with the actual signal from outside."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOOST YOUR SIGNAL","review":"After reading several reviews, including those on Amazon, I decided on the YX-510 signal booster. After carefully reading the instructions, I decided on a rooftop installation. The installation was easy, and I went from 0 to 1 bars in the home, with frequent dropped calls, to 5 bars in the home. Incidentally, i live in an older (1958) built home with notoriously thick lathe and plaster concrete walls. I would recommend this signal booster to anyone.

It kinda sorta worked for about two days (cable was run max distance, had at least two walls between cable ends, cell phone went from 0-1 bar to 2-3 bars) then it just wouldn't keep a signal. It would have been worth putzing with at half the price, but for the price and reception I was getting, I returned the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not amplify signal","review":"We have a weak signal both inside and outside our home. Even after trying many different locations for the antenna and base and after purchasing an upgraded antenna, the unit does not make a noticable improvement in our signal quality. I suppose this would work for you if you have a strong signal somewhere (just not where you need it), but it does not work if your signal is weak everywhere.Dave"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth a try, but don't believe","review":"HI,After long search for something to help get us signal in the house I settled on this unit. setup was easy, and it did bring the signal in the house had 1 bar before and after had 3-4, however only if my phone or MIFI was within 6 inches on the base unit. If I moved further than that back to 1 bar. So I returned it, it seemed to have potential but I couldn't alway be with in 6 inches of the base."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Our new house's roof sheathing has an foil (heat radiant) foil lining one side (facing into the attic)- resulting in a cel signal force field. Outside our house we get 4-5 signal bars from a tower not 2-miles from here, but inside the signal would sometimes be completely blocked (\\"No Service\\").The reviews that I read through my research, were good enough to convince me to throw a couple hundred bucks at our problem.Overall, we get a better signal inside than we did before. My issue is that lack of consistent signal boosting from this unit: anywhere from 1-4 bars now.I shouldn't complain, since I couldn't even receive calls during the majority of the \\"pre-ZBoost\\" era, but I still have some calls dropped (AT&T; on my iPhone 3G) with my ZBoost indicating proper installation/operation. Still, it was expensive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTALLY UNRELIABLE","review":"I purchased this to increase my signal at my lake house.... the unit does work, but is totally unreliable. There are times when the lights go red, red flashing, I've tried all manner of things such as changing the position of the antena etc... I even called their customer service, for all intents and purposes, customer service sucks. I would NOT recommend purchasing this unit. It is not stable at all, I would have done just as good if I had taken my hundreds of dollars spent, and lite fire to them. I am and EXTREMELY disastisfied customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works better than expected","review":"I read a review in a magazine and some other customer input but I was still skeptical because the cell service is so bad where I live.

No where as far as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...","review":"I've had this item for 11 months now. My home is only just over 1300 sq ft so we weren't asking a lot. We got it heading into winter (no leaves on the trees) and felt like we were seeing a bit of improvement where a bit was absolutely necessary. By spring, we had a more complete opinion and not a good one. Now, after 11 months, it is completely on the fritz and I'm trying to get it returned or, oh boy, replaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"No range","review":"The unit did a very good job at boosting the cell signal as long as you were within 2 feet of the base unit. As soon as you move away from the base unit the cell phone signal dropped to zero and calls could not be placed. Followed the directions as indicated and they were very helpful, but once again the base unit does not have any power. Do not fall for the 2500 square feet of coverage. The unit has about 4 square feet of coverage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me.","review":"I did not get reliable cell phone service with this amplifier, for any arrangement of the antennas. I also tried the zBoost PCS amplifier without luck and eventually settled on a Wilson SOHO amplifier system with Yagi PCS antenna which works well.The only reason I give this two stars rather than 1 star is that my case may be more challenging than most because my home signal is weak but there is a strong roaming signal at my house. This amplifier would frequently get the error condition of oscillation caused by having the indoor and outdoor antennas too close together, even when I had them much farther apart than the minimum recommended distance."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES IT WORKS!","review":"As long as you install correctly, it will work.

I have the antenna mounted in the highest peak of my attic, snaked the coax cord down through a corner of a closet, to the base in my office. It worked. The range is limited, about 25 feet, but I have cell service again. It's frustrating to have to build my own \\"cellphone tower\\" for AT&T, but thats about what it boils down to."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will work","review":"I moved into an office that got poor cell phone signal. I first got the single band from radio shack. It was just okay, but later I got the dual band because of others in my office. Dual band is a better product. It came with a bigger antana and got better signal. If you are planning on getting one, spend a little more to get the dual band. Only reason I gave a 4 stars in place of 5 is, occationally I will still get a droped call or less bars on my phone. But overall it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of works","review":"I was able to get the unit to work, but the area in which it increases the signal is only about the size of your living room. If that is all you need it would work great, but I was looking for it to at least cover most of my home. It did increase the living room size area by 2-3 bars, but signal in one room wasn't worth the price. I've decided to just forward my cell phone to my house phone when I am there. That gives me a perfect signal :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"The YX510 dual band repeater works well. I bought it mainly for a Verizon broadband USB modem that was only getting at best 2 bars and sometimes none. As soon as I hooked up the zboost (with the signal antenna at the roof peak), I went to 5 bars. I was getting RSSI of -100 and up and that went to -65 so I am getting a good signal to the USB modem now. I went from download/upload speeds of 100/75 to 650/250. I have the zboost sitting right beside the laptop so I cannot speak for range. I haven't tried it with my cell phone but its bars went up, too. It is a tad pricey, but it makes broadband possible for me whereas my only other choice would have been Hughes Net satellite which isn't getting such great reviews from users and is not portable at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased and very satisfied","review":"I received the wireless extender YX510 [ASIN:B000J2XZ1K Wireless Extenders YX510-PCS-CEL Dual-Band Cell Phone Signal Booster] and installed it in a short period of time. The extender did not give a better reception or bars on my cell phone. I then went and got a 10 foot piece of plastic pipe and raised the antenna so that it is 20 feet above my base unit. I live in a 40' RV and our reception in this area is terrible. Now whenever I turn on my laptop or cell phone I have the maximum bars showing. Also it speeds up my wireless card as far as downloading and surfing. No more dropped calls from anywhere in the RV. The neighbor next door could not believe how great his phone service became after I installed the repeater. Well worth the money invested and very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"injustice to 2pac","review":"pac hated jay's guts and this is sad seeing jigga steals his songs and making them pop cartoon silly stuff and beyonce is not a thug girl whatsoever if pac was here he'll slap jay z and take beyonce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny","review":"Lay Z&BoringYonce doing this weak re-make of 2Pac's cut. this cut is so boring&Predictable.the video is cool though.I never really cared for Lay Z's Flow.Beyonce is a dime a dozen Artist as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY FROM THEM","review":"They shipped the wrong size and wrong color.

Just broke but I feel that I got my $3.50 out of it.I won't buy another because the best thing about it was the glass, which broke for no apparent reason.The handle is cheap plastic that traps water under it when washed, so you have to take the screw out each time. My screw was without a driver fitting, no Phillips or flat-tip slot, so I had to set it down on a paper towel or rubber jar-gripper and push down pretty hard on the handle to unscrew it.The screw seemed to be rusting, mostly on the threads but had suspicious-looking discoloration on the head. Pretty sure it wasn't stainless, but it should be. I was already thinking about a replacement screw or/and getting the local glass guys to make something. Meanwhile, using the Pig press but I'd rather have glass.Just too much overhead for a piece of junk and probably not worth the fuel to ship it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hampton Glass Bacon Press","review":"[...]This bacon press broke into 5 sharp, large pieces while I was cooking with it the second time.This is an inferior product-the glass is NOT tempered, so it is liable to break at any time.

I had used it before on bacon with luck, but on lower heat it broke.THIS ITEM NEEDS TO BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET---IT IS DANGEROUS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, needs better execution","review":"Being able to keep an eye on your bacon so you don't overcook it is a great way to protect your daily floppy rations from being consumed by the unwashed masses who think bacon is supposed to be crispy. Having said that, I have two complaints with this product:1) The glass is highly susceptible to temperature shock, and is thus prone to cracking.2) If you're not actively purging the grease from the pan, some of it will get on top of the glass and get under the plastic handle, leaving visible grease deposits which don't come out in the dishwasher -- you need to get a screwdriver and remove the handle from the glass to clean it out.So, alas, my wife will continue to benefit from my short attention span while cooking my morning bacon, at least until someone can invent transparent cast iron."},{"rating":"1","title":"USELESS & BREAKS!","review":"I ordered 2 - because the one I had before (not bought through Amazon) lasted about 5 years.

Unfortunately, Katharine doesn't give much away. I can't help feeling that this is deliberate - if you really want to know how to run a concierge service, she wants you to use her consultancy services.If you are serious about going into business, you will need a lot more information than is contained in this book, and you probably don't have a bottomless budget.

Also, Beauty and the Beast had the old charmingly innocent 'he is good' 'he is bad' mentality. This movie is masterfully done to make it enjoyable for people of all ages to watch. Just recently I saw a toddler watching it. Then later, I noticed a group of 15-year-olds watching it and laughing at the jokes, then an adult or two peeked in and were enjoying it.

However, instead of talking animals, we have talking objects, formerly the staff of the Beast before the enchantress cursed him and his entire household along with him. Beauty isn't some pretty and helpless girl at the mercy of her mean sisters - she is a strong-spirited and intelligent woman who loves to read, so is a very much likeable character.

But Close!!","review":"This movie, I remember watching it in 1992 thinking about how they made this movie. Was it based on a true story?? Of course not! Most people think it is and it's not. The idea of a talking beast and the falling in love Belle had for the beast, is almost as good as the mermaid who fell in love with a human. At least it's not a fish and a human but a beast and a human. This movie is one of the best Disney movies besides The Little Mermaid. I give this movie 4 stars cause it's almost as good as The Little Mermaid. Good job Disney!! I wish this orignal as still avaible for buys. Anyway, good job Disney!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and Beautiful","review":"I received this item fast! Was sent Monday and arrived Wed or Thurs (I didn't check my Mailbox Wed...oops).

You also get 3 versions of the film... A Special Edition With a new scene added in, The Original 1991 version that was released to theaters, and the work in progress version of the film.NOTE: It is in widescreen... The restoration blows the mind and words can't even begin to tell you just how beautiful the movie now looks. It makes you see this film in a new way..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed DVDs, even when authentic!","review":"I ended up trying two differentBeauty and the Beastdiscs (purchased directly through Amazon, and definitely the real Disney article) and found a serious play flaw in the same spot in each. Each disc cut off the end of the same scene when watched in \\"original theatrical release\\" mode. When we tried \\"extended release\\" mode, they finished the scene, but then jumped back to the beginning of the movie! Amazon was great to deal with re: replacement/returns, but when I asked about maybe trying a different lot, Amazon's answer was that only option open to me was to try purchasing through someone else. Buyer beware! There are a bunch of other versions available, so don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware of bootleg!","review":"I suggest you contact seller prior to purchase to make sure you are not receiving a bootlegged copy when buying a used item. We suspected this was a bootlegged copy, so we contacted Disney. To describe the bootleg to you: the printing looked almost professional except it had a copied look to it; the \\"select angle\\" button came up a lot while we were watching it, although usually at the chapter marks; the picture was very pixelated while we were watching it when there was a lot of action in the scene. After speaking to Disney, also, the underside of the disc says, \\"Beauty and Beast Disc 1 D9A.\\" I was told by their representative that Disney doesn't print the name of the movie on the underside; rather, they print a barcode. And we were asked to report it."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN ILLEGAL COPY OF MOVIE THAT DOESN'T WORK!!!!!!","review":"I received the movie and wrapped it of my 4 year old daughter.

Gaston does and my, what a guy!

She did not believe me and basically told me I was wrong and I need to change my opinion about her because she is trying to make a living. I do understand that people are trying to make a living, however, when a customer complains about a product that was sent to them I feel like you should try and make the customer happy. This was not done. The movie was reviewed by a professional and it was a bootleg. Everything was copied. If I wanted a copy of a copy I would have went down to a corner somewhere and bought a copy. Amazon refunded my money to me immediately so I will give amazon 5 stars for working with me, If I could give the seller 0 I would but I have to give one because that is the only way you can comment. I would give a 0 because she was not nice or cooperative at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality DVD","review":"I ordered this for a friend's daughter before Christmas but, due to our busy lives/schedules, couldn't give it to her until a couple months later.

It's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong message to kids","review":"This movie is my daughter's favorite Disney film. It is also the one animated Disney picture I will never own. The message in this movie is that your ill-tempered, immature, violent boyfriend will change if you just love him enough. I don't want my daughter or her twin brother to think that abuse on any level - verbal, physical, psychological, etc. (all of which Belle tolerates) is ever okay. Especially not in a kids movie. Haven't we learned YET that childhood - early childhood - is where seeds are planted??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Something WRONG","review":"Does anyone else find it disturbing that the \\"beautiful\\" witch turned a little boy (albeit selfish) into a monster? If you'll listen to the song \\"Be Our Guest\\", you will find out that they've been rusting in the castle for ten years. And considering that the magical rose withers completely on his 21st birthday, I find it unbelievable that anyone could justify the actions of the beautiful witch....who had nothing better to do with her time than pick on an 11 year old boy. I don't know about you, but I would advise MY children not to let strangers into the house either."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the?","review":"This thing [stinks]! Don't buy this whacked thing!I thought it would be goog, boy was i wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beauty and the Beast","review":"Yep, Disney animation. All my students see this movie at some point between leaving high school and when I meet them as university students. Sometimes, their Chinese university teachers show it to them in class. So, I thought I'd see why they love it so much. I'm still wondering. This is a two-page short story, not a film. But on the bright side, if you skip all the songs it's under an hour. I've never enjoyed a singing toon in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Music Stands Out.","review":"In my mind the best Disney to date. The soundtrack from the last seven Disney films has been excellent... This started with The Little Mermaid and peaked with Beauty and the Beast. Aladin and The Lion King are also stunning. I think from then on has been less memorable and yet still of a high standard.If you're in the right mood then it's worth a watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Again Disney","review":"I'm giving this edition a 1 star rating because Disney messed up the video quality. By including 3 versions of the film onto a single disc, the result is high video compression. The low quality is noticable on larger tv screens. As a friend of mine said before, this should've been a 3 disc set w/ 1 version on each disc. Wait til it's reissued if you want a high quality dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Commenting on 3D Quality Only","review":"I was dreading watching this movie in 3D as I had ordered this along with the Lion King, and was very disappointed in the 3D quality of the Lion King. However, I was pleasantly surprised that the 3D quality of Beauty and the Beast was much better than the Lion King. Yes, there was a bit of ghosting and some of the 2D layering effect, but overall it was fairly well done, considering it was a 3D \\"retrofit\\" and not done in 3D originally. If your budget only allows for 1 Disney 3D movie and you are trying to figure out whether to buy this one, or the Lion King, I'd recommend this one (at least on the basis of the 3D--you would have to decide which story you like better.)What really throws me is that both movies were released at the same time in 3D, and the 3D quality is so different."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best animated features of all time","review":"Like I said, this is one of the best animated features ever made.

There are sometimes where you can tell the difference between scenes that were remastered better then others but overall the colors were fantastic.

If you are a Beauty and The Beast lover then you will be astounded at the details you can see with this re-mastered blu-ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Discs? Give me a break...","review":"This product is a bunch of extra padding in order to explain its exorbitant price.Its the entire 2-Disc DVD edition packed in with the single disc Blu Ray to avoid any extra (heaven forbid) production effort. 1 Blu-Ray could effortless hold all of this, but instead we get a sub par set filled with tons of SD featurettes -- just so they can say \\"3 discs\\" and justify the high price. This is not in the spirit of Blu-Ray, and makes the product come off as cheaply inflated. Quality products justify their price, but throwing excess plastic at us is not the way to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beauty and the Beast \\"Platinum Edition\\"","review":"I bought 2 of the DVD's for $30.00 each and they seem not to be the authentic product from Disney. The packaging looks grainy and contains spelling errors and typos galore.

The animation doesn't look hand drawn anymore its like DIsney is trying to convert the magic of the old disney films into the crappy animation of newer kids movies. The coloring wasn't bad and neither was the sound, its simply that it seems like the artistry of the original movie isn't in the new release. Luckily the DVD version looks good on a LCD tv but still not on a plasma. My parents have the original VHS release of this movie and I would rather watch it a million times over this \\"newer edition\\". I wish Disney would just leave their classic movies alone they were amazing in their original production.

My mother-in-law and I went to see the movie five days before my daughter was born. I cried in several places and decided that Beauty and the Beast was the best over all production of its kind that I had ever seen. Of course, we bought the video to share with my daughter and she has heard my story about seeing the movie just before she was born. She is now 18 years old and will be leaving for college in any a couple of weeks. She decided this year that the \\"Special Platinum Edition\\" of Beauty and the Beast would be the perfect birthday gift for me this year. And it was!!!

However, Beauty and the Beast is the top billing amongst all of Disney's masterpieces.This movie was incredible not only in the way that it captured a classic love story known throughout all ages and presented it in a way that appeals to the masses, but it also combined incredible animation techniques of simple pencil animation and state-of-the-art computer animation (which is shown in the infamous ballroom scene).I feel that this film opened many doors in animation with the animation, the presentation of the story, and the music that moves and supplements the picture.Besides, the fact that this was the first animated movie to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar just goes to show that this is truly a beauty of a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing 3-D","review":"I have a huge collection of BD and DVDs.

I for one will boycott ALL such Disney 3D titles over $30 and hope that they get the message and reduce them down to less than the cost of new 3D movies like Tangled, et al, and more in line with similar products from other studios.

No wonder blu ray is struggling in the market place.

In a time where sounds are being exploited and caving in on each other, The Aislers Set moves from genre to genre mastering each while at the same time preseving a unique integrity that makes their albums exquisite. This is their best yet! Each song is masterfully crafted, brilliantly self contained and not overdone. From pseudo-gospel tunes to Phil Spectorish to good indie rock, this album has it all.It is nice to have a band that isn't self-indulgent lyrically and avoids that \\"emo\\" sound and feel which really keeps some good bands from being great. A panoply of sounds from sleigh-bells to 2001 like heart-beat rhythms provides this album with a feeling that grows on you. Smart, beautiful, and at times ethereally delicious, this album is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Aisler Set: indie darlings.","review":"I'd have to say this status is much deserved.

Philip Warner recreates a complete picture of daily life in a medieval castle: how peasants and nobles lived; how men fought in tournaments and trained for combat; how castles were sited, designed, managed, attacked and defended; and what the the people who lived in them ate, drank, and wore. This book will also go a long ways toward breaking up some of the preconceived notions that people have about castles. One learns that the castle was not primarily a refuge. The object of the castle wasn't to retreat from conflict, but to control it. The Medieval castle was a dynamic integral part of medieval society and Philip Warner does brilliant work in showing this. Whether you're a medieval history buff or just a curious layman read this book. It will take a little effort to find it, but it's worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exelent buy","review":"This is a great book. Easy to read. Covering most aspects of castle life.

I've never had this problem with other headphones.

There are a variety of age ranges, mainly for women from teens to late 20s and there are a variety of lengths to suit auditioning needs.

I had the chance to see it at a festival in Rochester last year (I came from France to see it and meet Charlie David) and it will stay one of my best memory ever.Gay or hetero, you will love this touching story.

Lots of drama and some suspence. The emotional twist was a little weak, but it worked. It causes me to wonder how many gay men, for fear, ended up in heterosexual relationships and fathered children, only to face up to their sexuality later in life. This film looks at what might happen with the betrayal and emotional damage that happens when the truth is revealed. It can be devastating for all involved. The cat is out of the bag. One can never go back in the closet."},{"rating":"1","title":"sadly disappointing","review":"The potential story here is sullied by very poor storytelling. The characters are mere caricatures of people, we are \\"told\\" how we are supposed to feel by the constant insertion of melodramatic music, right on cue after certain \\"pivotal\\" moments, and the character transformations are superficial and scripted. This film comes across no greater than a typical Lifetime movie, and that's being generous. It's frustrating because both the reviews of others and the previews depicted a potentially good story line. And it had potential. It was just delivered in such a shallow manner that it fails to achieve more than the slightest of emotional impact, and little credibility to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trials of Love","review":"This is another great moving which shows how love in the gay world can lead to complications and also happiness and friendships.

Among the many abysmal \\"Conan\\" ripoffs in the 1980s, this is the ultimate full-scale stinker of the bunch. That being said, I love it. I once owned the soundtrack (on LP, needless to say), which included the immortal theme song. I even submitted the title to Mystery Science Theater 3000 as something they oughtta take a look at. And, after I moved to Austin, TX at the turn of the century, I knew I was where I belonged when I saw a \\"Yor\\" movie poster in the lobby of the Alamo Drafthouse.I would never, in a million years, buy this on DVD, but it's completely worth seeing: atrocious acting (by Reb Brown, the master), astonishingly bad special effects (flying creatures that are actually paper kites), and, of course, the legendary theme song (\\"Yor's world, he's their man, he's gonna make all those wild beasts look tame tonight!\\").

The reamining seven chapters covers network design, wireless bridges, access points, client adapters, WLAN security and accessories. A great deal of information.

Having seen it on DvD before, however, I must count off several stars for the terrible video quality of this download. The resolution is ridiculously low for something that was purchased; much less than the DvD would have been. In addition, the bottom of the screen has been cut off, removing the most important aspect of the ballet--the dancing!

There are bits and pieces of valuable insights in the text. On the other hand, it seems evident from the introduction on that the book lacks a clear direction or purpose. Despite some useful comments, it is hard to know what to make out the total picture. I was never clear where McKechine had left, or where he was heading. The book has value, but I came away unsatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still The Greatest Stroy Ever Told!","review":"Very well done, although its been done before. . . Mailer does an excellent job of personifying the Christ spirit using modern day language and struggles. HIs ability to articulate the conscious and struggles of the children on God, through the Christ character is uncanny. This book was a joyful experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't add enough to the Bible","review":"This book has some merit, but does not add enough to the portrayal of Jesus in the gospels to make it deserving of more than two stars. I liked Mailer's simple prose, which displays little of the show-offishness of The Fight, and the way in which he links the familiar events of the gospels, but otherwise I found the book slightly uninspirational. Jesus is portrayed as very human, and as grappling with the problem of how to handle his status of Son of God and the powers that go with it, but this is not a remarkable insight on the part of Mailer. I would think that anybody who has read the Bible with a sense of curiosity would have considered this as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Omnipotent god?","review":"In a universe engineered and operated by an all powerful, all caring and all knowing god... how can bad things happen? Well, god could be less than omnipotent and this is the god Mailer shows us. Kiind, caring and loving but deficient in power so as to be unable correct earths injustices. How real!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"A previous review says that the book doesn't fulfill the promise of the early chapters, I read the first twelve and am already dissapointed. Some reviewers have said the book is worthwhile for pointing out the gospels are probably not news reports but have some fictional elements. \\"Big deal!\\"...any observant person can figure this out. Mailer's portrayal looks to be as biased as any other biographer has been, except he's gaudy enough to write it as autobiography. The Jesus here is a boring, flat character. I wanted to discover a compelling leader, I met someone a good deal less interesting and powerful than some of my friends. Mailer could have done so much more with this book. The only redeeming quality is his portrayal of Satan and some of the other characters who get less attention in other writings. Nothing could be worse, or less true, than a Jesus no one was interested in or concerned about, which was how reading this book made me feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment. Not worth reading.","review":"Only through a newspaper interview with Norman Mailer, could I understand the purpose of the book and appreciate the research and work that went into it. The book itself is less than enlightening, and less than literature. I had the feeling that Mailer, during these Christian times, had either to avoid saying anything controversial, interesting or challenging - or he had overestimated the value of the intellectual and spiritual ideas which he had hoped to share with his readers. The only interesting element in the work is that he used the first person voice to represent the largest of all historic figures. The Christ as portrayed by Mailer could never have gotten out of his own times. Mailer would do well to stick to the world he knows which certainly offers him enough ideas for his writing talents. Frankly, this book is not worth reading - even taken as a small entertainment, the reader will feel he could have spent his time better elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A conservative re-telling of the Gospels","review":"When I saw that Norman Mailer had written a book about Jesus I expected a searching biography of the man. For some reason I didn't expect Mailer to closely follow the Gospels. But he did, and I was disappointed. I already read the Gospels, more than once. I'd like to read a book that leaves out all supernatural occurrences and just focuses on a human being who has been very influential. This isn't the book. Personally, I don't believe in the miracles reported in the Bible, and I was hoping for an incisive biography of a great man. The book I want on this subject hasn't been written yet, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"When a good idea goes bad...","review":"I had heard ravings about Norman Mailer and the controversy around his books for so long, that I finally felt I had to read something of his just to feel like I wasn't missing the boat. Well, I don't know if I just picked the wrong one or what, but I do not understand what all the fuss is about.The Gospel According to the Sonis a self-proclaimed autobiographical story of Jesus' life. There have been tremendous arguments about the validity, taste, and appropriateness of the story. The controversy alone made me want to read it. The controversy may have made for good reading; the book did not. Mailer's writing style was not to my taste at all. The book felt contrived, like he was deliberately trying to provoke rather than story-tell. Now, admittedly, he may have been - in which case he was successful in his own goal. But even so, to me as a reader, that resulted in a very unsatisfying reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking Christ Point-Of-View.","review":"The Gospel According to The Son, is a well written, thought provoking book written from Christ's point-of-view. If Jesus Christ had written an auto-biography this would be it. It gives you a feeling of insight to what it must have been like for Christ to be \\"God with Us\\". The stuggle of being both Man & God is beutifully told in this book. If it isn't now this book should be considered a classic work of christian writting."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the bible?","review":"I found Mailer's book to be uplifting. I feel he helped personalize Christ without any major changes from what was reported in the Bible. Mailer helped to humanize the Christ and make him easier to understand and a bit closer to man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why'd he bother?","review":"It is hard to find any compelling reason for Mailer to have written this book. There is little that is imaginative or new in this telling of the Jesus myth. Reading this, one would believe that scholars have discovered nothing about the life of Jesus since the gospels were written. Mailer's Jesus does nothing more than parrot the words put in his mouth by the gospel writers. Why not create a Jesus that would have been a product of his times, not one who is 20th century creation? Such a creation would have been worthy of Mailer's considerable talent. This \\"Gospel\\" can safely be ignored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doubting Jesus","review":"Mailer was on to something when he decided to write the story of Jesus from Jesus' perspective. But more often than not, I think he missed the boat. The characters have no depth, the book is a light weight read. He could have doubled the length of the book, slowed down and given more consideration to his characters and the book would have been better for it. What did I like? I liked that Jesus doubted the value of his followers, I liked that he wasn't \\"attached\\" to his mother, I liked that he saw that comfort in religion begets apathy and greed, I liked that he saw his followers taking liberties by exaggerating his life and miracles, and I liked that Jesus doubted his own commitment to his Father."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mailer's best book since \\"The Executioners Song\\"","review":"While I do not consider myself religious, I have read the New Testament many times (read: childhood education). It may be this familiarity with the Gospels that helped make this book such an entirely enjoyable experience. Mailer's effort here made Jesus Christ seem so human and believable. It made Christ seem very plausible - while at times in the past the whole story has come off a bit impossible. Or if not impossible at least recollections of admirers done 40 years later. I know some may find the whole idea sacreligeous, I instead found it thought-provoking and a real page turner. I can't always say that this topic has that same effect on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"No knock-out punch for the man who would be Hemmingway.","review":"Mailer falls short; but thank heaven the book is far shorter than his dismal \\"Harlot's Ghost\\". The author's ego -- battling \\"The Old Man & The Sea\\" for short novel, and \\"Last Temptation\\" for literary significance (both Nobel efforts) -- work's at humility in the first person and in doing so fails as a writer. The writing is as weak as any in terms of basic expository rules; at times it is smug, which is 180-degrees from humble.No American author has neglected his responsibility to literature more than Mailer. Fictionalized Journalism does not a Nobel Prize earn. The fiction here is totally lacking; as are active verbs, visual descriptions, writing as showing rather than telling. It's as though Mailer read the New Testament and then summarized it to a cronie over a few drinks at the bar, wet-minded enough to use the first person.A Passionist's prayers at the fourteen stations would be more revealing and uplifting and honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, But Uneven","review":"Mailer was looking for a miracle, but he will have to settlewith some broken bread and fish. The autobiography of Christ excellsin describing Satan's temptations and Judas, but boggs down in an irritating attempt to find Christ's dialect. While the introduction mocks the traditional gospels, Mailer too closely follows Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. The story spends too much time down by the Sea of Gallilee, then rushes at the end. God help us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite waste of time from Mailer who coud do better.","review":"Although this book was a great opportunity to add something tothe literature on the new paths of Christianity, it was a greatdisappointment instead. Although an occasional insight shows through, it is by and large, a superficial rehashing of the story of the New Testament with a few speculated thoughts of Jesus thrown in parenthetically. No surprises, no great controversies, no substance! Mailer has done so well in the past; I only wish this book did not have to be in his list of creations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I just finished this book. The reading was easy enough and I kept with it because I was hoping it would get better. The one word I have for the book, however, is *dull*.When I first read the cover for this book, I thought, \\"Well, this should give a new slant to the gospel, a shift in perspective to the story of Jesus.\\" I was sorely disappointed.Mailer seems to have simply pulled out much of the sayings from the traditional gospels and changed up some of their chronology and shifted the narration into first person. Otherwise, not much is different. His Jesus seems as distant from his own story as any of the New Testament writers who recounted what had been passed down to them.There seems very little passion in this protagonist. Ironic isn't it? Mailer's Messiah does not have the charisma to gather the following of crowds, much less interested readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus Rolling over on His Cross","review":"Argh! What a boring turkey of a novel this was! Mailer and Updike like to snub their noses and proclaim from their mighty recliners that THEY know literature. And if so, they can have it! I read this on a recomendation from a friend, well, and ex-friend. I'm sure he's coffee house hopping as I write this. Don't be fooled by pretentious blather... this isn't literature, just a vain attempt at it. I should have listend to Tom Wolfe when he said this book \\"sunk without a bubble!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"fundamentally mistaken","review":"In many ways this reminds me of Marion Bradley's Mists of Avalon: beautifully and persuadingly written and so completely believable if you enter the world of the author's imagination of how the story really is - but I believe both to be basically false. Mr Mailer seems to have little understanding of \\"true\\" spiritual experiences or of Biblical symbolism, or of what Jesus was really all about. But rather than keep on criticizing and putting people off of my comments, I would merely recommend they read the Reverend Sun Myung Moon's explanations of Jesus' life and examine how Rev Moom is seeking to fulfill Jesus' mission in our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conventional retelling of the story of Jesus","review":"For the most part, this retelling of the Gospel stories adheres closely to the familiar text. Indeed, Mailer seems to make a point of quoting all the idiomatic sayings that have passed into English from the New Testament. He has also avoided the risk of assasination by fundamentalists by affirming the miracles performed by Jesus.I expected Satan to be an attractive character, the kind of figure bound to go far in human society.An insight that got me thinking was Mailer's characterization of greed as the outcome of fear. It has been said that those two emotions are what drive the stock markets -- but they are two sides of the same thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Mixed Bag","review":"I really wonder if Mailer only wrote this after a bet, a dare, or a few beers, or all three. It's a sometimes adequate....at times very insightful and moving....rewrite of a Gospel. But, gees, Norm, this is a damn serious subject about a very complex guy.... couldn'ya have tried just a little bit harder? The characters (especially Jesus) are flat and dull. The overall story is dead boring. Where Mailer has a flash of insight, the dialogue and monologues are good....where he doesn't, he simply quotes the Gospels literally....those parts are intensely irritating. Come on, Norm. Next time you want to do a serious work, stay away from your mates and stay off the piss. And do a bit more thinking and research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old Stuff","review":"There is little which is new or interesting in this book. Mailer has attempted to write a autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth. Ultimately, he write just another version of those 19th Century lives of Jesus in the first person. If you want to read a really good, modern life of Jesus, by suggestion is the Last Temptation of Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointing: adds nothing new to the tale","review":"While an enjoyable read, this story adds very little to theknown tale of Jesus. Neither his divinity nor his humanity isexplained beyond what we already know, except in the most obvious manner (Early on, Jesus questions his divinity - Gee! What an insight!).It seems Mailer, oddly enough, tries to avoid controversy and gives us a nicely told, but ultimately redundant story. The big question for me was, \\"Why did he bother?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"Norman Mailer offers neither incite nor a controversy in this blended tale of the four canonical Gospels as told from the view point of their central character. Many texts from the historical Jesus studies and the complete Gospels offers a more fascinating tale. Mailer maintains both divine birth and resurrection. His commentary on Judas was interesting. Unfortunately the book had the rapidity of Mark and none of the capable depth of Mailer"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Atmospheric Ghost Story","review":"This is my first Dan Simmons book. I found it a good atmospheric story to be read on a cold winter night in a drafty house. And if you happen to have a fireplace, so much the better. Yeah, the flashback scenes with Clare are tedious, and I found myself utilizing my speed reading skills to mercifully get me through those sections; but I guess they were needed for 'the setup'. Other than that, a good campfire story for adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sequel....sorta","review":"I guess you could call this a sequel. To be honest, this is just an excuse to write a sequel, maybe for sales purposes. Anyway, this book could have been almost as effective without characters from previous books, with the exception of one instance.Story has a good, creepy vibe and a couple of spooky moments that will make your skin crawl. I actually liked this one better than Children of Night, which is supposed to the origin story.The way the end of this book wraps back around to the first book is a clever little trick though....."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a good read.","review":"The flow of interest was good. Although it didn't really get moving until close to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Is Reality?","review":"Being inside the head of Dale Stewart is not a happy place to be. He is holding on to his sanity by his fingernails, if that much. When Dale's world starts to unravel due to a rather pedestrian failed adulterous relationship, enough inertia is imparted on the character to push him in the direction of his boyhood home. Once there, old nightmares come to haunt and new dangers threaten his existence.But the question Dan Simmons poses is: Are the dangers real or do they only exist in Dale's head? Simmons doesn't force a standard ending down the readers throat, which may leave some feeling unsatisfied. But, I enjoyed the lose strings and unanswered questions (especially the one about the receipt for the Christmas ham). Are we going to be allowed to find out what happens next? Only time and Simmons' muse will tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long winded and wordy","review":"This was a three page story, and not very good at that, bloated into book length. Scarey? Only in the fact I had purchased this book and wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's No Stephen King","review":"Being not a Simmons afficionado I can't fairly say that he is a bad writer; but if \\"A Winter Haunting\\" is any example of his writing, I must say that I won't be reading any more of his work. I thought \\"A Winter Haunting\\" lacked substance, and feeling. The main character goes back to a spooky abandoned farmhouse where his best friend, the brilliant Duane, was killed in a nasty farming accident. And this is all the pretense Simmons gives you. He messes around with some mysterious hounds, takes a lot of walks (Lord have mercy, does this character walk!), and finds himself attracted to a lesbian; gets his tires slashed, not once, but twice by a group of \\"belligerent youths\\", aka skinheads. All in all, I give this novel two thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disappointment","review":"I absolutely loved Summer of Night and was eagerly waiting the sequel. Upon reading it I was very disappointed. It seems that Dan Simmons is an author who is losing his touch. In no way was this how I thought the main character of Summer of Night would turn out. The story has poor pacing and a pretty stupid plot. Simmons seems to want us to come away with the opinion that the events in Summer of Night were subjective and perhaps a hallucination. If you want a better sequel look towards Children of the Night or Fires of Eden, both of which have characters from Summer of Night in them. Avoid this book unless you are a diehard Simmons fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor plot. Not scary.","review":"I read, and liked, \\"Terror.\\" The next book, by Simmons, I read was \\"Drood\\"-- which I liked nearly as much. Searching for a good \\"haunted house\\" tale, I gave this one a shot. To be brief: the book is not scary. The book is about a middle-aged, suicidal-depressive, who (probably) has some unsettling hallucinations. Stick with M.R. James if you want a ghost story by a master teller. Sorry Dan, this one was a real dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"Summer of Night (this is the sequel) is one of my favorite horror novels. Its very similar to Stephen Kings It and if you're a fan of It I highly recommend you check Summer of Night out. This followup though couldn't be more different. Its about one of the kids from Summer of Night as a grownup. He comes home and stays at this farm haunted by one of the other kids from Summer.. who died in that novel. Where as Summer... was full of action and interaction between the kids and Lovecraft like monsters, this is just the sole character hanging around. Its slow and not very scary. take a pass and try Boys Life by McCammon instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can someone explain the end to me?","review":"First, I didn't realize this was a sequel. Second, Drood and The Terror were good books. Third, this book was not good.Can someone explain the ending to me? I became totally lost as to who the narrator was and what really happened throughout the story. Seriously, if someone could just comment (with a spoiler alert) and break this down for me I'd really appreciate it. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simmons must be a Peter Straub fan too","review":"This book is a paint-by-numbers ripoff of Peter Straub's If You Could See Me Now. If you've read Straub's book, don't waste your time on this twice-told tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO not scary .....","review":"I used to love reading Simmons - but no more. It's seems as if he goes to the library, reads up on a subject, then sprinkles the findings of his research into his latest novel - whether it has anything to do with the story or not. In this case: not. There's a blurb on the back cover from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch which says, \\"One of the scariest and most unnerving ghost stories to come along in quite some time.\\" Wow - I wonder what that guy was smoking. The tip off should have been the blurb by Stephen King on the cover which says, \\"I am in awe of Dan Simmons\\", which doesn't refer to this book or ANY book. He's probably in awe that Simmons can get away with publishing this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful sequel","review":"Very disappointing sequel to SUMMER OF NIGHT. If you enjoyed SUMMER OF NIGHT, I recommend staying clear of A WINTER HAUNTING, as it effectively ruins the first book, and most of its characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the edge of your seat","review":"I think this book is an on the edge of your seat kind of book. You are not sure what is going to happen next. Those are the kind of books I like it is not predictable like some I have read. I like a book that keeps my interest, a book I can't seem to put down, and I think this is that kind of book. Of course this is just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say it isn't so, Dan!","review":"Others here have adequately filled you in on enough of the plot of A Winter Haunting, so I won't rehash what's already been written. What I will say is this: if you are a true Summer of Night fan, if you've read it more than once and have enjoyed the other exploits of its characters as adults (Fires of Eden, for example)you may be sorely disappointed in this book, as I am. SPOILER .....After all is said and done, this \\"update\\" on Dale leaves the reader with the sad possibility that none of the true horror elements of \\"Summer\\" ever happened, and that this it (Summer) was Dale's memoir which has been tweaked by the ghost of Duane to spin it into a horror tale.Dan, oh Dan, say it isn't so!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to stay with","review":"I had a really hard time staying with this story.Some parts were good than it would very quickly get boring and drawn out,I found myself skipping over many pages.It is not a story that would stay with me,it just didn\`t keep my interest.Not even half as good as the prequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"a slow burn that culminates into an infernal climax","review":"Until I read A Winter Haunting, I had forgotten why I enjoyed Summer of Night so much. Simmons teases his readers with a level of suspense and fear that builds so very slowly and methodically that, by the end, the reader is mentally exhausted. Plus, the \\"twists\\" in the novel were truly unexpected, unlike the so called \\"surprises\\" in some novels that you can see coming from a mile away while blindfolded and passed out. It kind of reminded me of the movie, \\"The Sixth Sense\\", in that respect. While it still doesn't quite measure up to Summer of Night for me, A Winter Haunting is a more than worthy sequel that will make you question the bumps and creaks in the middle of the night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior Simmons","review":"I love Dan Simmons (especially the Hyperion books), but this one didn't work for me. He's a talented writer, and the book moves, but the whole haunting thing has been done soooooo many times that it really takes a fresh idea to make it worthwhile to read another book like this. This ain't it. I admire him for trying to write about a thoroughly damaged (and unsympathetic) main character. At the same time, I didn't like the character at all, which makes it hard to like a book like this. Full disclosure: I read Summer of Night, and didn't particularly like that either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sequel","review":"Very good book, spooky, psychological, basically a haunting novel. Dale returns to the place where the horrors of the Summer of Night took place, to the house where his best friend lived, who died so horribly. Ghosts, friendly and evil, pay him visits as he himself must fight his innerself and his past demons. Great job by Dan Simmons. An excellent sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great suspense book and an even better sequel","review":"Dan Simmons in one of the most talented authors around today. I have read almost all of his books and some are perfect (Hyperion series, Song of Kali) and some are just okay (Children of the Night, Carrion Comfort) but in all of them one thing is consistant, his writing. This book goes in the former category. It is much better than the book that precluded it and once is much better than any suspense/ghost story/mystery that I have read in a while. The way Dale is written really made me feel like I was privy to Dale's thoughts and feeling of insanity. I felt like I was going crazy halfway through the story.And the end.....I loved it. You'll know what I mean when you read it. Anyways, I give this five stars and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great New Find","review":"I like to find a new (to me) author and devour all that they have written. I randomly pick them from the horror or fantasy section of my local used book store. Dan Simmons is my new favorite. I am buying up his books and look forward to many great reads. A Winter Haunting had me scared enough that I wouldn't lie near the edge of the bed... the only disapointment that I have is to discover that I started with a sequel, now I know how the Summer Book ends. Oh, well, still a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy a good read","review":"After recommending \\"Summer of Night\\" to all my friends, I can add this tale to their short list as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened here?","review":"i recently began reading dan simmons' novels, and the two i started with are summer of night and winter haunting. after finishing summer of night, i was thrilled to find that winter haunting contained some of the same characters. i was expecting the same feeling of terror while i read it. the book was entertaining but definitely not as great as its predecessor. in fact, i was rather disappointed at the fact that the author could not keep continuity between the 2 books. i know they were written 10 years apart, but for goodness sake, some of the differences were really noticable. and i couldn't help but wonder if the intent was to totally negate summer of night. such a shame because it's such a wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"For Dan Simmon's, this is a very short novel. Why he would completely waste so many pages of it on the boring and trivial is beyond me. It starts out in a psychiatrists office where the distraught protagonist very calmly and drying describes what should be a horific dream yet it comes off about as scary as bad wallpaper. I must add that it is the most unrealistic therapy sesson I have ever read. Then novel bumbles along in dreary boringness.Does it get better. Technically, yes but not by much. If you haven't read Summer of Night, read that instead! If you have already read Summer of Night, do not touch this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One huge disappointment","review":"Anyone who has read Summer of Night will no doubt expect a superb follow-up with its semi-sequel, A Winter Haunting. However, this is not the case. Where the former was truly frightening and a page-turner, it was a struggle to read more than the first 20 pages of the latter. I found A Winter Haunting to be dull and uneventful, more a story about Dale's life and the problems of a small town than about anything scary. For the most part, a big disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Disappointed","review":"I was excited to read this novel before I even read Summer of Night...but now I just disappointed that I was excited to read it. It seems to me that Mr. Simmons just figured, \\"Hey, Summer of Night was a good book...eh... I'm low on cash, so I'll slop up this meaning-less sequel\\". I was deeply angered by a few things that I can't go into because it would spoil the book for future readers, but should have been included for faithful readers of Summer of Night.Also, in no way was the Dale in Winters Haunting the same Dale as in Summer of Night. I know the character obviously aged and had a few problems in life, but let's get real here.It hurts me to type this about a series and cast of characters I really feel for, but this book should not have been written, it's just a pile of crap that fails to entertain let alone make any sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUMMER of a Sequel","review":"Well sorry to say but cute little 11 year old Dale from that great book, Summer of Night, has not aged well. And I have to admit that I liked young Dale ALOT better than divorced, suicidal, clinically depressed, having an affair w/his student, 51 year old Professor Dale. Elm Haven hasn't aged so well either.I hate it when alot of stuff that happens is not explained at the end, think it's an easy way out for the author. Lots of loose ends in this book.I had high hopes for this sequel which were sadly not met. Don't waste your time or your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful...","review":"If it was possible to rate this album with zero stars, I would. Horrible! I actually threw it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"They weren't wrong with that sub-title.","review":"I purchased this book expecting a witty retort against the books it parodies. Instead, it appears to be a collection of every remotely relevant \\"email forward\\" that ever existed. These forwards are something I dislike receiving in my inbox, let alone actually paying money for.In addition to that, there are a number of errors that undermine its entire point - in one spot, it tests the reader's ability to spell the word \\"calendar\\", (ignoring that both \\"calender\\" and \\"calendar\\" are real words), giving multiple-choice-style options. Unfortunately, none of the multiple choice options actually matches the answer given. Considering the sub-title of this book, perhaps this is some level of sincerity that I fail to appreciate.I made the unfortunate mistake of expecting a large amount of original content that had at least been proofread. Silly me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Very high quality light fixture. Easy to put together. Exceeded our expectations, which were high. There is nothing cheap about this lamp. Could easily be a heirloom furniture item."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Wonderful Story!","review":"The first book in the double-book series of Lugh the Harper is quite wonderful. The detail the author offers is remarkable. The story is a fantasy in some respects, but it is also realistic. It's a story of love and vengeance, honour and cowardice, treachery and bravery quite like none I've read before. If you would like to know what this very distant past was like in the island of Ireland, you will certainly get a good idea by reading this book.he incidents and battles that occurred are remembered from legend and they are very carefully and completely described by this very talented author. Because the story is told in the first person by the narrator, who is Lugh, it gives a really personal slant to these events, and we as readers become directly involved. Luckily I have the sequel The Crow Goddess waiting for me to read right away. I truly want to find out what happens after the famous battle of Erin and Ulster in the second century AD."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice and easy","review":"It doesnt fit as nice as i will like to, but it work very nice... now im not as worried of taking a bad posture with mi 12 shotgun"},{"rating":"1","title":"NEEDUM PICTURES!!!","review":"Ah, fourty-five self defense moves. Shame that there are only thirteen pictures in it! OK, the book had some good concepts, and I'm sure that most of the self-defense lessons are servicable. However, the lack of photos is more than disappointing. I did like the fact that after every lesson, there was a \\"Concepts to Learn\\" portion. I'd like to see that in more books like this. In the beggining of the book, concepts, basic striking tools, and stances are covered, though not very well. Many of the terms used in the book are not explained well, or sometimes not at all, and this makes reading difficult. It's an OK book for a martial artist to use, mostly to incorporate into his self-defense studies, and also gives some insight into San Soo, but in that respect is by no means complete. It's a little useful, but may not be worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good,Could Be Better","review":"I'm not a San Soo practitioner; but,as an outsider, I believe that this book gives a fine \\"feel\\" for the art. The author writes in a manner that is simple and direct (a blessing in this type of book). Presented are the basic lessons which provide the San Soo student with a solid foundation of self-defense skills. It is clear that the author went to great lengths to preserve this material in as accurate a manner as possible. I certainly hope that he produces many more such works in the future. The only fault which I may find with the book is the relative lack of step-by-step photos to accompany the techniques. The text probably is sufficient to allow the reader to duplicate the moves, but more photos would remove all doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"One out of eight different versions.","review":"While Master Ron Gatewood goes to great lengths to claim that his version of the Basic 45 is the most complete and accurate version on the market, this is not the case. He is better than some, on average. But, he is also way off the mark at times as well. I am currently looking at eight different versions of the Basic 45, and examining them technique by technique, step by step within the lesson. I am looking for the common denominator, or common thread shared by all versions. This has been an enlightening project to say the least. Master Ron Gatewood does provide a slightly above average version of the Basic 45, but it is by no means the \\"be all - end all\\" version. However, the pictures are helpful, as well as the concepts page opposite of each lesson page."},{"rating":"2","title":"San Soo's Basic 45","review":"As a former San Soo practicioner, I find the book an excellent review of some of the foundations of this ancient art. Given that there are so many nuances to this art, one could not expect to become an expert with a review of this work, but unfortunately could learn enough to be dangerous-as opposed to cautious. The book delivers on it's promise to be as accurate a portrayal as can be delivered in print. I would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good air filter, easy to use","review":"This is a very good air filter, light to handle and easy to use. The Hepa filter is simple to put in.

After running it a few days with no change I returned this unit and recieved a new one with the same problem. I also talked to the manufacturer, KAZ, since it seemed like they got a bad batch of filters. They were willing to provide a new unit if I paid for the shipping. The status of this unit is still unresolved.I would not recomend this unit to anyone unless you can tolerate the smell of noxious organic materials - such organic vapors could even be carcinogenic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not created for long-term use","review":"We purchased this about a year ago.

If it was not sitting in the bedroom, it wouldn't be so bad, it is a good price for a hepa filter, but it doesn't move much more air than the $40 unit I had before, it is a top rated one from here as well (which also gave me the same trouble after 6 months of use - fan became out of balanced)Why such bright blue lights on these units? *sigh* I guess I will have to fork out >$200 for a better unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Product","review":"I've used Honeywell filters for many years and I've seen a gradual reduction in quality over the years.

They answer the phone right away, and will send you a brand new machine if you are having problems with it, if you send it back along with a ten dollar check.PS, I am a physician who has asthma and 3 long haired cats, and I think this machine is worth having in the home.

When the dog's in the room I still get a little congested but not as much as before. The Honeywell is not all all what I'd call \\"whisper soft,\\" as the first review I read described it, and I have started turning it to the low setting when the TV is on.

After the fist few days of use I was sleeping much better and my asthma was gone when I was at home. In addition, I wasn't sneezing from the high pollen count! So, in conclusion, I'm very happy with my Honeywell air purifier. A very good purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty chemical smell","review":"This filter gave off a nasty chemical odor. It seems to come from the rubber material around the HEPA filter and upset my allergies. I am sure that not all of them have this issue, but mine sure did! Quality control is not what it used to be I guess...And it was also way too loud! It was not at all quiet on Low, and on Medium I would have to jack up the volume of the TV. They chose to put the word \\"quiet\\" in the products name, it is not even close.Returning it to Amazon was easy, no issues. I have since purchased a Winix 5300 from Amazon and have been very happy with it. It has more advanced features then the Honeywell and is QUIET on low while still moving a lot of air!!! It is possible!Maybe if Honeywell decided to update their technology they could release a great product.

The HEPA filters will eventually absorb the smoke to a point where the unit will become unusable, as it will continuously blow out smoky air, regardless of where it is used. The HEPA filters will have to be replaced at a considerable expense. We are very disappointed in this feature flaw, as we purchased the unit solely for this purpose. THe HEPA filters cannot be cleaned. The product description talks about cleaning the air of smoke and while it certainly will do that, it does it at considerable expense and inconvenience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for six months, then wet dog smell","review":"The smell is unbearable.

It is also poorly and cheaply made, with some of the plastic seams not even bonded together, so it can be easily separated. In addition, it is supposed to come with small plastic pads to put on yourself to help with the cushion.

I'm returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Malfunctioned after 2 weeks!","review":"It's noisy and expensive - you can get that from reading the other reviews on this page.

We have bought the Hamilton Beach TrueAir 04381 Allergen Reducer Air Cleaner which is cheaper, smaller, and very quiet. Most importantly, it works!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LOUD & EXPENSIVE","review":"I bought this filter for my mom's house because she has bad allergies and has a cat. It is VERY LOUD, so she can not leave it on during the night while she sleeps. Also, the HEPA filters that you need to change out every year cost almost as much as the unit $60-$90 and you also have to buy another filter that is not as expensive $20 but you have to change out every other month. The 1-bedroom condo still smells of Tiger the cat, even though he sadly passed away several months ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"i waited several years","review":"I purchased the Honeywell 17000 a few years ago but wanted to wait to see how it performed before reviewing.

He wanted 300 dollarsThis unit did the job on that and many other things including pet odors.AND...it runs quietly"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"This air purifier worked really well in my house to get rid of some of the musty smell because I'm gone a lot. It also helped to clear congestion that I get every morning. I was so happy with this purifier that I told my mom to get one for her house too.A few of the other reviews said that it was noisy and I'm very noise sensitive so I was a little worried about that. When it's on the low setting, it's not any louder than your refrigerator when it's running or when your heater comes on. I actually leave it running at night in my bedroom on low and when I leave during the day, I'll turn it up to the highest setting.The filter was very easy to put in the first time, so it should be a breeze to change it when the time comes.The only thing that I didn't like was the purifier had a \\"new\\" smell as the instructions put it. It said that smell would go away quickly but it took about a week of running it full time on high before it was really gone.

We have had one for about a year so then bought 2 more. After we got that one a friend gave us theirs so now we have 4 of these running on hi at all times. The noise doesn't bother me anymore and we actually like it so we can sleep and not hear the cars driving by or the cats fighting outside :) My daughter doesn't touch it and I clean them every 4 months. The dust and crap I find on it makes me glad I have on in almost every room of our 4 bedroom house.I totally recommend this to people. It could be better if the other filter quality was better, total charcoal and not just a dusting of it.

I had it for years and the burning wire smell never subsided. You would walk into the room where the device was on and reel from the smell.

It smelt like burning metal? What a waste of 130 dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reasonably quiet","review":"I don't have another air cleaner to compare this to so my words may not be of much help. I bought this air cleaner used and I'm very happy with it. It's not too loud, I can sleep with it on even on medium. It definitely works, especially when I've blown out a bunch of scented candles and the room is filled with smoke. The smoke hangs in the room until I turn the air cleaner on then it's gone in what seems like minutes.

It is really noisy and kept even my deep sleeper husband awake. On the high setting it sounds about like a hair dryer on high. On the low setting it's still much louder than my portable fan that I use for white noise. After returning it I did more research and discovered that it had received a poor rating on air quality from Consumer Reports. I strongly recommend against this model. There are much better and quieter products out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't help my allergies at all","review":"I was suffering from respiratory allergies in a new home, and a friend recommended this product. I had high hopes, as my allergies (mold?) was making it hard for me to breathe (and live) in my home.I had this on for days at a time in my home office, which is where I spend most of my time. I noticed absolutely no difference in my condition after using it. Maybe it's because I was in other parts of the home as well - yet I even tried spending the night other places, where I don't have allergies, so that my time outside of the room I work in was limited.I would feel better when I was out of the house, but when I would come back, the symptoms would arise whether or not I had this purifier running or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honeywell 17000","review":"There are several versions of this air purifier made over the years:1700017000N17000-SSome with permanent filters, some don't.I assume there are difference in material/components between the models and therefor the difference on perceived noise of the unit.The Honeywell brand purifiers are made by Kaz.

It has only a 'dusting' of charcoal on the prefilter, which doesn't remove odors for long enough to be useful. The design is also bad: the air intake and outlet aren't well separated, so after a little use, it is putting out dusty air into the room.

Well... he got me! =DI read the entire darn thing while I was in my doctor's waiting room.Simply put, it's a very short story, nothing really to do with the original trilogy, and required no further thought process: you just read the story and is left with nothing to ponder over.Although it was not \\"terrible,\\" I would not recommend it.As a matter of fact, I gave the book to the friend that made me read the trilogy so he wouldnt waste his money!

I can't imagine the wait some people (who got this book back in 2003) have endured. Hopefully the new book will be out soon.

Most people reading the other books in the series will no doubt be good at reading (as they can be tough going sometimes)and this addition seems almost patronising.An ok book overall but if you wish to keep your opinions of Lyra and Will as they are left in the last book then I would discourage you from spending this much money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even if you love Lyra, it's not worth the Lira","review":"I enjoyed the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy as much as anyone, however this product just isn't a good value for the money.

The actual story inside; however, was extremely disappointing. We learn only the tiniest bit more about Lyra's life after The Amber Spyglass. The plot was not developed or intricate. What did I expect out 49 pages? An enjoyable story, that's what, not a turnabout mystery easily explained at the end like Scooby Doo cartoon.

This strikes me as the kind of thing, that is typically a bonus chapter, or first chapter of the next book, that you find at the end of a full sized novel.

He said he doesn't turn lead into gold. The book is easy to read but in some parts of the book it is hard to understand.If you like to use your imagination this is a great book for you.

Fitz-Enz focuses mainly on his days as a Lieutenant and Captain, and any officer of any branch of the Army can learn a great deal about creative leadership.

It's quite readable and detailed enough to provide a solid background for narrower studies or to provide Tang-specific information to a Chinese history generalist.

The band undeniably have a direct mid-period Katatonia influence, with up-tempo drum beats and inherently emotional riffs and lyrics, but the band also have some oft-overlooked clean vocals, adding a beautiful and majestic touch to the bleak and depressing atmosphere already on this album. Musically, the band is quite above average, creating some great dual-guitar interaction and crafting some truly awesome riffs. There are also some excellent acoustic atmospheric moments with clean vocals that provide a nice break from the depressive attack of the album. Depression is the keyword here. Check it out if you're into the up-tempo, mid-period Katatonia sound, or if you're just looking for some well-crafted, emotional music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Dark.....","review":"This album is beautiful dark metal at its best.

It covers sexuality in gaming in not just a fantasy setting, but in historical, modern, horrow, and future campaigns. The book is well crafted in that even if you are not using d20, you can easily adapt it for your setting. It does have ready made spells for d20, but this is a bonus, not something which draws away from the rest of the book.

I've always been a fan of Hayley Mills, since we are close in age. Maurice Chevalier with his wonderfully warm voice, and Wilfrid Hyde-White (remember how kind he was in \\"My Fair Lady\\"?)I even can admit now that I had a crush on Michael Anderson, Jr. This movie may seem a bit too 'nice' for some of our more potty-mouth movie fans, but it's a great fun family film, filled with one exciting adventure after another, (there should have been a theme park ride based on some of the action scenes) Curl up on the sofa with a hot cuppa, and just have a fun time watching the show.

I just viewed a rented version of this film only to discover that \\"Castaways\\" is only available in full screen format! This is a fine film and there is no good excuse for it to be limited to a full screen format. I remember seeing it in the theater as a young boy - and even then I vividly recall the widescreen picture. Don't buy this \\"shot in full screen\\" excuse. That is simply not true.

One sequence in particular, when the characters cling for their lives to a piece of ice SLIDING down a mountainside following a landslide, I believe inspired a similar (if not as logical) scene in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (Spielberg has long been a huge Disney fan!). On the other hand, like some Roger Moore 007 films, the plot is strung along so thinly between action scenes at times it's hard to recall how and why the characters got where they are! I'm not entirely sure, but based on a footnote in the Verne novel THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, I believe the book this is based on is actually titled \\"CAPTAIN GRANT'S CHILDREN\\".

They did this with \\"That Darn Cat\\" as well; another great movie I won't be purchasing because of the inferior quality of the DVD. They did this before when they first put out \\"The Absent-Minded Professor\\". Thankfully they put out another edition several months later that was in the original aspect, 1:66.

Instead I received a \\"Bonus\\" DVD which has a fairly nice introductory course on Mandolin playing. It is instructive and redundant as it just goes over most of the lessons in the book. I did not receive any CD with all of the musical lessons or back tracks as promised. So, after watching the DVD, I am left without any sound clues to work through all of the real lessons myself.Had I known this, I wold not have bought this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great classic ubers","review":"One of the best coming out novels, lesbian love stories, picaresque sociological treatises, or works of erotica that you will ever read. A monumental achievement (the author intends to write a novel length book about her characters for every letter of the alphabet) and a distaff look at life in S.F. every bit as significant as \\"Tales of the City.\\" Both of the ubers are young here and still in school, but it gives them an awful lot of memorable growth work to do for, with and towards each other. This would make a great series for the proposed gay channel, every bit as compelling as \\"The L Word.\\" And more romantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Found My Heart in San Francisco","review":"I think so highly of I Found My Heart in San Francisco that I have purchased extra copies of it and have given them to friends. The storyline is one that most readers will relate to and find interesting as well as entertaining and humorous. One of my major complaints with fiction that centers around lesbians is that so often I really don't care what happens to the characters because the author has not been able to pull me in to become emotionally involved. With Jamie and Ryan I did not have that problem at all; I loved them and the supporting cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very realistic","review":"As a lesbian who was engaged to a man when she came out, I can completely sympathize with what Jaime went through. The confusion and emotion are very real.The early part of the book - when the friendship between Jaime and Ryan is developing - is very well written and easy to read. However, once Jaime and her fiancee break up and Jaime begins to come out, the writing and the story become very cliched. The ending seems very rushed, like the author just wanted to get them together and didn't care how it was done.Overall, this is a good book. Just be prepared for a let-down ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Value but careful","review":"Buying these products in bulk will save you a dollar - but i have found that most of these 25 count testing strips expire in a year - not good when you are only going to test it on your self."},{"rating":"1","title":"selling my address is illegal","review":"It don't got nottin to do with the product as it is a medical item which they neithermanufacture nor replace with a generic version.The problem and it is a big one was the selling of my address to Stamps.com which emailed me three pages of adds to inform me that \\"something was mailedto me by TEST MEDICAL SYMPTOMS @ HOME\\".For that I also blame Amazon as I expect it to insure that its sellers respect the privacy of Internet Commerceturk"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Black and White","review":"Good book, lousy printing job (published should be shot.

TomTom apparently doesn't realize this, since Navigator 5 allows you to activate it exactly twice (on your original, and one replacement Treo), before it refuses to activate again. You'd think they'd be bright enough to cross-reference w/ the Treo device's phone number, or something along those lines, to realize that you are the very same person who paid good money for, and activated, the software previously. Instead, it just refuses to work.If you then follow the instructions from their Web site to resolve activation problems, you are eventually led to a screen which, while labeled Step 1 (of 3), is a broken Web page from which you can accomplish nothing.Shameful."},{"rating":"1","title":"The GPS unit stopped working in about two weeks and tomtom does not respond to my inquiries","review":"My wife got it new from Amazon in early December 2005.

It could not be turned on even it's fully charged.I filed the report on tomtom website three times and got no responses other than automatically generated ones. I was able to find the \\"support\\" phone number on its website on Jan 05, 2005, but that is a non-working phone number.

I doubt I'll use this for anything more elaborate (we already have enough editing software), but for transferring VHS to DVD fairly cheaply for the sake of permanence, it works fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supplemental use I discovered","review":"This is a handy gadget. One use I have found for it is to connect the component inputs on the Sony to the component output jacks(red, white & yellow) from my Panasonic LCD TV and use it as a replacement for VHS recording of TV programs. It suffers some loss of clarity, since it is analog, but it sure beats VHS tapes by using DVD+RW that can be recorded over up to 1000 times. It records in 1, 2 or 6 hour mode to a 4.7 gb DVDRW which can be played back in modern home DVD players.I don't believe SONY advertises this feature but it works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Similar to the review before mine.

If you don't mind hearing a loud static every few seconds then by all means buy it.Another problem is the format if you are like me you will want to make you own personalized menu's, well you can't do it with this machine it seems to have it's own format that looks like DVD but when you try to get the movie files you get an error.I really thought this was going to be the perfect DVR but it's not, no way near it.

This book stinks! The writing is juvenile, the ideas insipid, and the style awful. The best thing I can say about the book is that it's short. It didn't take me long to flip through the pages (most of them have lots of empty space on them) and reach the end. The arguments are short because Russo has no facts to back them up, only opinions. Russo's opinions stand alone about as well as a flamingo in a hurricane.This is the perfect gift for a sports-nut who doesn't read, or for people who need kindling for their fireplace."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"can't put down\\" read!!","review":"For anyone who has grown up playing or watching all sports like me- this is a MUST read.

His opinions are the opinions of a person with a very large ego. ie. \\"What I would do\\"The gift was purchased in good faith, but this book does not \\"cut it.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything You'd Expect from the Dog","review":"Any fan of \\"Mike and the Mad Dog\\" knows that the Dog has an opinion on almost everything sports-related. In this book, Chris Russo offers his opinion on 100 great sports arguments (though not each subject is really an argument), each without blatant subjectivity. Russo does not draw out his opinion over 20 pages, keeping each argument at around roughly 3 pages, which makes the book enjoyable because one can browse through the arguments that are not of interest. One doesn't have to read each argument and agree with everything Mad Dog says to find this book entertaining.

This canner is not meant to replace a pressure canner for low acid foods. It is a shallow pan with a rack and a large lid. The shallow pan is filled with water and boiled, the rack fits over the boiling water and the jars are put on the rack (7 quarts at a time). When the water boils, it creates steam- steam is at least 212 degree water- steam can actually get hotter than boiling water. When the steam is at a certain level (in the instructions) you begin timing your jars. The reason that this is so easy is that it doesn't take 20 minutes after you put your jars into the rack just to come back to a boil, thus saving a lot of time. I highly recommend this product. I just made salsa and it took me 30 minutes for 14 jars- In a traditional pot it would have taken at least 2 hours. That is the difference!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful","review":"I also can, and it was my first time to use this steamer this summer. My main reason to get it is to have a sterilizer while I use the BWB canner on another batch. If I was canning only one batch of high-acid foods, this would suffice, and it was indeed faster to process in this than in BWB. I would use a thermometer before I start timing the processing, at times I would even have to lower the heat setting as the temp was maintained anyway. Quite sturdy despite being lightweight. And since I don't have to wait to fill it with as much water as in BWB canner, it saved time in filling, heating the water, and re-boiling it for processing, and it remained light-weight! For its price, I already had a ROI for the abuse it got from me just from this past summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viperu3 3.5 in Usb3.0 Externalsata Aluminum Hdd Enclosure","review":"The product arrived in a well packed package.

But when I read on page 58 that the men aboard the Karluk were disheartened by the story of George Washington DeLong's expedition in 1879, and how the crew of the Jeannette had all perished (all 13 of them!!!) Anyone who knows their polar exploration literature knows very well that quite a few of the Jeannette's crew actually survived in one of the most amazing \\"triumph of the human spirit\\" stories in polar history. The entire world was shocked when they turned up alive in Siberia well after they'd been given up for dead. To misrepresent this story of survival as a doomed expedition from which no one survived as a way to explain the mounting dread in the Karluk's men ruined this book for me.

She kept on writing about the same hardships over and over. For example, she writes constintly about how cold they were. I knew that the first few times she wrote about it. Every new chapter I began to read just sounded like the one I just finished.I could not finish the book. If you want to read about an artic expedition I do not suggest this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"Coincidentally I had just finished 'Alive' - another story about cold weather survival.

Chicken, pork, turkey, Beef, Lamb..., excellent results with all. Tough cuts come out tender after a bunch of jabs, while fine cuts get shorter cook and marinade times and better marinade penetration from just a couple stabs. Be careful with cook times though, it really does cut them drastically. Very easy to overcook until you are used to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great...just be very careful","review":"I use it all the time to tenderize flat cuts of meats. Just a couple of tips:Tenderize both sides twice, the 2nd time at right angles to the 1st.When tenderizing a nice thick steak if you don't support the sides, a 1 1/2 inch steak can quickly become a 3/4 inch steak.The prongs are VERY sharp, so be extremely careful as to where your fingers are.You have to be careful about using this on the very best cuts of meat. Fine grilling steaks such as ribeyes, filets and NY strips will usually taste mushy if you tenderize them with this tool"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meat Tenderizer Heaven","review":"This product is an absolute must for cooking Deer Meat.

It's a bit tricky to clean without cutting yourself, but it's easier if you wash it *immediately* after use to prevent anything from drying on.

I love chicken fried steak but want to stay away from the fatty meats. He said to tenderize your own lean bottom round to make cube steak. Are you wondering if I'm deranged?....chicken fried steak is as greasy as it gets, why worry about fatty meat? Well, I do well with meat protein but don't want the saturated fats. I can fry it in olive oil which is a healthier source of fat....so I can have chicken fried steak once in a while with less guilt.The 48 blade tenderizer is a wicked device that is made well. It's not a cheapy gadget. I have used it on top sirloin steaks before bbq'ing and they are like eating filet mignon. Using it on veggies and meats before marinating made for more flavorful absorption.A must for anyone who is having dental work done, wears dentures or has partial plates. You can chew with ease again.I'm giving them out as gifts. An impressive gift for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, it works but...","review":"I bought this about 7 months ago for my husband because he is a grilling fanatic.

The problem is after 7 months of use it is falling apart. Two of the three screws that holds this product together has disappeared in the dishwasher.

While the show may have been improved since it's original 1974 production at Yale, it just doesn't come together. I think it is a lovely academic excercise, but it is too anaesthetic and lopsided to serve as anything other than an academic excercise.

I lost my job and my apartment. I moved back home with my parents as I searched for a job. My great escape was found in discovering and reading NIGHTSWIMMER. I would come home and lay on the bed in the sun porch of my parent's house and read about Will and Sean. They were both anguished over love and lost love. I was also in the process of ending a summer romance and everything Joseph Olshan wrote in NIGHTSWIMMER spoke to my heart. This was the first novel by Olshan that I read and I was very pleased to find an author who spoke directly to me. Finding that is so rare."},{"rating":"2","title":"page-turning, yet somehow beyond stereotypical","review":"I was unable to escape the intensity of this story, and like several other reviewers, was unable to put this novel down. There are grains of truth found in every stereotype, and while I am ambivalent toward the so called \\"Fire Island School\\" of fiction (Picano, Mordden, Holleran) I couldn't help but be drawn in by this tragic tale of lost love and the sometimes desperate search for communion with others. This tale goes beyond the stereotype of the beautiful gay man trying to find himself amidst a whirling backgroud of casual sex, discos, bathhouses, etc. The cosmopolitanism found in the stories of Ethan Mordden (for instance) has taken a backseat in this more timely, up-to-date tale"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was up til 1am finishing the book","review":"I picked this book up at random in the bookstore....but I found that I could not put it down, and read it in just one evening.

The story took me a short while to get into as the writer has a very distinctive way of approaching the telling of his story. As a matter of fact I almost abandoned the book. However, I am so glad that I didn't, as it truly was masterfully written and the story about lost love and how it affects us throughout our lives (especially as gay men) rings so true.

Although they do exist in this book, they are not quite as predominent as in other works.However, this story deals with two men who cannot put their pasts behind them and embark in a healthy relationship. The term \\"Nightswimmer\\" becomes a metaphor for issues that the characters cannot put behind them and, although we all have our own \\"Nightswimmers\\", the trick is to get beyond them and find happiness, not dwell on the past. The story is written as though the author is speaking to the other main character in the book, a very interesting and almost haunting effect.I would, in the future, like to see a book about well-adjusted men without emotional baggage carrying on a healthy \\"normal\\" domestic partnership-- but then that's not much of a story, is it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, no, not again","review":"Yet another gay fantasia, centered on how much great sex the author/persona/narrator \\"gets,\\" Nightswimmer traffics in every silly sterotype about gay men that the dominant, straight culture has shoved rather unlovingly down our gay throats. Ah, yes, we are obsessed with sex. Ah, yes, we are interesting when we are bleedingly tragic. Ah, yes, our wit is just ever so quick. And best of all, we can whine like no one else. But perhaps worst of all, it's so disheatening to find the stereotypes aped and pandered by those in the gay community.

It was involving to the point of distraction, forcing this reader to break up his plans for the evening to just finish the damn thing. I was sorry afterward that the experience went by so quickly, but I also walked away resenting other books that fail to get under my skin like this one does---still. Thankfully, Olshan came out with \\"Veritas\\" a few years later and reaffirmed my conviction that he is a marvel at characterization, plot and illuminating the rough spots in matters of the heart.

As for the chord changes and form, on closer examination, though it seems Ayler may navigate through specific instances via \\"mind-over-matter\\", he still has a very good broad sense of the form.

On this disc more than her other 2, the boundary of what is improvised and written often just flows out and into one another, warranting that each song should be evaluated in its entirety, not in solos.I disliked that she played out of the harmony so much on this disc, but I can also appreciate how she makes the keyboard/piano almost talk...Her music is moving, academic, and danceable.To watch her on DVD is also very inspiring, ecspecially to piano players.Hiromi has a very powerful spirit, and it shows.

When I opened it there was a foil sealer that I don't recall seeing on other Premier Dead Sea products. The foil wasn't thightly sealed so that was strange. Then the cream was very thick, smells waxy and there was only about half of the container full. All very suspicious.

As a whole, it lacked depth and development."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stellar read","review":"The Great Tree of Avalon by T.A. Barron is not only the best book by this masterful writer but one of the best books ever written in the English language. It's truly riveting, fabulous, and full of surprises. With colorful descriptions that make you feel like you are really there, Barron leads the reader through a rip-roaring adventure of epic proportions. It made me think instantly of the marvelous storytelling of J.R.R. Tolkien. All of the characters are so real and vivid that I now count them among my friends. I just can't wait for Book Two!

The Great Tree of Avalon was hard to put down because the plot was engaging and you felt like you really KNEW the characters.

Barron's Lost Years of Merlin epic is among my favorite series of books, a series that I consider to be up there with my other favorite series, The Belgariad/Mallorean cycle (by David Eddings), The Wheel of Time Series (by Robert Jordan), the Shannara books (by Terry Brooks), and Lord of the Rings (by the great J.R.R. Tolkien). When i heard of a sequel series to LYoM I was extremely excited, then severly let down. This isn't up to standard with the old Merlin series. There are many pieces of the two series that just don't fit. Maybe its my sentimentality for the old characters, but I just can't seem to connect to them.

It works great and can also used for slicing carrots, potatoes, celery, citrus, etc. The cutting edge extends part way around the tip of the knife, so be careful as this baby is very sharp and it's easy to cut yourself because of the shape of the blade. I managed to slice two parallel cuts in a finger getting it out of the !#@%&! clamshell package!

It is both very funny and insightful. The characters are well drawn and the ensemble cast is an example of how a good Director can mesh disparate types into a unified whole. The performances of the three leads make this movie better than most teen genre productions. Rob Adamson is quite good in his portrayal of the stereotypical arrogant \\"jock\\" while Lyndsey Shaw as the point of the love triangle shows she is a very special young actress. Gary Entin shines in his portrayal of Flynn, the loner/outsider. Exhibiting a range not typical of young actors Entin moves from nerdy to popular insider and finally to the moral center of the piece in a seemless fashion.

Far better, for different reasons, are \\"Oedipus at Stalingrad\\" and \\"The Death of My Brother Abel\\"--now scandalously out of print, at least in this country. Personally I believe Von Rezzori superior to both Thomas Mann and Robert Musil as a European novelist of ideas--but I won't take the space to justify that assessment here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable von Rezzori","review":"His obituary rang no bells. Von Rezzori did seem to have an intriguing background, and there was nothing on my bed table, so I decided to locate this novel and give it a try. Frankly, I am more of a non-fiction reader, so I began with low expectations.Wow! Pithy, unusual and magnificent. I took a leisurely pace, like the train in the title, and found myself enthralled. Perhaps understatement works better, and is more credible. Neverthless, this is the finest work of modern fiction I have had the supreme pleasure to read.

I enjoy the illustrations, which were done by Disney artists of the time. The story is very much like the movie. One reviewer states that there is nothing about Dumbo losing the magic feather and believing in himself, however it is in there. Another, reveiwer felt some of the lines were odd. Personally, I adore those lines! The line about the pension makes me laugh out loud. This book might be more wordy than picture books of today, but as an educator and avid reader, I appreciate books that might make a child sit and pay attention for longer periods of time. Our society has become too instant, too immediate, and believe me those ideas are reflected in how little time children want to take on their school work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dumbo (Little Golden Book)","review":"Wonderful story and pictures.

Most were written in a time when things weren't totally geared towards kids as they are today. The book is very wordy and the pictures are fairly sparse. The story is a good one, but is buried in a lot of detail. Not great for a 2-year-old. Maybe older kids would like it better.

These tea bags of stevia are awful. The tea leafs are too fine and there is a lot of dust. This dust filters right through the tea bag and enters the tea. This gives the tea a terrible taste. I tried brewing it longer and shorter time but to no avail. It is just plain bad.

I was not disappointed . I think what I enjoy so much about this author's work is the perspective that a major female author is once again bringing to the Mystery/Detective genre. Rozan brings a woman's interest in the nuances of interpersonal dynamics, and in No Colder Place, she combines that with her knowledge as an actual working architect. Not every author could get me thoroughly engaged in a murder mystery surrounding a construction site. But this one can - in fact, she actually put me in the gratifying position of feeling knowledgeable about what was happening in and around the construction site. And as always, Bill and Lydia are a wonderfully unique and complex pair of sleuths. I can't help myself - I LIKE these guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"stilted","review":"As a heavy reader, lover of complex mysteries, and female landscape architect, I was SO looking forward to this book since the author is a woman and an architect. I was so dissapointed and was unable to plod through the heavy, stilted, unnatural conversation. I thought a contemporary book featuring a woman in a traditionally male industry written by a woman who is actually in a traditionally male industry would feature stronger female characters that reflect reality (we work, make decisions, are equals with our partners). I didn't think the characters were realistic at all for contemporary times, conversation was awkward and the women in the book were wimpy dependant characters. It takes a lot for me to put a book down before I'm done, but this was so plodding and awkward and sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Setting Makes the Story","review":"This is by far my favorite of the first four of Rozan's books in the Chin/Smith series. In it, both Bill Smith (the story is told from his point of view) and Lydia Chin are working undercover to determine who's behind the murders at a NYC construction site. Smith is working as a mason on the site, and Chin is working in the company headquarters. The setting is excellent: a reader can almost sense the height, feel the pace of work, and taste the grit as the highrise inches its way toward the sky. If you're a reader who loves setting, you'll enjoy this book. The plot is realistic and the solution is satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"This is the fourth in the Lydia Chin/Bill Smith series and I liked it as much as the first three. I like the way Rozan switches the point of view of each book, the first from Lydia's view the second from Bill's etc. It is a clever hook and works very well. The books (Concourse and No Colder Place) from Bill's view have a decidedly harder edge. Rozan keeps her characters fresh and sharp. Hope she continues for a long time!Ree-views"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book with an interesting setting","review":"I loved this book and found the setting of the construction site very interesting.

I suspect those other reviews were written either by the author or her friends and relatives. Apart from being badly written this book is written in the first person perspective and that character is supposed to be a rough and tough rigger working on a construction site. However it reads like a book written by a woman who is imagining what goes through the mind of such a guy rather than actually by a guy who can actually relate to these experiences. And that is in fact the case, the author is a woman named S.J.Rozan. However, I suspect that if she wrote a novel on a subject that she actually had some empathy for, it would still be terrible, as she can't write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading.","review":"Product features says 3 pack bulb replacement is actually 1 bulb with shipping adds up to just under $10 a bulb."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor","review":"Hi. I have to say that in reading this book, I noticed several unfortunate things. Most importantly, the author left out a lot of facts. For example, most of the Christian bishops present at the Council of Nicea in 325 voted against the deity of Christ, but Mr. Morey fails to deal with the logistics of the debate. He also fails to deal with the fact that the early Christians including the Ebionites and Nazarenes believed that Jesus was a mere man, facts which are acknowledged by Jerome, Tertullian, and Eusebius. Nor does he deal with the known falsifications of the Bible in 1 John 5:7 or Romans 9:5. He also does not deal with Christ's inferiority to the Father (John 14:28, John 17:2) or Christ's lack of omniscience (Matt 24:36.) The material on the Holy Ghost is even weaker. Unfortunately, Mr. Morey did not seal with all the evidence and issues in this matter. Most other books I have read on this subject are much more competent; spend your money somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor logic and history","review":"The positions of this book are very weak. Morey's work is not based on exegesis. Instead of reading things from the book; he reads things INTO the book. The fact that the trinity is post-biblical can easily be seen by reading other great books on this topic such as:Ehrmann's \\"The Orthodox Corruption of Scripture\\" or \\"When Jesus became God\\" or better yet the Bible itself:For us there is one God, the Father--= 1 Cor 8:6 This is eternal life that they might know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom You sent.--John 17:2"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Work On The Trinity To Date","review":"Dr. Morey's book is brilliant. He argues for the Trinity by analyzing both the Hebrew and Greek Syntax of the Scripture, leaving no doubt that the Trinity is thoroughly biblical. He clearly demonstrates that the Trinity is a fact of both Old and New Testaments. Extensive citations from the World's foremost biblical scholars strengthen the points made by Morey. His book is an excellent refutation of Greg Stafford's book, Jehovah's Witnesses Defended, despite the fact that the book was published before Morey had any knowledge of Stafford's book. Must read for any serious student of the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good survey and defense of Trinitarianism","review":"I've always had a tough time trying to explain the doctrine of the Trinity to people. But Dr. Morey does a solid job of discussing not only the history of the formulation of the doctrine of the Trinity, but he goes into the Old Testament (and even refers to the Hebrew text) and shows how there is evidence of plurality within the Godhead in texts such as Genesis 1:26; 3:2; Genesis 18; Is 9:6; 48:16; 63:9; Zech 2:10-11, and others.He then moves through the New Testament evidence, and discusses such passages as Matthew 3:16-18; 28:18-20 and passages dealing with the relationship between the Father and the Son.The book is academic in nature, yet is simply written and very informative. It isn't quite as engaging as his prior work, \\"Death and the Afterlife,\\" but it is one of the better books on the subject of the Trinity."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only book of its kind!","review":"I'm... speechless!

I wouldn't feel right about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive swing - not much use for infant","review":"I received this swing as a baby gift in 2004 and used it for my daughter. She did not get much use from it then. I am now using it for my 6 month old and still do not use it too much. The swing is not appropriate for a newborn because the back of the seat does not recline enough which makes the baby's head come forward. As the baby gets bigger she can sit in it confortably but not comfortable enough to nap in. The other day a very scary situation occurred when she pulled herself to a sitting position on one of the swings hanging fish. She then fell over to the side and got her head wedged between the two bars of the swing(The one bar with the fish in it). If I was not in the room with her she would have fallen out of the swing! My baby is on the smaller side and if she can get herself into a position such as this one I would hate to see what could happen to a larger baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great While it Lasted","review":"My son was small for his age for the first few months, but this swing was perfect for him.

BAM BAM BAM!!! He's too young to realize, 'hey, everytime I move my head 5 inches to the right or left, it gets bashed between these two things holding me up so I better not do that.' I don't understand why this thing is on the market. He didn't need to be hospitalized, but that doesn't mean it's safe. I stopped using it, but didn't throw it away.

When I turned it on, I first noticed that although there is a dial that indicates \\"8 speeds\\" there is really only one speed. Also, it made a grinding noise like it was \\"struggling\\" to swing. Then, when I turned on the lights and music, I noticed that the orange light was very dim. I still thought it was cute, so I wasn't too worried.

He liked the crib thing and the big swing. The only thing about this swing that was good was the fact that it folded up and you could throw it in the car and take it places. The thing I disliked was 1.when he was a newborn he would always fall over cause the seat wouldn't recline enough. 2. When he got maybe 15 pounds he would fall forward and the swing tipped over with him strapped in. So all together it was pretty much useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"25 pounds ???","review":"My son was 9 pounds 11 ounces at birth. From that point on, the swing was GREAT. There were times the only way to put him to sleep was to put him in the swing. This was after white noise, nursing, walking, rocking, and several other tricks. Once Ryan was old enough to grasp things, he loved pulling on the whale. This caused the swing to stop. When he let go, the swing moved and he smiled....I guess this could be educational since it taught him cause and effect.I had no problems with the swing until he reached 18 or 19 pounds and he liked to sit instead of lay. The swing seems to recline more and more as the baby gets heavier and I had to keep turing the speed dial higher and higher. For example, I put my son in the swing yesterday and had to have it on 8 and he weighs 21 pounds. I did not feel safe leaving him in the swing because he looked like his back was almost parallel(sp) to the floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great swing, especially for older babies","review":"This is the best swing on the market for babies who will sleep nowhere else but the swing. My 13 month old still naps in it, every single day. She naps in it for hours, much longer than she would in the crib, and she falls asleep in there almost instantly. My sanity is tied to this swing.We have a full-size swing in addition to this swing, but it sits up so high that I am afraid she'll fall out. In this swing, she sits less than 2 inches off the ground, so there is absolutely no risk of her falling out and being hurt. Also, it is the only travel swing on the market (that I am aware of) that reclines quite as far back, so even if she leaned forward really far, she wouldn't fall out. I've looked at other travel swings (even the other ones made by F-P), and the seat is nowhere near as deep.I don't mind buying all of those C batteries, they buy me a whopping TWO AND A HALF HOURS of nap time every day. Life is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Accessory","review":"I borrowed an older model of this swing for my daughter when she was an infant. We loved it so much for her that we bought a new one for our son while I was pregnant. He spends a lot of time in this swing. Whether he's being soothed by the soft sounds and smooth, slow swinging motion, or just sitting still watching us, he loves his swing! It is very portable and goes everywhere with us. Be sure to stock up on C sized batteries, though, because you'll go through a lot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great swing!","review":"We had another take-along swing that was very similar to this one for my first daughter. She loved it, and so when that one finally died (it had been passed down to me from another family), we got this Aquarium take-along swing. And now my 2nd daughter is really enjoying it. She loves to look at the lights and I think it's great that she can reach the hanging toys and turn on the music herself (a feature that a lot of other swings don't have). The handle bar on top is a little higher than our first take-along swing, which is just perfect for being able to take her out without hitting her head (which did happen sometimes with the first swing).

It was given to us by our friends who love theirs, my hairdresser loved hers..............However, this one is nothing compared to it. There is no distinction in the speed control. It is one speed, period. The light show and music are not impressive and they give you a little yellow toy to attach to the fish but the fish on one side is not missing the interior to hang it from.The deciding factor was, however, that Josh falls asleep every time in the big one and screamed his lungs out in this one. Decision to return made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Swing","review":"We had registered for this swing along with the papasan full size swing. We wanted something we could take to peoples houses with this smaller portable unit. We did not recieve the full size swing for our shower so we decided to just try the smaller one. Now that we have it home and put together the size is perfect for our smaller house. I think a full size swing would take up too much room. It is nice because you can pick the unit up and move it to another room even if the baby is in it. The swing mechanism is a little on the louder side (I have nothing to compare it to right now) but our daughter does'nt seem to mind it. The lights above capture her attention and I like that as she starts to grab at the toys she can make the music go by pulling on the dangling fish. I am not sure how well this will hold up with a larger child being so low to the ground and more compact. Overall we like the swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!!","review":"We have the full sized aquarim swing and our daughter loved it!I was looking for a a good travel swing because we travel a lot. I tried 2 others and they were horrible. I finaly convinced my husband to buy this one and our daughter loves it too. She loves to watch the lights and the fish on the side. One time we were at a hotel that said they had a crib but they didn't so we used this for her to sleep in at night and she slept soundly for 8 hours in it. She's 9mths old now and still loves it. I would definately recommend both the full size and travel size Aquarium swings."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves this swing!","review":"I got this swing to take with me to work and so when my mom keeps my daughter she could have a swing without having a bulky full size swing.

The only thing that I do not like is that the lights don't have a setting just for them and when you turn the lights/music setting on it does not last long enough to keep my daughter entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for our house","review":"We bought this for our second daughter who's been using this swing since she came home from the hospital. She's 3 months now and its safe to say we all LOVE it! Its close to the ground and sturdy so we feel better about our dogs being around it.

I will say that she's just now able to grab at the fish and pull them to make the music come on by itself. And I know the weight limit is like 25lbs and a lot of 6 month olds are nearing that weight so I'm glad she is on the smaller size and we will get more use out of it.The only thing I would change is I wish it played more upbeat music.....all of the music is soft, going to sleep music."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic travel swing","review":"This is one fantastic swing and I'd recommend it to Anyone! A word of caution, read the instructions CAREFULLY and if your baby is SUPER active (bouncing or swinging the unit without battery power), even under the weight limit, please discontinue use of the swing as the plastic angle bracket can wear and break. It took almost a year of hard wear for my daughter to wear it out, but Mattel/Fisher Price customer service is FANTASTIC. Even though the swing was out of warranty, they took it back with a FULL refund so we could get another one for our next child. Great company, excellent swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient, Easy, and Fun","review":"This is one of the best purchases I've made for my grandchild. I can easily take it anywhere in the house, even while holding her. The various speeds allow me to adjust as she gains weight.Right now she is two months and starting to actually reach for the dangling fish. Once she is able to pull on them, I'll change the lights & music setting to working only when she pulls a toy which is a feature I really enjoy.The only thing I don't like, which maybe is a defect in mine, is that the lights and music work only for a short while - maybe 5-10 minutes before you have to turn them off and on again. It gets irritating to notice they have finished their cycle & now I need to go over & turn them on again.Also, the seat is deep enough that, at least at this age, I don't HAVE to always put the seat belt on - especially if I'm just putting her there for a minute or two. She is clearly very comfortable in the swing and really seems to enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chair broke while my baby was in it","review":"I bought this swing because it wouldn't take up too much room, but that was a mistake.

There are 8 speeds of which 1 - 5 barely move at all. I have to have it all the way to 8 to get a decent motion going and that is only if I help it. I am going to return it - so disappointing since I loved everything else about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"went thru 2 and neither worked","review":"The first swing I received was defective and I didn't realize until it was basically all put together.

After it was put together we noticed when it was at speed 8 it went slower then speed 7. 8 is supposed to be the fastest and was more like 1. Maybe I just got 2 bad ones of this swing, but either way, I'm not getting a 3rd to find out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept but....","review":"I bought this swing so I could use it at work when I took my baby in with me. It's very portable and doesn't take up too much space. It was great at first, and there were no worries about the baby folding over like in some swings. Our son ended up being too heavy after a couple of months and his bottom would drag on the carpet and he would end up stopping himself. While he started off as a tiny little guy, once he started putting on the weight we could no longer use it. I also would have liked if it reclined a little more, perhaps this would have prevented his bumm from dragging so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Don't waste your money on this sauce.

It is sturdy and durable. Yet, it lacks educational value. Let me explain. Most of us learned the solar system from the Sun to Pluto. This puzzle places the moon first and does not have a Pluto. Imagine my awkwardness in explaining to my child that there are 9 planets in the solar system, but Pluto is no where on the puzzle. How embarrassing.

It is tough to make a 4 yr old understand that the moon is smaller than the earth when the moon occupies the entire model. Also, the order is not based on distance of planets from the Sun, and the asteroids are not helping.I did not like it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is pluto?","review":"This is a very lame puzzle.

They then used it to tell me everything they'd been learning."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT puzzle and VERY educational","review":"NEWSFLASH!! Since Pluto is no longer a planet this puzzle is technically accurate. FYI to the few of you that may not have heard yet but in Aug of 2006 it was determined that Pluto would no longer be considered a planet (much to my disappointment to be honest). Just Google 'pluto not a planet' if you don't believe me (this is only for those critics of the puzzles accuracy). That being said, this puzzle is accurate and a lot of fun for our boys, 5 and 2. Even our 2 yr old, who loves planets, is already starting to put it together. It is bright and colorful as well as very sturdy. I like the fact that it is from the moons perspective and, since the planets are still in order, it's perspective does not detract from educating kids correctly.

It also gave me some other ideas to toss around. Beyond that however, the book was great in letting you know how to get started, some of the pitfalls to watch out for, and an overall sense of what it takes to start a home business. The only down side I found to the book was the constant references to other books by the same authors to get more detail information on any given topic.

I am not exactly sure why; maybe just to be reminded not to become complacent about it. This one juxtaposes chapters describing the plot with chapters focused on the bios of individual victims, a technique that, I think, makes the tragedy more vivid than massing victims in to a big number. I learned a few new things about the plot, a lot of new things about some of the heroism of the victims and the minutes before the collapse. In contrast to the previous reviewer, I did not think the approach was clinical; if anything, I thought the writing was a big overwrought in places. Still, this is a minor complaint about a really well done book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass This One Up","review":"I've been reading everything I can on 9/11 lately, and sorry to say this one was one of the worst.

For people who want a view of the day beyond the numbers, dates and times, to really understand the terror, hopelessness & agony of the day, this book will disappoint. The horror of September 11th was not the destruction of walls of the Pentagon or the tumbling of buildings, it was the agony of loss, the simultanenous, murder thousands. It's the thoughts that imagination creates and the pressing, persistent questions that peek out of forcibly supressed memories. The horror is the public murder and the agony is the private, unknown details. This book misses those things. The author recounts \\"things\\" well in the method of a reporter taking notes, but misses the importance of Sept. 11th, which is maintaining its meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Examines creationism within the framework of true science.","review":"This separates fact from theory and allows the reader to evaluate the theories of creation and evolution within the framework of established physical laws.

Contrasted to the book's period, the Soviet Union's breakup was a huge strategic gain for China, by immensely reducing the size of the Soviet/Russian economy relative to China's.Plus, China's economy has grown significantly since 1990, and is now heavily business oriented.

Elements on the other hand is a wonderfully complex, intriguing & challenging piece of work that you would be suprised to come from Roger Glover. It has a very grand orchestrated sound with lush arrangements, beautiful melodies & singing, reminding one more of a broadway play than an album. It reminds you at times of Rick Wakeman's \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" from the early seventies.

The stories and statistics are wonderful; however, the Kindle Fire version is not the best. There are typing errors, the print for the quiz answers is very small, and the boxes on the pages are all messed up. Also, the stories that the author tells us about being a teenager are not detailed enough and don't make sense to me. I don't think the author relates to modern day teens. Sometimes when I am reading a story and a box is in the middle of the text (to state a fact, give a quiz, etc.), I get annoyed because it interrupts my reading. On the bright I side, I like what is inside of the little annoying boxes. I believe that the boxes are suppose to be colorful and whatever but they are not.

I paid around $70 for it and they want to fix it for $69 + shipping. I'm very disappointed with this purchase, hoping LG was a good buy, but in this case, it was two thumbs way down.

Diz takes a stab at early 70's jazz-rock fusion...an admirable and promising venture. And while most of what Gillespie has touched in his career has turned to gold, this stuff has no shimmer. Repetetive riffs, simplistic chord progressions, square rhythms, and studio fade-outs predominate. \\"The Real Thing\\" even dabbles with \\"flower-power\\" sounds and lyrics that will make you cringe. The \\"Portrait of Jenny\\" album is somewhat better, with a smaller group stretching out on some mellow jams... but while it isn't unpleasant, it's often very dull. The live \\"Giants\\" session returns to a more traditional acoustic combo playing mostly standard tunes, but the performance is poorly recorded and uninspiring overall. Beware: For Gillespie completists only!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ipod Cover + Armband","review":"This Ipod accessory is definitely useful.

And rather refreshing in this age of excess, where rich and poor alike seem determined to set a new standard for greed and self-indulgence. She lived in tumultuous times (Mussolini, WWII), but she tells her story from a strictly personal viewpoint: her family troubles, her experiences in school, her months of nursing during the war. She was a sensitive and intelligent woman who went on to achieve great things in Italy, a country where women still seem to be 6 paces behind the men. Thoughtfully-told recollections, if you like intelligent writing, you will likely appreciate this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A LITTLE CHILD DID LEAD -- HE WAS THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS","review":"This heartwarming story of how a bitter woodcarver let a widow and her 7-year-old son into his life should be a holiday tradition for all.

My woodcarving magazine reported that a movie is being made about from this book and Tom Berenger will play the role of the woodcarver and a Joely Richardson? will play the mother. Shane Raven, a wonderful woodcarver from England carved the actual set used in the movie and also served as the woodcarvers hands in the close-ups. Lets hope the movie people have enough good sense to stick to the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book.","review":"This is a great story.

The cd that comes with some editions is an added plus for classroom use. The illustrations get ooohs and ahhs from old and young alike.

This book was a real page-turner. From the opening scene of an FBI agent being used as chum to the blending of the story of the loss of the Panama Canal, fanatical drug dealers, government officials trying to cover their butts and creative, frighteningly easy airline sabotage. I don't want to give away the action scenes, but I have say, there is a really incredible commercial airline scene. Rudy will repulse you, Nestor will frighten you, you will be certain of Chris and Zac's demise and you will despise George Drany. While reading, I couldn't help but picture Benjamin Bratt as Zac and Charlize Theron as Chris, John Travolta as the egocentric George Draney, Dennis Franz as Rudy and without a doubt, Johnny Depp as Nestor Avila.

Even so, I have the distinct impression that the most he's ever seen of a \\"hacker\\" is on TV.My background in this topic has been purely educational (that is to say I've taken 1 forensics class) and I have to agree that there are several books that cover the topic more clearly and more in depth than this one.My recommendation... go to your local library or book store and spend 30 minutes reading the Introduction, you won't be missing much."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's new here?","review":"There is nothing in this book that has not been covered 50 times before.Interesting read, but there are gigabytes of similar FEEE data on the same topic on the net.So why bother?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Really New","review":"I have been in the computer forensic industry for a very long time and have a number of books on the computer forensic subject, but I returned this book to Amazon, because it it really didn't add any thing new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"If you need to know anything about forensics, DON'T read this book.Poorly written and full of errors.Avoid at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor book","review":"This is a book by a person who clearly has no real world experience in the word of digital forensic investigations.While the information is relevant; it should not be used as an authoritative text.There are much better titles and this should be used as a text of last resort."},{"rating":"2","title":"The personal side of Bud","review":"If you wanted to know what it felt like to live with Bud Powell and have him play for you in your tiny Paris apartment, then this is the album for you. It's low recording and authentic voices heard throughout, this is the quintessential Bud Powell collector's album. He sounds free and adventurous because he had none of the pressures of a club or concert hall date to hinder his playing style.The reason for these recordings is outlined in a biography of Bud. The story of Bud, as told through the eyes and ears of Francis Paudras, who took Bud in and helped him regain himself, is called Dance of the Infidels. It is a wonderful read, and it provokes a lot of thought and desire to do more research into the music and life of, one, Bud Powell."},{"rating":"2","title":"New film makers","review":"Good to see a new generation of talented film makers with fresh ideas.

And never in a million years would I think JP'd include a funky drum solo on an album!The one thing I dislike is the final cut; too cloying for my taste (the children's choir is cute, but sort of cringeworthy)...I suppose this track is their attempt to end the album with a bit of an anthem ala The Beatles \\"Hey Jude\\" - but I just don't dig it all that much.That said, you'd be hard presed to find a better guitar-pop album this year.

For a beginner I expected this book to get me up and running, It never did. I read the first 5 chapters and their was way too much focus on the Java code that was created by the JSP engine from a JSP page, and not enough emphasis on how to implement and use JSP. BOOOOH.

Worse than that, the examples are so long and detailed that it is very difficult to find particular pieces of information. For example, in the explanation of how JSPs interact with javaBeans, there is an excruciatingly detailed example of how to use JSPs, javaBeans, and JDBC. Not that JDBC is unimportant, but it introduces enough extra complexity should not be used to illustrate the above interaction.That being said, the necessary information is mostly there.

The problem i find with wrox books is that by having numerous writers, they don't read each other chapters, and consequently repeat each other over and over.I found this book to be far too big as well. For example, for each JSP example, they print the corresponding servlet code. This takes up a lot of space, particularly in the early chapters and is pretty useless in my opinion. Also there is a glaring typo on the first page of the book which dosnt instill confidence. I think this may be a good book for people already using JSP pages, and looking for extra technical knowledge. However for people like myself, interested in learning how JSPs work and where they fit into server side java solutions, its not the best buy! Its not a bedtime read, one for the office bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will not recommand","review":"Wrox has published some very good books on Java and web development,this book is not one of them.Though the authors have tried to cover everything related with JSP , the explanations about different topics are not very clear,very important topics like Cookies , session tracking etc have not given as much importnace as they deserve.There are some very good books available in the market like \\"Core Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP)\\" and \\"Web Development with Java Server Pages \\", I would definitly prefer these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too wordy - hard to understand","review":"I didn't like this book.

This is a celebration of graffiti and impromptu art that discusses the art in serious terms, often more than I think it warrants.

While many of Kohn's views seem logical, they fly in the face of fact. However, while Hirsh's views seem supported by fact, they often extrapolate the actual evidence into questionable deductions.This reader finds the evidence presented by these two authors to support a philosophy that supports many of the ideas of both authors, but gravitates toward that of E.

It was very odd. The part I did not like was when Taran was a pig boy. He had met Gurigi but he did not want to be his friends so that part was crazy.

It still holds my attention and tugs at my heart strings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fantasy","review":"Lloyd Alexander was one of my favorite authors as a young adult and his work has really held up now that I'm an adult.

The box itself appeared old and worn. In fairness I cannot evaluate how well the product functioned because I absolutely will not use a personal product which appears to have been used.

It's an extremely solid album and it's classic Bruce at his most rockin'. It also has marginally better guitar work than most of what he's put out. But what I think makes this album so effective is how pretty much everyone can relate to experiences expressed by the boss in these songs, and even though there are still many refrences to cars and what not, it's a very emotional and powerful album. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Springsteen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turn it up!!","review":"This is one of the best albums ever.

Bruce Rules!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce's Second Best Album","review":"While I still think Born in the USA is The Boss's best album, Darkness on the Edge of Town is right behind it. This album is loaded with great songs, including Badlands, Adam Raised a Cain, Prove It All Night, Darkness on the Edge of Town, Candy's Room, and Racing in the Street.If you're just discovering Bruce Springsteen's music, I definitely recommend this album, along with Born in the USA and Born to Run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystical American Workingclass Opera","review":"Grandiose, visionary, baroque, tragic, triumphant, dark, beautiful. Embodies the aspirations and existential terror of the American workingclass- mythologizing and simultaneously shattering said mythology in one fell swoop. Raw yet well crafted, terrifying yet consoling- Bruce speaks with the confused, angry, passionate, truthful voice of every American outcast, drifter, junkie, and working stiff. This is Bruce's swan song- infinitely better even than the oft lionized \\"Born to Run\\"- a pinnacle in the creative arc of a storytelling genius and true American poet- in the same league as all the greats- and this is hands down his masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album Ever","review":"The album is for those of us who have \\"the notion deep inside that it ain't no sin to be glad you're alive\\".It is no escapist notion; It well recognizes that we live \\"the working, the working, just the working life\\"; \\"it's never over it's relentless as the rain\\"; \\"your eyes go blind and your blood runs cold\\". The album is infused with \\"the dark heart of a dream\\".But it sees that as the \\"price you've got to pay\\". It knows that \\"in the darkness there'll be hidden worlds that shine\\". We don't have to waste our lives \\"waiting for a moment that just don't come\\". If we are willing \\"to pay the cost\\", when the \\"time is right\\", we can \\"take one moment\\" into our hands.I for one, live for the \\"things that can only be found in the Darkness on the Edge of Town\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Boss's Best.","review":"This is one of the most powerful albums I have ever heard. I didn't get Bruce in younger days. Back in the 80's I was only interested in heavy metal and it wasn't until my early twentys when I began to expand my musical horizons that I understood the Boss. These songs take on a whole nother meaning now. A couple of years ago I remember making my hour long trip to work where I supervised a department that due to layoffs was overworked and I was catching heat for the work not getting done from corporate and worried about getting laid off myself. (It was a lot like the movie Office Space) I felt like I was fighting a losing battle and Badlands and Promised Land literally gave me the strength to go into the building. Sounds corny but listening to this CD was like a religous experience. Even though there is uncertainty and darkness in these songs there is still a sense of hope. Thanks for the inspiration Bruce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best rock and roll album I have ever heard.","review":"While others Springsteen albums may be better known by the casual fan, i.e. Born in the USA, Born to Run, this is his piece de resistance.

This great (Darkness...) album was WAY overdue for a remastering but Sony/Columbia only provided a big price tag box set or mp3 download (which is inferior). The album and cd should ALWAYS be made affordably available and as a \\"stand-alone\\" product!!! Its not only tradition, but standard, customary practice; and, \\"good business sense\\"! It also shows respect and consideration for the consumer and Bruce fans. Its hard to believe that Bruce would allow this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"Um...if I want an LP-sized package, all I need do is go to my bookshelf of albums and pull out my original copy of Darkness from 1978. This seems rather pointless to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce Springsteen's Best Album","review":"DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN is Bruce Springsteen's best album ever. Instead of the street scenes of the first three albums, this one features harsh, gritty reality. Danger and loss are right at the surface in all of these songs, although \\"Badlands\\" and \\"The Promised Land\\" do offer a shot at redemption. \\"Something In The Night\\", \\"Streets Of Fire\\", and the title track, on the other hand, feature hopelessness imbued with a sense of compassion. But don't let the dark lyrical content dissuade you from purchasing this album. DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN is a rich, rewarding album that repays repeated listening with new insight into one's own trials and tribulations. When you consider Springsteen's advocacy of sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's recent trumped-up drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist, this album becomes an absolute necessity for both your ears AND your conscience."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good.","review":"One month in, and giving us all we could ask for.

I read lots of reviews before ordering this book and most people were satisfied-it got better reviews than Karen Pryor's cat training book so I went ahead and got it. In the end I had better luck just applying Karen Pryor's theories to training my cat as this book doesn't provide much specific clear step by step instruction and the techniques it did provide weren't very useful. If I could get half my money back in exchange for the book, I would take it. Recommend reading Karen Pryor's books-they're a lot more in-depth, scientific and interesting.

(After trying the 'come here' command successfully several times without the clicker, I tried it with the clicker and the sound scared my cat--maybe we'll work on it...)Good info in this book--it would be nice if they can make a cat training DVD. It's nice to see it working."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Incredible Egg","review":"I was immediately drawn to the beautiful artwork of this book. The cover page was so very descriptive. The illustrations throughout the book are wonderful and very little text is needed to complement the art of the pictures. On the discovery of the egg in the henhouse, George takes the egg to his bedroom to keep it warm and safe until it hatches, reading to the egg all the while. George seems to believe that the egg can hear his words and continues to read to the egg. On hatching George continues to read to the dragon before bed each night after training the dragon during the day in dragonly characteristics. Reading plays an important part in the book, and is a good example to be setting for young people enjoying this book.

That was heard ad nauseum back in the mid-90s. An orchestral version? I understand ballads don't lend themselves well with remixes, but Madonna managed it with Frozen and What It Feels Like for a Girl. But then again, Madonna made it on her own, albeit with some help.

The authors' writing style is excruciatingly verbose and the structure is haphazard. I do not understand why algorithms exhibiting similar techniques (e.g. dynamic, greedy, etc) are not clustered together. Another peeve is the fact that critical parts of proofs and explanations are left to the reader. And of course, there is no solution manual available to the public.So if you would like to learn algorithms, please check out Anany V. Levitin's book.

The authors seem to feel that the instructor should provide solutions, well I don't know about other Universities, but my professor does not provide solutions in class and the TAs are not very strong with this type of difficult material.

It doesn't know whether to be a radio or MP3 player or recorder or whatever else it does. When I'm driving I just want to hit one of the presets and have it tune to that station without a lot of programming steps or mode changes. I can't be taking my eyes off the road just to read the display to see why it didn't do what I expected it to do. I really don't need three different levels of favorite channels and I definitely don't want it to go off somewhere else when I hit a channel preset.

Attempts to contact customer service were futile, and I was willing to send it in to have it repaired at any cost to me (providing it did not exceed the cost of a new one!).Stay away from it, as I forgot to mention that the power cord died after a year, and I had to resplice the wires in order to have it charge the device.This was purchased to replace another item that was in an accident, and I will never purchase another.

The hair that grows in is THICK and jet black, which looks very very bad!!! After using this product under my arms, I now have that clean look. No razor burn, no hair, no shadow, Just clear skin.

I definitely think you should try this out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"I purchased this hoping that it would be the answer to frequent shaving and waxing. It wasn't.

In any case, it appears that the blades are on a straight surface, plus it seems to be much higher seeling than the Emjoi. Will make a comparison once i get it, but if the above sounds relevant, bear it in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst ingrown hair problem ever!!!","review":"The first use was fine - got all the hairs on my tummy and bikini area just great. I even expanded its use to my underarms. It was plenty painful under my arms but the results were worth it. Then all the problems started. When my hair started to come back in I used the Gently Gold again. I remember thinking how little it hurt. As near as I can tell it was snapping my thinner regrowing hairs off at skin level. Then the worst, I got raised, horrible, awful bumps along my bikini line and on my tummy! I had never had ingrown hairs. I discontinued use in the area. It's been months now and I am still dealing with unslightly ingrown hairs and the scars they leave behind when you finally liberate the hair. Back to shaving! I continued it's use on my underarms since the hair there was not as thin/frail as the hair elsewhere, then the durn thing burnt itself out after a total of 4 months use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, something that works!","review":"Don't waste your time and money with other gadjets or products.

I only wish it would make my legs a little more smooth and then I might not mind the intense pain so much. I have been getting waxed for years so I can handle pain pretty well but this is unbelievable, I actually have to take breaks to let the pain subside. I can eventually get my legs pretty smooth but not as smooth as shaving. The only thing that keeps me using it is that it is taking the hair out by the root so I know it won't come back anytime soon and it is cheaper than waxing in the long run!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it !!","review":"I love it and it works great!

After the first use or two, it doesn't hurt (other reviewers gave up too early and didn't give them enough time). But the Emjoi is poorly designed -- it's curved head means that the entire head does not touch skin at the same time, so it often misses a lot of hairs. This means you have to go over the same areas again and again. Also, it doesn't handle fine hairs well (after months of epilating, your hairs get very fine). Because of these inefficiencies and poor design, I returned the Emjoi and will instead search out another Braun (hopefully a rechargeable one)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stubble-free","review":"I hate stubble - and I haven't had any for 4 years, thanks to my Emjoi. I recommend it to all my friends. It is admittedly painful at first, but I only have to use it once every couple of weeks (it takes that long for anything substantial to grow back) and I've gotten use to the feel of the pull. I love not having stubble or razor-burn (especially on my bikini line). I'll never go back to shaving with a blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than waxing","review":"I rarely write Amazon reviews but had to share my experience with the Emjoi Gently Gold Caress because I've been so pleasantly surprised at how well it works. I've been waxing my bikini area and underarms for years. I've used Emjoi for two months now and am so happy that I no longer have to pay for ongoing trips to the salon. Like other reviewers, I also must have a higher pain tolerance because it doesn't really hurt. Here are some tips for reducing the pain: (1) go to the salon for a professional wax before using Emjoi so you have a clean start, then use Emjoi going forward for maintenance, (2) put a little baby powder on your skin prior to using Emjoi to ensure your skin is dry, and (2) be sure to pull your skin *taut* while using Emjoi to reduce catching your skin. What a great money-saving beauty tool! I'm thrilled!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gently Gold Caress Hair Remover","review":"This is my first epilator, and I am highly impressed. My main reason for purchasing was for unwanted facial hair. I tried waxing, but all the stubborn chin hairs would not come out with waxing. I then began using hair removal creams, but I would have stubble before the end of the day. With the epilator, my face stays smooth for days (not the 4 to 6 weeks promised, but a big improvement!). It DOES hurt, I won't lie to you. It is not unbearable, however, and the small amount of pain is worth the results."},{"rating":"2","title":"YAY!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I just got this item yesterday and tried it out as soon as I could get it out of the box. I have large psoriases patches on my legs, so shaving and waxing are both HUGE no-nos. While for some people, the pain is harsh, for me it's way better than slicing off a chunk of my leg with a razor blade or ripping off a bunch of skin with wax. I also did my chin and upper lip. It got all of the hairs on my face, with the exception of two that were very stiffly laid back against the skin, but tweezing two hairs instead of two dozen was definitely a good thing. Keep the skin TAUT like the directions say. You'll end up pinching skin if you don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well AFTER you get used to the pain.","review":"This machine does work well, however there is pain involved.

Day 2, I attempted my whole bikini area and lower, (I couldn't do the whole thing though, way too sensitive) I did do my underarms and I am impressed at how smooth they feel. No more day after stubble, that is so noticeable. I never knew how long the hairs are underneath the skin until this machine took them out. I will continue to use this machine regularly.

Furthermore, the underlying theme of the book is that technology should not be implemented just 'because it's there', but only when and where it is needed and will provide a benefit to the business while having its cost justified."},{"rating":"1","title":"SEMPER FI: VIETNAM","review":"Semper Fi: Vietnam is strictly a history book written by a general for generals. It's devoid of any personal feelings and observation by the troops. It's as sanitized as a war can get. In typical fashion, for a general, he was enamored by the body count as it was the measure of success or failure for staff officers. Of course we all know about how you count bodies in Vietnam where 1 possible VC KIA at the squad level became 60 KIA when it got up to the division level."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE RIGHT PRODUCT","review":"I have been using norelco cool skin 7735x blades for about 10 years - they advertise and show you a picture that they are the same blades, but they send you the 8000 series which is much different and leaves burn red marks on your skin.

Almost immediately, the plastic housing which covers the engine began to crack, and eventually broke in several places. Early this season, the Yard Man began to spit out the spark plug every once in a while. The part of the engine housing the block was worn / stripped and I had never put a wrench on it at all.

Although most high schoolers will likely have difficulty it can be used wisely as a study tool since they have sections for hints and finally a solutions section. It should be noted that other solutions are possible but the ones given are very easy to follow. A fun time for all geometry teachers (like me) and good students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good after the basics","review":"This is a great book! But, don't buy it if you don't know the basics well. You'll get frustrated easily and leave geometry. For beginning this is what I recommend: [...]Firstly, don't try a problem for 10 minutes and then just look at the solution. This way, you'll gain nothing from the book. You HAVE to try these problems for at least an hour (some may even take up to 2-3 hours)if you can't solve them. You can, however, break this up into pieces. For example, sit for about 15-25 minutes with one line of attack and then if couldn't solve it, then come back when you have time and give a try with another line of attack. And, let me tell you, when you do solve a problem after trying it for 1-2 hours, it'll be motivation enough to move on to the next problem.I especially like this book because I can hide it under my desk at school :)Also recommended is Geometry Revisited (buy it with this if you can)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging Problems in Geometry","review":"\\"Challenging Problems in Geometry\\" is exactly that - presenting problems in plane geometry with detailed answers.

I was surprised (and confused) when I found that it was a computer-human relationship. The book isn't all technical jargin, but has a loosely veiled message. How Edgar, the child, rebels against Alice, the mother, is a direct parallel to how Alice rebels herself. It is a great computer/philosophical read and the intersting and roiginal idea intrigued me."},{"rating":"2","title":"WoW! 2 days? 7 hours!

I became so enthralled with this computer/human relationship that I was unable to stop reading! It is hard to really explain how this book worked with me, but if you love computers, read it and I think you should be able to understand what makes this book so good. I truly hope that Astro Teller creates a sequel, or at least continues writing with such cutting-edge style and format. And I mean come on, how couldn't you love a book with a :) on the cover?

The first pages were so intriguing that I showed my officemate and said \\"Read these.\\" But that didn't last long, unfortunately. As the rogue AI gets more and more philosophical, he gets less and less interesting (to me). I collect \\"rogue AI\\" stories, and for the first time I found myself more interested in the human character than the AI. I don't care if there are two Edgars or not, I want to know what happened to Alice. So, despite the attractive narrative, this one failed me on two fronts - an AI that didn't capture my interest, and a story that fails to tell me what I want to know about the human."},{"rating":"2","title":"< E X E G E S I S > _A s t r o T e l l e r_","review":"This book was very unique.
