It is ludicrous to attack Brock, as some have, for being unbelievable now since he has admitted to lying in the past. Blinded by the Right reads like the truth, a truth Brock has no credible reason for coloring. Independent thinkers who are not affiliated with movements or political parties should find the facts in the book highly illuminating and if they are serious about casting responsible votes, they will take a long hard look at the \\"brain trust\\" in the current administration and the forces and events that allowed that \\"trust\\" and its agenda to be placed in control of the free world."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Hand Evidence of Right-Wing Nut-Job Hypocrisy","review":"David Brock exposes what we have all known for a long time: there is a \\"vast right-wing conspiracy\\" and it is operated by a nutty clique of zealous hypocrites. Does Brock provide evidence of his claims and does Brock back up his charges? YES. Full of first-hand accounts, detailed descriptions, and thoughtful opinions, Brock's book is as enjoyable as it is informative. It is a must read for anyone who wants to know the truth by looking beneath the surface of the hateful spin spewed by the ultra-right.The many reviews by right-wingers on this site is evidence that Brock's former collegues have succeeded with their tiresome propagandist attacks. My guess is that most have not even bothered to read Brock's book, for if they had they would be ashamed of themselves and embarrassed by those they adore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it and weep, right-wingers!","review":"\\"Blinded by the Right\\" is essential reading for liberals who wish to understand how the conservative political machine functions and thrives. I also recommend it for any Republican naive enough to think that his or her party really stands for integrity and morality. Brock reveals how he and other journalists became trained character assassins, taking out any and all who stood in the way of complete right-wing dominance. He chronicles the bitter hatred that many extreme conservatives feel for those unlike them (moderate Republicans as well as Democrats), describes and their smug feelings of \\"legitimacy\\" that drove them to wage (and lose) an unconditional war against the Clintons. Probably most interesting is Brock's own realization of how he had betrayed his own identity in working for a movement that hates homosexuals. \\"A Jew in Hitler's army\\" is how he describes being a gay man in the right-wing hate machine. Worthwhile reading regardless of your ideology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conservative....YEAH RIGHT","review":"...

The ignorance and political self indulgence that Brock so clearly expresses in his book makes a joke out of responsibledemocracy and/or freedom.

Reading this book makes clear the intellectual and emotional bankruptcy that is now so pronounced.

He writes about being closeted and about shrugging off anti-gay attitudes in the 'movement' as not 'personal'. But I will never understand how he, as a gay man, was EVER able to throw his lot in with that bunch, as HE describes them.It's a bit like reading the confessions of a Jewish Nazi propaganda minister.But still in all, those attacking his credibility now are clearly only doing so because they are uncomfortable with his betrayal.This still has the ring of truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vast Right Wing Conspiracy","review":"This books details the vast right wing conspiracy that anybody who followed politics in the nineties knew about. Especially accurate is Brock's description of the nasty, hateful, condescending attitude of the right. The book provides an inside look at the lies, character assassination, and deceit of the Republican Party, which Brock notes has lost any moral authority. A very interesting book that shows how corrupt the conservative movement has become."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book belongs on fiction list","review":"I read the book and laughed! Brock has been caught in so many lies it's damn funny, first he made up his college years and the incident with Jean Kirkpatrick and now you have many people like Andrew Sullivan also claiming he invented the material in this book. So you have to conclude that David Brock has a chip on his shoulder and the truth be damned.David Brock also claimed that Fox has blackballed him and wouldn't allow him to plug his book. I guess that Brock forgot that he was on Fox plugging his book and the pictures are on Andrew Sullivan. Com. Brock just can't stop lying!!Also Drudge has reported that Brock was in the loony bin when he wrote the book...Figures!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Bust for Brock.","review":"David Brock churns out another pile of trash in his newest book \\"Blinded By the Right\\". He continues to prove that he is nothing more than a glorified tabloid writer. The author of \\"The Seduction of Hilary Clinton\\" tries to convince everyone he is only out to clear his conscience and uncover the conspiracy being run by the conservatives. This quite apparently never would have happened if he couldn't make money out of it. He didn't have a conscience when he blatently concealed information in the Clarence Thomas sexual harassment fiasco, and certainly hasn't gained one now. Seizing the oppurtunity, Brock further proves that he should be writing for the National Enquirer, exposing FAKE scandals, since he has so aptly proven his ablility so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh..........","review":"There is no reason to believe that Mr. Brock is any more truthful and honest now than when he was working for the \\"other\\" side 10 years ago. It all appears very self serving to me, and some reviewers have said that many of his facts in this book are just as iffy as in his earlier tabloid publications.It would be a much more effective, interesting and enjoyable read if Brocke in this book stuck to politics and journalism, and did not turn this all into some type of pop-psychologico journey for personal identity salvation. Also, for someone who has as much media clout as he has, and who seems to have a commercially succesful writing career yet in front of him, the lack of reflection, thoughtfulness, and general intelligence is disheartening."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 problems","review":"There are only two problems with this book:1) Clinton recommends it to his aides.2) Brock has always been a Politically Correct Liberal. That's right, this is not a story by a defector.... He was never a Conservative thinker...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foolish","review":"Well, I have to say that the essence of liberalism is captured in this diatribe of hate and self-loathing. Preying upon the emotions of the weak and destitute and those that feel like outsiders in an attempt to ignite American class warfare by oversimplfying fundamentally complex issues is very dangerous to our society. Read this book if you want better understanding of the caustic machines called leftism and socialism. For enlightenment, I would suggest you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing insight into the dirty politics of the right","review":"I just finished reading this book . . . I stayed up to 5 a.m. last night finishing the book because it was so riveting. The book provides a great looking into the world of dirty politics via character assassination. During the entire Clinton presidency, right-wing billionaires funded investigations and right-wing publications with attempts to bring down the Clinton presidency. Most of the alleged Clinton scandals we heard about (Whitewater, travelgate, filegate, troopergate, etc.) were figments in the wild imagination of right-wing operatives. Only the Monica Lewinsky affair was real. Only the word 'vast' in Hillary's famous reference to a \\"vast right-wing conspiracy\\" was an exagerration.This book is a must-read for anyone that wishes to understand the American system of scandal-driven politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best political book this year","review":"Although others such as \\"The Hunting of a President\\" covered the subject, this book added the personal observations of David Brock from deep inside the inner most circles of the infamous \\"Clinton Haters\\". By time you get through the troopergate chapter, you can \\"feel\\" the uncontrolable hatred these sick people have and it becomes very difficult to put down the book. Most political books in the past have put me to sleep - they were too boring but this one kept my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shining a Light into a Vast Well of Darkness","review":"It is a rare person who can own up to past mistakes and youthful delusions. Rarer still is a person doing so publicly. So, bravo to David Brock. I've nothing but admiration for that all-too-rare quality of trying to correct personal wrongs. (And David, a request? Please call Anita Hill and finally apologize in person. Does she not deserve this? And will you not benefit as well?)That said, Brock's book is a fascinating, grim, and quite scary insiders look at what is wrong with American politics. Sadly, I've no idea of how to repair this serious decline in ethics, standards -- and vision -- that has overwhelmed American politics (right and left), but I thank Brock for shining a light into a vast well of darkness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"Today is 3/16/02.

This book is great and it is a must have for anyone interested in what goes on behind the curtain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining as hell","review":"Man, I've been waiting to read this book since I read Brock's fit of apologia in Esquire in 1997. It's a good window into the fevered swamp of the conservative movement, it provides plate upon plate of good dish on various conservatives (although if you're an eeeeevvill lib-rul elitist like me, the claims that the righty ranks are full of anti-semites, homophobes and a therapist's dream assortment of various obsessions and complexes won't come as a surprise) and Brock seems sincere enough in its pages. True, he may have lied in print to serve The Party, but unlike slimebaugh, he admits it, and I have no reason to doubt him now.Although it's not a book that'll be a cornerstone of progressivism, for liberals like me it's damn entertaining, and will undoubtedly send the slack-jawed armada of \\"freepers\\" into fits. If nothing else, \\"Blinded\\" is certainly illustrative of just how far off the rails rightists have gone. Brock's a pretty good writer, too, and the book's hardly boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blinded by the light...weight","review":"This guy is a mental lightweight who clearly has no idea where his conscious lies. With this book, he has clearly severed all ties with journalistic credibility. In my opinion, he is trying to revive a career with a controversial political \\"switch\\".

His owns columns and rights to free speech were suppressed by the left and liberals because they didn't like what he said! Ironic isn't it? Do yourself a favor, save your money. If you are to purchase this book, do it for one reason only, to see the hypocrisy and confusion he struggles with in his own life. Maybe it was the lattes at cafe roma, (ROFL)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD, PATHETIC AND SLEAZY","review":"A truly sad mea culpa from a sleazy, pathetic man who admits what some of us have long suspected - that David Brock is a pathological liar whose work needs to be sealed off by the EPA.

However this book is entertaining in that it shows how one person can deceive themself while attempting to deceive others. Avoid this book and instead try reading a good John Grisham novel like his latest one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"David Brock is a talented writer and knows how to make his points, such as they are. But he has run out of things to say. Maybe a book is just too much content and he would be better sticking with journalistic length pieces. He doesn't have that much to say; so the empty space gets filled with a lot of stuff from David's Id that I really find boring.In short, this is a bitchy little book by a little man. I was completely unable to sustain interest in David Brock working thru his personal problems in public.He should go away for 10 years, grow up, and then try writing another book. He has the talent to write a good one. But he needs something to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinarily interesting read","review":"What a remarkable expose. Regardless of where you fall on the spectrum, I think one has to read this book to help make up your own mind about the political history of the 1990s. It's a fascinating read, full of named names and detailed accounts of a not-so-righteous right-wing machinery. It's a shame to read the ad homininum attacks on the author (some reviews in this space) as simplistic rebuttals. Brock skewers himself as much as anyone with this book; judge for yourself his crediblity. And if even a third of the picture that this book paints is true...I am worried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confirms what I always suspected","review":"David Brock's expose of the New Right confirms what I always thought was true of the \\"movement\\" as he calls it:Modern conservatism is a bankrupt and utterly destructive system of non-ideas that could never withstand the light of day. The only way the neocons can advance is through negative attacks, innuendo, lies and, ultimately, stealing elections. The sad fact is that this cabal of right wing lawyers, writers and political hack/operatives are finally in power as Brock points out at the end of his book. These folks don't create or accomplish anything...they simply form conservative think tanks and watchdog groups funded by Richard Mellon Scaife to spread their political excrement. They have all the money in the world but no class."},{"rating":"2","title":"A jaw-dropper and a must read for the 2008 elections","review":"There isn't much I can say about this book that hasn't already been said in other favorable reviews here. All I'll add is that even if you allow for the zeal of Brock's re-converson to liberal prinicples and some bitterness towards his former conservative and neocon mentors and paymasters, there is much in this book that rings frighteningly true. Most fascinating is Brock's inside look at the anti-Clinton smear machine of which he was part - and which, no doubt, is warming up for 2008. Arm yourself with knowledge that you'll need if Hillary runs for President. Read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa, Nelly","review":"Oh dear me. An excellent if sometimes gossipy and unevenly written look at the inner workings of a poisonous cabal. Brock damns himself as much as his former associates, quite consciously and thoroughly. He's a brave man. As more and more information emerges in the form of Robert Ray's final reports surrounding the Lewinsky and Whitewater investigations, this book helps chart why they started and what they really meant. Another reviewer has mentioned that Brock was confronted on TV with \\"facts\\" he couldn't \\"refute,\\" yet does not identify the show or the interviewer. My suggestion: said reviewer is tainted by a particular bias, and really needs to read what the Ray report DID say about Willey (hint: it's not very nice if you read it carefully)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic.","review":"I recently read this book. First, I enjoyed it. Many political books are dry reads. This one is not.D. Brock's comments about how the extreme right captured the GOP seem right on point. Given his history, I would not take every factual comment he makes as gospel; but, anyone who blindly relies on the statements of a political writer is trapped in a grade-school mentality.The book is a great insight into the back room workings of extremists. True, he really picks only on the GOP's extreme right, but, I think even he admits that the extreme left would do the same. They, however, are not as organized.In case anyone thinks it is relevant to the review, I am a moderate. I have voted for both Dems and GOPers. I enjoy reading both liberal and conservative writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The jig is up.","review":"This is an intelligent and revealing book and critically important. It describes clearly, from behind the scenes by a former operative, the beliefs and actions of certain individuals and publications and think tanks of the far right, which is, alas, the section of the party in control of the Republicans at the moment (Lincoln Chafee please clone yourself). Most usefully it reveals the source of some of the funding backing the far right. Follow the money, said the wise man. The book is sorely in need of an index, however, since \\"Blinded By the Right\\" should be next to the TV as a background resource when watching the news shows and their parade of talking heads."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thank You, Sir.","review":"I must admit that it was fun to read a bit of dirt on people as repugnant as Anne Coulter and Newt Gingrich. But the fun wore off when I realized I was just reading a left-wing version of the same sort of low-brow tripe that currently infects conservatism political \\"thought\\".Mr. Brock's epiphany has come conveniently late. He and his ilk have already mananged to dumb down the discourse on one side of the political aisle, and now it seems he'd like to expand the franchise to the Democratic side. No thank you, Mr. Brock.If I'd wanted to read books filled with pseudo-political drivel written by un-journalists of questionable ethics, I would've become a Republican."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter bowling shooes","review":"product arrived quickly and as described.

Some of the trails described no longer meaningfully existed as such, and one was a dirt road with a heavy 4wd traffic. After having been mislead one too many times, we abandoned this book completely and relied only on the trail descriptions inThe Ultimate Kauai Guidebook: Kauai Revealed (Ultimate Kauai Guidebook). That said, we looked to this book only for hikes, not beach walks and the like. It may be that it is a very competent guide for strolls. This book doesn't describe that many more hikes than the Ultimate Guidebook does, but the way some trails are broken into several hikes makes it seem at first glance that it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent trail book","review":"I can't imagine the trip we took without this guide. It took us along trails that were stunning and amazingly little traveled. I felt like we saw the REAL Kauai. Surely it wasn't the hotels at the shore.

Worth owning if yer a fan.","review":"Peel songs can be something or not. The UNDERTONES were one of those bands who pretty much recreated their songs in the Peel studios live like they sounded on their records. I've heard several live UNDERTONES shows and they really got into it. Actually, I sent like 12 friends and relatives to see their San Diego show in like 1980 and I was workin' that evening. BUMMER.So, yeah, these Peel songs are nice but not crucial. Yer not gonna hear great variations on the studio versions here. A big UNDERTONES fan should definitely get them cuz, well, cuz it's more UNDERTONES, in theory. Otherwise, I'd stick with their studio albums.I always wanna hear Peel sets by the bands I really like to see if there's variations on some of their great songs. You don't really find that here.

This incredible track shows just how much Madonna understands what music is underground, and how to bring it to the masses, coupled with the brilliant video, Bedtime Story is trully a masterstroke of utter intelligence and serene science-fiction! Madonna outdid herself with Bedtime Story, written by the tehcno-princess Bjork and produced by Nellee Hooper, make no mistake, this is Madonna at her best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless Junior Vasquez remixes ruin the song.","review":"These remixes are a perfect example of why you should never have just one DJ remix your song. \\"Bedtime Story\\", one of my favorite Madonna songs of all time somehow fell almost entirely on the mixing board of Junior Vasquez. Junior's mix of jungle-drum rhythms and absurd synth chords just do not lend well to pop music. In Junior's mind, everything should be remixed in his style to play over and over again at mindless white parties and Ibiza club nights.If you want to hear the worst of Junior Vasquez look no further than these remixes which incidentally ended all future collaboration between Madonna and Junior.

Her family is split up and she is taken as a SLAVE! When I first read this book, I must have been 13 or so, and I found it to be utterly terrifying. Most Americans who were born and raised in the US have no clue what it would be like to have tanks and intruders rolling into one's town, taking power, taking Democracy, and forcing us to be COMMUNISTS!

The main character isn't particularly compelling or likeable: just a typical strong and flawless victim/activist (who is a young and attractive female, of course). Nothing in this book touched me emotionally at all; it's just melodrama. I love how in the first chapter a sister to the main character is mentioned once, then completely forgotten about. This is typical; the novel's people all just seem to be placeholders being used to work out the author's intellectual exercise.

If you're new to Lovecraft, or haven't read him, don't bother to get enthousiastic about it. It sucks! These are stories he had to write for others, or he wouldn't have bread on his table. And it tells! These stories are not Lovecraftian, but it will make you laugh if you know something about the horror pulp in the magazines back then. Or Lovecraft didn't give a damn about what would come out of his pen, or he had a jolly time mimicking ridiculous horror fiction.

I was fascinated by the exposition of how conclusions can be drawn about climate change. Alley briefly explains several different methods, but goes into detail on how ice cores can be used to make educated guesses about past climate. Very simply, every year there is a new layer on top of the Greenland glacier that can be analyzed chemically and differences in the chemical makeup of the layer reflect differences in the underlying climate (temperature).I found the book fascinating, although it reads somewhat like a textbook rather than a story. However, my purpose in reading it was to try to understand for myself how conclusions on climate change are being reached, and the book fills that purpose admirably."},{"rating":"2","title":"About half way done...","review":"I'm only about half way done but I am really enjoying the book. It is a very easy read, not very technical at all but still very informing.

Crystal in its final version in the GETREADY album is leagues better than any versions in this CD-Single. This CD would have been a good buy if they included the other two tracks not included in the final version of GETREADY. Instead they only add another track...!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crystal Broken into Unsalvagable Granules","review":"While \\"Crystal\\" is one of New Order's best singles to date, the remixes included on this CD deconstruct all the great qualities of the song.

These remixes are barren, not beautiful, and lack energy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen more than once","review":"I have to admit, I was let down when I first heard this track. But I didn't tire of it, even after listening to all the remixes. This CD-single didn't wear out its welcome, even after hearing what is essentially the same song (albeit in 8 quite different versions) over and over. And now I find myself humming the tune and wanting more. The \\"B-side\\" (track 9) is also quite good, perhaps better than the single itself.

'Crystal' is a very fresh and raw sounding track. It epitomizes Bernard Sumner's angst while complimented most eagerly by Peter Hook's talented bass playing. After seeing them perform live in California, I can wholeheartedly tell you that they are BACK!! The thing to do now is e-mail your radio stations and request that 'Crystal' be on the playlist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar comeback for legendary British band","review":"New Order is back with a killer new single, a preview of their first new album in 8 years. \\"Crystal\\" recalls the guitar-heavy era of \\"Brotherhood\\" and \\"Low-Life,\\" incorporating New Order's trademark of solid hooks and Bernard Sumner's instantly recognizable vocals. New Order's extended hiatus has obviously energized the band; \\"Crystal\\" is a solid, cathartic, rocking tune from a band not often associated with pure rock 'n' roll. But fans of New Order's more dance-oriented releases need not worry. \\"Crystal\\" boasts a solid groove tailor-made for dance floors, and the Digweed/Muir remixes on the maxi-single release are instant classics. New Order is definitely back, and the world of music is a much better place with their participation."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all about the b-side..","review":"This CD is really terrific. First off for only half the price of a regular CD you get an hour's worth of music. That's good. \\"Crystal\\" is a really good song...but what makes this CD is the b-side \\"Behind Closed Doors\\" it's worth the price alone. It's slow and has haunting vocals...the lyrics are great the piano meshes perfectly. Crystal is...well Crystal. Good guitar hook (the female vocals do sound out of place a bit) and the song bops along merrily at its own pace.The remixes tend to get tedious after awhile (especially the Digweed ones..too long and dull) but the overall quality makes up for it.Worthwhile pickup."},{"rating":"2","title":"The influence of Corgan..","review":"is obvious on the sound and the production, but even in lieu of that, the song is simply superb. It's not a flat-out masterpiece like \\"True Faith\\", but when you're one of the best bands in the world, what are you going to do other than what you do best? A driving fusion of dance and rock, and that's what \\"Crystal\\" is. Hopefully the success of the single and their upcoming release will drag these legends from their respective self-inflicted reclusions, but hey, if they release killer songs like \\"Brutal\\" and \\"Crystal\\" on a semi-regular basis, us lovers of music won't complain too much, will we?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not inspiring, just dull as dishwater.","review":"Save your money.

While she managed to score a #1 record with \\"Chain Reaction\\" in Europe, the singles from the album flopped on the Pop charts in the states while the title track only saw moderate success on the U.S. R&B listings. The album went no where on either chart.Despite returning to Motown and recording a couple of fine albums after this muddled mess, Ross has failed to redeem herself on the charts, lacking a significant hit since 1984."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD SERVICE.","review":"I made an order to this product in February 2010 and I still continue waiting to receive the order item.

However, the album does sound like Spector put most of his efforts into that song and very little on the others. The others are fine, but they don't come anywhere close to the majesty of the title track.(Also, the samples associated with this album are incorrect. They're from a different album.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good addition to the Freestylers collection.","review":"I have the previous Freestylers albums, We Rock Hard and Pressure Point. This album has more of the similar beats and cadences that define the Freestylers, but with the addition of several tracks of female vocals and slower, yet upbeat music make this a great addition to the collection!

Disney Studios made a number of quieter movies specifically for the foreign market tastes, and they usually ran it on the television show later. This aired in Europe in 1977, and was broadcast on \\"The Wonderful World of Disney\\" as a two part show beginning on March 25, 1979. Directed by Don Chaffey, it is the story of a young boy in Australia who loves the sport of horse harness racing, which he shares with his grandfather. Grandpa runs a farm, but is losing money on it when he finds a young horse that could be a big winner. They train the horse together and learn some lessons along the way. Great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Born to Run","review":"At times the sound quality of this video was fair but that is to be expected for an older video tape.

What legal or artistic machinations lie behind these dreadful changes remain elusive (similar to the evisceration of \\"A Muppet Family Christmas\\" since its early network showings), but the worst that can be said of the terrific CD soundtrack is its ability to evoke bittersweet memories of a movie that had been just about ideal ... and is no more."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Christmas Carol Tale!","review":"Humor and delightful character adaptions make this the best!

Michael Caine does a magnificent job playing Ebeneezer Scrooge and the entire cast of the Muppets retell the story of Charles Dicken's classic, \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" as he encounters three ghosts on Christmas Eve.

I'll put my two cents in. Methinks I hear T-Rex, early Sparks, The Stranglers (distorted organ in the front of the mix), Augustus Pablo and early Gang of Four (gratuitous use of the melodica), and the 1960's hits of Phil Spector (infectious pop hooks within the aforementioned fat, dirty mix). The stand out tracks here are T.K. and 2nd Foot Stomp. I am reasonably certain that my neighbors must be sick of hearing them by now. How about it? With brilliant recent offerings from The Strokes, White Stripes, and Clinic, I am convinced that, as far as pop music and rock n' roll is concerned, we are in the midst of an astonishing (and long overdue) renaissance. We haven't had it this good since 1977-1980."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor","review":"\\"Internal Wrangler\\" is a perfect illustration of the bad things that can happen when alternative music goes mainstream. In the old days (ie. pre-Nirvana), a band like Clinic would most likely be putting out 7-inch singles on its own label, at four or five bucks a pop. In such circumstances their sloppy, amateurish noise pop would be forgiveable, even endearing. However, at the price I paid for this CD I expect a little more -- things like production values, and actual songs, not half-baked doodlings. And if I can't have quality, then at least give me quantity: \\"Internal Wrangler\\" has only 13 tracks, half of them less than three minutes long, maybe 40 minutes of music all told.This is not to say it's a bad disc. But I couldn't enjoy it -- I felt too much like the guys in the band were playing a joke at my expense. The moral? \\"Don't charge corporate-rock prices for something that sounds like you recorded it on a cheap 4-track in your basement\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"They never got better than this!","review":"Not one of the more popular Whitesnake records, this is nevertheless their finest work.Everything after this record was a letdown, including the hair-metal 1987 monster.

The action would have been sustained. Ngaio Marsh, Charles Dickens used lots of words; but then Mr. Shirley is not in their class.Once you realize what is happening, the author repeats and repeats the action in different situations. But it's not suspense from here on out, it's just repetition. He makes a good point about technology, but it's necessary to wade through too many useless words to discover the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shirley's worst","review":"Crawlers is little more than Shirley recycling bad Dean Koontz novels from the late 80s.

But is that bad?","review":"Warning is a different album than the other Green Day releases, something which is obvious when you listen to it for the first time. I find it is a mixed album, with some excellent bits (Misery, and the interesting Blood, Sex, and Booze) and some, well, just uninteresting stuff, like the title track and Macy's Day Parade. Anyone who expected an release that sounded exactly like Insomnia or Nimrod is missing the point of putting out new music. It is called new for a reason, and looking at it in that light, I enjoy most of the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREEN DAY AT ITS PEAK","review":"i cant belive why some people didnt like this cd? it ROCKS i mean it isnt fricken hard core [crud]. it is good music. GET THIS ALBUM. the songs will stay in your head all fricken day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't anyone come up with original music anymore?","review":"Anyone who enjoys the title track, \\"Warning\\" should check out the song \\"Picture Book\\" by the Kinks on their \\"We Are the Village Green Preservation Society\\" album. It's the *same* riff, give or take two notes. Give me a break. They barely even bothered to change keys. I liked Green Day, but Jesus, write a song that *hasn't* been written before! I know there's no market for originality and creativity today, but why not break the monotony instead of jumping on the bland-copyright-infringement-\\"musical\\"-trend?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but GREAT","review":"The first impression when listening to the CD is that it doesn't seem the Green Day's music, it is very acoustic and very slow, but when continuing listening you realize that the letters are fantastic and the songs are all incredible, you will be singing them down the street all the time because they are great.My favorite Green Day albums are the Kerplunk and 1039, I love their oldest songs, Dookie is excellent too and I believe that with Warning they have taken a great step in its musical style, creating an album that MUST be in the collection of everyone who likes the good music. (sorry about my english, It's not very good ;))"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!!! Something new from the best band on the planet!","review":"Green Day has been my favorite band for a very long time. I've followed them every step of the from the Kerplunk days. This new album has been there most highly anticipated and it is amazing, from that catchy song \\"Minority\\" to the different \\"Misery\\" this cd is Green Day at they're best. They've matured so much with this one cd, they even produced it by themselves, showing their raw talent. They did nothing wrong on this cd, and it can only be described as amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greenday - 'Nuff Said","review":"Ok, Maybe not their TOP top album.. in my opinion American Idiot or Dookie would take the No. 1 slot, but I feel that Warning is probably their 3rd best album. It has a lot of \\"re-listen-ability\\". The songs on this one, especially Warning, Minority and Misery, almost beg you to sing along with them. If you like GreenDay at all, I'm betting this will be one of your favorites. And if you somehow DON'T know Greenday much at all, but like Rock/Alternative, this is a good introduction to Mike's fantastic guitar, Tre's insanity on the drums, and, of course, Billie Joe's famous nasal voice that for some reason you just gotta love!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my 2nd review","review":"Green Day have been classified as \\"Punk\\" ..but if u really think about it they have always been slightly Pop music. With their first 5 cds they were 2 parts punk and 1 part pop. With Warning they have shifted to 2 parts pop and 1 part punk. Warning is Punk just not as fast and loud as Green Day used to be heard, this is not a bad thing! If you like Green Day's older stuff, u should like this ..to most people Dookie is and will always be Green Day's #1 cd ..i think that too, but if you want upbeat,witty and catchy pop-punk-rock get this NOW!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, By no means did I see this coming.","review":"I'll admit right off the bat, I'm a new fan of the band, but when i heard warning I was pleasently suprised, Its not nearly as upbeat or angry as warning, but has inspirational lyrics and awesome mixes of acoustic and electric guitar chords. I love Misery, my favorite song on the album, unlike punk operah, \\"American Idiot,\\" it tells short skimpy stories about a couple of people who got some serious problems, complemented by great vocals and a beat you can't help but tap your feet to. Its amazing that there's still a rock band out there that has a care for quality, and Music Theory, you can tell there not in it for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont listen to the five star reviewers...this album is horrible","review":"Green Day is one of the worst bands of recent times and are as bad as similar groups like N'SYNC,BACKSTREET BOYS and WESTLIFE.THEY ARE A TEEN POP BAND AND SUCK!!!!!!!!.Warning is as bad as American Idiot,so take my advice and stay away from this awful album as well as all the other albums from GREEN DAY.Get albums from great bands like THE WHO,LED ZEPPELIN,BLACK SABBATH,DEEP PURPLE,PINK FLOYD,RUSH,ROLLING STONES,AC/DC and THE BEATLES instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"why green day why???","review":"i never thought i would see the day.my favorite punk band has become pop.i loved kerplunk,slappy hours, and nimrod. i had mixed feelings about insomniac,but dookie was my favorite.when i heard minority on the radio i knew i had to get this cd.so i bought it,took it home, and put it in my cd player.i expected more cool punk tunes but all i heard was this god-awful pop music. since when is green day supposed to be soft?i know theyre maturing, but this sounds like a whole new band!hopefully soon they realize how good they once were.but right now, i have one word for you green day:SELLOUTS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vanilla","review":"Plain, uninspired, boring, slow, SOLD OUT. That's to sum up what I think aobut this album. Green Day was my favorite band...they eased me into punk and although tehy didn't always play fastest, they seemed to be the most unique, and to me, prone to be the most origninal. This album, however, sucks. The songs are really far away from Green Day's punk roots, the lyrics seem trite and really meaningless. This album is not Green Day. I saw them play soem of these songs live, and they actually played them like the punks they started as, but they slowed them down on this album to go mainstream. Boo Green Day, and lets hope that they learn to get back to their roots soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: This album does NOT rock!","review":"The rip-it-up Green Day of old is long gone, my friends.

Get out the wheel chairs... looks like Green Day is padding their bank accounts before their retirement. This record is weak. It lacks spunk and muscle. If you long for the Green Day that =rocked=, buy Rancid 2000 instead. This Green Day album has more in common with Backstreet Boys than with anything 'alternative'.

There aren't any songs about hating someone and hoping they die, or about the girl at the library. The songs are much calmer, and somewhat comparable to the beatles(most of them). I'm not much of a Beatles fan, but i love this album. But some advice before listening to the album, don't go into it expecting another Insomniac with hate filled rants(not ragging on those, they were awesome), and you should have no problem enjoying it. It's probobly not their best album, but it's still an awesome cd, and I would reccomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Others","review":"The entire CD is pretty good. You probably know the hit song and that's the reason you're buying this. Once you get bored of that one song you'll get hooked on another and another until you like the whole CD.

You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning: Green Day Rocks Yet Again","review":"Billy Joe heads this hard to resist rock/pop band with another hit album and by far the best. All of the tracks are hits and needed to be cranked. The record even has the amazing track; Misery which tells a story of huge porportions and is beyond me why it never made it as a hit. There's also the hilarious track; Deadbeat Holiday which is perfect to explain the teenage life, parents listen that track it'll help you figure out your kid's life. Tracks; Church On Sunday, Fashion Victim, Hold On, Waiting, Minority, and Macy Day's Parade are what make this album on of the best year. I hope you also enjoy my favorite track; Castaway and leaves you as a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"good album but unexpected","review":"This album is what most old green day (punk/rockers) fans will call a total joke to punk music, still i've been a green day fan since 1039/smothered out slappy hours, and i've kind of grown up along with green day's music. if you liked Nimrod, then, you'll probably like Wrning, because in both CDS green day shows a different level of music, a more openmind style, this doesn't mean that the've totally given up their punk rock roots, they're just trying not to be repetitive, this is a great album, but there are very few songs i still don't get, maybe cause I don't listen to that record much, but this is once again a green day record no matter what their music sounds like, they are basiclly good musicians, and billie joe is a very talented song writer, and this album is different ... yeah... but is good anyway"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sellout Rock From A Sellout Band","review":"I'd like to start off by saying I'm a huge Green Day fan. Dookie is my favorite CD of all I own, and Nimrod is great, but this CD is absolutely not good. Don't waste your money on this unless you are into slow soft rock. I listened to this CD two times and then gave it away. It is obvious in every song that Green Day did this just for money and Blink 182 stole their status of the most popular pop-punk band. While Enemma of the State might be a sellout CD also, it is so much better than this it's amazing. Excluding two songs, every song on Warning sounds the same. If you like Dookie this CD will disappoint you greatly. Warning is proof of why you no longer see Green Day on tv or hear them on the radio, because they are no longer any good..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING:THIS ALBUM SUCKS!!!!!!!!!","review":"My friends first and foremost I would want everyone to ignore the previous reviewer(An alias of Whirligig) and avoid this lousy Green Day cd.Green day are legends only in the previous reviewer\\"s mind.Their only listenable cd is Dookie which only deserves a two star rating.Forget Green day,listen to Led Zeppelin's debut album instead.that rocks!,not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING is Right!","review":"Sorry, but this album is actually quite awful. Firstly, I luv these guys; I thought Insomniac was great when people were dumping all over them. Nimrod was a bit more progressive, but still enjoyable. On Warning: There's only one song (besides the single, Minority) that I found listenable. Sheesh, there's almost a polka on there. Sure the masses want progression etc., but lest ye not forget GD is supposed to be a punk band (I'm not going to get into the whole punk ethos here). I would say progress with the lyrics and the arrangements, but the guitar is almost non-existant (sounds like blue-grass). Oh well, the new Offspring is coming out. This album is definitely passble."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKY, POPPY, GAY LAME ALBUM","review":"TRUST Me, i used to like greenday when they were still real- when they still had their punk juices flowing; but this album is simply [not good]- it's not punk anymore; i didn't feel even a single punk vibe throuhout the whole album, it's all pop, meaningless, collection of radio-friendly ... songs; some say they matured in this album, but i say they just sold out; some say blink 182 and sum-41 [are not good], but this one proves green day is the worst among all of them; so if you're a pop fan and you like nsync, buy this one coz green day lowered down to this level known as pop music; but if you're a true punk fan, PLS.

Billie Joe and the boys really outdid themselves this time. Don't expect to hear a dozen 2-minute songs of them whining and ranting about this and that like the other albums. This album really demonstrates how they've matured as musicians and songwriters. There's a lot of acoustic guitar, horns, harmonica, and other non-typical Green Day stuff. I especially liked the refreshing and melodic track \\"Church on Sunday\\", the unusual waltzy-sounding \\"Misery\\", and the mellow ballad \\"Macy Day Parade.\\" If you're craving the old traditional Green Day, then there's the punkish \\"Minority\\", \\"Castaway\\", and \\"Blood Sex and Booze\\". The band really expanded their music and their abilities with this diverse collection of songs. I highly recommend this album to anyone, even those of you who don't know Green Day.

There is a reason that there are no songs like \\"Longview\\" or \\"Basketcase\\" on this recording: Billie Joe and the guys have grown up. While this may upset some people, I feel that a true testament to the quality of a band is how they grow over the years. I have every Green Day album and while this one strays from any they have done, I think in its own right, it is fantastic. If you truly listen to the message the songs convey, you will understand that the band has been through a lot, and unlike a lot of bands today, Green Day has survived.

Do Not Buy This CD!!!","review":"The early 90's punk rock band, Greenday, has previously put out four great punk albums: 1,039 Smothed Out Slappy Hours (1990), Kerplunk (1991), Dookie (1994), Insomniac (1994), and Nimrod (1997). The realse of there new album, Warning, was long awaited by millions of Geenday fans worldwide. However, the joy of a new Greenday was soon dampered when it occured to the old school Greenday fans that this album is the worst yet.The reason that I gave this album 2 stars is: 1. Its greenday and 2. I like the song Misery. This didn't even deserve 1 star.

Let's settle it right now: THEY NEVER WERE TO BEGIN WITH, AND THEY SURE AREN'T NOW! Have any of you kids ever listened to their first vinyl EPs (well, I did...way back in 1989). I'm assuming not, because if you did, you wouldn't be calling them \\"punk\\" anymore. You probably wouldn't even be fans of them anymore, either. I wouldn't blame you, though. The recording quality was unbelievably poor, and the songs are stupid and sappy. Did I mention they couldn't even play their instruments? Well, I just did (and they still can't, even today). That's right, kiddies, Billie Joe (a High School drop-out and stoner) still hasn't learned to play more than three chords in over the 10+ years he's been in the band. Thank God John Kiffmyer left the band while he still could (back in early 1990) to pursue a college career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Green Day's Worst Album","review":"This album is horrendous, it never should have been released. It shows Green Day running out of gas, churning out three- minute pop songs. I bought this cd and regretted it immediately. Sure, some of the songs like 'church on sunday' and 'waiting' sound ok, but overall the album is a waste of your time and money. Green Day's old school stuff was awesome, raw, and honest material. Dookie and Insomniac are both awesome, and Nimrod shows Green Day at their creative peak, but it seemed that Green Day were on the downside of their career when this came out in 2000. American Idiot is their first good album in 7 years. So, once again, Warning is garbage and is not worth your money. If you are just checking out Green Day buy Dookie, Insomniac, Nimrod, and American Idiot."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really worth your hard earned cash","review":"yeah ok so minority and warning are pretty good but the rest of the album isn't very good to be honest.i mean yeah its ok if you like that sort of thing but its not going to convert you or anything, save you money up and buyt something diffrent like brit rockers feeder, and their fourth album echo park."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!

When they did a concert when nimrod had been released 3 years ago they played almost all there songs from nimrod.

Well now they do country dance music."},{"rating":"1","title":"And now for something completely similar..","review":"Warning isn't necesarrily a bad CD. It just isn't all that great. It lacks Green Day's usual energy and humor; the songs seem to get diluted and repetitive. Minority, one of the CD's better moments, is a catchy anthemic song about nonconformity and shunning authority, as is the title track, Warning, with lyrics that were supposedly taken off bumper stickers. I found the song Waiting to get pretty annoying, Billie Joe's voice seems almost nasal on this track and is it just me or does it sound a hell of a lot like a song called Downtown or something? I heard a radio DJ mention that too.If you're looking for a good Green Day CD, you'd be better off with one of their earlier efforts such as Dookie or Nimrod, from before they seemed to lose their edge. If you like Green Day, also check out Bad Relgion, a great punk band, The Living End, Suicide Machines, etc.Growing up, selling out, call it what you want but Green Day just isn't the same with Warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most disappointing cd's in a long time","review":"After hearing Green Day's first single on the radio from Warning, Minority, I was a bit worried about the cd. I decided to buy it anyway since Im a huge Green Day fan and it is by far, the worst Green Day album. It seems as if they are selling out, changing their sound to mainstream ska type music, with poppy melodies, that sound like they could have been released in the 50's. Macy Day Parade is a lame follow up to the great Time of Your Life and the majority of the songs just don't seem right. They've also lost their smart, yet funny lyrics from the Dookie days. The pluses, though, include th up-beat Warning and the traditional Deadbeat Holiday. Hopefuly their next cd goes back to the Dookie sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"not like the previous green day CDs","review":"I bought this CD on the assumption that a lot of the songs would be like Minority, which is a great song. I was surprised to learn that this CD is softer than its predecessors like dookie and insomniac (which I strongly recommend). There are only a few songs on this CD that I found particularly good: Minority, Castaway, and Deadbeat Holiday. Misery is also a good song, and it shows a different style from the others. The rest of the CD is simply mediocre. The new sound of Green Day just doesn't work as well as the heavier instrumentation in earlier songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could see this coming","review":"Green Day used to be my favorite band, but when Nimrod came out, I could see them starting to go down hill. Green Day is running out of orginality. All of their new stuff on Warning sounds like softer versions of their old stuff, and they have ripped the beetles off many times in this cd. I know that they are not changing their sound just to be popular,(like blink 182), but they could've done a lot better on this album. There isn't one punk song on it, and everything sounds the same. This is definatly Green Days worst work. I wouldn't waste your money on it. Instead buy some NOFX. They are one band that will never sellout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the older stuff","review":"This is a good CD. It is not as good as Green Day's older stuff, such as Kerplunk, 39 Smooth, and Dookie. It is still a great CD. Misery is different from the other stuff, but is probably my favorite song. I would reccomend everyone to buy this CD, mainly because it's Green Day and they Rock!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Day's indisputable best","review":"I am and have been a Green Day fan since the days of 39/Smooth, and have watched Green Day grow from a college band to the Kings of Punk Rock, to what they are now. I have not listened to a single track on Warning that did not impress me.But WARNING to Green Day fans, Green Day isn't punk rock anymore, be prepared when you buy this cd for Green Day at a different level. I have to say, this is their best, particularly Castaway, Warning, Minority, and just about every track with the exception of \\"Macy's Day Parade.\\"What I'm saying is, if you're ready for a new Green Day and better Green Day than you've EVER seen before.... just buy this cd it's awsome."},{"rating":"2","title":"WARNING: Great album with balance!","review":"With WARNING, Green Day finds (IMHO) the balance they were searching for on Nimrod (a great album itself, but in ways a bit lopsided). With these 12 expertly crafted songs, Green Day walk the perfect line between their anti-authority past and their more grown up side which first showed itself on \\"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life\\". Not to be repetitive, but it is true that \\"Macy's Day Parade\\" succeeds in the same way, and to a larger extent, in establishing their more mature side. They even offer a cautionary tale in the rollicking \\"Jackass\\", which takes a direct stab at the very people they used to be. Not an easy thing to pull off without sounding overly self deprecating, but Green Day do it quite well.If you want Green Day just as it used to be, go for Insomniac or Dookie....if you want Green day as it used to be and a lot older and wiser, get your hands on Warning. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"Warning was not what I expected but it is not a bad album. I will expect better next time around but maybe I am bias because I like their old stuff. Anyways, some bands really leap forward when they reinvent there sound but Greenday does not. Radiohead has done an excellent job changing from album to album (see Kid A) please Greenday stick to what you do best and do not make any more songs like \\"Misery\\", I felt like I was in Misery listening to this....hopefully this will be the last album like this they ever make. buy this used if best and do not pay full price like me... they made a fast buck on this disappointing album..... what's sad is it took three years to make it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the long wait","review":"After nearly 3 years Green Day releases the new album Warning, containing a much different sound than anything they've done before. They are happier now and straying further and further away from the Dookie sound. This is however not at all a bad thing. This is close to being my favourite release by them so far (a few more listens and it probably will be.) Every song has a different feel to it, the most obvious being Misery..which is unlike anything i've ever heard before, not just from Green Day. The best songs on here I think are : Blood Sex and Booze, Misery, Deadbeat Holiday and Waiting. But the rest are also incredible. A great purchase and possibly the best cd so far this year (just have to wait for Limp Bizkit.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"way rad album","review":"i've been reading some of the reviews and alot of them are complaning that it dosent sound the same as the old stuff. one of the reason this album is so rad that it's so different. i can't stop loving how it's so different. the first time i heard the song \\"misery\\" i just said to myself wow!. so if your a green day fan this is a must. so make sure you check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Green Day CD","review":"This CD is just so cool.

But I liked them so much I went out and bought six albums, (seeing as how this doesn't quite compete to Nimrod- I'm not sure anything could- I've only given it four stars). So I was delighted when I heard they were releasing a new album, and was CERTAINLY not disappointed when I bought it on the day it came out! It has so much variety, from the 'Time of Your Life'-esque 'Macy's Day Parade' to the, erm, Levellers- esque single 'Minority' and the punk-pop 'Church on Sunday', it's clear Green Day still haven't lost it. The best track is probably 'Blood, Sex and Booze', or 'Misery', both of which are really different and unusual (and have great lyrics as always). They may have changed their style over the years but they still sound great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"'Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout a brand new hope.....","review":"Green Day is a good band but they just like Metallica, eventually slowed things down.

It held a lot of the old Green Day energy, with songs like Minority, and rampant insanity, Blood Sex and Booze, with a mix of heavy seriousness.Before you dismiss a CD based on a harsh Music Critic's perspective, ask yourself \\"Are you loyal to your band, or are you loyal to a critic?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What Is Going On Here?","review":"I bought this album the first day it came out, and the first thing i thought was..\\"A lot of fans are gonna hate this\\" Not as many as I expected hated it, but atleast i am not the only one who thinks it sucks. A few people complained about Nimrod cuz it was softer, but I liked it, cuz the songs were GOOD. Warning is a letdown. What happened to the driving guitar distortion Billie loved to use on songs like \\"Longview\\" and \\"Geek Stink Breath\\" and other classics? Beats me, he must of lost his distortion pedal. The only songs worth listening to are Blood... and Minority. I suggest that any new fans should buy the albums in this order: Dookie, Nimrod, Insomniac, Kerplunk!, and 1039... then Warning. Hopefully someday they will get back to their punk/rock roots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cd, but I miss the ska...","review":"I don't think anyone can say this is a shame to Green Day.

I do like this cd, no questions there, but where is the pure raw energy? There's chruch on Sunday that remains faithful to the punk-ska style everybody knows and loves, there are more upbeat riffs similar to minority, but they wear down, where has the magic that the band who made Dookie and Insomniac gone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best (according to me)","review":"Eh, this CD is definitely not one of my favorites. Some of the songs like 'Church on Sunday', 'Minority', and 'Macy's Day Parade' are pretty good, but most of the songs I don't even listen to when the chance comes that I actually listen to the CD. I bought this CD after I heard 'Minority', and I do really like this song, but the CD isn't worth getting just for that. At least according to me it's not.

I am a hige green day fan but this is thier worst work. They are toning down thier lyrics thier music is going soft. Whether this is because they are getting older have families or fame has finaly gotten to them. The one song that saves this cd from getting one review is the song minority. This song should become a punk anthem. Unfortunately this one song cannot carry the whole cd. The other songs while easy beats to get into do not sound anything like Nimrod or Dookie thier best cd. If they are switching genres then more power to them but as a punk band they are no longer. If possibly buy the single don't waste your money on the other stuff on this cd.

The vocalist has an amazing low growl scream, the guitars are near flawless, and the drumming is absolutely fantastic which fits every song nicely.

Both actors and production are awful, the movie is full of cliches and Chechik tries to save something from the wreckage by a useless bloody end. There is no suspense of psychological tension in it, Clouzot's version was built on a subtle climate of anxiety and terror. Here there is only a bad mixing between buffoons characters (like the female inspector) and sentimental situations that could fit into a Reader's Digest dramatic story. This movie (can we really call it like that ?) is representative of the Hollywood (Holy-money) remake industry trying to make money on classics masterpieces (the remake of Psycho is another example). Don't even waste your time to see it, go directly to the original version of Henri-Georges Clouzot.

This is a story of cheating, lust, deciet and murder. Of course Stone is going to play that well. That is the momentum for the plot, without that, there is no story.Having seen the original a number of times, all I can say is I wish they would have kept the original ending. It was by far better than this.That is why I only gave it 4 stars.Word to the wise.... if you like twisted mysteries that are convoluted, you should like this.

If you're looking for a full body workout, her it is....oh, except she doesn't work on the abs. Her tape is not a typical aerobic workout but more so she does sets and repetitions; you don't feel like you're out of breathe by the end of the tape.

If you want a workout tape that visually conveys that working out is a DRUDGERY, then this is the tape for you.I bought this tape after buying and thoroughly enjoying the \\"New Dimensions\\" tape by Kathy Kaehler with Cindy Crawford. In this newer video, the producers wised up and the tape is filmed in great cool, soothing blues with great scenery (beaches, skylines, etc.) and nice music.

The drums uses a lot of light snare, which you probably like if you like the Charlie Brown Christmas album.I listened to this on Pandora last year, and I've been eying it for a couple of years, and it was well-worth the purchase.

The title of this book should be: \\"What Freemasonry is NOT\\"; instead of presenting what Freemasonry is, how it started, and what it actually is, the author devotes 500+ pages and 30+ chapters to presenting 30+ theories of the origin of Freemasonry AND THEN goes on to explain how EACH of these theories, one by one, is flawed, wrong, or otherwise inaccurate. I started reading the book with a clear question in mind: \\"What is Freemasonry and where did it start?\\". When I finished the book, I was no better off than when I started. The book does a wonderful job of confusing, confounding, clouding, and misinforming, which is really a shame, because I had heard that Mackey was supposed to be quite an authority on Masonic History. Overall, a big waste, and written in archaic language, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"History Book? Nope.","review":"If you are looking for a history book, then you've come to the wrong place. Basically, it is a chapter by chapter evaluation of the myth of where Freemasonry came from along with Mackey stating at the end, this is not correct. This goes on for each chapter and by the 3rd or 4th, you can just turn to the last page in the chapter and read the synopsis and you will get the gist of the entire chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This book is aweful!

Here we have another movie with Ms. Whurer and it is just like most of her movies very very poorly acted and just a waste of time and film for that matter. If all you are looking for is a movie to see her nude than this is for you. If you are not and you are looking for some entertainment than I sugest that you don't waste your time and money.

Kari Wuhrer is in it and she's a babe. But if you really want to see her act (and who really does) rent Kate's Addiction, or An Ocassional Hell. Throughout this lousy \\"art\\" film, we see far too much of the lead actor moping around trying to find inspiration. HELLO! Have you seen your girlfriend lately? The film would have been much stronger had the premise been more of a subplot. They needed to focus on Kari and her inner turmoil. At one point in the movie she suggests going dancing and seeing friends. Yes, that's precisely what they should have done. The paint fumes in this movie left me gasping for breath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luscious aka Vivid","review":"In case you wanna know, this film was released in 1997 under the title \\"Vivid\\", and Kari Wuhrer was credited as Kari Salin back then.

Personally I think this girl is so \\"luscious\\" we just can't help looking for her although we gave up expecting anything big from her films. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naked girl","review":"In this movie if you want to see Kari Wuhrer naked you will see that but if you are looking for some kind of plot it is lacking there.

Jeff explains how he came up with these recipes and presents his extensive background in nutrition and cooking. Having young children help in the kitchen shows how easy these recipes really are.Cons: Most of the meals are too similar, although our family enjoyed eating all of them. Using a different base for some of the recipes might help with providing more variety.

What I got was what looks like a (poorly made) home video of basically one recipe repeated 5 times. Throwing a few canned and frozen ingredients in a pot and just heating it up is not cooking. Nor does it give the dish any flavor. The recipes all taste awful. If you eat crap food to begin with and don't have any taste buds, then you might like this DVD but otherwise, all the recipes taste like warmed up V8 juice. Maybe if a little bit of olive oil (which won't kill anybody) was added (along with salt, which Jeff says can be added) and if the food was actually allowed to cook properly, maybe half an hour, to allow all the flavors to blend together, then maybe these recipes might be edible.

The way that scales are presented is incomplete with only partial scales and very poor explanations of how the different forms within a scale link together that I would actually consider as being wrong. A lot of the examples and techniques explained are stupid.

People intended to be sympathetic just don't come across that way (I really kept wondering why everyone thought Ann was so wonderful, when she was consistently anything but - and to say I didn't get the appeal of the hero's old flame is putting it mildly), and the ending.... Well, it's difficult to say much without giving away spoilers, but the ending ruined the book for me in terms of enjoyment. It was clever in a technical sense, but not very believable when added to all the misdirection.

I also discovered that it had been manufactured in Taiwan, and with cheaper, weaker materials.The arms holding the sandpaper in place bent completely out of shape on the third piece of sandpaper I inserted. BTW, I'm 69 years old, and not an overly strong person.Instead of the stronger spring steel arms that are supposed to be on the tool, these arms are made of a cheaper, non-flexible steel that bends.I figure that the arms will snap off after about six to eight more sheets of sandpaper are inserted, making the sander useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreliable","review":"Critical Review:Helicoil 5546-6 M6x1This is my first review on Amazon.com.I am a diy auto mechanic who takes pride in performing maintenance work on my BMW 325 xit, 2003 with 78k.Aluminum housing on auto transmission revealed failed pan bolt holes and redrilled all 20 to insert helicoils per manufacturer's instructions.Unfortunately, despite following instructions per exact detail and insertion of coils 1/4 to 1/2 turn the coils did not remain in place as expected.

It sounds like \\"thrash lite\\" or \\"thrash by numbers\\"...and some of it is just not thrashy. There doesn't seem to be any energy to the songs. Gary's great riffs and crunchy sound are there, but not served in a manner that I care for. Also, when Zetro tries to \\"sing\\" it gets awkward and unlistenable. I'm amazed that more people aren't ragging on this release (although not too many are praising it either, most people probably just ignore it!)There is a reason that Exodus never plays ANY of these songs in their shows.

It has a lot of general information and can help you understand the jargon, but the info is maybe 40 years old and some things have changed since then. It very broadly covers everything from panning to dredging and camping to staking a claim. As a fairly new prospector I didn't feel as though I learned anything substantial from this book, most everything I had already picked up from other people or my own research thanks mainly to the internet. I wish the book went more into where to find gold, not specifically where but what to look for and reading a river, geology, topography and so on which it only slightly touches on.

The last 8-minute perfomance peice, \\"Going Down\\" is definately reminiscent of the sounds and feelings of going down the drain, all muffled notes and gurgly ambience.FP has a lot of nerve (and humor) to throw hip-hop beats, electro, and cat-purr sounds all into one mix! Somehow, despite the diverse ingredients, he brews up an incredibly pure sound while adhering to his fun-first mantra.If you like the sampled ambience of the music of The Art Of Noise, The Future Sound of London, Laurie Anderson, or Yello, then you should DEFINATELY try Funki Porcini ....you'll like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funki Porcini - Love, Pussycats & Carwrecks","review":"Funki Porcini's second album,Love Pussycats & Carwrecks, starts off with the feline and sensuous \\"Purrfect,\\" an auspicious start if ever there was one. \\"Groover,\\" however, starts in with the off-kilter jazz, with some sweeps that sound almost like a dying vacuum cleaner. Indeed, Funki seems to move away from the smoothness of his previous album and more keen on introducing elements of noise. \\"Last Song\\" has plenty, as does \\"12 Points Off Your Licence,\\" with its modulated horn stabs and compressed squelches of sound. He seems to be exploring the idea of sound: \\"Carwreck\\" has a skittering energy, while \\"Elephantitus\\" wanders from one idea to the next. \\"Venus\\" hearkens back to the earlier album, though it does embrace some of the chaotic zeitgeist. \\"I'm Such a Small Thing\\" takes the ambient tack, and \\"Going Down\\" takes out the album in that mellow, sleepy vein.

I borrowed the stapler from a friend and on the very first shot the staple went right through my pinkie bone and warranted a trip to the E.R.

It was a complete failure. So I returned it and asked the salesperson and some shoppers for their opinions. I was talked into this forward action stapler, and I'm THRILLED with it.

I get a lot of compliments on it, but I should say it is a larger watch for a woman which may be a turn off to some. Combine that with the shiny face and band and it is noticeable. It is elegant looking but the style is simple enough that it can be worn with casual wear in my view. One thing it does is catch the light like any mirror would so sometimes it is startling (but comes in handy if you need to surreptitiously check your makeup!)Not for everyone but if you don't mind a big flashy watch, you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too bad.","review":"I bought this item as a gift and the day I gave it as a gift, it got stolen.

A comparative history of vaqueros, cowboys and buckaroos is needed. These three groups share much in common but they are nevertheless historically distinct. I was hoping to understand the uniquess of each experience by learning about the common threads that tie the three groups together.Unfortunately, the authors were not up to task. The authors are amateurs who share a great love for the subject. Unfortunately, there is large chasm between an enthusiast and a professional author. Sadly,the writing and analysis was weak. While reading the book, I wanted them to succeed but in the end, this was a book written by enthusiasts. This book only proves that gifted amateurs are a rare bird."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absulutly nessary for any reader","review":"This the most comprehensive collection of Vaquero, cowboy and buckaroo history.

Good writing, although curiously flat in parts, despite emotional potential of content. Potent combination of sex and violence may by too much for some.

The writing doesn't flow at all. The spelling errors and typos are bad enough, but the author constantly offers her own sarcastic opinions about the information she's presenting. It's not entertaining; it's embarrassing. The writing style is more suited to a series of magazine pieces than to a book. There is also a lack of insight into the subject himself. At the risk of sounding like I bought the book just for the dirt, one of the things I was most curious about was why Michael had his affair with Nurit Wilde. The topic was barely touched upon. I wanted to know what makes Michael Nesmith tick.

There is no cohesive narrative to speak of and the facts are pointless and tabloid worthy. This is the first time that I have ever actually felt sorry for an author for the choices that they have made. I was actually cringing while reading the book.

Take a class in writing before you do in the future. This author has always had unkind words about the whole \\"Monkees\\" franchise, yet calls herself a big fan! Make up your mind!

This Massingill person has a problem that Nesmith was the sucessful Monkee. Sometimes it takes standing up for what you believe in. The writing is as if a junior high schooler wrote this for a project. The typos are aweful! The pictures are poor. It's a glorified non-fanzine. I would love Mr. Nesmith to write his own book. His life is a fasinating story and would be a great read. He is genius much in the was Brian Wilson is. This book was a quick \\"cash in\\" with no new facts. Lots of improvising too.

Nearly all of the information collected in this book is available in the booklets of the CD and VHS box sets.What bothered me most, however, was the lack of professionalism on the part of the author. A paraphrased passage: \\"Mike showed up in disguise at a Monkees show in the '80s, but us die-hard fans knew it was him.\\" Additionally, the appendix article written by the author's boyfriend starts off as a discussion of Monkees web resources, but ends by talking about how the web board sparked his relationship with the author.The additional appendices are total filler: Monkees disc-and-video-graphies (again, multiple Rhino sources have published the same lists), a painful \\"interview\\" with Nesmith's hat, and a multiple-page listing of EVERY video/tv show Nesmith produced. There are HUNDREDS. At the very least, some sort of firsthand or primary source would have helped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Nez fans","review":"I am not a fan of this book. I am a Nez fan and have been for some time, and I was appalled by the way he was presented in this book. Granted, he is not perfect, none of us are, but a person who claims to be his fan writes a book like this about him?? I wouldn't write a book like this about my worst enemy. It had a few clever anecdotes, some interesting information, etc. but I do not feel it gave an accurate portrayal of Mike/Nez. I wouldn't reccomend reading it if you're a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Boring","review":"I have been a Mike Nesmith fan for 13 years (im 26 but ended up in the kids section so ignore the age field!!) and was really looking forward to finding out about his life, him as a person, and exciting Monkees related stories. This book was full of boring business stuff and gave me little emotional insight. I appreciate that some things are personal but thats the point of this sort of book. I felt like it was written by piecing together newspaper articles or something. There was a shortage of photographs too (possibly just as well considering the hideous beard. Generally it was sadly lacking. There must be more to a strong character like Mike Nesmith than this? Maybe its an English thing but this just didnt satisfy my curiosity!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is more of a research paper than a biography.","review":"Total Control reads more like a college research paper than it does a biography. Lots of facts, summarized and outlined, it would make a good reference book for Trivial Pursuit. As a biography it leaves a lot to be desired. Made up mainly of sound bites from various articles, the book feels manufactured and sterile. The author's effort to round out the biography by interviewing friends and family falls short due to the mostly negative portrayal painted of Michael Nesmith. I recommend Total Control to anyone who is interested in the history of 60's Rock Icons. I do not recommend Total Control for anyone looking for insight into the man who is Michael Nesmith. I was left wondering if the image presented by the book was truly factual, and if it is why would anyone want to be his \\"number one fan\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Writing the Wrongs","review":"I was unaware of the savage beating this book was taking on Amazon when I read it.My personal reaction was a positive one.Being a life-long Monkees fan,I thought the literary task of illuminating the enigmatic Nesmith persona would yield interesting results...and this book IS interesting.The author is a tremendous admirer of Nesmith,despite what some have come away thinking.There is plenty of new information--and until Nesmith does his own biography,who else is up for the challenge? If whatever pointed criticisms of Nesmith are what makes you dislike this book,I don't think that's a fair judgement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nature's Gate ruins a good shampoo","review":"I had settled on this shampoo as my personal favorite because of its natural ingredients, moisturizing properties, and the way it left my hair feeling. It also smelled great.Sadly, I can no longer recommend this product. Earlier this year (2006) Nature's Gate reformulated its Organics shampoos, subordinating most of their natural ingredients to chemical ingredients and adding several more chemicals. Most disturbing, the company added parabens (methylparaben and propylparaben), which many health-conscious consumers don't want in their body care products. The absence of parabens in the original product was a key reason why I chose this shampoo to begin with.I'm very disappointed that Nature's Gate has adulterated what was one of the best shampoos I ever used. The new formula doesn't even smell the same. As far as I'm concerned, Nature's Gate is more interested in profits than people's health.

At the recommendation of several reviewers I ordered this bra one size larger in a 40DD-F. I think a 42 might be better because I had intended this as a sleep bra and the bottom elastic is a bit tighter than I would like in a sleep bra. However, the real problem is that the cup size runs very small. If you place your hands over your breasts and press tightly to your chest, you will have an idea of the way this bra supports. The stretch fabric crushes my boobs to my ribs, creating huge cleavage in the middle and with a surprising amount of overflow ending up at my sides - effectively under my arms. I think this may be a contributing factor in other reviewers' complaints that the bra is uncomfortable under their arms. I cannot recommend this bra to full-busted women.

The color is gray...literally it looks like the headboard was gold and they just brushed a gray brown paint over the top...it makes the bed look very modern and almost impossible to match to anything in our home or to find anything in stores that would match - and defeats the purpose of saving money by just replacing a headboard rather than replacing an entire bedroom suite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I was worried about the sound quality on one of these portable record players but this one is great.

Now, you can really only rock out gently, not too hard, because the volume doesn't go up all that high, and the sound is a little bit thin. I expected this though, and it doesn't ruin the experience for me. It reminds me of the turntable I had as a kid that I used to play my Disney and Monkees records on. Back then I thought it sounded great, and you just have to try to go back to that attitude with this player. If only they had included an output to hook it up to other, better speakers if you choose to, but that isn't here. If it had that, it would have gotten a full five stars from me.It looks great in person, and the Stack-O-Matic feature is great, as you can stack up a bunch of 45's and let 'em drop one by one.

If one follows his career cronologically, beginning with a Stone For Danny Fischer and ending with the posthumously 'subsititute author' written Sin City, one can almost trace Robbins' improving talent/success leading to his increasingly heavy drug use and finally see the work suffer as he cranked out bools faster and faster to keep up on his income tax back-payments. The Carpetbaggers was written at the point in the man's life just after he hit his true stride as an author and just before his cocaine madness sabotaged his work.If you've never read a Harold Robbins book, do yourself a favor and read The Carpetbaggers first.

But something isn't right. At first it appears the video is washed out - in a haze. OK so there are fog machines on stage and the picture quality takes a hit. But even at it's best, the colors are blah and nothing is really in focus. Did they makes this from a VHS transfer or just use lower quality cameras?It's standard DVD format so I was not expecting blu-ray sharpness and color definition. But usually, standard definition video close-ups are sharp even when the audience and wide shots are fuzzy. The video is consistent regardless of scene. I'm guessing they shot this video with 1.33:1 aspect ratio (full screen) and then cropped it into a widescreen video. Maybe it looks OK on TV, but on a projector screen it reminds me of videos from the early 90's.In any case it's great to hear the music of Journey again.What a high energy performance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpowering guitar from Schon","review":"Pineda's voice is excellent and powerful, but Schon's guitar dominates the mix to the point that this is nearly unlistenable for me. This seems like nothing new as I saw Journey live in the 80's and walked away with the same impression and disappointment in the mix. Don't get me wrong: I love rock guitar and play guitar myself. However, there is something to be said for a balanced mix where the other band members can shine too. Journey's recordings always had great vocal harmonies and they are lost in this mix. When Schon stops playing for a moment, you can hear a glimpse of the melodies and harmonies. Then he comes back in and completely drowns everything, but hey you can hear every palm thunk, string slide, and bum note out of his guitar!

Mine showed up today...This is an ALL Region Blu-ray with 3 different Audio options and the full concert on 1 Blu-ray disc opposed to the 2-disc DVD set. Awesome picture and audio as you would expect from a blu-ray! Must have!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound mix","review":"I just viewed the concert on the HD concert channel, \\"Palladia\\". I have read all of the reviews of the poor video quality but it was crisp and clear on Palladia.My complaint is it sounds like Neil Schon did the final audio mix and mastering. I tried listening in 5.1, stereo and other settings with the same results. Schon's guitar dominates the mix way way way too much especially on the right channel. The drums are lost and muddy and the keys are almost nonexistant. \\"Seperate Ways\\" is a keyboard driven song and I couldn't even hear them over the guitar.The new singer sings great but even his vocals are overshadowed by the guitar and like another review said the backup vocals were weak.I was wondering if others noticed this on their DVD copies of the concert before I make the decision to buy or pass???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound mix a disappointment","review":"I'm a big Journey fan and was looking forward to the Blu Ray version of this concert. I have a 7.1 home theater in a large room, system calibrated with Audyssey Pro. Unfortunately, all audio options suffer from the same problem. The center channel vocals take a back seat to the left and right main speakers in this mix. New lead singer's vocals are rather muted and overpowered by the rest of the channels.Perhaps I expected more, but when compared to say the Eagles and the David Gilmour discs, the poor mix really shows. I put on various other concerts in to ensure my system was not causing the problem. In fact, the above mentioned concerts sounded as great as always.For the price, this disk is a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking - Terrible sounding","review":"Being a ex- Bay Area fan of SO many years I came across this video on Pallaidia and it looked good. BUT (and it's a HUGE BUT!) it sounds like a never-ending Neil Schon solo - nearly straight through the entire three hours. While the new lead singer has very \\"Perry-esque\\" vocals, it's not the Journey I remember. Too bad too, because they were one of Bill Graham's greatest bands. Hope Bill wasn't watching from on high! Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good tunes, video, bad audio","review":"The audio on this DVD sounds extremely compressed.

And re price - why does Amazon have it advertised at a bloated $45.99?To the DVD itself - the much hyped Oakley Red Camera is nothing but window dressing - PQ was average, no sharp colours at all, a tad above standard DVD quality. But the biggest disappointment was the AQ, Arnel Pineda sounded muted, and the lead guitarist sounded strident - to a point where the ear's began to pain. The drummer who seemed to put so much effort, poor fellow, little did he realise that he would turn up on BR with his contributions relegated into the background.Give this one a MISS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Sound","review":"I love watching concert Blurays and was excited about this Journey Concert, When I played it, all the different sound set-ups sounded the same, and was very disappointing.

The only guitar stand I'll use. Mega-stable, and very durable. The only nit I'd pick is the same one with most stands-- if you have a nitro finish, you need to cover the rubber padding. They are still good stands, but, I must say, a few years ago they were still USA made, and I always prefer that whenever possible. I wish they had just raised the price on them by $10 instead of exporting the labor. A lot of us would be willing to pay that to keep American jobs in America. Even so, it's still a good product.Amazon came through with fast shipping, as usual. Had them for the gig in less than a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Stand!!","review":"I have been using this stand for about 10 years. Gig after gig and in the studio. No parts to loose and extremely sturdy. Beside the simple fact that it hangs your guitar/bass and fits almost any one of them with the exeption of headless instuments. The black rubber tubing does ware away however after a few years. So I wrapped it in one sided hocky tape and for 7 years it hasnt fliched! ;)Highly recommended!!!-jway"},{"rating":"1","title":"This WAS the best","review":"Sadly, I have to revise my previous review, and I *am* going to use something else. I've recently been having problems with the lower screw (that holds the legs in place) slipping. This is not good when you hang your nice guitar up, and come back five minutes later and realize that the legs are flopping all over the place. I don't know what the problem is mechanically, but I've tried screwing the screw in as tightly as I possibly can, and it's still iffy. The stand is about 10-15 years old. Sadly, I think it's going to be relegated to my basement, as I no longer consider it reliable enough to bring on gigs. I've just ordered one of these (based on Amazon reviews) and will be trying it out over the winter:Ultimate GS100 Support Genesis 100 Guitar Stand(previous review follows)This is the best guitar stand I've ever used.It's sturdy.It folds up very small.It's very stable.It's only one piece.I'll never use anything else again."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken books","review":"Honestly, this book is good if you need spells, want new spells, or just want to have a massive field of spells. More honestly, however, is the uber broken fashion of this book. About 25% of the spells are not thoroughly explaned, or at least not to level of specificity my gaming circle would appreciate. On a personal level, I fell there are much more than are necessary, taking from actual roleplaying, and pumping all the focus on the magic aspect. And most of all, many are too powerful for the level they describe when comparing their stats to the PHb spell list. In my opinion, most of these spells would be more appropriate for plot weapons, intelligent weapons, artifacts, or as godly favors/empowerments. Toward that end, I see great potential for this book, but on the whole, is is overpowered and lopsided for the role playing game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spell Compendium 3.5","review":"A good dose of spells in here.

Nope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful and pretty","review":"I'm of the same opinion as Mr Beavers on this book. The book is good idea, and the updates are worth having. The renaming of spells to some extent is nice because you may not be using Bigby and others in your own homebrewed world, but it's not really necessary. I like the fact that I now dont have to go through 20 different books to find a few cool spells. I also like that the PHB spells aren't included in this one. That would have been overkill and unnecessary. I could care less about the descriptive text.

DM's you will love having all these spells consolidated into one book! If you play a spellcaster, and your campaign allows more than just the 3 core rule books, then this should be with carried with you. There are no prestige classes, no items, nothing that some players will use while others disregard. This is neither good nor bad, but in this case, it is perfect.

No matter what your spell-casting class, every player will find something useful in here.The only downside to this book is the amount of erratta that is needed to correct various printing errors. Some spells have their discription mismatched with the spell effect, while others are missing vital information from their stat blocks. One spell is even missing altogether!

But the Spell Compendium is a complilation from many works, good and bad, that is actually useful to game play. The pure volume of spells is amazing. Yes, you will find real head scratchers mixed in with outstanding and balanced spells, but the impact this text will have on your game is immediate. You'll never need the Dungeon Masters Guide Two or the Players handbook two either, but you will want to carry the Spell Compedium with you to every game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for DMs and players alike","review":"While WoTC churns out more and more fluff based books (Complete Champion?), this book is all crunchy goodness.

About the only bad thing I can say about it is that it doesn't list what source each spell originally came from. This might not be a problem for you, but some DM's disallow all materials from some books, so finding out disallowed spells takes research.That being said, that's not much of a bad thing to say about it. It truly is a great supplement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Milwaukee Let Down","review":"I have owned many, many Milwaukee tools...But this one was a real disappointment.

Herge's depiction of Africans is dated (1930s) and may be offensive to some.

As an, er, 'unfortunate' adventure from the point of view of modern Tintin fans, it is yet, like the first Tintin book, a candid (and illuminating) insight into the popular mentality around the young author. Only slightly later, with the Blue Lotus, did Herge get Tintin's politics (somewhat) in line with modern sensibilities. Either way, all later works eclipse this.

Lightfoot is a folk singer with an ear for harmony--not nearly outside enough to be jazzy, but enough to give your ear a field day; and his melodies (check out Circle of Steel) are unbelievable.

When we can put it together and get the train on there, it runs off the track. I am SO disappointed because the other reviews are great and this JUST is not working for me. I have put it together 3 different times and it does not matter the little car won't stay on the track.

Once we got it assembled, they had fun watching the trucks go around a few times, but then they wanted to rearrange the tracks. Unfortunately nothing works unless the track is in the predesigned order. It is now a year later, and they have never touched the toy again. :( It did seem well made and did do what it was supposed to, but just not worth it in my opinion since it is so limited in how you can play with it. You can't even interact with it. You just sit there and watch it do what it's supposed to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tommy Loader is Fun","review":"Our son had a Tommy Loader when he was 5 (he's now 37) and played with it for hours on end.

I have heard this was a good brand, and the video looked great. The thing the video doesn't tell you is that, putting it together is beyond frustrating as the pieces do not snap together well and as you are putting the next piece together, the previous falls apart. The track and trucks are VERY poorly made, very cheap plastic that if you aren't super careful will break easy. The track falls apart at the tiniest nudge. The vehicles at least once ever 3-4 times around fall off the track. My daughter is careful, but still it falls apart so easily. I don't see the toy lasting long. She giggled at it and enjoyed it to start, but keeps getting frustrated at it falling apart and falling off the track. Would not recommend. Really cute idea and concept, but they need to follow through on quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tomy Big Loader","review":"I was looking for Thomas Big Loader and found out it they didn't make them anymore.

Not even the job boxes made of steel are $300. This is plastic. They are very strong and great for what I need, but no way will I pay 2x more. I was getting ready to order 8 of these to organize my life better, but when I did go back to order them they want more then $100. I bought my first one from Home Depot and I love it. I paid $68 for it and it is still $68. Amazon had it for $68 when I first saw it here, but what happened? No way will I pay more for this than the retail price of $68.

The two latches don't always close because the tap that goes through the latches keeps getting bent and has to be straightened out, which isn't hard to do but is a pain in the neck when i'm in a hurry.My biggest headache is the uneven bottom of the chest.

It does not do a good job at explaining the different technology, hardware, software, and other components that make up an IS/IT infrastructure. The book is targeted at end-user or managers but does not clearly explain issues relevant to people in management positions, which is how to measure the cost and benefit involved. Moreover, it is very difficult to read because of repetitions. For example, the phrase \\"Internet, intranet, and extranet\\" is repeated hundreds or even thousands of times for no apparent reasons. Finally, the cases in the appendix are vague and unclear. One example is the Sonoco case, in which the order fulfillment technology is explained up to the point of production, but there is no mention of how the IS/IT system helps the company to schedule deliveries and track shipments to its customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst slicer EVER!","review":"This slicer is essentially \\"tinsel trash\\".

I love my other Milwaukee tools (cordless and corded drills and Sawzall) but this tool is junk. It vibrates so badly that it skips across the surface of the wood. The clamp levers are so weak that one of them bent the first time I used it. And the pad is so flimsy that it was damaged in two places after a half hour of use. The P-C never suffered any such problems.I've been working wood for over 40 years and have never used such a bummer of a power tool.

It was affordable & sounded just as good (if not better) than a Bose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing sound and quality","review":"When first lifting this out of the box, I could tell this was no ordinary clock radio. It has such a solid, substantial weight to it - you perceive a higher quality. Once you plug it in and listen to the full, rich sound - your perceptions are confirmed. This is the most amazing sounding small radio I have ever listened to. The price is a lot, considering my old clock radio was about 20 bucks, but for an audio nerd, it is well worth it. I wanted a nice CD player to fall asleep to with all the conveniences of a clock radio and this fits perfectly. The handy remote and luxury features like a dimming display and dual alarms are added bonuses. It is a simple, clean design and the sound is remarkable - I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's going back","review":"I had high hopes for the 88CD based on reviews I had read. When we got it we discovered that (1) it's huge (and heavy), and (2) the FM reception is really inferior.

Even being marooned on a planet with defeated exploratory teams barely ruffles her hair or mars her manicure. It's a good thing the early settlers of Pern did not have Nimisha's ship-design skills, as they would have developed a high technological civilization in approximately 25 minutes, and we would have been denied some of McCaffrey's best books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Slow Deterioration of a Great Reputation..","review":"Oh, Mrs. McCaffrey, stop it! You are beginning to really hurt your true fans. The latest offerings, most especially Nimisha's Ship, have got me wondering just what it is that makes me love your books so much. I will buy anything you publish, as in the past that has been rewarded, but now I'm getting leary. The possibilities for this book were bountiful, truly up to standard for a great writer, but the execution left much up to the imagination. This is not why Anne became a goddess to me. If you are new to the books, start with Pern and skip this one entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat story idea, lousy book","review":"This book follows the trend of Nerilka's Story (a more recent Pern book) in that it is more of a writer's notebook than a completed novel. As usual, McCaffrey has designed a unique set of planetary and social systems and peopled them with potentially intriguing characters. Unlike her earlier works, this book reads like a rough draft. The pacing and time transitions are particularily rough in the first half, and several prominent characters become mere shadows by the second half (without resolution of their story lines). If you're a McCaffrey fan, read it for the ideas (and fill in the blanks yourself). If you haven't read McCaffrey before, don't start here; head for the Pern books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Cares About Nimisha?","review":"I love Anne McCaffrey. I've been reading her books for nearly fifteen years now; the Pern books were the first science fiction books I ever read.All I can say is, \\"What happened, Anne?\\" Nimisha is *boring.* There isn't a moment where I'm concerned about the characters. Her \\"enemy\\" is practically nonexistent. Even romances should come with *some* dramatic tension - if you want a *good* romance novel, try Diana Gabaldon's \\"Outlander\\" books. Leave Nimisha cast away with her twins and triplets."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Swear this was written and performed for children","review":"I needed a few audiobooks to take on a long drive and took a chance on this one. Big mistake. It is written and read at the level of a 10 year old, and was an insult to my intelligence. The only reason I even listened to the whole thing was because my radio's attenna was broken! Don't bother with this unless your kids are into sci-fi!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"When I saw the new McAfferey book I had to have it, what a total waste of money. Absolutely nothing happened, no suspense, no romance, no sinister plots, no friendly mythical creatures, NOTHING! Please do not waste your money on this dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read, typical McCaffrey style.","review":"I have enjoyed reading Anne McCaffrey books for years. Nimisha's Ship is a pleasurable read, not too heavy. This book is written in her typical style, if you have read Freedom's Landing you already know the general plot of this book. Even though McCaffrey uses a familiar plot, I recommend this book to anyone who likes her writing. Once again she has created a heroine who has broken the mold created by society and succeeded amidst adversity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lisa Faires from Canada.","review":"I actually got this book as an advance copy....I feel it is one of the most wonderful books Anne McCaffrey has written yet!! I'am a long time Dragon Rider fan and was amazed how diversified Ms.McCaffery's writing is! This book draws you in and takes you on a thrilling ride through Space to places unknown. A Fantastic read!! I recommend this to anyone who loves Anne McCafferys work!!! I LOVED IT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How Disappointing","review":"I love Anne McCaffrey's work and was glad to see a new direction. Until I started reading it. What I found was a family structure that seemed cobbled together from Mario Puzo's Godfather and Frank Herbert's Bene Gesserit. When I started finding elements of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and then Voyager, I had to put the book down. It's too much of bits and pieces strung together to try to resemble something original. It fails, badly.This is one manuscript that should have been relegated to the recycling bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"The plot is written for a 12 year old. None of the usual intrigue found in her works. No creative environments."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast pased love story","review":"A refreshing read as the novel combineds relationships, tech-advances, and aliens. The social structure of the First Families is not such a far-off concept that it would be unacceptable. McCaffrey stays true to the usage of heroines (at least in the novels I have read). Yet this story, though the tech is impressive as is the \\"fictional sicience\\", is dominated by the relationships between the characters. McCaffrey has to be one of those few writers that can create very real and memorable characters. The only missing thing from the story was the lack of development in the Sh'im. Their relations with each other and the humans would have added to the depth of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"NIMISHA'S SHIP SINKS","review":"I LOVE MacCaffrey, but this tale, had no suspense and darn little romance. The heroine faces absolutely no adversity that might build her character except her mother's frown. When she does manage to get lost in space, she finds a new planet, other shipwrecked people to keep her company, a Swiss Family Robinson type crashed freighter that supplies everything needed for comfort, aliens that are both friendly and cute, and her own true love. And even the course of true love runs so smooth that nothing really happens. YaaaaawwwwwnnnnnnnProves good conflict makes a good book and this one didn't have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"I think Anne made a bet with someone to see if her name would be sufficient to get \\"dreck\\" published. That's what this book is--\\"dreck\\". Let me tell you how I really feel, this book is awful. If you are an Anne McCaffrey fan, don't buy this book as you won't stay a fan after the experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing read!","review":"I am a big McCaffrey fan. I bought Nimisha's Ship thinking it would be a good, unthreatening read like Restoree. However, I was sorely disppointed. I did not feel anything towards her characters - they all appeared to be fairly undeveloped. What was amazing was the amount of sci-fi jargon I recognized from all the Star Trek series!For someone who enjoyed the Tower and the Hive series, Nimisha's ship was a disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, the title fits..","review":"First..I am a McCaffrey fan...but this book doesn't really live up to some of her previous novels...high on special effects, and neglects plot and dialogue...I mean, we have a couple of really great nasty villains...who basically stay in the background and make threatening noises, and a wondrous ship, which is more like a deus ex machina than anything else. I know that technology is by definition unbelievably advanced in the future, but the stuff she has the Ship doing really strains credibility unless the AI is developing sentience...c'mon, Anne, you can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfunny satire, or just plain boring?","review":"I have rarely been more disappointed by a book. I've read plenty of McCaffrey's previous books, and enjoyed most of them, but this one really misses the boat. Stereotyped characters so flat that \\"one-dimensional\\" does them a favour, the development of the relationship between the Sh'im and the humans was a joke, and the re-introduction of sci-fi elements that I thought had died out with E.E. Smith and his lensmen (in itself a far superior narrative to this tripe). I mean, really, who writes about catering machines that produce meals out of nowhere at a second's notice anymore?I'm just glad that I didn't spend my own money on this book. It belongs on the coffee table of Hell's waiting room along with Raymond Feist's Krondor : The Betrayal.C'mon, Anne, you know you can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hopeless dog","review":"Follows a too much of a formula; problems are solved far to easily; the baddies are stupid and lazy and fade from the scene early; there is not even a climax. There is a huge amount of potential in this story, but it bubbles into the ooze with nary a whimper. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid","review":"\\"One\\" of the characters in this work is described as vapid. Rather, the entire work is insipid. This is 1950's sci-fi tarted up with a few female characters"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nimisha's Ship","review":"Having read almost all her works, with varying degrees of enjoyment, I find this is a very standard book. This is certainly not one that I will read again - too predictable, without the surprises, twists and gentleness that are so appealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"very pleasant","review":"I found this book to be a very light enjoyable read. Perhaps it is not the best of McCaffrey's work, but it is fun. The first time I read it, I was a little disapointed, but its turned out to be one of those rare books that I can enjoy reading, but be able to put down when I need to. Which makes it perfect for between classes, or during my lunch break.If you looking for some great epic adventure, NIMISHA'S SHIP isn't it. But if you are between reads and looking for something fun, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upon recieving, destroyed","review":"I ordered these a week into December as a gift.

Michael Caine and Candice Bergen are great, too. A Cinderella Story is so cool and it stars the beautiful and talented Hilary Duff as sweet Sam, a young girl who lives with her wicked stepmother and has to work at a diner. In the end, however, she stands up for herself and even gets the cute guy in the end. She also gets to go to college. Both movies are funny and entertaining, and well acted and well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doll or art, threapy or craft.","review":"This book had great meaning for me. I started making dolls as a child and was always happier making and creating them than playing with them. Often at flea markets I rescue folk dolls because they seem to speak to me as an object of the creativity of another and a link to that person or that time. I have hidden the part of myself that needs to create and appreciate the creation of others. Now as Elinor says, I have permission to play. If you also need permission then you need to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"doll making books","review":"I did not find this book to be inspirational in any way.

Always a need for a handy stapler when hanging targets to flyers and this one easily survived the daily hardships that a heavier stapler might not have. Was very pleased with its performance and now it rests in my range bag to be used everytime I visit a range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"I bought this staple gun from Home Depot for stapling targets out on the range. On the first outing I noticed that if I did not have the entire front of the gun resting on a surface the drawer would shoot out and spill staples everywhere. Ok, no big deal, I'll just have to remember to keep the thing flush right? No. About 20 staples later the drawer pops out no matter how I hold the gun, every time! I like the size, and ease of use, but durability is a big thumbs down. Every staple, the drawer pops out and drops all the staples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Found weakest point","review":"I like the reverse hold over traditional staplers, easy one the hand. But with this one being all plastic the piece that holds the staple draw closed developed a crack along one side where the plastic pivots when you pinch it to release the draw. Now it pops open from the vibration of firing off a staple, the draw opens, and all the staples fall out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing purchase","review":"Yes, it works well within its (limited) parameters. But, what is the point of making recordings that you can't copy? This limitation was not mentioned by the salesman at Circuit City. When I went back and complained about this, they sold me $100 of software to allow downloads to my computer, for editing and copying, which did not work. The best I can do is copy discs to VCR tape. Also I have suffered the \\"black screen of death\\" others have mentioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alright Camera","review":"This camera is a cool way to have your videos on a DVD but does not offer any (GOOD) way of editing the discs. The picture quality is fair and the sound provides a good general result. Not the greatest \\"true to life\\" quality that you would expect for a camera at this price.

Lack of Usb and firewire ports."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"The Sony DCR-DVD92, which I have since returned, was very disappointing. Its picture quality was substandard--colors appeared dull and faded, and overall sharpness and clarity were poor. In fact, my old Sony 8mm camcorder, purchased in 1991, delivered better results. And most comparably priced Canon camcorders produce videos with twice the number of effective pixels as the Sony DCR-DVD92.Furthermore, videos taken on the DCR-DVD92 had missing frames, creating jerky and unstable playback images.I did not experiment with the camcorder's numerous editing features--the picture quality was such a deal-breaker that I returned it before testing its full range of features.On the plus side, the camcorder is easy to shoot with in \\"Easy Mode,\\" and the mini-DVD format allows for quick playback videos on your DVD player.

This message lasts for about 15 seconds and blocks the entire lcd screen and view finder. If I'm trying to make a quick shot I can forget it. This message is something that Sony should have left off. I feel it's simply an attempt to make you buy Sony dvd's. I have found viewing still pictures also to be a problem.I haven't found a way yet to view them on anything but the DCR-DVD92. Unless I use the the handycam when I select still pictures to view from the menu it rapidly goes through them not allowing me to make a selection.

I had contacted Sony, but their \\"warranty policy\\" is to either repair the unit or provide a repaired model to the customer. BAD IDEA"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my needs","review":"The camcorder is very lightweight and small, easy to use, and replaces the need of having a digital camera and a video camera. The best thing is that it saves directly onto the DVD disk so that you can see it immediately without tape transfers or computers. It also saves the photos and movie all on one disk, which I like so that everything is together. It doesn't work that well in low light and the digital photos are not of the high quality of a good digital camera, but if you mainly use digital photos to email to family, as I do, then it's a very good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating","review":"though boring in the beginning.

There was far too much superfluous detail, and I felt a more skilled writer would have communicated the content of this book in a much more efficient and moving manner.

This hemisphere is essential for healing, creativity, problem-solving and enjoying meaningful relationships. Dr Stone's book provides a series of exercises (action plans)on \\"Calling for answers\\" with your right brain and covers prosperity, health, justice, creativity, protection, intuition and more. I find his approach to self-help original and refreshing, and the book is really a pleasure to read. Also, the exercises are fairly easy to perform and memorize. There is even a reproduction of the mysterious \\"Solomon's Seal\\" that one would expect only to find in books on magick. Dr Stone has been a Silva Method lecturer for more than 2 decades and introduced the program to a number of countries. I like his writing style and his acumen for putting across metaphysical concepts in a manner that is easy to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quintessential self-help","review":"Very absorbing and seemingly useful self-help book with many exercises.

However, given a second listen, it becomes quite clear that the complexity and maturity level, as well as the intentional new direction in sound of this album can be dismissed as either to commercial sounding or simply not sounding like their past albums. These criticisms are irrelevant because Doyle and his fellow bandmates wanted to attack their sound from a different angle. It worked. Some of the songs might seem rushed, but its how TAD deliberately constructed and crafted the songs. The riffs are heavy as always and the transitions are tight and well executed. I strongly recommend this rocking album to any hard rock or grunge listener!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What's This Grunge Music I've heard About?","review":"I have to agree with the others. Crunching riffs, double bass at times and melodic. There is a mixture of melody with some pretty heavy hitters on this. I think the album is heavier than lighter. There are a couple of songs and some parts of songs where Mr. Tad sings softly. You get chunky, heavy riffs with melodic, Punkish melody. I also agree, the music is done very well. Nice off beat rhythms, with decent drumming. Fairly heavy twangy bass. The songs are pretty catchy. Their music is just edgey enough to be more of a Grunge/Metal/Punk. I don't pick up on a fuzz sound or muddiness, nor any retro style licks. Not sure what the issue is with this album, I don't understand. Very nice Grunge album.As of 12/31/2012, Tad Doyle has another band, \\"Brothers of the Sonic Cloth\\". They are recoring an album as of this time.

Starlight is on Catapult Records out of Boston, by the way. \\"World\\" is a cranking, reeling pop rocker with some truly classic lyrics like \\"I saw your sister/She said your family hates me/and she said that's why you like me/and she said she thinks you're crazy/Said I'm just a loser/Said I'm just using you/SAid you'e going to try and save me/because you're the patron saint of losers.\\" Obviously, I like this band a lot.

Such a wonderful introduction to the Hebrew letters and many fundamental Hebrew words. People who don't know any Hebrew at all can read this book and get a lot out of it. But it also contains much of interest to people who already know the Alef-Bet. I go back to this book time after time -- and smile!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Starting Point","review":"This is the second book I've read on this topic and I found it to be a comprehensive book any first timer who is interested in learning about starting a business in California. All general aspects of starting and to some extend even running a business in California are covered. Not all Chapters might be useful, but it is a complete reference guide it offers information as to where you can find more information. This is also a perfect book for those who are interested in doing business online in CA. This is a good entry level starting point for information about starting a business in California."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tutorial and reference","review":"Everything you need to know about starting a small business in California is in here. What legal structure to choose, which agencies you need to deal with, what forms you need and where to get them, web addresses, phone numbers, and all the details.It also has a wealth of information on running a business, including information on accounting, taxation, and employees. It's well organized and easy to read.The only gaps are in some of the details on forming LLCs and corporations. The reader is referred to other Nolo books for the gritty details. If you're forming a partnership or sole proprietorship -- probably the most common types for \\"cottage industry\\" -- the book is reasonably complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst, most pointless work in the history of the world","review":"The total lack of interest generated by this book is inexcusable for such a \\"celebrated\\" author.

Violet never checked or even read the file that was sent to her by my editor- instead sending it straight to her publishers to print. I hate the version that was included in this collection- so when Violet implored me to write a review of this book here at Amazon in hopes that it would help her get an IPPY, I declined.I hate this book.

It still remains challenging and is a good solid workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the best!","review":"This video came out in 1994, I didn't buy it till 2007. I think it's the BEST step video, and probably the best of all aerobic workouts, that I own. It really stands the test of time, as you can tell from people leaving postive reviews for this video for several years now. I'm high-intermediate to advanced but when it comes to step, I don't like to learn complex choreogrpahy because that just wastes precious workout time. This one was easy to learn, it's fun and enjoyable, yet still challanges me, because Kari demonstrates different advanced options during every combo. Just choose all the advanced moves if you need more challange. Choose all the easier moves if you are still learning or need to take it easy. Kari is my favorite instructor, definitely my favorite step instructor. She's so much fun! I wish this would come out on DVD! Kari's Go! is perfect for learning basic moves, then follow it up with this one and prepare to have FUN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"difficult reading","review":"For somebody whose mother tongue is not English this book makes very difficult reading.

You rarely get the bigger picture of what was going on at the time. I am also highly suspicious of the 'philosophical' conversations he had with his Communist captors.

Anyone who knows about The Who and the time and place knows that the MODs were not, strictly speaking, punks, while the Rockers were. There was an ongoing rivalry between the two groups that eventually included the spin out groups who created Punk, such as Johnny Rotten.

She is very happy with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Stuff Worth Owning","review":"This disk showcases the Who as England's new pop stars. There is the mix of covers, including James Brown's \\"Please Please Please\\", which showcases a juvenile Daltry trying his best James imitation, as well as some classic Who. Singles include \\"Legal Matter\\", which is a brilliant showcase of Nicky Hopkin's piano against Pete's vocals and a catchy guitar lick, the masterpiece \\"My Generation\\", and the lovely Mod anthem \\"The Kids are Alright\\". \\"The Ox\\" is another John tune, an instrumental which also highlight's Nicky's keys. \\"The Good's Gone\\" and \\"It's Not True\\" are very much period pieces that have the feel and orchestration of the typical mid 60s English pop tune.

This is what I feel about FIREWORKS, a rambling, incohesive, dull character study. While the idea of letting us get to know characters well is commendable, why write a book about an alien spaceship that crashes into a lake and not explore it any further? Little comes of the spaceship, except the usual government coverup. Most of the characters are stereotyped to the max, and those few you care about bite the dust. And then, the spaceship just goes away, no explanations, and we're given this coy cutesy ending.

Hopeless for horses.","review":"I bought the seventh edition of this book whilst a veterinary student, and it has gathered dust. Although there is a great deal of information in this book, which is easily accessed (an advantage over Smith's Large Animal Internal Medicine), it is too brief for serious research and too opinionated for a quick reference. This reviewer also finds the style difficult to read. If the diagnosis is unknown, this is an almost impossible book to refer to and the avoidance of differential lists contributes to this.For the equine veterinarian, I would recommend Reed and Bayly's 'Equine internal medicine', which is more thorough and better written. For the food animal veterinarian, this book is a possible choice, but it is my opinion that 'Smith', despite its flaws, is a better buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of little use to the academic or practioner.","review":"If you know the diagnosis then good descriptions of the clinical signs and pathogenesis are usually available.

By the way, link to this software, listed in the book is wrong. There should be a big warning on the cover that software is available only for Linus and MacOS, to avoid situations like mine.

Most of the mountain men hated all Indians.\\" (page 14) \\"The contempt, on both sides, had its beginning in the earliest association of redmen and white.... Each thought the other fantastically stupid, and his low opinion of the other's mind and values gave zest to slaughter and scalping.\\" (page 25) It might also be noted that Fisher, who was an atheist, has his characters speak frequently of \\"the Almighty,\\" but it would be a mistake to construe from this that Fisher was religious."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money.","review":"I can't believe I finished it.

I usually fix two packages at a time, so use my four-cup Pyrex, available on Amazon (geesh, that sounded like a commercial).The result is... well, much more than worth that two minutes.Flavor is a matter of taste; but, for me, this pistachio is one of their better flavors.

Watching Matthau and Lemmon struggle so hard to make this clanker enjoyable was nothing less than depressing. Part of the enjoyment of the first Odd Couple was the clash of personalities between Felix's anal retentive, obsessive/compulsion and Oscar's boorish impatience. This film hardly touches upon that struggle and, instead, becomes a watered-down version of one of the Grumpy Old Men movies. In fact, this movie seems like a compilation of other Neil Simon movies. When Felix and Oscar get lost in the Californian desert, it's \\"The Out of Towners\\", except in reverse. When Oscar's son gets cold feet on his wedding day and camps out on the roof, it's like \\"Plaza Suite.\\"Also the use of the F-word and of middle fingers just makes the movie seem all that much more desperate for laughs.

While trying to get to their kids' wedding, they get arrested three times, attempt to hit on two younger women, and take a ride from an old man who dies a short way into the trip!I have read all the complaints of juvenile humor and inappropriate dialogue, but in my opinion, this is still a funny movie, and a beautiful tale of friendship between two clashing personalities.

I don't really ever watch those, except for the dissection of how they actually made the movie. At any rate, the story is top-notch, as well as the production value. It definitely has some out-dated SFX, but again that adds to the appeal as it is a childhood memory film. Other than the sometimes noticeably old effects, the movie itself is amazing.

The creature effects were pretty decent. And I'm still a fan of Weller. It's also nice to see Dan Obannon's name on a screenplay again.I'm only disappointed I didn't notice the DVD was a 4x3 aspect ratio before I bought it. So I guess down the road I'll end up buying it a second time in widescreen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sci-fi thriller that could have been better","review":"Screamers is an interesting sci-fi thriller, and it does have a lot going for it for a while. There are some tense moments interspersed throughout the film, and it's a decent film for the first hour-and-a half. During that time span there's enough action, suspense, and relatively adequate acting and screenwriting to satiate undemanding fans of sci-fi and horror. Unfortunately, it all goes to hell in the finale. The last 20 minutes are so awful, filled with one unsurprising plot twist too many and featuring a badly directed and staged kung-fu catfight between two screamers that looks so campy you would swear you were watching a film that wasn't trying in the least bit to take itself seriously. The final scenes are also a misfire; it hints at the idea of a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun with killer robots","review":"Yes it's an older movie. Yes the plot isn't that well fleshed out.

I could use it in doll houses and on picture frames, but when I tried to use it...it worked for 4 nails..and then I had to take out the nails and replace them to get it to work..and then only 4 more nails worked. I couldn't get it to work after that at all. The staples never go all the way in, even though I put my whole 200lb weight over the top.

Total rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Staple/Nail Gun on the Market","review":"After using this staple/nail gun until the staples ran out, I attempted to reload with more staples. I could not open the chamber in a normal manner. I had discarded the instruction manual on the first day and I had no idea how to reload. There were no instructions, arrows, words, or even clues printed on this gun like the Arrow Staple guns I had purchased in the past. After several attempts to open it, I went to the manufacture's website and downloaded the user manual (16 pages). I followed their instructions very close and again tried several times to open the chamber. Still no luck. After 10 minutes trying to reload it, the staple gun broke.Potential customers BE AWARE, this gun has the worse design for loading staples.

In my case, it was very dangerous and resulted in a trip to the emergency room.For years I have braced the back of the staple gun with my palm when using the tool on the edge of a piece of wood (because traditional staple guns have you compressing on the back of the tool). I was quite surprised when when on my second round with this tool, I instinctively used it like a traditional staple gun and shot a staple through my hand.I believe there are benefits to this tool; however, like all tools, it can be very dangerous when used improperly and I hope my accident can help prevent others from a similar fate."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just wasted 24$","review":"I bought this 'cause I thought it was a good design and needed a staple gun.

It seemed like a Christmasy thing so I bought it. There are six big pieces inside. One of them was broken in half, but I didn't mind. The candy looks pretty and it tastes so-so. It's not one of my favorite kinds of candy, but I bought it to celebrate Christmas. I think I haven't had ribbon candy in many years. I don't remember seeing it around until today at CVS. I think they should use better tasting flavors in this candy. They're really not very good flavors. A couple of pieces were licorice, which I don't like, and one piece was spearmint, which I really hate. I hate anything that is spearmint flavored. There are many much better flavors that they could have used. They really should improve their product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken broken broken","review":"All except one piece were broken.

Inside the box there were 6 pieces - orange, yellow, 2 greens (one with white on the edges), red (with a white stripe on the edges) and white with green on the edges.

I had been using other caulk tube sealers, most of them that go inside the spout. That style usually causes the spout to split and you loose the seal.

I had a hard time seeing the road and the berms, especially after the plows have scraped off all the lines. These lights really light up the near road and cast a wide beam. Installation was actually fairly easy and everything is included. I mounted mine on the top of my bumper (the bottom would have been my first choice, but there was not enough 'lip' for drilling). These lights work as advertised and are great for my old eyes. Oh, I just hooked them up to a simple switch... working independently of either the high or low beams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Service nice product","review":"Very good company to work with.

It has more sex than I need in a novel, but it also has GREAT prose. I read the novel last summer and phrases still linger, ready to amuse. My favorite: when querried by her miffed husband as to why she had kept the murder a secret, the heroine replies that \\"after all, he was only a parent.\\" That jewel alone is worth the read, and there are many, many more. At times, I had to put the book down, just to savor the joy of the words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody plays unaccompanied Bach like Henryk Szeryng","review":"Henryk Szeryng was one of the greatest violinists of the 20th century, fully equal -- or superior -- both technically and artistically to other more famous violinists. His performances of the Bach Sonatas and Partitas were particularly outstanding. Many years ago a leading magazine wrote that \\"nobody plays unaccompanied Bach like Henryk Szeryng.\\" They were right; in this music he is without peer. Please note that a later -- and equally great -- recording of these works performed by Szeryng for DG is also available (at lower cost) from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Second Glance","review":"Ghosts was both creepy and fascinating. In spite of it's length, the author never became wordy or prosey and the book was almost impossible to put down. It is \\"A real page turner.\\" Hynde expleres all levels of fear and and enlightenment without going over the top. The odd assortment of characters are all engaging in their own way and they are quite believable as well. As the pieces of the story, set in Nantuckett, are skillfully brought together, I found myself strangely compelled to \\"suspend all disbelief\\" for far more than the time I spent with the book and giving my fellow citizens a second glance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"This book did not do it for me. It was not really a ghost story and so forgettable that two days after I read it, I couldn't remember anything about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and predictabler","review":"I thought I'd enjoy this book but as the title says it was completely predictable on every level. Any thrills or shocks are spelled out well before they occur. I really struggled through this book and only kept reading after looking again at these reviews some of which said there was a twist at the end. Even this was predictable and I saw it coming about half way through.On top of this is the woodenness of the characters, not to mention their apparent stupidity. They go through a huge amount of ghostly situations and still never seem to know what's going on - They continuously accept that ghostly goings on are happening and then several sentences later they behave as if they have no idea.Save yourself some time: read the first few chapters, skip to the middle, and then skip to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary, No. Dull, yes!","review":"I picked this up since one review said it was as scary as \\"The Shining\\". Not even close! The reviews that talk about how poorly written this is, are correct. It was very amateurish with the same phrasing used over and over again not to mention predictatable. Additionally, I live on Cape Cod, just a boat ride away from Nantucket and no-one calls it \\"Nantucket Island\\" NEVER! Did Mr. Hynd ever actually visit the spot where his book takes place? Ugh, I couldn't get passed that and a whole lot more. With so many well written books on the market, don't waste your time with this poorly written one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointing","review":"I was looking forward to reading a really good ghost story. There are so few around. But I also enjoy murder/mystery and that is what I got out of this book. It started out as a ghost story and soon turned into a who-dun-it. Very predictable and drawn out."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better endings I've read in a long time!","review":"It's really too bad this book is out of print as it is definately a good ghost story. I must disagree with many of the other reviewers however, while creepy and well written I would not clasify it as \\"terrifying\\" and it certainly did not keep me up at night. The story development is excellent, the characters quite believable, and the \\"ghosts\\"do all the right things. I especially loved the ending, it was totally unexpected and was actually my favorite part of the story. If you can find it, Ghosts is definately worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting to say the least!!","review":"I'm currently working on my own \\"horror\\" novel and if I can scare half as good as Noel Hynd has with Ghosts, I'll be a happy man. A great novel - yes, the leads were a bit cliche - detective from small town falls in love with big name actress - but there were many moments in the story where I looked over my shoulder while reading on the couch late at night. And I did not see the twist coming in the end. I think Ghosts is the kind of book I'll read every couple of years. Loved it!!! Will definitely seek out more of Mr. Hynd's stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an AWESOME book","review":"I read the book over the summer, just after i turned 13...I am kinda mature for my age and that helps with this book...It was sooo scary. I loved the mix of romance and supernatural happenings..I thought it was awesome and a great book for anyone who isn't scared too easily. And if your younger, than just know there are some, as some would say, inapropriate parts in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!","review":"I really loved reading this book. \\"Ghosts\\" was the first book in a long time that had me thinking twice about reading in bed at night. It's a captivating ghost story with a good plot and well developed characters. There were surprises around every turn. I can't wait to read more of the authors work."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERRY GOOD","review":"This was a very good book. The first i have read by this author. I havnt found any of his other books that can match this one. He should do just like John Connolly is doing with the Charlie Parker series and make a series out of the police officer in Ghosts. If he continued the stories i would buy them all. As long as they stayed interesting and spooky like this one was. Also keep the priest in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn scary...","review":"I love a good scary book and this one suits just fine. It took me back to the days of hiding my books at night because they were so scary! I was tempted to hide the Kindle, but I am a grown up now and resisted the urge! ;) The character development was good; we did get invested in them and the hauntings weren't too over the top. Overall, a good scary read that I would recommend to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story, awful prose","review":"Noel Hynd tells a great ghost story, there's no doubt. I was nicely creeped out, and anxious to find out what happened next. That said, Hynd could use a much better editor. His dialogue was awkward at best, incomprehensible at worst. The book was full of cringeworthy grammatical errors--so many I assumed it was a first novel. Imagine my surprise when I found he had published more than a dozen!I finished this book for the strength of the story, but I won't be picking up any more Noel Hynd."},{"rating":"1","title":"great plot, terrible writing","review":"Okay, maybe terrible is a little too harsh. But the editor in me couldn't put down my proverbial pen. So many problems, small things, using the conjunctions \\"but, yet, though\\" inappropriately, and the predictability, poor dialogue- seriously, cops, even fictionalized ones, just don't talk like that. It was stilting.When he writes the horror, writes the ghosts, he shines. It seems writing the straight stuff is difficult for him, and it makes for difficult reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me scared of my own home","review":"The most frightening novel about ghosts I have read. It takes place among the normal peaceful neighborhoods of Nantucket Island. The ghosts haunt the town by night, good and bad alike. They are not limited to any house, nor will any home keep them away. The ghosts stalk the night. No one is safe. Starts out like a murder mystery and comes around to horror and romance. Fabulous book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghosts","review":"The BEST and SCARIEST GHOST STORY I have ever read! I read this book once a year and I still get scared by it. I remember the first time I read it in 1992, I was alone in the house and even though it was daytime I got spooked by my own house sounds. If you find a copy of this book and you enjoy ghost stories, don't hesitate to buy it. Over the years I have lent it out two or three times,always insisting I get it back promptly. My copy is worn, but much loved. It's about that time of year for me, so I think I'll just take it out for another great read. Since this book I have been disapointed by Mr. Hynd's other ghost stories. I felt they have never quite risen to the scary heights of Ghosts. I wish he would write a sequel. Take my advise, buy it if you find it and don't read it when you are home alone at night!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for the kids, NOT","review":"Truthfully, I am sad to say I have one of these. This keyboard which I purchased long ago was actually to be used with IPAQ or maybe other old windows PDA, as I recall.

I was researching if this was actually blue tooth, and had a chance to be used with today's products and found the comments here. I don't think so!Mine is now a conversation piece and visitor keyboard at my desk. LOL. I figure it will be soothing for visitors to be able to type on it and say what's that!

It's not about TV ads that use emotions to peddle products. It's about making customers feel as if they have a personal friendship with the brands they choose. It offers crucial insights into the cause and affect relationship between customer loyalty and the emotions that customers have for brands. It's a must read for marketing executives looking for next big idea. Unfortunately, it's missing a chapter on measurement.

It contains less than 1/4 of what is in the book.This DVD does include a 30 minute Q & A session with some of the audience, which is only fair at best. However, you have to go online to take the Real Age Quiz, a fact I never could find mentioned in the description.

This takes care of that, plus it's ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY.A friend of mine had breast cancer & her doc told he not to use deoderants that contain cancer causing properties, or have been linked to it. This product has none of those & ELIMINATES that. Spray it on clean feet - no foot odor all day. There are so many pluses - I could go on & on.

The easiest way to describe this book is this: look at the cover of the book closely...this book is basically going to explain everything that is going on, in said picture. I already have a good bit of information on vodoun so the most valuable thing, for me, was the veves and the vodoun pantheon list. If you want true secrets of vodoun, purchase \\"The Spider and the Green Butterfly\\" by E.A. Koetting. There are only 500 copies available, so move quickly. But all in all, this was a good book on the \\"surface\\" view of vodoun"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful and ignorant","review":"After reading several books to seek more knowledge about the Vodou tradition, this one is by far the worse source of information I have ever encountered. I started reading this book and before I passed the first chapter I was dumbfounded by his definitions and comparisons. So I decided to skim through the book and kept finding inconsistencies as well as some appalling assumptions. I don't know where this author got his information but this book should not be sold or bought because I feel that this book is an insult to such a beautiful religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Id say 4 to 4 1/2 stars","review":"This book is nice and Im glad I bought it. The veves are nicely illustrated and the content is pretty informative. The only reason I am not giving this book 5 stars is because theres some small content on cabala which has nothing to do with voodoo. There are some other authors out there that want to mish mash everything together but its just not so. I would still reccomend MAMA LOLA over this book but this one is better than alot of the others out there.

Granted, this was before the Sept. 11 bombings, but before that the World Trade Centure was bomb back in 93, and in 98 the U.S. Embassy was bomb in Africa by alcada, besides the way people were depicted in this film was objective.

The parallels are just scary: so much so that I almost immediately thought of this movie.Read this article and you will understand what made this such a prescient, important movie then, and now more than ever.Or worse yet, juxtapose this situation with the one in Iraq at Abu Gharib Prison and it only gets scarier."},{"rating":"1","title":"just awful","review":"The Siege is an ill-conceived movie and bad on so many levels.

This movie should be seen by all people who believe in the current system and people who believe that the military should be deployed to attack serious issues. The movie itself attacks serious issues. It shows how a country like America can be brought back to the dark ages and how you should be careful what you wish for, because you might just get it. The Acting by Bruce Willis is outstanding how he portrays a cold-blooded, power hungry general.

Annette Benning was great played a tuff lady! She was and could be mean!

The acting was bad (except for Denzel Washington, who was brilliant as always). Annette Bening acted like she was a 19-year-old actress auditioning for the first time. Absolutely not convincing. Bruce Willis looked as if he doesn't know where he is or what's going on. It's a pity that the director of the gem Courage Under Fire would make a movie like this.

Typical Barney fun ensues with jokes and songs and lots of animal pals.Some of the animals featured:Flamingos, meerkats, giraffes, tortoise, tigers, lions, porcupines, chimps, apes, monkeys and gorillas, hippos, parrots, zebras, warthog, elephants, barn owl, bear, kangaroo, koala, among others I might have missed :)The real strength of this video is that there are lots of opportunities for kids to learn about animals. Among other things Barney discusses how different animals prefer different environments: food and activities, for example. Hippos, he points out, like the water and kids learn that hippos' noses are high on their heads to allow them to stay mostly submerged while they breathe.The photography is very good and the music catchy.

In other words, it doesn't make sense if the lyrics are pessimistic. I'm not so sure why the song itself is a slow ballad tune, but I would say not all ballad songs sound negative.

She's got her custom-built home on a lake in Florida and has money for flying lessons and jet-setting across the country anytime her heart desires. Wow, what sacrifice. There were a few sweet stories by other women in the book, but for the most part, women wrote about the travesty of having to give-up designer shoes and couture clothes and risk having their minds go to mush by becoming a SAHM.

So if you don't think you'll need a substantial one, the 5 inch size might be fine for you. However, this guy is barely any more money than its 5 inch counterpart, and I didn't want to regret it and buy the small one and find out that the bigger one might have been a better idea to get.

Keep one of these kits for the day you don't have time or interest in washing the original one, or when you do wind up seeing the pleated filter break down.Eventually, I would guess the pleated filter will break down, and you may also tear the foam part, so keeping a spare set handy is a good idea.

Anyway, Stevens must investigate a series of deaths (don't worry, they're boring too) that have occurred at the hands (fins) of a creature, obviously designed / constructed by a team of monkeys with mittens on. This \\"phantom\\" is almost as frightening as Sigmund The Sea Monster, and looks nowhere near as realistic. Of course, radiation is to blame, causing the soggy sea-turd to attack local rowboat enthusiasts without mercy. This film goes out of it's way to be non-entertaining! I mean, at least CREATURE FROM HAUNTED SEA had some moronic humor to balance out the ridiculous monster and \\"tension\\"! This one's a real dogfish..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Inside Scoop on the Phantom","review":"I am so amazed to see people spending so much time watching and reviewing this movie! I thought my family was the only group left on the earth to watch it! I am especially impressed by your fine observations about the unweildy monster suit! And I am equally amused by your observations about the poor man in the suit!Here is the secret you have all been dying to know--it wasn't a man in that suit, but a woman! In fact it was my grandmother, Norma Hanson. And the young teenage girl on the beach with the boy was my mother! So you can see my family has reason to sit around and watch this movie.If you have no other interest in the movie (like your mom in a bathing suit), I really can't see watching it for free, let alone buying it!Cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic D- Film!","review":"It's a CLASSIC D- FILM ..!!!Pre-Movie Note:I'm getting ready to get into this incredibly horrible fim with cheesy special effects: from 1955 ... The Phantom from 10,000 Leagues ..!!With posters like this, you *know* it's good ..!!Post-Movie Note:Okay ... This movie really blows ... it's gotten far too serious and there's only one sea monster that moves as slow as a turtle and head butts boats with his horns to tip the folks over who, just a moment ago, were swimming past him. He's funny to watch but you don't see enough of him.AND ... there's no sexy chick being groped by a leering sea monster like the poster suggests*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have had these speakers for several years in the wall of my bedroom and I hate them. Very poor bass, and generally muddy sound. Similar to other reviewer, even driving with high power you get weak sound. I have Canton in-wall speakers througout the rest of my house, and they are a thousand times better, but I had bought these CS speakers before I knew better. I will probably replace them with Canton if I can find a pair that will fiut in the same cutout, or will maybe cheap out and try the Polk's, which from the reviews people seem to like, and they are very reasonably priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased!","review":"Well put together,Her honesty on bass is unmistaken. This is one of the cd's that i'd recommend to most of my friend and just about every player that i know for this year. A hint of miles and the space of coletrain, Different textures throughout.her combination of players work well with her ideas. She said that she just wanted to play bass and she does it so well on this cd. Meshelle, my hats off to you on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dance of the Infidel","review":"I found this album dissapointing, not for the musical content, but I bought this album to hear Me'Shell NdegéOcello sing not a list of other musicians."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened Me'shell??","review":"OMG I heard her perform this album live.. Now, I've heard all of her previous albums but not this one.. so I went to the performance thinking she would sing.. much to my surprise it was basically a buncha instruments attempting the most choatic form of jazz I have ever heard.. imagine elevator music that has the opposite effect of soothing and you have this album.. In fact, if the songs didnt have titles.. u wouldnt really know wether or not they were indeed different tracks, or a huge jumbled together song.. I have never been so dissapointed in an artist ever.. Its like Jill Scott, Erykah Badu and others who have incredibly powerful voices and decide nah im gonna play a guitar and let everybody with an instrument have a 5 minute solo.. This is nothing like her previous work.. I am sorry but I absolutley hated it"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would never buy this kind of jazz.","review":"I can't give her a half a star? Yep, I heard Me'shell for the first time in quite awhile on XM Radio just recently. Her new jazz album is being featured alot lately, which is too bad, because I like Beyond Jazz on XM, but I have to turn to a different channel everytime I hear that dreadful sax player she's got playing with her. If you like \\"stress-free\\" jazz, definately stay away from this one. I like Me'Shell from back-in-the-day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"I heard rumors of MeShell doing a jazz CD maybe a year ago and the wait has been well worth it. She has an great line up of musicians with her such has Kenny Garrett, Wallace Roney, Matthew Garrison, Cassandra Wilson, Lalah Hathaway, and others. If you're new to jazz you will find this a great intro.MeShell is the total artist, writing, playing, producing, while sharing her life in doing so. MeShell's CD's are the only ones I buy without hesitation anymore, she hasn't let me down yet. You owe it to yourself to check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow, cool and relaxing","review":"This is a great cd to just chill too and imagine. Im definately diggin it. The melancholy mood to it can put the mind at ease. Im an avid fan of Me'shell because she always strives to improve her artistry. She's always growing; evolving into something better. I can appreciate that because its hard to find an artist out now, who isnt simply, a gimmick."},{"rating":"2","title":"JAZZ?!?! Me'Shell??","review":"This CD was a pleasant surprise. Probably not what you'd expect, but truly beautiful Jazz music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going through the Motions Song","review":"13 Years Ago this Song was Better as \\"Around The World Girl\\" but in 2003 it seems like a Cat just hanging on or just getting by with whatever.\\"Loungin\\" was tighter than this Cut as well.it's a Safe Re-Thread For LL.but I remember When LL truly challenged Himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"One song does not make a CD.","review":"My mistake.

This woman's work was weak, not to mention it is already on another album. Stick to your own stuff Maxwell.2. Sounds like RKelly or someother R&B no talent wrote and produced this mess.

He has been removed from the \\"artists I always buy without hearing a song first\\" list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Greetings,Maxwell third album is excellent. I am amazed at how complete of an artist he continues to be. I can imagine how difficult it is for an artist of his talent to remain totally free but somehow he does it.Favorite Tracks\\"Silently\\"\\"Open Wide\\"\\"Lovers Only\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This is a great soul album but I am adding this review purely for his cover of This Woman's Work. Forget it, it would be worth buying this CD if it only had this song on it. Absolutely amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Now\\"","review":"I absolutely loooove Maxwell!!! What can I say other than this CD made me fall in love all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocking da mic","review":"This album...is not Maxwell's best...but is still better than all the other repetitive R&B plugging the armwaves right now...He's kind of following the R.Kelly-ish route of making poppier music, than sticking to his smoove, groove roots...If you want to check out a similar artist to Maxwell, but with slightly more soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album Ever","review":"This is hands down the best CD I have ever heard. The tracks are hypnotic and send you to instant relaxation mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIBERATED MODERN MALE SOUL","review":"Maxwell's voice and vocal talents,coupled with a more organic and dynamic sound,makes for a decent album.He shows that neo-soul,if that is what modern soul considers itself to be called,doesn't just include D'angelo, Badu, Scott, Bilal, Patterson,Benet and David-Hall.'Now' is such a blend of hard soul and heavier rock, that he make it seem so easy to do what others have failed.He clearly knows that from 'embrya', his material maybe great-yet he has to broaden his sound to other potential fans.Great ,reflective soul for the liberated listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maxwell's Return","review":"After a long wait, Maxwell is back. NOW brings us more of the slow, sensuous jams of URBAN HANG SUITE as well as some very funky uptempo grooves. Although it's closer stylistically to UHS than EMBRYA, it has a new feel and showcases several different shades and tones of Maxwell's musical expression. This is a CD that you can listen to from start to finish! I think it's safe to say that it was well worth the wait!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album...depends on what your're looking for","review":"1)If you are looing for deep lyrics that were in Embrya don't expect it here. You might be little disappointed. (There is no \\"Everwanting\\" or \\"Submerge Into the Light\\".) 2)But if you want something that gives you that warm fuzzy feeling that Urban Hang Suite offers, it here. The songs here cannot live up to UHS. (There is no \\"Reunion\\" or \\"Lonely the Only Company\\" here. But he comes pretty damn close. Many say he went back to his mainsream sound for commercial reasons. I SAY, no matter what he does its coming from his heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Contemporary Artist","review":"Everyone became aware of Maxwell with Urban Hang Suite and the sophisticated, surrealness of Embrya. \\"Now\\" is a great CD and will draw Maxwell's old fans and create some new ones.If you truly want to appreciate the talent of this artist, catch his live show. I saw him twice and it was worth every dime. I can now truly appreciate his vocal range and sheer magnetic sensuality. The concert version of Till The Cops Come Knockin'is enough to melt the coldest heart.Favorites include Changed, This Woman's Work (it takes a brave man to tackle Kate Bush), and of course Lifetime. Had Fortunate been included, my life would have been complete.Maxwell, your fellow Brooklyn native is so proud of your talent. Keep em coming! You stand alone in Soul Music and remind me of what Marvin, Stevie and Donny have done. It's about sensuality and seduction, not sex. Four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Me listening to this cd :)","review":"This cd rocks his style just keep getting better and better. I just can't get enough of this cd. If u were ever a fan of Maxwell u will love this get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed fan of the music","review":"Very dissapointed. Many of the songs sound same as eachother. No stand out tracks other than \\"get to know ya\\". Everything else feels so languid and lush, which I know many folks enjoy but I feel like we've already been there done that with Urban Hang Suite. It is not as strong lyrically of as Embrya. Sounds more like story telling rather than poetry. Very dissapointed, NOW was not worth the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE IS MAXWELL????","review":"I used to like this album, along with all of Maxwell's work. \\"Now\\" was such a great addition to my Maxwell collection...it was unique like he is, but still fairly mainstream. I liked \\"Embrya\\", but I understood that it wasn't going to be popular with most people. This was more popular, and for those who were \\"scared off\\" by Embrya, come back to Now and you won't be disappointed.Maxwell has been MIA. His \\"crown\\" is about to stripped (if not already) by Anthony Hamilton, Van Hunt, and even Rahsaan Patterson. Will the real Maxwell stand up?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I Have My Money Back......\\"Now?\\"","review":"\\"Urban Hang Suite\\" will always be a classic in my collection. Live, Maxwell is electrifying. I am a fan, so don't crucify me.... :) What starts off with a promising first track, \\"Get to Know Ya,\\" quickly deteriorates into listenable background music. That would be a compliment for a lesser artist, but I expect something far more original from such a talented man. I'd skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different style.","review":"I thought I was in for a real treat when Maxwell's newest one came out. I guess I am so used to the sexy, soulful sytle of the Embrya cd that I was not quite prepared.Now is a collection of funky, upbeat songs. I did like them but I just didn't fall head over heels like with his earlier work. Didn't care for the Kate Bush song he borrowed.My favorite off of this one is \\"NoOne\\". Maxwell is still outstanding and has the premiere spots on my cd shelf!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Signature Maxwell","review":"NOW is signature Maxwell. It's no more or no less than what you'd expect from him. He's got talent and a rare voice and style that works for him. He does some repeats on this album and that's why I didn't give it 5 stars. I think he should have saved the repeats for a future 'best of' album. In spite of that, I think it's still a good buy. Maxwell rarely disappoints a fan where his music is concerned. You can't help but love him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bedroom singer, studio genius","review":"From the opening strains, you can tell immediately that Maxwell's comeback shows plenty of promise. Busy guitar-picking opening up a deliciously Moogy synth-bass, horns lines that retro-fy that garage-y nu-step, and finally the slap-n-pop basslines, executed with such unerring precision that sequencer hacks are put to shame. Like Prince, Maxwell is the musician's musician. And if his talent stops at his wrists, he compensates by surrounding himself with enormous talent, and only those who can decipher the densely innovative music of his mind need apply. With guitars at the fore, Now could pass off for a lazy afternoon with Jonathan Butler, which is off the mark only because Maxwell's music is famously make-out conducive. But then again, who says you can't play the bedroom bingo-(bango) in the afternoon?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maxwell does it again...","review":"I have been listening to this album repeatedly since I bought it. Once again Maxwell has come through for his fans who have been long awaiting his next venture. \\"Now\\" shows how much he's matured, not only vocally, but emotionally. \\"Changed\\" and \\"For lovers only\\" are my two favorites, but I am especially impressed with his vocal talent on \\"This woman's work\\". Of course \\"Urban Hang Suite\\" will always be number one on my list, but this album ranks a close second. Maxwell is still the smoothest, finest brotha in entertainment...Buy this album....you definitely won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"choice cuts","review":"This album is very good. The sound production is stellar. The guitar is beyond belief, and plays second fiddle only to Maxwell's voice, which is so hauntingly beautiful, it will stand your hair on end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I love his music but you must admit that Maxwell really needs to use another producer for his work. Except for a few tracks, the rest of the CD is pretty much the same sort of music on all his CD's, kinda weird except for a few tracks. He should really look at using other producers for his music like R. Kelly who wrote a very simple song in \\"fortunate\\" but it was a hit. If Maxwell wants to have a mega hit again like \\"urban hang suite\\", he has to get out of \\"his World\\" and allow someone else guide him musically. He seems to be on an endless journey and by now, many people hope he hurry up and find himself so we can get to good music again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"This is a great CD for anyone and especially if you are a fan of Proof. He has some great work in here that isn't very well known but it is amazing. Simply put, it is a good CD no matter how you look at it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This is my favorite cd of all time...Please do yourself a favor and buy this CD... some of the tracks are near perfection like :Pray For Me, Live N Direct, Wots Up, Brick By Brick, and Oil Can Harry. It upset me when I talked to people and mention Proof as one of my favorite rappers and they either don't know him or say...\\"oh you mean Em's best friend didn't he get shot\\"...buy this CD listen to it and hopefully you will add him to your top ten favorite rappers list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahead of its Time","review":"I enjoyed this book having read it when it was first published and at that time, it was a thriller. Not too many novels were out about stalkers and the terror someone can create in one scene. I remember the bathroom scene and the heroine realizing \\"he\\" had been in her house because the toilet seat was up. Later, in the movie with Julia Roberts called Sleeping with the Enemy, she showed her terror with the towels being out of place. Robyn Carr was ahead of her time and that gives this book a four star rating to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bakuretsu is worth it","review":"For those of you who remember the days of fan subs, Bakuretsu Hunters (Sorcerer Hunters) was one of the best titles out there. And it still is. Where else you can find a guy who turns into a beast of destruction that must be whipped back to human form by VERY scantily glad, gorgeous women as a central plot theme? Aside from that, the story is good and stands on its own merit, the animation is excellent for the time it was produced in, and the characters will leave you in hysterics. If you're looking to get into Anime, or have been in the know for a while and haven't checked out this title, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best teen film in years","review":"\\"All I wanna do\\" is absolutely hilarious. The Flat Critters kept me laughing through the entire movie. Kirsten Dunst did a great job as she always does, and Tom Guiry has made a wonderful transition from child actor in the sandlot. He has definatly become a handsome man. If you are sick of stupid teenage movies without any depth or plot this is definately the movie for you. It supports womens rights and has a hilarious song at the end about the Hairy Bird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"This movie is so forgettable that I am sure that I have watched it before. Don't waste your time. Although it has a good overall feminist theme, the acting, plot, and script were useless. It's pretty predictable as well.If you must watch this drivel, wait for it to appear on cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is the worst!!","review":"Why did I see this movie? I saw it only because it had some of my favorite actresses in it which include Kirstin Dunst and Rachel Leigh Cook. I thought it would be a nice movie. Boy was i wrong! I hated it. I think all this movie had to do with was sex and drugs/alchohal. As for the rating, PG-13, this movie is definitely an 'R'. The message this is giving the kids is to go have fun, make out, and have sex and get kicked out of school because of it. I would give this movie a zero if I could. Kirstin Dunst I give you a 5, but this movie I give a zero. Don't watch it, it's repulsive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC MOVIE, with stunning actors/actresses","review":"At first I was sceptical of the quality of this film, because of the title, the plot . . . it didn't sound sound very exciting. But I can assure you, this movie is VERY good. Cook (Abby), Dunst (Verena), and Hoffman (Odette) played inspiring characters, and less known Keena (Tinka), and Kartheiser (Snake) were fabulous and are great new actors! I found the idea of the DAR (Daughters of the American Ravioli) very inspiring. The whole movie gives young women courage. It tells a wonderful story about five girls with ambition and plans, it tells about the obstacles they overcome. I definately recommend this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"you're so beautiful I could eat your teeth","review":"I love this movie! I watched it on tv one day by complete chance and feel in love! Mostly with Vincent Kartheiser who plays Snake. This movie has an odd flair that just drew me in. The actors did an amazing job and it was a fun journey with them. I must once again comment on Vincent Kartheiser. He was so amazing he had some of the weirdest lines ever! But he delivered them in a way that made them positively intoxicating! I mean who can say \\"you're so beautiful I could eat your teeth\\" and make it sound like the most amazing thing! If you love goofy movies with lots of heart this is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Perspective","review":"This movie changed my view on all girl schools. I always thought they were unnecassary and stuffy. I now feel like they really are a useful tool for the empowerment of women. The charecters in the movie were more on the believable side. I found it an enjoyable and heartwarming film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Flick, Serious Subtext","review":"As an alumna of a woman's college, I hollered \\"comrades!\\" to the characters in this movie as this fun and funky story unfolds. Pay attention to the dialogue - every character contributes a strong point of view that is still relevant today in the discussions about single-sex educational institutions. Lynn Redgraves character makes an excellent point about how aluma(e) dollars work - made me want to write a check to my alma mater. I thought the goofy \\"young Hollywood\\" cast wouldn't be able to treat this subject seriously and yet have fun with it, but Gaby Hoffman and Kirsten Dunst do a great job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and fun girl power flick!!!","review":"This is a fun movie, perfect for budding young feminist! I saw this in college with some friends and we had a blast. This would be perfect for a blast from the past party, or a girl's night in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All I Wanna Do","review":"All I wanna Do is my all time favorite movie. This movie stands up for girls and mixes it with a little humor. I can't see why anyone wouldn't like it. Even parents because it teaches you some real good values. Hope you enjoy this as much as i have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie! Dunst rules!","review":"Kirsten Dunst delivers a fantastic performance in this movie. It is an absolutely hilarious movie that keeps your interests at all times. It is about a group of students at an all girls school that want to be heard. Some of the students will do anything to get what they want. I would recommend this comedy to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did no one else find this movie as vacuous as I did?!","review":"It was so bad! Thank goodness I saw it on tv and didn't waste any money on it. I wish I could give it 0 stars instead of 1. The characters were forced and the plot was predictable. And \\"talented group of rising young actresses\\"? The only actress in this film with enough charisma to carry a full-length movie is Lynn Redgrave, and unfortunately the director didn't give her character nearly enough screen-time, or enough (any?) good speeches/dialogue. And I was more than a little disturbed by the film's careless handling of the bulimic girl - ipecac is a POISON, after all, and it's irresponsible to show it as a weight-loss tool, especially in a so-called feminist movie. I'm all for feminist & empowering films - but give me Legally Blonde over this any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"What i wanna was an even movie","review":"Pretty much all this film is good for is a see it once rental, because it had so much promise but never delivered plus i thought it was too much over the top male bashing to actually enjoy. i rent the dvd because i liked the other films these actresses have been in and decided to give it a shot but i simplely found this movie to be a little self service in the script for my taste and lacking any substance or any real depth and it was uneven all around. all in all this film stinks and i so badly want to like it too what a shame.it's worth 49.cents to me. what junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Very Funny Movie","review":"I didn't really like this movie, because it wasn't that funny at all. There was nothing really funny to laugh about. I didn't understand it that much either.This movie still can be enjoyed by others. Just not me. I almost fell asleep watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidden Obsession-Jan Michael Vincent - Heather Thomas","review":"Jan Michael Vincent fans will find his ability to transform from \\"Nice Guy\\" to \\"Underlying Psychotic\\" very intriguing. Great scenes! His fit and tan physique, golden hair and interaction with Heather Thomas is well done. As well as the ever gorgeous Heather Thomas, best known possibly from \\"The Fall Guy\\", very pleasant and easy going personality. So glad I bought it! Lots to love about it for all the female Jan fans out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply looking at the front cover told you: \\"The Masterpiece\\"","review":"The first time we laid eyes on Richard Avedon's stark, black and white cover photo in early 1968, all of us instantly knew that we were about to be treated to one of the greatest folk-rock masterworks of all time. I'm not going to waste words describing this landmark album. The gripping emotion and beauty of this effort hit all of us like a ton of bricks when we experienced it in 1968. This album is the \\"Sgt Peppers\\" of the folk-rock era. Preserve your memories........ they're all that's left you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two to Three Worthwhile Songs Surrounded by Mediocre Stuff","review":"P, S, R & T contains a much nicer mix of music from top to bottom. I would say that this CD is their weakest. Love America, Mrs. R and Zoo. The rest bore me. Wed. am 3am although capturing them in a cruder moment, is richer by far in total, IMHO. Outside of the above 3 songs, this CD bores me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised to see a bad review?","review":"I'm a big Simon & Garfunkel fan, but this is definitely my least favorite of their records. Somehow it just misses. Bright spots are \\"America\\" and \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" but besides that... The guys don't seem to be working together much. Paul wants to do his own thing, and some of these songs sound like they should be on a Paul Simon album. And Art Garfunkel is obsessed with growing old...which is charming for a while but gets, pardon me, gets old. They have better albums. Any of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"???????????","review":"I just purchased this cd, loaded it, and then proceded to fast forward through most of the songs. People, and the album jacket, claim this is their 'best' album???????I must be living on a different plain.....this cd was a waste of money, I doubt I'll play it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simon and Garfunkle's Masterpiece","review":"I first heard this album (I guess I am dating myself) when I was in high school and instantly fell in love with the music. I had been a Simon and Garfunkle fan for years but had never heard this recording before. Every track is wonderful, especially the arc of \\"Voices of Old People\\", \\"Old Friends\\" and \\"Bookends\\". Those three pieces fit perfectly together, as if it were one long piece. How can anyone listen to those three pieces and not be blown away. Many people feel that \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" is Simon and Garfunkle's masterpiece, but I feel without a doubt that \\"Bookends\\" is their masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best S&G album gets a pristine remastering","review":"Bookends is one of the best examples of Simon & Garfunkel's studio prowess and Paul Simon's songcraft. From \\"Bookends Theme\\" to \\"At The Zoo,\\" the entire CD flows and has a vitality that is unmistakable.Thanks to Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs, the CD is now available in best-ever sound from the original twin-track masters. Subtle nuances in the recordings become crystal clear, much better than any previous CD issues (and, for that matter, all cassette and LP releases).Also, MoFi went to the trouble of reproducing - in miniature - the poster that was bundled with the orginal LP release."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest Album's of all Time!!","review":"Bookends was released in 1968, a very fertile year in pop music, which also saw the release of The Beatles White Album and Hendrix' \\"Electric Ladyland\\". This is definatly S&G's pinnacle though with stellar song-writing, singing and production. This is one of those album's that still sound's incredible on head-phones!!If there is one S&G album you must own,it's this one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still good.","review":"This is my least favorite Simon and Garfunkel album, but thats just my personal taste. I still listen to it and enjoy it but there better ones :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"S/G at its best","review":"First of all, I wanted to correct the other reviewer who stated that Garfunkel is obsessed w/death. It's actually Paul who is, he's said it in many interviews. Anyway, I think that this is the best compilation of the extraordinary harmonies the two have. They don't take themselves too seriously, yet have intelligent lyrics. Fakin' It and Mrs. Robinson are probably my two fave songs. I have all the albums but if I would reccomend just one, this would be it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's to you Mrs. Robinson","review":"Bookends is 29 minutes and 13 seconds and released April 3, 1968. Bookends reached #1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Albums Chart and went Double Platinum. This was the duo fourth studio album. Five of the songs charted and is interesting to note not one of the song reached the Easy Listening charts since they are a folk group. I am no die hard Simon & Garfunkel fan; so I can be more liberal in my opinion. I did not care for the album. One side the music is soft and you need to turn the volume louder then usual while the other side the music is little loud and the volume can be adjusted to normal. I can only give Bookends a B+.Side OneBookends Theme (Instrumental)Save the Life of My ChildAmerica#97 U.S. Billboard Hot 100OversVoices of Old PeopleOld FriendsBookendsSide TwoFakin' It#23 U.S. Billboard Hot 100Punky's DilemmaMrs. Robinson#1 U.S. Billboard Hot 100A Hazy Shade of Winter#13 U.S. Billboard Hot 100At the Zoo#16 U.S. Billboard Hot 100"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Time of Innocence","review":"Well, this very well might be Simon and Garfunkel's finest hour. Or in this case, I guess I should say half-hour. Still no great album ever wore out it's welcome, and S&G use their time very well. Sure the first half has been called conceptual, ranging from childhood to old age, yet the folk melodies stand quite well on their own. I love pretty much every tune, even \\"Save the Life of My Child\\" which certain skeptics have written off. The second is very upbeat and contains many classics like \\"Fakin' it\\", \\"Mrs. Robinson\\", \\"A Hazy Shade of Winter\\", and the fitting closer \\"At the Zoo\\", which ends perfectly with a fade-out of yet another classic shared vocal by the duo. \\"Bookends theme\\" is such a classic opener as well, with it's reoccuring position solidifying one of S&G's most profound statements about life (one after \\"Old Friends\\"). Preserve the few S&G albums we were given, they're all that's left you."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolutely classic album...","review":"Under-rated on its release and rapidly eclipsed by the massive success of \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\", \\"Bookends\\" has, with time, proved to be not only Simon & Garfunkle's best album but one of the very best albums of the 60s.And, 40 years on, the first seven tracks tracks that formed side one of the original LP, with its themes of old age and alienation, remain as fresh and relevant today as they were then... a cohesive and beautifully reflective suite of quite exceptional musical poetry. So good that the quality of \\"side two\\", with its five incredibly catchy but more mainstream folk-rock tracks, is often lost in reviews... which is a shame as they're also among Simon & Garfunkle's best and are good enough on their own to justify five stars. But, in the end, it's the timeless brilliance of side one that elevates \\"Bookends\\" to \\"classic\\" status."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's, like, scary good","review":"This is S & G at the peak of their powers. A very experimental record in many ways, and one that succeeds almost completely. As a big fan, I can easily call this my favorite record of theirs. And it's not a bad entry point for new fans, either. \\"America\\" alone is worth the price of admission, a stunning song, beautifully arranged and performed here. But you get so many other gems (\\"Fakin' It\\" and \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" stand out to me). This expanded version kinda changes the deal by including the outtake \\"You Don't Know Where Your Interest Lies\\" (which is interesting but won't set you on fire, probably) and a demo recording of \\"Old Friends\\" (which is valuable why?). But the packaging is superior to the prior CD release. You can't really go wrong with any version of this classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An old Friend-Bookendz","review":"Bookends is one of the greatest alums of all time, although it does not apper in any of the top lists and I feel it is unjustly reveared and underacknowledged. Bookends is a meditation on lifes loses and it does have a large helping of pathos within it that really adds to the enjoyment of it. Bookends is heatfelt, bittersweet, and if anything magical. Musically it is well written and well produced the lyrics are profound and sicere and rivaling even Dylan in content and shear atmosphere.(Old freinds sat on the park bench like bookends..)The album is quite short at just over 35 mins but the tracks flow and meander into each other like a beatles album and it truely is special.Give it a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought this for my Husband","review":"He loved it, had always wanted to replace allot of his lost music on the reel to reel tapes. It made him happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other Side of the White Album","review":"The Beatles \\"White Album\\" represents 1968 to many; its jagged music and harmony representing so much gone wrong so quickly. In \\"Bookends,\\" probably their best album, Simon & Garfunkel use better production and more complete songs to express many of the same feelings. \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" is a cliche' now (has been since Frank Sinatra's cover), but \\"Fakin' It,\\" \\"Hazy Shade of Winter,\\" and especially \\"America\\" express with detailed imagery the loss of innocence and even civility that marked their previous generation. The long bus ride, the trip to the zoo, even the morning breakfast (\\"Punky's Dilemma\\") are chronicled by a sweeping lonliness society only pretends to fill with the \\"Dangling Conversation\\" of S&G's previous album. A classic best heard start to finish in one listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"The singers singer","review":"There are many great singers in Australia, but Anthony Warlow is the singers singer. It's not often that you listen to a recording where every note if perfect, but somehow Anthony Warlow manages to hit the right note, with the right emotion every time. His art is that you actually believe every song.This is more than having a great voice, and every voice has its limitations, compass, strength, timbre. What makes Anthony Warlow different is the way he can use it. Every singing student should get his CD's and listen to the technique. If you love the voice, don't miss this or any other Warlow album.If Mr Warlow ever can, I hope he shares some of this talent in some master classes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing voice!","review":"I first heard of Anthony from my friend's Les Miz recording and have since become a die-hard fan. Centre Stage was his first solo album, and it's amazing! His \\"Music of the Night\\" is beyond comparison and the whole album is both funny and incredibly moving. \\"Anthem\\" is my favorite in this set - it almost had me in tears the first time I heard it. This CD is a must for all Warlow fans and anyone wanting to hear some amazing singing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best voices","review":"Regardless of the arrangement or instrumentation of the songs, the interpretation of Anthony Warlow delivers. I first heard his voice in a complication CD, the best of Act I. This is my second CD of his. I like best his simple, yet elegant, interpretaton of Johanna, I Am What I Am, and the Colors of my life. His voice is very refreshing. I really do not tire of listening to this CD again and again. His background is theater but his interpretation is not over-dramatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Memories","review":"This was a great buy.

No such luck, apparently.After shelling out for \\"Old Friends\\", I cannot justify dropping around fifty bucks for much of what I already own. This set isn't filling in all of the holes left from \\"Old Friends.\\" Unreleased tracks and alternate takes are nice, but where's the hit version of one of S & G's biggest hits?

A good story is badly told - dry and dissapointing writing with stupid or inapropriate events that appear for no apparent reason in what should have been a good story.

The back cover claims \\"It's a scary good time with the COMPLETE first season of Danny Phantom.\\" (emphasis mine.) However, it only contains the first 13 episodes, while season one was twenty episodes long. Similarly, the \\"Season Two\\" set contains episodes 14-26 and does NOT include the fan favorite \\"The Ultimate Enemy,\\" which is probably why many fans wanted this one to begin with.Save your money for a REAL box set that has all twenty episodes, plus extras and everything a season box set should have. This, sadly, isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed review","review":"As the title says, this set is a mixed review.The good, looks like they got the COMPLETE season out, not part like in the first release.The bad, the physical discs themselves are cheap DVD-Rs, not even real commercial quality DVDs. This means they are very delicate and most likely will degrade in a year or two as the purple dye fades. The authoring on them is slipshod, I couldn't even play the first disc on an older DVD player without the disc skipping and the picture being pixilated beyond anything watchable. Ended up having to watch it on my PS3.I really, really wanted the series and when it's finally released, it looks like a cheap pirate job. I am sorely disappointed in Nickelodeon, but unless its released on Blu-ray, I hate to say this is the only way to get the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, Look at that Price!!","review":"My wife loves this tea, the store sells the packages at over $5 a package.

This is one book in a series, so you can read more if you want.This book is good is because this book has a lot a action in it and it is interesting. Another reason is that Ash sees a Poke'mon he wants to catch ,but Misty wants to catch the Poke'mon too. There are a lot of problems to be worked out also. Tracy West has written most of these Poke'mon books, so you can read more if you like this one.I think the Tracy West's purpose was to give the reader an idea of what Poke'mon looks like and for the readers to use bigger imaginations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make an excel spreadsheet instead","review":"The book is nothing but blank spaces for you to write in what's in your freezer, what you're having for a dinner party, or who you're inviting. What??? I can write that on a blank piece of paper and save myself $16 bucks.Even better you can make an excel spreadsheet and actually have it mean something. I can't believe a publisher wasted paper on this book, trees were killed for nothing. This is truly a book of blank pages. There are no organizational tips, no party invitation ideas, there is nothing here that would actually help organize a cook."},{"rating":"1","title":"An organizer that you fill in... not a how to book.","review":"This book has more to do with providing a space for you to put \\"your\\" organized work into and then use as a reference point. So rather than go to a cook book for your roast beef recipe, then another for your rice pilaf and then yet again another for your sweet yam pie... you write them all down here. That is not a how to book if you ask me, the title and description gave me the idea that this might be a book with insight into a proper prep kitchen. I was wrong, and even at the discount price I am not pleased. If I had time to write out my planning for a party, recipe or some other event. I would do it in connection with that event. I am sorry I normally do not give one star, but I did not like the marketing aspect of this book, it was a bad trick on poor unorganized cooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hannie Caulder","review":"I'm so glad that this movie is finally to be released on DVD. I have an \\"imported\\" copy. Although I have difficulty with the, almost comedic,antics of the villains,as well as the mysterious stranger, this movie is a gem. The late Robert Culp was always one of my favorite actors. As Thomas Luther Price, his courage, integrity and prowess with a gun are unmatched...as is his compassion. Being a shooter and collector of \\"Old West\\" firearms, I found that as a teacher, Robert Culp was unbeatable. He showed Hannie the proper form, and approach to shooting a six gun, with a mixture of toughness, understanding, and patience. His advice, at all levels, was both wise and true. Such was Thomas Luther Price's \\"presence\\", that something about the movie seemed to die with his absence. For those who value courage and integrity, coupled with compassion,and the \\"romance\\" of a love left unspoken, I highly recommed this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raquel Rocks!!!","review":"You can not go wrong with Raquel Welch in leather pants, a poncho on with nothing on underneath and packing some heat!!

About half way through, down in the lower right hand corner the symbol \\"AMC\\" popped up and I realized that it was just a good copy made from the American Movie Classic channel.This version that is now being released should be far superior....and I look forward to it.If you have not seen this movie, by all means give it a try. There is not a single wasted minute in the whole film. Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crack in the World - Old School Sci-Fi","review":"I remember seeing this movie in the late '60's and enjoyed it. I have been, for the last few years, searching for this movie and stumbled upon it quite accidentally. It , to my mind, is old school sci-fi because of the story, the quality of the special effects, acting and continuity flaws. I don't want to spoil it for anyone. it is apocalyptic in some respects, but it is fun and a good romp just the same. if you do not take the movie too seriously it is pretty enjoyable. if you recall some of the sci-fi \\"B\\" movies from '60's and '70's you know what I mean. if you are too young to have seen these type of movies, give it a whirl, you may be pleasantly surprised on how entertaining it is.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Over Due Release","review":"I had searched for a long time for this movie because I was always intrigued by the scenario. I first saw the trailer at the Drive-In theater when I was a kid. But never through the years had I the privilege to view it in its entirety. Well i was not disappointed by what I saw. Its a great SciFi thriller even though a little vague in theory. Well worth the price and the time spent searching for it. Don't expect the CGI effects in this one because they didn't have it.

The descriptions of the record you will hear are entirely accurate. He is a gifted singer/songwriter (and I think he arranges the music on his own as well) who writes gorgeous melodies with lyrics that give off feelings of sadness and humor, often at the same time. Call this record melancholy fun if you want, but it is so much more than that and I really can't recommend it highly enough. I would have said it was my favorite debut of the year, but the Arcade Fire record holds that status now and probably will till the end of the year. A great record from an artist worth paying attention to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad, shocking, and well worth watching","review":"This movie was sad, shocking, and well-done. It is not easy to watch and I was frequently overwhelmed by the terrible story that it told. These poor orphans and their horrible lives in hell, because, yes, hell is in the Russia of today, just tear at your heart.Yet the movie does not exploit the horror with any falsity...everything rings so true and genuine. The cinematography is so real..one actually feels the filth and the neglect to which these children are subjected.Vanya never thinks his mother is really gone.....he is sure that somewhere she is waiting for him. And he is determined to find her, despite the obstacles he must overcome....not the least of which is getting out of the orphanage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Little Movie","review":"This is a sweet little movie with an ending that seems too pat, but any other ending would have made the movie almost unbearable. The movie was reminiscent of Dickens in two respects; the view of the underbelly of society, and that the characters were far more interesting than the plot. Since this was a movie created by Russians for Russians, it may be that it was intended as a modern day morality play. Whatever the intent, it was done well. I doubt I will get the image of the orphan out of my mind for a while, and a number of other characters will stick there for a while too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Boy's Adventure","review":"This is a good movie. If you know too much about the story much of the impact of the movie will be considerably lessened. So be forewarned: many of the reviews here reveal too much. Now back to the movie itself. If after a few minutes you are tempted to stop watching because of the grimy and sad look of provincial Russia as well as the bleak harshness of the orphanage, don't quit, keep on watching! Soon enough there will be plenty of intensity, suspense, and adventure. The film presents us with several subtly drawn characters and some surprises along the way--not everyone acts according to type. Ivan (Vanya), the main character, is a sensitive and good hearted boy who is also indomitable and resourceful. The child actor playing him does a superb job. A film well worth of your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Superb Film","review":"Regardless of how accurately this film portrays the real circumstances of adoption in Russia, it is a totally absorbing cinematic experience, with a convincing portrayal of the ways children and teenagers actually respond to one another. Many of the children in the film, including some with speaking roles, are residents of a children's home near St. Petersburg.But the main reason to see the film is the performance of the amazing Kolya Spiridonov in the lead role. He simply lights up the screen, and steals every scene he is in. I think it is one of the best performances by a child actor ever captured on film.

I feel it's not really a book you'd read to learn about, or advance your knowledge of chemistry.

This book provides a very mature analysis and solution for Christians going through those extremely difficult experiences in life, whether those trials are relational, physical, financial, spiritual or any combination thereof. You won't be disappointed by this book. This book goes way beyond 'spiritual grade school' and instead takes the reader to 'spiritual graduate school'.

Mr. Finkelstein's scholarship, passion, humility and humanity are unmatched and they come through so clearly in this film. He's an unsung hero of this country and I thank the filmmakers for bringing attention to him. Although the film does not go in depth into his scholarship and the issues for which the Zionist lobby, organized or individuals, have gone after him for, I still think the film succeeds in bringing to the surface the problems with academic censorship and Zionist control over the discourse in this country."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Radical: Trials of Norman Finkelstein","review":"Norman Finkelstein is a beacon of truth for the Palestinian/Israeli conflict. This DVD follows the lifework of a man devoted to bringing justice and peace to the Palestinians . . . as well as exposing the actions taken by the Israelis, that impede an agreement to be reached between the two. This portrayal holds your interest from beginning to end. The truth is simple . . . the lies complicate the issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"A defining album in folk/rock history. A defining American album. BOTW is a wonderful journey. This uber-talented duo have never sounded better, or written better than here. The melacholy vibes just pour off of \\"So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright\\" and \\"The Only Living Boy in New York\\". Gorgeous songs that captivate the spirit and imagination. Then throw in hoots like \\"Baby Driver\\" and the heartfelt \\"Bye, Bye, Love\\". This is an album that spoke many things for many people. It spoke for a generation of Americans disturbed by economic distress and wars and rumours of wars in far away places. A powerful snapshot of American history.Essential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bridge Over Troubled Water","review":"This is not a slam on the seller but on Amazon. I ordered 5 titles that were advertised to be in a mini-disc format. All of the other sellers cancelled except this one when they saw it was really a cassette. They said Amazon improperly identified them as mini-discs. Cassettes are a useless format these days and I probably will never listen to this but it's too much trouble to return it.Kjacks"},{"rating":"1","title":"About the package, not the album itself","review":"The album it's a classic and it deserves that.

When it was released I recevied a card I was supposed to return to my record club and I forgot it and received this vinyl album. When I played it, I thought it was the best pop album I'd ever heard and up to this day I still believe that. I've had this on vinyl, 8 track (what's that???), cassette, cd and now remastered cd.This one has two bonus tracks including a demo version of 'Bridge'. It's almost like an unplugged version because Ernie Freemans' great orchestra is not featured. The lyrics are a little different. Historically it's a good cut but can't begin to compare with the finished version. The only sour note is the live version of 'Bye Bye Love'. Good remastering job and some nice surround effects. A must have for any pop collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"So sad this was the end","review":"Their last album to me is their finest.

The title track, \\"Bridge...\\" is my all time favorite song! Other S&G classics are: \\"Cecilia\\", \\"The Boxer\\", and (in my opinion) \\"Keep the Customer Satisfied\\". I rated the CD this way because I like all of these songs. The only songs that I'm not fond of (much), are \\"The only Living Boy...\\", & \\"So Long, Frank..\\".

We all know how good \\"Bridge Over Troubled Waters\\" and \\"The Boxer\\" are. You will be pleantly surprised by \\"The Only Living Boy, in New York\\", \\"Song For the Asking\\",and one of my favorites \\"So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright\\" which is melodically beautiful, and lyricly wondrous.

The lyrics are practically part of my DNA. Still sounds great. Bought a copy for my folks so they could have it on CD; they were thrilled with it too. Stands out as original (does anything else in pop music sound like this?) and musically and lyrically interesting. Songs are still catchy. One of the top 100 albums of all time (per Rolling Stone, not just my opinion). Go, go, get it, get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Albums of 1970: No. 5","review":"Both the Beatles and Simon & Garfunkel released their final albums in 1970. However, while LET IT BE documented the fragmentation of band members heading in different directions, no such tensions are evident on BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER. The title track is a majestic tour de force and spent six weeks at No. 1 and sold over a million copies. \\"Cecelia\\" was another million-seller. But my favorite track is the melancholic \\"The Boxer.\\" And just for the sheer joy of the song, \\"Baby Driver\\" runs a close second--even though I still don't have a clue what the lyrics mean! And they pay homage to one of their biggest influences with a rendition of the Everly Brothers' 1957 hit, \\"Bye Bye Love.\\" Simon & Garfunkel were the most successful duo of the Sixties for a reason: Simon was a superb songwriter and they could sing the hell out of a song.

The script is awful, the directing is leaden & dreadful. The story makes no sense. Why anyone ever made this into a movie escapes me.

Holly Hunter has moments but isn't at all believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Prison Film Since Midnight Express!","review":"This Film Didnt Get the Recognition nor the Accolades that it deserved! Came and went in the theaters, many people have discovered this Little Gem On Video! More than Just a Typical Prison Film, this is a Film about Friendship and Love! I am sure that everyone who has seen this film ask themselves the same question, \\"What Would I Have Done In a Situation Like This?\\". For The People Who have seen the Film, My Honest Answer was \\"NO WAY WOULD I HAVE GONE BACK!\\" The acting is exceptional and this should have been Anne Heche's Breakout Performace! Do yourself a favor and See This Film, you wont be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Feelings","review":"i think Vince Vaughn is a very good actor. even though the remake of Psycho flopped, he was a pretty good Norman Bates. this movie, however wasn't as good as it could have been. the editing was very choppy, and the sound mixing was terrible, i couldn't understand a lot of what was said in the movie, and the cinematography left a LOT to be desired. with all of these things fixed, this movie would have had a lot of potential. Anne Heche is a very good actress, but it was stupid how her and Sheriff had sex and then immediately fell in love. CHEESY! well, very gripping plot, but i really didn't feel much of the suspense because of the film quality and sound. also, some of the music was good for the scenes, it added the suspense and feeling that the sound and camera work took away, but it didn't do it adequately enough. i'd recommend this for people who don't plan on seeing it with a critical eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie, tough getting through the prison scenes!","review":"I stumbled onto this movie today, and decided what the heck, it was nothing else on anyway. Very emotionally charged film, and great acting, especially by Joaquin Phoenix. I have seen him in other movies, but this was a very good performance by him. It was really tough to watch the prison and courtroom scenes, especially that last prison scene with Vince Vaughn. It was hard not to cry. I walked away from the TV twice because the scene was so intense. What I really liked about the movie is how it slowly reeled you in at just the right pace. There were never dull moments, and made you that more curious to see how it would end. It also left you thinking about your own morality and friendships. I plan to buy this movie and add it to my collection, again Great Movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good and could have been great","review":"Excellent story line.... Vince Vaughan is a young actor that needs to mature a bit... he is a little too cocky and smooth in this role.... Had he been about 5 years older, and with many more roles under his belt, this could have been a GREAT movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific story of love, honor and courage!!","review":"Though the movie is slow paced, it is a terrific story.

Terrific performances by Heche and Vaughn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vince Vaughn was superb!","review":"This movie is spellbinding the story is interesting it just pulls you in. The actors are incredible with their performances especially Vince Vaughn,Anne Heche,and Joaquin Phoenix. Vince's sheriff is the one that grows in the movie and a very likable character. Great!movie it should've got some oscar nods."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only film to reduce me to tears for four days after","review":"What a beautiful performance by Joaquin Pheonix. No other film has subjected me to such distress as this. The story of an innocent abroad, such is that you come away trusting no one. The tense court room scene, which will leave you actually gasping for breath and then the look in Joaquin's eyes when the verdict has arrived.Never in my life have I experienced such heart wrenching stuff, that I actually cried for many days after. His desperation, his pleading and Vince Vaughn's comforting words, were like no other film I have ever seen. Joaquin Pheonix has once again, shown himself to be a very very brilliant actor and I strongly recommend people to watch Inventing The Abbotts.This guy should be up there with the likes of many of the top actors. Her should get the status he deserves and let us see more of this wonderful and brilliant actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great movie","review":"this is one of the few movies that has ever made me cry . the movie was great and made me think about what i would do and it really makes you realize how good life in america is. i thought joaquin played in some way the biggest role even though you only saw him for brief amounts of time.he diserved so much more credit after all he is the one who made you cry. vince vaughn and anne heche were also great. this is one of those movies that leaves you crying the next day so plan something fun . also don't listen to return to film school he has no idea what he is talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought provoking movie..","review":"Although this movie wasn't a box office hit (hey, maybe that just means it's probably good), it is truly a film worth watching. I already knew the ending before I actually watched \\"Return to Paradise\\", so I was robbed of the suspense that makes the movie even better. The acting was great. Joaquin Phoenix is frighteningly good in his role. There really aren't any words to describe what he does on screen in this movie. Vince Vaughn gives a wonderfully well acted and thoughtful performance. They are my favorite actors for a reason. It is obvious from this movie that they are talented and underappreciated. I only had one complaint as I was watching-- the love story really diluted the message of this movie and seemed tacked on and out of place. I would have thought this movie was perfection without it. \\"Return to Paradise\\" is really a movie worth watching, if only for the question it asks. Would you do the right thing, even if it had the potential to ruin your life?"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT?! This movie was horrible!","review":"The last 20 minutes of this movie was great!

The premise is absurd: namely, that anybody would even THINK about giving up three or six years of their lives to live in a hideous torture cell just so some friend that they barely knew in the first place won't hang - preposterous in itself - for smoking some hash.My advice to Joaquin Phoenix would have been: Sorry, pal, but get a better lawyer.A ridiculous storyline that wasted some fine acting talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boringgg","review":"A story about the most stupid person on the planet.

It starts at the front, with things like the squeltchy title track and the critcical hit My Legendary Girlfriend (a seven minute epic). The standard of CD1 isn't far below either of those gem albums by the group. Being Followed Home is a particularly chilling and daring offering, and She's Dead, I Want You and Don't You Want Me Anymore all emrit a mention. CD2, however, is from an age in which their work wasn't of the same standard. Only the humourous Dogs are Everywhere and the crooning My Lighthouse are up to standard. Best way to think of this might be thinking of CD1 as a long awaited new album, a return to a radio-friendly sound after the experimental (but great in its own way) This is Hardcore, and CD2 as a collection of bonus tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest CDs!!!

Fathers were in the war and mothers were working in factories. Incidence of juvenile delinquency soared. This movie focuses on the problem with a very entertaining story of a teenager on the threshold of manhood that, although he has good intentions, ends up on the wrong side of the law. The acting is surprisingly good and the story is never dull. This is a movie to relax with and enjoy a window into the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"There is actually a DVD edition of this sans MST3K treatment? Amazing, simply amazing. This movie is bad. Not bad in the way that Manos, Hands of Fate is bad, but it's still bad. That's not to say that parental neglect is not wrong, but this movie doesn't really put that across very well. Sure, the \\"kid's\\" parents are a gambler and a drunk, but none of that adequately explains why the \\"boy\\" (this guy's got to be at least 28) ends up working for a gang. Indeed, part of the reason, this guy starts doing odd jobs for the gangster is for lack of money, which his dad seems to have quite a lot of (I would think if your pops isn't paying enough attention to you, you could at least hit him up for as much money as possible). And nobody (at least nobody with any dignity) would spew forth the speech this poor \\"kid\\" does to the judge when he blames his parents for his misfortune (and stupidity)."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply great","review":"This is so well written and very funny.

All other cologne I have bought, including the smaller version of Curve which I bought at a department store, all persist all day long. The scent does not diminish until washing the garment. Now that I noticed, I tested and sprayed my shirt again and like stated in another review, it seems to last anywhere between 15min - 30min then the scent fades drastically.

I love the show, however, so I needed no other reasons to pick up the book. The book was great. The first season of the show was mostly from the view points of Nathan and Lucas Scott. The book, however, gave us more insight into other characters such as Haley James, the geeky girl that Nathan Scott falls for, unintentionally. Although some would say the book is written for teenagers; I would disagree. I thoroughly enjoyed the character development, and am extremely excited about the second installment, which I hear is from the viewpoint of Brooke, the misunderstood princess of the bunch. I would recommend this read to just about anyone, and if you're not watching the show...start!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read","review":"I love watching One Tree Hill, and this book really added a lot to what we know about the characters. It's fun reading about what they do in the summer when they're not in school, and also how all of them acted towards each other before Lucas joined the basketball team. The book is pretty funny, too. The best part of reading book like this where you know all the characters is that there are details about them that you can't get from the show. I like knowing more about the music that Peyton listens to, and about Lucas's friends at the River Court and other things like that. If you like the show, you should definitely read this.

This coming May, 2000 will be the first time it will be available, so make sure it's on your list of movies to check out! The film takes place in 1965 at \\"Tubby's\\" Drive-In. The central character is Newbomb Turk(Robert Wuhl)and his rambunctious gang of \\"Knights\\" running around their Town and playing funny pranks on themselves, the bumbling police and their school. Hollywood Knights is considered to be the clone of the many \\"Drive-In\\" type movies, most notably, \\"American Graffiti\\"(1973) but I guarantee you will laugh your socks off. This film is also notorious for featuring the debut performances of, Robert Wuhl, Fran Drescher and Michelle Pfeiffer. Tony Danza, Stuart Pankin, and Gary Graham also appear."},{"rating":"2","title":"hollywood knights","review":"Hollywood Knights.....simply the BEST cult comedy film.When you need to laugh this movie is the one.

I have been watching it for almost ten years now and every time I see it, it gets funnier. The best time to watch it is when you are with a group of your buddies, like co-workers, or dorm friends from college, buy a couple cases of beer, pop in \\"the Hollywood Knights\\", and live a time that was innocent, yet disturbing. even though I was born in 1977, the stories that my father has told me about growing up at that time in his small town of Logan, Iowa, remind me of the hell that he and his buddies raised. The situation with the police is the same, Vietnam was n the minds of the young, hangouts were customary, and getting that girl you liked was number one, or number two, depending on how serious you were. Every Baby Boomer's child should watch this movie to see what things were like when their parents were young. Then, ask them questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Newbomb, go Newbomb","review":"I'm delighted to see that so many people love this movie! I saw it several times when it first came out and waited way too long before it showed up on cable. The real star of the movie is Robert Wuhl who is dead on FUNNY! And I would say the best co-stars are the cars and the culture of 1965 Southern California. I am lucky enought to have experienced the Drive-In experience during my high school days and though we had lots of fun, a night like the October 30, 1965 at Tubbys would be one for the books. The movie runs easily from gag to gag with little time for a breather. The serious moments are few and well played. Of course Duke and Suzie will eventually break up and we hope Jimmy comes back from Viet Nam to enjoy his ride and hang out with Smitty and the boys. But until all that is known let's raise hell on Halloween! I'm glad there was never a sequel to this movie because this special kind of fun can only happen once in a life time."},{"rating":"2","title":"excelent","review":"This movie was great and if you are a Fran Drescher fan , even though she does't have a big part she was still great, you will love this movie !! buy it today"},{"rating":"2","title":"Those Hollywood Knights they drive me crazy Part II","review":"Oh I almost forgot!

Hands down, that honor belonged to Robert Wuhl whose Newbomb Turk character made this movie the classic that it is. Danza and Pfeiffer have bit parts as the \\"love interest\\" and their story does little to move this flick along, but I guess they were the prettiest and most recognizable faces in the movie. (Well, Michelle's was.) I'm proud to say that I actually paid money to see this in it's original theatre run, and that for years one of my proudest posessions was a taped copy from Cinemax.

The DVD cut is unwatchable as most the the best scenes are left out which makes following the theme of the movie hard at best to understand. From what I understand there were alot of legal battles to even release this to DVD as alot of the big name actors didn't want it to hit the light of day.

It's about the crazy hijinks of a car club set in the late 50's, early 60's. All throughout the movie are some great songs and great cruising cars from that time. Racing on the strip and visiting the local drive in burger joints were also a sign of that time. In this movie the burger joint is Tubby's and it's about to be closed down for so called \\"progress\\" and the opening of a new office building in it's place. Throughout the night of the closing the Hollywood Knights gain some new initiates and lose one of the older members to the Vietnam war draft. You won't be disappointed with this movie.

By the way, isn't Robert Wuhl like 45 years old in this--playing a High Schooler? Wannabe American Graffiti, which also sucks. Has Michelle Pfeiffer ever NOT played annoyed/angry in any of her roles? All she does is argue in every movie she's ever made. That's a prime indicator that she has No Acting Ability Whatsoever. And Fran DressCher lends her annoying Honk to this Moronic Film!

This 10+ hour drama, so beautifully written, is now more than 30 years old, but holds its own against anything of its kind today. Straightforward camera direction, outstanding production values, and a cast of dozens of the finest actors of the day, including Charles Kay, Peter Vaughan, Barry Foster (bringing Kaiser Wilhelm to life in an astounding performance) Michael Bryant, and Patrick Stewart (as the autocratic Lenin!) makes this series well worth having in your video library.

Weston and Nichols, in particular, were extremely fine composers, each with a flair for off-kilter rhythms and unexpected, charming melodies; and the inclusion of their work alone would make this an essential addition to any jazz lover's library.

This was NOT the 80s I remember. This compilation is the kind of lowest of lowest common denominator garbage that gives the 80s a bad name. Unfortunately there are few alternative collections that roll together the true new wave groundbreakers, godfathers of electronica, and pre-90s alt rocker forebears that made the 80s a phenominal time for good middle-of-the-road pop rock - no such thing even exists today.

He provides the reader with not just a detailed anecdotal of his journey across the sea and across continents, but also his own personal perspective of the meaning of this journey that he takes with his family. I found the book a good read and one incredibly full of insight into the divine elements of the codes of the Torah. He spells out clearly what he's doing and how he's trying to find the answers through the codes. What is very compelling about the book is Roffman's honesty in revealing that perhaps the codes aren't going to do what he hopes they will. He corrects some false assumptions and provides the reader with a genuinely honest perspective on the nature of the Codes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money!","review":"This wand is the equivalent of a drinking straw, with a cheap sequin star, even cheaper looking strands of beads and wrapping paper equivalent ribbon attached.

A simple man's journey through complicated times. The coming-of-age of a generation and a whole country. And at the heart of the story is the music. Music that lives with us, always there to remind us of the people, the places, and the events of our times.

I have never seen this movie, so can't compare this album on relation to the film, but it is kinda hard to believe that all of these songs actually played in the film. Plus, I understand that there is also another Forrest Gump cd of the original score music. So, how can one film have so much music within it? Maybe one day I shall check it out to see.

I was bitten by the pop-up bug when I purchased Robert Sabuda's Alice in Wonderland (Matthew's mentor). This book is equally as beautiful and I love that it is not a \\"Disney\\" princess book. The center page has Cinderella after her transformation in full ballroom attire with real ribbon and she stands about 5 or so inches tall out of the middle of the page. In the final pages you can actually watch the prince's hand place the glass slipper on her foot and pull a tab to watch them ride off in to the sunset.

They fit very well front and back except the driver's mat, it will take a little trimming to clear the dead pedal on the left. If you have an automatic that probably won't be a problem. These should be good for winter, they have deep grooves and channels.The mats were pretty hard to get off the package/hangar they come on, you have to cut them off. Plus the vinyl smell is a little strong, I'm sure that will fade though. When placed on top of the original black mats, these clear mats appear bluish for some reason. Doesn't bother me too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"great buy","review":"Very happy with these mats, I just bought a new car and the mats fit perfectly and do not slide around. They were a great buy and will save the rug in my car from getting dirty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I ordered the clear ones for my RAV4. When i bought the car there were no OEM floor mats in the car. This product is very good. The bottom side that touches the car floor is jagged and it attaches firmly to the car floor - and wont move.

The size was perfect for the RAV4 - no trimming needed. Great purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mats were smelly!","review":"These mats were purchased for my mother's car. They were extremely odorous when removed from the shipping box. My mother laid them outside for four days to allow them to air out. Once she placed them in the car the smell did return a bit. But she also found that it was difficult for her to move her foot from the accelerator to the brake due to the raised texture. So, she called the company, was issued a return authorization number and she shipped them off. Cost almost $20.00 to return and of course they only refunded the product cost to me! So, these mats cost me $17.00 and cost my mother almost $20.00 to try them! We won't make that mistake again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice car mats!!","review":"Very good quality.

They are universal mats, so you do have to cut them to size. The only problem I had is I can't them to fit exactly in the driver's side floor board (there is a place for your left foot in a Civic). But they work well and the price is very good. The plastic is very thick and sturdy."},{"rating":"2","title":"floor mats","review":"Good product....can easily be cut to fit.

I tried using face masks but they are annoying especially since I use glasses that fogged up. This air filter was the perfect answer for me - I run it right next to my saw while I'm cutting and I can watch all the sawdust get sucked into the filter resulting in totally dust-free air. It's not perfectly quiet but it's a lot quieter than I expected, nowhere near as bad as running a regular dust-vac. I can't even hear it once I put on my headphones and tune into my music.

I thought this product would work well because of the size. Well, it does not.For one thing, this item is huge. It's about 2 feet long and about a foot in diameter. It is not designed to be hung out of the way. Instead, it's meant to sit on a surface like on a bench top or the floor.It does not suck air strongly enough. The effective distance that it affects is about 6 inches. If you are sanding beyond that, the dust will go elsewhere, and not get sucked into the air cleaner. You sort of wish that while the fine dust is airborn, the air cleaner will just pull it in. What I observed, though, is that everything in the shop is eventually covered with fine dust even while the so-called air cleaner is running continuously.Crappy product. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for small shop","review":"Have this air cleaner in a small basement shop ( ~250 sq. ft) at my summer home where I have a table saw and many portable power tools. Air cleaner works well for that area keeping the dust down. Its very light and portable, so can move it and set on a table near your work. Would have given 5 stars if it had a mechanism to hang from the ceiling. I screwed some hooks to the joists and used some old chain and placed through the handles and that works fine.

Ezra Taft Benson, probably more than any other L.D.S. chief leader has spoken more clearly, frequently, and convincingly on this subject. This volume, more than any others with his name on it, is particularly important in that it was published when he was President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Its review by the sitting First Presidency is mentioned in the preface pages. The last third portion of the book is devoted to the subject of freedom, with many powerful L.D.S.

The key innovation was the \\"semiotic triangle\\" where we are encouraged to think of things, thoughts and symbols in separate and distinct domains. I now use the \\"semantic triangle\\" (a more approachable name) in many of my semantic web training classes. The key concept to get across to students is that when computers need to communicate, there are many limitations when using symbols alone, which can have many different meaning within different contexts. For example the word \\"run\\" has over 50 different meanings according to WordNet. A more robust way to exchange information between computers is to associate data elements with concepts.

I love them, they are so talented and cool but in this sourpuss flick, I was less than impressed. There's nothing really wrong or terrible about their performances in Le Divorce, it's the weak and confusing storyline that makes this movie a waste of time. I was hoping for a sweet romantic comedy and what I got was a depressing and hollow look at couples who want what they can't have, same old same old. Watts's character tries to kill herself and Hudson's character is casually sleeping around with a married man. Too many cliches, pointless ending, I just wanted this movie to end. It's a darn shame Le Divorce wasn't spectacular, the previews made this film look so good, never trust the trailer, looks can be deceiving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a comedy,,,,,,","review":"but kinda sorta interesting.Naomi Watts' french husband walked out on her and their daughter shortly after she found out she's pregnant again.

She doesn't even want a divorce; just never to see him again.There's an excellent cast, including Glenn Close and Stockard Channing, but the movie never really jelled for me.

Then I watched it looking for \\"romance\\", \\"comedy\\", and a reason to care about the story and found none. I found the movie depressing--an irate husband shooting his adulterous wife and lover, an old philanderer luring and then leaving a young lady, and stuffy French family values. The sub-story about the painting just seemed added to waste time. I mean, who cares? I waited in vain for something to happen to tie everything together.

The only \\"villain,\\" if there is one, is social and legal problems in France. Dialogue is smarmy. There are no laughs at all.And to make it work for America, the movie tacks on and ends (never mind the silly coda) with a VERTIGO scene, or maybe it's the belltower scene from BATMAN.Fine actors like Bebe Neuwirth and Sam Waterston are utterly wasted.

I checked it out of the library for free but I am sorry I wasted my time watching it when I could have been doing other things. I was disappointed in the Kate Hudson character. She was just too quick to fall in bed with men, first with the man that worked for the Glenn Close character and secondly the man who was a relative of her sister's husband.

A formula for success, right? WRONG! Le Divorce is nothing short of a disaster.Hudson plays Isabel, a free-spirited woman who travels to Paris to visit her pregnant half-sister Roxanne, played by Watts. Roxanne is devasted at the news of her husband's affair and debates on whether or not she should file for le divorce.Hudson and Watts are joined by a superb cast which include the long absent and always beautiful Leslie Caron (Gigi), Sam Waterson, Glenn Close, Bebe Neuwirth, and Stockard Channing, to name a few. This delightful cast and the beautiful Paris locations are unfortunately the only redeeming quality in this boring and muddled film. The script is awful, the characters dull, the subplots uninvolving, and the ending extremely clumsy. It's a shame to see such a fine cast wasted. Le Divorce is le pointless.

This movie could only be loved by college freshmen who think there is some deep meaning in anything they can't understand. The only character you root for is the manic jealous husband. If he hadn't shot (whoever it is that he shoots) I would have done it for him. In fact there were several other characters I would have pointed out for execution had I been there. The French come off as nasty and money-grubbing, although they supposedly don't like to talk about money. The Americans come off as naive and victimized. Whether you are sophisticated or naive, there aren't two ounces of morality to rub together in any of these characters. Poor St. Ursula. I feel sorry for her getting dragged into this movie.

These shoplights are far better than the el cheapo lights they replaced. These lights are free from flicker and start up immediately. The T12 bulbs are very easy to install and I believe you can also use T8 bulbs. The tread pattern doesn't do anything for me as the lights hang about 15' up in my garage where you can't even see the housing. They also have a on/off pull switch but I have the lights plugged into a switchable outlet so don't need this feature. I did alot of shopping around and with in-store pick-up Kmart had the best price on these lights.

Mine started going off ALL DAY, on and off, for hours and hours and hours. I replaced the batteries, that helped the beeping BETWEEN when the alarms were going off, but not the alarms themselves. I wasn't even cooking! The heat wasn't on! there was no fire! Pushing the \\"hush\\" button only works half the time. I finally unhooked them from power AND took the batteries out. Listen to me and these other people when we say do not waste your time with these horrible machines. Absolutely absurd.

Looks like he definitely did his homework."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like to be woken up at 2 AM for no reason, buy this smoke detector.","review":"I've had 5 of these interconnected smoke alarms for a little less than 3 years. Right now it's 1:30 AM on the East Coast and me and my wife and two small children have just been awoken in the middle of the night by a false alarm for the eight or ninth time. I can only imagine how often these things fail in the daytime when we are not home. For some reason the only time they go off is when you are sleeping. I've tried everything to rectify; including lithium backup batteries ... to no avail. They are super easy to install and super easy to change the battery and super LOUD but they are all interconnected so one false alarm leads to 5 (I have 5 in my house.) blaring smoke alarms and there is no way to know which one is faulty.Do yourself a favor, select a different smoke alarm and sleep soundly at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"False alarms for no reason!","review":"I purchased two of these to replace aging alarms in my townhouse.

Replaced 5 year guaranteed batteries (Duracell Coppertop) and cleaned with vacuum per instructions for alarms in one unit to see if that was the problem, but had another false alarm two hours later (3 the night before). Do not purchase this Model and not quite sure why this averages 3 stars when over 25% of the reviews claim the same problem.

They did fit real nicely in my trash can though. For that, it earned 1 star. Another trick that you can try to silence them is to vacuum the sides.

In fact, I'd call it a slog (and I'm a readaholic who can't put down the back of a cereal box!). But, the concepts presented are worth the work. The authors explain what's so darn compelling about Apple's logo, what type of client you want to speak to, and what they need you to say to make a connection with them. Plus much, much more.So if you're trying to get a handle on branding and figure out what will work for you, grab this book. Thankfully, although it is dry as bone, it's fairly skim-friendly.

After removing the tray for one second, with an adult less than three feet away, our 8 month old leaned forward and, apparently with just the pressure from her legs and belly, released the clasp of the restraint and tumbled to the floor.

When I read them, I stayed up all night to finish each one and when they ended I said, \\"Why?\\" The author must have heard that a lot and so these books were created to fill the request for more. However when I started reading this book I said, \\" Why\\", many times, except it meant, \\"Why am I reading this?\\" I made it through the middle of the book and looked at the ending and threw it in the recycling bin.

I was totally bored and read the book through because I was hoping it would get better, then i was happy when it was over. The plot idea was great, but it was not developed well and left me wanting for something more. I was expecting Henry to be a major player like he was with Victoria, but no, he is relegated to Tony's homosexual vampire lover who helps Tony out.Disappointing. Dull.

Their daddy, musician Ike Everly, performed many years ago. But if ever their voices harmonize well, it is with those old folk tales.No other duo has ever evoked such vocal purity as the Everlys. They sound as one, even though there lies that distinction in their voices. And no performance they will ever do will compare to this reunion at Albert Hall. The two looked great! ......MzRizz"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Everly Brothers Deserve Better","review":"The Everly Brothers have been on my best-loved list since the late 50s and I thoroughly enjoyed the VHS version of their heralded Reunion Concert.

It was good seeing the Everly Brothers performing together again. They brought their tuxes. They brought their Guitars. They forgot to bring their souls. Don and Phil Everly clunked their way mechanically through all their great hits. The performance was better than simply mediocre. But the SOUL, that thing that animates a performance and brings life to it and makes it true art, was missing. I am old enough to have seen the Everly Brothers perform live and on television giving far more animated and engaged performances than their \\"Reunion Concert\\" in Royal Albert Hall.

I was blown away.Gadjo Dilo (\\"Crazy Stranger\\") refers to Romain Duris' character a Frenchman who goes to Romania to find a Gypsy singer he has a recording of. Does he find her? Well, I won't tell you, but what he does finds is the heart and the soul of the Gypsy world, the music. Meanwhile, we discover a world mostly unknown in our structured \\"West\\" - human, funny, raw, passionate.I must have taken friends to see it on 3 separate occasions when it was in the theatre when it came out a few years ago. I have the soundtrack, and now I'm buying a copy of the video for my husband who's never seen it (but who loves the CD)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gadjo Dilo- a rare gem.","review":"Like the previous reviewers, I had trouble finding this film on video, finally locating it through Foreignfilms.com's message board. The film gives us a peek into gypsy life- raw, gritty and uncompromising. It is also an achingly beautiful romance- in the true sense of the word. Coupled with the fine music score, it has a viseral quality that in the end leaves you a little giddy and grateful to people like Tony Gatlif for making movies like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mondo, It Ain't!","review":"If you were looking for something with the charm and beauty of Tony Gatlif's \\"Mondo\\", forget it. Basically, \\"The Crazy Stranger\\" is a \\"Fiddler on the Roof\\" with very crude and sexually explicit language that doesn't fit the story; cheapens and makes it crude and, seems to be interjected just to make the film stereotypically appeal to the western audience. Nobody is loveable in this film. All though it does depict modern life for gypsies in Romania, you end up very disappointed because they seem to only get abused and mistreated. What a disappointment. Obidiu Balan \\"Mondo\\" has a very small part of no consequence which is what sparkered our interest in the film to begin with. I hope his work in the upcomming film \\"Stowaways\\" will be something worth owning.Disapointing. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"French guy gets stuck in Gypsy village","review":"Having enjoyed the music and patient non-narrative pacing of Latcho Drom, my friends and I tracked down this other Gypsy-themed film by the same director, Tony Gatlif. Unfortunately this one has far less of the sublime music and tries to tell a story. A young Parisian fellow travels to Romania to find a favorite Gypsy singer of his late father's. He enters a Romany (Gypsy) village and is unable to leave, though I can't imagine why. All the residents do is complain and curse in incredibly foul expletives. Any child old enough to read should not be allowed to watch this endless barrage of foul profanity. If a child is too young to read the subtitles then it would be ok since the dialogue is in Romanes, French, and Romanian. The only redeeming feature of this film, other than the occasional musical moments, is the opportunity to view the life of an oft-ignored culture, but this film is a wholly unpleasant experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Isleys album","review":"Equally divided between funk-rock and ballads, and the funk-rock is tops: \\"Fight the Power\\" is a gritty protest; the title track has some fine heavy guitar; \\"Hope You Feel Better Love\\" mixes that guitar with funk rhythms. The ballads are a bit more problematic. Other than \\"For the Love of You\\". Anyone who thinks that song is problematic should be arrested or something, because it's just so lovely and so melodic and so sensual. Unlike \\"Sensuality\\", which trudges along for seven minutes. Not much of a song at all. And while I do like the first half of \\"Make Me Say It Again Girl\\", I don't see why the band was so eager to stretch it out to eight minutes: I love the popular radio edit, of course, but it ends up as an unimaginative repetition of the refrain. Quite tedious. Thankfully, the whole is more than the sum of its parts.

By this time the Isley's perfected that blend of soul, funk and rock. And boy did it rock!!! Between the Isley's and Parliament Funkadelic, they changed the way an \\"R&B\\" record was supposed to sound. This record was particularly smart because the first side had 3 pure smokers, then side 2 helped you cool down with 3 just as powerful ballads. To sum it up, they brought the \\"Heat\\" with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cd","review":"I have enjoyed listening to this cd, first off it was hard to find until someone told me about amazon.

It has great infomation and takes things several levels beyond previous books. Of course that is part of the problem. 3d Edition D&D is harder than 1st or Second. It will take a great deal of work to setup a campaign and be a DM/GM. The book is a great tool, but be prepared to involved much more time setting things up than you did in 1st or 2nd Edition rules."},{"rating":"2","title":"AD&D 3rd Edition","review":"This book is obviously essential for any 3rd edition DM to own. You simply cannot DM 3rd edition without it.The pictures in this book are incredible! It's probably worth getting just because it's a work of art. Aside from that, it has some cool new monsters and monster templates.However, I do think it was a mistake to remove some old monsters and replace them entirely with templates (example: vampires).All-in-all, it's a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"Okay, I've been playing AD&D and D&D since I could read. I've read every edition, and this has GOT to be the worst possible job ever.First, was it necessary to use the words \\"hideous\\", \\"cunning\\", and \\"vicious\\" in almost every entry?Second, the author (Skip Wiliams) coughed up very little new material. Most of the entries are the same creatures available in the older editions. Any DM can modify their old rules without wasting another $20.00 on this thing.If you've never played before or don't own a REAL Monster Manual or Compendium, it might be worth it. If you own the older ones, just make a few modifications and save some cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Now Know","review":"I know why the Githzeri, the Leucrotta, and all the other monsters from the old Moster Manual weren't included here: WotC decided to place only the most common, the most simple monsters here and spread the other all-stars to the Psion's Handbook, Monsters of Faerun, the upcoming Monster manual 2, and various others (the dracolich appears in Pool of Radience adventure).I'm not so obtuse as to not grasp the notion that to play d&d; you need opponents, and this is a nessesary evil. But the book's monsters are practically stat blocks with only a paragraph or two to decribe ecology, habitats, culture, motivations, etc. The whole effect is a only cosmetic difference between a goblin and a kobold. This is Cynicism at its worst: the book doesnt care about the monsters exept as punching bags and Piñatas. This is what any decent roleplayer like myself despises about these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monster Manual 3e","review":"Of all the books in D&D, I love the monster manuals the most. But unfortunatly this book is a BIG disapointment. If you compare it to the 2nd Edition Monsterous Manual the first thing you notice is size, 3e is half the size of 2e and that means half the monsters. Many of the basic monsters of D&D are missing from this book and the new beasts don't measure up to the old ones. The second thing you will notice is how easy the 2e book is to read. All the enteries are uniform, one to a page, not scattered over multiple pages as most of the 3e monsters are. Also, some of the artwork in the 3e book is just plain awful. If you are new to D&D and want some good monsters check out the Creature Collection from Swords & Sorcery Studios. The book is in 3e format, has lots of great new creatures(and new ways of using old monsters) and is professionally put together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster Manual, Frightfully Delicious","review":"This, the third incantation of the Dungeons & Dragons Monster manual continues to live up to the high-quality expectations of the dicerning players. New players and old-school hardcores will agree that the art and writing has only improved now that DnD has reached the new millenium. Definately worth having, it will make your DMing life a lot happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Excellent Book","review":"I remember when I first got the 2nd edition Monster Manual and I was in for a treat. Jump foward to today, and I got that smae feeling when I opened this one up. The artwork is great! Most of the creatures from second edition made a comeback in 3rd edition. The descriptions of the monsters are great and well defined. The only problem I have with the book is that they got rid of the ecology and habits section of each monster that told you how the monster lived and reacted to certain everyday life things. But thats a small adjustment and if anything, you can just go back and look in your 2nd edition book for that stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above Average","review":"I completely agree with the gentleman from Madison, WI. If you're going to base your purchase on these reviews, do yourself a favor and read \\"Let the Games Begin\\" by Haggarddm which you can find below. Just to sum up; You need this book if you are planning on playing 3rd ed, the format is annoying (monsters crammed in with a shoehorn), the rules are fresh, the art is the best it has ever been in a previous Monster book by at least 10-fold (muah!). But shouldn't there be rules included to convert 2nd ed monsters to the new system? (I run an Oriental campaign and I need my Kara-Tur creatures updated) Also, a blank monster template for photo-copying and creating your own monsters would have been a nice bonus. Oh well, coulda, shoulda, woulda. It's not going to change, and it's well worth more than 20 bucks so I'll stop moaning and groaning and let you get on with your purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work once again.","review":"This book offers over 500 monsters for the new D&D game. All the old standbyes are back and there are many that I had never seen before. Perhaps the most imressive of all the new books so far. AC and other factors are now catagorized by size. Allows players to for the first time play the monsters as characters. Offers new templates that allows all monsters to attain characteristics of a base monster. For instance, any monster may now be a vampire version of the base monster. The illustrations are excellent and make the monsters virtually jump off the page. Another excellent piece of work in the D&D 3rd Edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I found this item!!!!!!!","review":"I saw this item advertised in a magazine years ago in an airport and kept thinking I would find it at an accessories store or a men's clothier... no luck!

Once you raise the head rest this caddy snaps securely in place on the vertical support bars on your seat. It is immediately ready to valet your coat or jacket. I have put a couple items on it at the same time with no problem, however, the clips that secure it in place are made of a heavy plastic that could be broken if burdened with too much weight.

Nope. The film starts off with promise in that you do see Eno in his studio dicussing sounds, ideas, etc. It then begins the first in a series of increasingly irritating (in my mind) \\"landscape\\" shots with his music playing over the top. You may get a snippet of conversation here and there, but it mostly is just bad films of open highways, clouds and scenery shot from a car with his music over the top. I fell asleep the first time I watched it. I tried again the next day thinking I was just tired. Nope. It's just that dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revolutionary","review":"This film changed my whole approach to film. To me it's revolutionary. (Its best seen as a film piece rather than an exposition of the life and times of Brian Eno.) I like the fact that it has space between the dialogue with the montages of film and music. The disjunction between dialogue and imagery is provacative. I particularly like the juxtaposition of the seemingly random comments about wildlife contrasting with the technical aspects of both the commentary of Eno on his art and the way the film is edited.Like some of the other film makers I admire---Sally Potter, Jarmusch, Herzog---the style of this film allows the viewer in by creating a sense of space and wonder.I hope this comes out on DVD soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"how is this woman an author?!?","review":"I really do like the Monkees music and TV show.

There aren't too many good scary movies these days but, this is no doubt one that represents!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"I liked the cast in this movie and films like this are sometimes real guilty pleasures for me but this particular one was a real let-down. It just wasn't interesting, scary or funny. A cast like this could thrive with better material. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even worse than Halloween: H20","review":"Finally, a horror movie you can take the whole family to see. Recently, horror movies have been lacking frightful parts, but Urban Legend has just destroyed all the competition in this category. I managed to sit through this whole movie without being even remotely scared at any part.The highlights are Joshua Jackson from Dawson's Creek because he's a cool person and Rebecca Gayheart because she's hot, but aside from that there isn't really any reason to go unless you have a free pass or a hot date or something of that nature.It starts out okay, but it goes downhill from there and once you use the art of common sense elimination, it's pretty predictable for those of us with an IQ higher than Mike Tyson's.Get the wife and 2.5 kids, toss 'em in the station wagon and have a nice family outing at the movie theater. Is there a lower rating than 1 star? Abolute garbage. Can we make horror movies actually thrilling? Uhh, maybe not."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIDICULOUS !!!!","review":"GOd, what a bad \\"horror\\" movie. It has all the cliches, a ridiculous \\"climax\\", bad actors all over the place, a normal female killer that has the strength of a man - a totally deceiving ending .. Horrible. I hope they don't make a sequel to this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"This movie is terrible with a truly horrible ending. There isn't one part in the whole movie that had me scared in the least bit. Most parts are so predictible it's sickening. The acting is awful, it moves at a snail's pace, and the killer isn't believable at all. There is no way that the killer would've been able to pull off what they did. After SCREAM and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, this movie was really uncalled for. The first scene gave you hope for a half-way decent flick, but that didn't happen. If you want my advice, don't waste your time or money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as violent as I thought it would be","review":"This movie was definately not as violent as I had first thought it would be. It wasn't graphic violence that was in the film, unlike that of movies where you see them being killed up close like the 'Scream Trilogy' (although those were wicked films). I thought this movie had an excellent storyline to it that was very original. Someone killing others through the means of 'Urban Legends'. I shall not reveal who is the killer but let you see for yourself........ Don't Get Scared Now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"not being much of a fan of slasher movies i saw this at a friends house and thought that it would be a hoot to try it out........oh god!!!! big mistake.......as others have said.....mega cliched storyline and characters that seem to annoying to live(thank god that they don't).Lame acting and trash in general. don't buy it....stay away.........."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN INSULT TO THE SLASHER GENRE","review":"I thought that the scream films were a wake up call for the genre, but then along comes this complete dire rip off, that holds no promise what so ever. This is the biggest insult to the slasher genre, bad acting, bad directing, bad script, need I say more. It's films like this that give a bad name to film, it should be wiped off the planet, cause it's enough to make you physically sick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb, but has its moments","review":"Mostly, I'm just glad I didn't pay money to see this movie at the theater. That the killer based the murders on urban legends was interesting, but I didn't buy the identity of the murdering psycho. The killer would have had to move at the speed of light to get to all of the people who were killed, AND have superhuman strength. And the animal cruelty was really disturbing. And I'm not just talking about the terrier's fate. Its stupid owner pierced its nose and forced it to drink alcohol. Yeah, that's really funny. On the positive side of the movie, Robert Englund was great as a suspicious professor, and the female campus cop with delusions of grandeur provided some comic relief. Mostly though, this movie sucked. The only scary moments were in the very beginning--the gas station scene. I got a few chills from that one. Anyway, if you want to see this movie, wait until it isn't categorized as a new release and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"you must be joking?","review":"it amazes me the amount of movie lovers who think films such as this one deserve anything more than one star....honestly that whole cliched genre of Scream, I Know What you Did Last Summer, etc. are at the very lowest denominator of talent and cinema. They are the repulsive section of Hollywood that lack any emotional creativity in all its forms, and the movie going public that place Happy Gilmore and Mean Girls on their top ten list, and with IQ's less than 20, are the ones who make films like these gross the amount of money they do.There is NOTHING, mediocre, or even 'fair' about Urban Legend. It sinks beneath the yoke and is one of the worst films ever created. Pure excrement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scream again","review":"This movie was so un-scary that the only reason it is a 'horror' film is the dishonor it gave to the name Jamie Blanks.

A few tense moments don't make up for some of the worst writing and acting I've ever seen. Question: Why did so many people happen to A.) Own the same coat and B.) wear it with the hood up in hot weather? That's just dumb. And what's the deal with Gayheart's \\"psycho\\" acting all of a sudden at the end? Sure, the character was \\"psycho\\", but a piece of dancing feces could have done a less unintentionally-funny job. Don't waste your time on this garbage. Go rent the best: Scream.

If you can find copies of some of her more obscure works, such as Fun and especially Hotel Room, I strongly encourage you to check them out. However, she displays absolutely none of her huge talent in this predictable mess of a horror movie. Nobody else does, either. When Robert Englund turns in the best performance in a movie, in what was basically a joke cameo, what does that say? The direction was big on fake scares and people jumping out of the dark while the music blasts, and short on suspense or ingenuity. The killer's identity and motive is ridiculous beyond words. The plot holes are legion; over and over again, things happen which simply can't occur in real life (like covering up all those murders). All we're left with is just another Scream clone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello! Pretty people, who can't act, having a bit of fun...","review":"Hello!!!

It is kind of similar to Scream 2. But I'm not sure if I have ever seen such a good opening scene (Except for maybe in Scream). It was awesome!

If you like horror movies you should definitely see it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cable viewing only","review":"While not flat-out 'bad', Urban Legend really ammounts to nothing more then an untimately unfulfilling 'Scream' clone. It has it's moments, there are scenes where UL is at least trying to be clever.

It was interesting how it had a twist at the end and how you had to keep on guessing who used the Urban Legends as a way to murder people.

It is somehow different from Scream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Scream clone","review":"A group of young college students get stalked by a killer obessed with making urban legends reality.

A mystery story requires continuity and hints that allow the viewer to accurately discover the villain. This movie has no such continuity and one guess is as good as the next. The true killer is an impossibility. We are expected to believe that a 5'2\\" tall 95 pound woman can physically overpower all these victims? Sheesh!This movie continues the 'tradition' of Scream. Cobble together a crazy-quilt 'plot' where there are no real clues to solve the question and pretend that it's a mystery.Still, it's better than the Fridaythe13th type of movies. give it two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than SCREAM!!","review":"Urban Legend was a movie I had been dying to see for a long time - and when I finally saw it - I wasn't disappointed. The killer was thrilling, the storyline was great, babes in heaven and much more thrilling than HALLOWEEN! Anyway the story goes like this - when Damon Brooks (Joshua Jackson) is killed in the forest with his un-killed friend Natalie (Alicia Witt) all hell breaks lose as there is now a killer on campus - mainly after Natalie and all the reast of the babes on this movie. This horror is recommeneded to all you people who rule!!

Maybe even the top 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly and \\"overpredictable\\"","review":"Sill, silly movie. Which would be fun if it weren't so predictable. I knew the killer less than FIFTEEN MINUTES after the opening, and this is one of those films where you're supposed to learn who the killer is only in the very end. Even Robert Englund cannot save this movie with others acting so bad. And speaking of bad actors: who is that character killed in the very beginning, the one driving the car in the rain? She has to be the worst \\"actress\\" I have ever seen. She can't do ANYTHING, she can't speak, she can't sing, she can't walk, and she most certainly couldn't act even if she took 1000 acting classes. If you think you've seen a bad, wooden actress, take a look at this one... Apart from the quite good, ambient score, there is one good thing about this movie (probably especially for a non-American viewer :) - you learn a good deal about nice urban legends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Urban legend","review":"Plain and simple: I liked the movie. Making the urban legends come to life, using them as ways to off people was interesting. I like the twist at the end and the acting was good enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely and totally mediocre in every sense of the word.","review":"The string of teen horror flicks was revived with the wonderful Scream. It was then followed up with I Know What You Did Last Summer. Then along comes Urban Legend. This film takes everything you learned from Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, and turns it into the completely predictable piece of film trash. You can figure out who the villain is, who he/she will kill and even how they are gonna bite it. The film is okay to watch if you are a fan of horror, but do not expect Halloween standards. The only thing good about this film were that a few of the scenes were inventive, but still predictable. Don't see this film, watch Scream instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd BEST MOVIE EVER","review":"This was probally the 2nd best movie ive seen. The acting was great and Josh Jackson was hotter than ever. This is a must see movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey yall, I think Urban Legend was DA BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Urban Legend was a REALLY kewl movie. I wasn't really into horror movies before, so I was really freaking out when it first started. But after that, i was just really REALLY scared. But don't think that that is a bad thing, because if I was freaking out the whole time I wouldn't have been able to enjoy the movie. It is so much more fun if you watch it with others though. Urban Legend is worth every penny. You gotta see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great opening, goes downhill afterward.","review":"Alicia Witt is a college student investigating murders that seem to be based on urban legends. Interesting premise begins very well, with a tense opening sequence that actually provides some good chills, but goes downhill with repetitive stupidity, annoying characters, and the revelation of the killer and his/her motives is ludicrously bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripoff!","review":"I thought this movie would be awesome because I knew all those scary stories, and loved them. Unfortunately, Urban Legend's writer doesn't know the meaning of the word \\"originality.\\" This movie copied off of Scream. At the frat party, the character, Parker, gets a call from the killer on the phone. Of course, the killer is using a voice changer, just like in Scream. Did the writer actually think people would find that scary or original? I think he was too wrapped up in being on the horror bandwagon that he failed to come up with something original."},{"rating":"2","title":"urban legend is flooded with excellent actors","review":"urban legend has an all-star cast. it consists of non-mediochre portrayals by the young but talented cast. for instance joshua jackson's portryal of damon brooks was award winning and clever. the pop rocks and soda scene displayed his high acting capabilites. it also included veterens of the horror genre. to name just a few; robert englund, and tara reid. robert englund graced us with another excellent performance in a horror flick. in case you didn't know he played freddie kreuger in all of the nightmare on elm streets. tara reid who starred in halloween made a come back as the radio show host. jamie blanks the director, wooed audiences with his high calaber directing capabilities. jamie who won an award for his documentary did not suprise us with this film. i thought urban legend is the best horror flick of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best horror flicks!!!","review":"Urban Legand was a great movie. It wasn't like \\"Scream\\" or \\"I know what you did last summer\\" no, it was different. I am a horror nerd and when I say it was scary, It was scary. Hardly anything scares me but this, .. It gave me chils! Yes it had the same plot and all but it was more suspensful. I had no idea the killer was the killer. It's not actually the swearing that makes the movie \\"R\\" its the killing and the action. You have to see this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"CAN YOU SAY\\" TAKE A HIKE \\"SCREAM\\" URBAN LEGEND IS HERE TO","review":"I THOUGHT URBAN LEGEND WAS WAY BETTER THAN SCREAM (EVEN THOUGH I STILL ENJOYED IT). THIS MOVIE WAS A GREAT IDEA,A GREAT MOVIE,GREAT CAST, AND THEIR WASN'T ALOT OF SWEARING (AT LEAST IF THEIR IS YOU CANT TELL BECAUSE YOUR TO INTO THE MOVIE) AND THE ENDING IS A BIG SURPRISE THAT IS VERY SUSPENSFUL. YOU JUST GOTTA CHECK IT OUT... IT'S JUST NEAT WATCHING ALL THE DIFFERENT KILLINGS AND THE BEGINNING IS REALLY COOL AND IS PLAYED VERY WELL BY NATASHA GREGSON WAGNER AND INCLUDES A GREAT 80'S SONG. EVEN THE SOUNDTRACK LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD BE A GOOD ONE TO HAVE. WAY BETTER OPENING SCENE THAN SCREAM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome.","review":"This was a really great movie. The plot twists and turns into a chilling climax and an interesting turn in the end. The only problem with this movie is that the star has a type of \\"cardboard\\" acting. I feel that part should have had somebody more experienced in acting, such as: Neve Cambelle, Jenifer Love Hewitt, or Sarah Michelle Gellar. But other than that, this movie delivers. But don't worry, nothing will happen if you eat both pop rocks and soda at the same time. That is just and urban legend. Another thing I liked about this movie was the originallity. I mean, an eskimo suit wearing killer killing people using urban legends, now that's original. This movie can be compared to the great movies such as Scream Scream 2, and Halloween H:20. I hope you buy this movie and watch it a lot, I know I did!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, the STUPIDITY of it all!","review":"Okay, okay, I give up! The sound that you are now hearing is me throwing out my hopes for the future of the horror film. Once a place where talented individuals like John Carpenter, George Romero, and Don Coscarelli(to name but a few)could tingle our spines and stimulate our minds, the horror genre has become a veritable wasteland of loathsome, brainless junk. Case in point, Urban Legend, a movie so bad that it actually hurts. Who thought that we needed another goofy Scream rip-off? More hip references? Why not? Another ridiculous resolution to a mystery? Sure!! One more hip soundtrack of audio sludge? Bring it on! In our pursuit of dumbing down our youth, we have inadvertantly lobotomized ourselves to the point that we no longer know how to do anything but copy the latest blockbuster. It's sad. Horror is dying.. and we are holding the smoking gun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Puh-leez","review":"Don't waste your time with this stupid little flick.

What a terrible film with a flimsy premise! The only kind of bright spot was seeing Freddy Krueger veteran, Robert Englund in the film. And then they killed him! Lousy acting and not at all believable villian. Scream, while meant to be tongue-in-cheek anyway, was much more fun than this quickly processed garbage! Go and watch Halloween or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre if you want to have a good fright. The only thing scary about this was everything that wasn't intended to be: script, plot, acting, direction, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"(I can't find the other half) The next best SCREAM","review":"A group of college students infatuated with urban legends are knocked off one by one by a psychopathic serial killer imitating the myths.

Much better than the Scream and I know series."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty bad","review":"This movie had some pretty good scares, and some good laughs.

You don't really see that much gore. I'am a scary movie fan. I also like comedy and action but I like horror the best because it gets to you when you don't no it. Teri Reid did a super job in this. Horror fans out there I have one thing to say and that is , RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE"},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time!","review":"A bunch of readers nailed it right on the head. This Saturday afternoon tv matinee romp reeks of Scooby-doo chararcters and story lines. Rebecca-duh-Gayheart needs acting classes way bad, ten year's worth. Only then would she barely qualify for squeeze-the-Charmin- commercials. This is not horror, but a lame excuse for a slasher movie trying hard at times to be funny. Nothing works for this waste of celluloid except the intro scene with Brad Dourif (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) as the gas station attendant. After that, turn your set off and watch something else. This movie is so bad, Burt Reynolds collects royalties."},{"rating":"1","title":"yet another teen scooby doo guess the killer flick","review":"The film started off looking ok, but straight away showed off some of the worst acting i have ever seen. Then slowly degressed into yet another film set in a university campus, about a string of vaguely related murders. Which of course inevitabley turns into a \\"can you guess who did??\\" scenario which is fine for the small minded. but if you really like to think about the films, not just select then endin from a few annoying university students, then steer clear. too sum it up its for the spoon fed with bad taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Where's that FSTFWD button?\\"","review":"Do you like fast-forwarding movies?

What starts off as an intriguing premise to a movie (pop rocks and soda: a deadly combination, looking in the mirror and saying \\"bloody mary\\" over and over) these are all things I grew up hearing as a kid, so the fascination was there! And when I heard they were centering a horror movie around this plot of plots I thought cool! This is gonna make an awesome movie! Well sheesh! Boy was I wrong!Like this and all it's pseudo predessors, once again they screw up a potentially horrific horror flick! They just don't know how to make grotesque horror movies anymore!

The overall idea of an urban legend killer was interesting and I give the creators that much, but the movie was just boring and dumb. I didn't listen to the reviews and gave it a chance, big mistake. This movie was made for money and you can see that through all the crappy one-liners and words that no one even uses. I do have a question though, wasn't there a time when movie making was considered a form of artwork?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay sometimes but also stupid","review":"The movie was alright at times but other times totally unreal. Like the part when he e-mails her from the same room how stupid i doubt a killer is walking aroud with a lap-top. And the part with the dog is just nasty and wrong.

The cards are hard to read with their small print for older eyes even though we play with regular not large size decks.

Reading these stories at the same time as the first volume of Theodore Sturgeon's complete short stories constantly had me drawing comparisons between the two writers. Wodehouse never wrote fantasy *per se* (that is, Bertie Wooster never encountered a genie or a god in his garden), but in truth his stories were always fantastical. As commentators have said, the idyllic world of young men in spats and authoritative aunts was a figment of Wodehouse's imagination, and never existed at any time in England. I don't think Wodehouse would have disagreed; he knew the power of fantasy. In this volume, he tells one story (\\"The Mixer\\") from the point of view of a dog, and one of his habits was to read the entire Shakespeare's collected works every year, and Willy wasn't a stranger to fantasy, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light, Fun Reading","review":"Man with two left feet is a delightful book.

The film exceeded my expectations. The story of an introverted girl who mimics famous vocalists and her boozy loud and obnoxious Mom is incredibly well written and the actors in the film version are all terrific. This is a sad tale of desperation and family strife with some elements of dark comedy provided by Caine and the small time show biz type he represents. The surprise is the musical performance of Jane Horracks in the title role. She is fantastic. If I had to say which was better the film or stage version- I'm not sure I could pick.

The acting is fabulous (was the Academy asleep when this movie came out?...where are all the awards! ), and the story is interesting (despite what I think is one very minor flaw in the story). But what really blew me away is the accurate dead-on portrayal of what sloth, greed and selfishness do to people. What a revealing and interesting picture of human nature! You can't help but feel sorry for LV when you see what surrounds her. It's well worth renting, and definitely worth buying. This one's a keeper that you'll enjoy owning.

He creates a cadre of complex and compelling characters, then breathes life into them with lots of action, surprising plot twists and a spellbinding story.

An alternative history with both East & West Rome still existing in the 7th century AD, with foederati states on the edges and an ancient foe - Persia - in the east: it looked good. I didn't exactly expect a masterpiece like Turtledove's \\"Agent of Byzantium\\" but neither was I prepared for a non-story. The book lacks a coherent storyline, credible characters who act instead of brooding over a fire, and - worst! - any explanation how this alternative to the actual history came into being. So in one word, this book is a disappointment - and a waste of time! Since it's the start of a series,if the writing in the following books doesn't improve dramatically they should be better avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise - Fails in execution","review":"As an avid reader of alternate history (especially recent novels of S.M.Stirling) and a Roman History buff, I bought this book on impulse after reading the flyleaf notes and anticipated a great few days of reading. Unfortunately, the book reminds me of a role playing game where the events and characters are created by a random number generator. The motivation of the characters, especially Maxian, is murky at best. Also, there was not enough description of how the empire in its 600CE form had come about and how it changed in organization and bureaucracy. I was disappointed. A somewhat similar set of books but, in my opinion, a more successful one, was the 'Krispos of Videssos' series by Harry Turtledove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont believe the five star reviews, they must be family","review":"Poor characters, weak relations, unbelievable plot.

Must be family of the author.HA"},{"rating":"1","title":"A mismatch of fantasy and history","review":"This book shows a promising recommendation, but it didnt match at all its expectations. First, it is a book one of many. This should be made very clear before you order it. Others like myself are not fond of those series, especialy when you buy a book one without knowing that it is the first of a serie. Needless to say that this book doesn't end at the last page. second, the book consists of various story lines, whose are by itself mini-stories, and all well writen. But they don't mix of interfere (at least not in this book) and one of the stories (the one of the magician-healer fits beter in a horror book (diggin up the death and giving them life back using blood) This has nothing to do with SF ! The other stories are placed in the history. So, if you want to read SF, skip this book. As a historical/fantasy roman this book would probably score more then the single point it earns from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopefully this guy will only get better!","review":"I've always been a fan of alternate history novels, so I picked this one up, hoping it wouldn't be just another Classical Age thud-and-blunder what-if. I'm glad to say that I wasn't disappointed! It took only a couple of chapters for me to be firmly hooked, and I generally don't take to first novels that well. The characters are more than simple cyphers, and the plot is compelling--a combination of history, mystery and ghost story that will keep me waiting for the next book in the series.

They have an equally rootsy sound but are more representative of the Havana style of rumba which is a little more suave but no less rhythmically complex.This album is (as the liner notes say) the first authorized recording of the group, and it's a gem. Each track sparkles with virtuosity. My personal favorites would be tracks 3, 4 and of course the classic Que Viva Chango (the first commercially-recorded song which made explicit reference to the orishas).Part of the group's appeal is the way in which they fuse together elements of different rhythms. Tawiri (track 4) for instance is a blistering fusion of palo and guaguanco, while Ve y Dile a Tu Mamita (track 3) juxtaposes a son clave pattern over a fat (and phat) yambu. The vocal work as always provides yet more layers of complexity such that this album is a joy to listen to from end to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"best wath for Heart Rate","review":"Is an accessory that despite being very elegant, can be used for sports such as diving, climbing, cycling, in addition to a great extreme Durability and low temperatures and high pressures, is able to shine at night neatly ."},{"rating":"2","title":"The display is too dark!","review":"I ordered this and ended up returning it because the display seemed very dark!

Because of the lower price, I chose this 4 pack of Norpro spoons and found them to be just what I needed and even better than I expected.They have a simple, sleek design that is comfortable and easy to hold - they're a nice weight. They do their job freeing the grapefruit sections from the peel easily, and aren't going to hurt your lips unless you're being careless. And the spoon bowl is a good size for scooping bite-sized portions, unlike more narrow styles. They look nice and blend with my other flatware.

I thought the book was pretty basic when I first looked at it. Then I took it to him and he showed me how to use it. He had me play the ride cymbal on 8 notes so that I could keep the high hat going on the quarter notes with my left foot, while still playing bass and snare drum where indicated in the book. Then he had me play all 16th notes on the high hat, bringing down either the left or right hand on the snare where the book indicates a snare drum note, and of course playing bass drum where indicated. This makes the book so much more challenging and so much more fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent title but...","review":"This is NOT for rank beginners by any stretch. The majority of the book provides a number of two bar rhythms to practice along with 8th and 16th note hi-hats. Almost all of the beats require a good 16th note ability on bass and snare drum and if you haven't got this down yet, this is the wrong book for you.While I definitely recommend this book as an excellent volume, I suggest Jim Payne's Funk Drumming book as a precursor. It will take you to where this book really begins.Also, this volume is NOT set up anything like Pickering's Studio Jazz book (which I also own and highly endorse).

What are you doing here?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst \\"professional\\" movie we have ever seen!!","review":"My wife and I watched this together one evening and found ourselves laughing at how bad it was from top to bottom.The worst acting, writing, and cinematography in a film made by professionals that we have ever seen!! There MAY be worse b-movies or low grade independents than this, sure,but in the 10 years we've been watching films together we haven't seen one that rivals this for all around bad and we have seen a LOT of films. Still most reviewers at this site love this film, so tastes are very different. It is suspicious though, that at one site I check which has reviews of most everything the last several years that has been released on video, this film is absent. I think I know why!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing!","review":"I love Stephen Dillane which is why I picked this movie. His performance was very good but the overall movie was weird and jerky. The \\"no script\\" thing shows how important a script is. I hope the director bagged that idea after this movie. It is painfully apparent when Stephen Dillanes character runs into Victoria Foyt's character at the house in London, she just keeps saying \\"what are you doing here?\\" and Dillane doesn't respond. The bedtime conversations between the old couple that owns the house are just plain weird and completely irrelevant. I agree with the other reviewer that Victoria Foyt's character comes off incredibly whiney! The other story lines - Vanessa Redgraves - would have meaning if they were in turn experiencing some sort of Deja Vu but they don't. I would pass on this movie, this director and certainly Victoria Foyt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deja Vu","review":"Waited a year for this great movie to come out in DVD letterbox (widescreen)...what happened?

I'm sure the director/producer knows what I'm talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story line, poor acting.","review":"This could have been major hit, the acting was dry and the scenery was drab. The story line was so loving that it is still worth watching if you are a romantic person. Wish this could be redone with more warmth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"great premise, not so great execution","review":"For lovers of romantic films, the idea sounds great: A mysterious woman gives another woman a brooch that will lead the recipient to her future true love, a true love that will reignite a flame of love and passion that was first ignited a generation before. Unfortunately, (although typical for a Jaglom film) much of the movie is given to meaningful babble that in this film serves only to draw out the ultimate conclusion, a conclusion that could have come a lot earlier, or at least with more imagination. It doesn't help that Victoria Foyt, while a dream to watch and fantasize about, begins to truly annoy with her whiny interpretation of the female lead. It would be nice if the film were shelved and the sound track were released; the soundtrack being a wonderful compilation of truly inspired, vintage romantic music, and well performed at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only One Good Thing About It","review":"Two questions: Why has Stephen Dillane done so few films? and Why did he choose to contribute his significant talent, charisma and appeal to this dog? I rented it to see his performance, which even in an abyss of bad writing such as this, was very good. But the rest... ugh. The lead female actress has SO little to recommend her. The dialogue was painful. The score was drippy. Even the scenery was rendered bland by the company it kept in thei film.Please, Stephen Dillane: Do not cast your pearls before swine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving and powerful movie that makes you think","review":"I really loved this movie! I liked the way the story unfoldeed, the brilliant dialogue, and the acting. Stephen Dillane and Vanessa Redgrave are particularly powerful. Dillane is an actor who always seems to hit the right notes, and he brings emotional depth and sex appeal to every role he takes--I wish he'd do more films!This movie will bring out the romantic in everyone and also give you a few philosophical moments. Thoroughly enjoyable and meaningful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than it could have been.","review":"After the terrific reviews, I had expected better.The Idea is indeed a good one, but the lead actress is... awfull (I'm sorry to say it, but there it is.) She is whiny, complaining, selfish, and just generally irritating.While watching the movie, I just kept wondering why any of these people would want to spent time with her, let alone, seek her out or leave their wife for her.To say something good about the film, the filming locations (Paris, Cliffs of Dover, etc.) were excellent and beautiful. And the rest of the cast could act and was wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DeJa Vu hit home","review":"I rented DeJa Vu and Cassablanca both on the same weekend. I had never seen either movie and was so shocked to see the similarities. I was in tears with both movies and felt that the director of DeJa Vu should have chosen a younger sexier actress than Victoria Foyt. I thought she had too many temper tantrums and could of portrayed more passion. I would of liked to have seen more of the love scenes also...I felt the house party scene was very good. It had me on the edge of my seat and I felt like I was right there in the room with the actors. I really enjoyed the line that went something like.... \\"An Illusion is really the feeling of something good coming close\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary!","review":"I'll join the chorus of praise for this unique and lovely film. I will echo an earlier comment by a reviewer who stated he or she had been looking for this film for a long time. Indeed confirms what I have believed about love for so long. Watching this film was an emotional catharsis for me. Not in a long long time have I been so emotionally involved in a film from beginning to end. The acting, directing, SCENERY!-everything works like a charm. If you're a romantic like me this is the film for you. You'll be watching it over and over again for years to come.

The music and scenery greatly add to the film as well as the wonderful cast of actors. There's something about this film that is more than just another romantic story. There's something compelling about it, a film to be seen more than once. If you enjoy escaping into a story and are willing to toss a little realism out the window you may also become a fan of this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The very best that Jaglom has yet created!","review":"I caught this film recently on \\"WE\\" cable network and was glued to the tv and completely drawn into Deja Vu's world - I felt as if I were living Dana and Sean's story. I have seen several of Mr. Jaglom's films but this is absolutely the best he has ever created. Vicoria Foyt and Stephen Dillane were so wonderful and believable (the whole supporting cast was so perfect especially Vanessa Redgrave) I must agree with so many of the reviewers who stated that this movie has now replaced Casablanca for them. Ditto for me! This movie has something to teach us all about settling for less than true bliss. Then again, I believe that very few of us ever meet our true love/soul mate. But the whole premise (of true love, serendipity, fate, the choices we make, the consequences we must live with) was beautifully and hauntingly handled in this film. Thank you Mr. Jaglom, for a new classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"I found it!","review":"I saw this movie in a small theater last year and fell in love with it. I came back with a friend and saw it again on the same day. Every time I've gone in to the video store I've looked for it and was so thrilled and shocked to finally see it on the shelf today that I pushed two people out of the way to grab the last copy! Why do I love it? It touched my soul. I felt connected to the characters and the emotions and the settings. This is pure romance without the hollywood gloss (or the high budget!)

I enjoyed watching the three films, but have to admit that the books are much better. All three movies have the same character, a racing detective.

She watched part of the set up this time, and I've let her know I will do it once more, and will help her once after that -- then I'm done with set-up duty. She's been weaving for about an hour, and has about 9 inches of cloth, I think. Also check out backstrap looms. I set up my 4 3/4 year old with an off-the-cuff one out of posterboard since she was interested in the other loom. She's off and running.

Based on a British novel by Joseph Connolly following various middle class characters (upwardly and downwardly mobile) on a holiday that takes in various affairs, jealousies and suicide attempts, it's a light confection that works surprisingly well, not least because people DON'T do the right thing (when estate agent Jacques Dutronc finds out an employee has reduced the price on a desperately short of cash friend's house for a backhander, he does nothing to rectify the situation). Much of what happens is fairly predictable, with the exception of Charlotte Rampling keeping her clothes on for once, but the performances are strong and Michel Blanc's direction keeps it all on track. Nothing profound, but surprisingly likeable.Extras are fairly light - just a trailer and a photo montage with an audio essay by the director."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Headset!","review":"The main reason I bought this was for the headset and when I opened the package, it was the wrong one.

It starts out promisingly with an intriguing conspiracy plot, but director Alan J. Pakula is simply a lousy storyteller. His sense of pacing is terrible--scenes go on for far too long, often while we don't really understand what is happening in them, and then cut abruptly to something new. Parts of the film that are intended to be suspenseful register as dull and confusing. This does have its compensations; Pakula and the great DP Gordon Willis create some striking visual compositions, Warren Beatty does a nice job with his underwritten role, and the famous brainwashing montage is terrific. But the story is too incoherent to deliver the goods as a thriller, and the movie never recovers from Pakula's narrative indifference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riveting scenes of an escalator going up and down","review":"I have read other reviews of this movie and clearly I am the slow kid in the class because I was unable to discern just exactly what this film was about.

And they used so much film to accomplish this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RELAX WITH PARALLAX ?","review":"Another all but forgotten hit of the 1970's, beautifully photographed with a mature (but fantastic) script. Maverick reporter Beatty,along with hundreds of others,witnessed an assassination of a U.S. Senator 3 years earlier. Despite Official U.S. investigations to the contrary, people who were present at the shooting are dying pell-mell, and Beatty's out to investigate Parallax, much to the chagrin of his boss, Cronyn. Beatty is convinced that this organization trains \\"hit-men\\" to carry out \\"big-wig\\" murders,then covers them up with more murders.A movie not for ths faint of heart, it's also an indictment of pro- forma investigations that fail in their duty, and waste huge amounts of taxpayer money as well.By all means, see this movie which is really timeless in nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spare, dreamlike thriller","review":"\\"The Parallax View\\" is a taut thriller about a reporter Joseph Frady (played by Warren Beatty) investigating a political assassination.The film is strikingly shot - harsh lighting and sound, and harsh surfaces are used to highlight the increasing harshness of the story. The film almost takes on a dreamlike quality - and indeed given Frady's unbalanced past you could consider the film as a figment of his paranoic imagination.Director Alan J. Pakula would reuse many of the techniques in his next (non-fictional) political film \\"All the President's Men\\".This film certainly needs to be appreciated in its original 2.35:1 format as presented in this DVD. Sadly there are no extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling","review":"After watching a week of the History Channel's \\"The Men Who Killed Kennedy,\\" someone recommended watching this movie. I tracked it down with the help of Amazon.com. Produced only ten years after, it splendidly parallels the JFK assassination. It was highly insightful, given the time it was produced. The story line is believable, the acting is superb, and although dated, sends a powerful message. Thanks, Warren, for having the courage to be who you are!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated and dull","review":"The Bottom Line:I imagine that when The Parallax View was released the post-Watergate sense of paranoia obscured the film's many flaws, but viewed today it's a boring thriller with a dull Beatty in the lead that's chockablock with plot holes and contrivances leading up to an ending that's supposed to be poignant but comes across as ludicrous; skip this dated thriller and watch The Manchurian Candidate instead.2/4"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple? Yet Effective.","review":"'The Parallax View,' boasts a quality absent in most conspiracy thrillers -- The ability to stand as a compelling film, without relying on complicated plot devices, and distracting production features. Warren Beatty, and his supporting cast, perform well, with enough subtlety to be convincing as everyday people. Alan Pakula, the director, does an excellent job of letting the story tell itself. Much like 'The Conversation,' the protagonist, here, is a victim of fate. Once involved, there's no way out. This develops the conspiracy as a character in its self; an effective one at that. This underrated gem deserves a look. Pay attention to the obvious references to the JFK Assassination, and how this film reflects on the paranoia of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best political thrillers","review":"The idea of corporations brainwashing people into assassins is a creepy one. Watch this movie and you will believe it could happen. Warren Beatty stars in this movie as a reporter who is investigating the convenient deaths of other reporters present at a Senator's death. Twists and turns abound and at the end you are left thinking of the Warren Commission and all the other assassinations of the 1960's.

The kit isn't very expensive and so there is good value here. Some caveats - trees and mountains do interfere with signal. It works just fine in the city of Seattle area. Also, using the cassette deck adaptor, be sure to use the control on the separate receiver module to reduce the output (it's in the XM menu) else it overpowers the cassette function very easily. I've got it on one bar, would like to go lower. Lastly, it's kind of hard to hide for antitheft purposes and the vent mount system allows it to slip a bit.

The reason for this is simple: the movie was pieced together from four one-hour OAV episodes!

While it's fun to look at, there is too much taken out of the original series. Yes, it still makes sense for the most part, but the relationship building between Naomi and Ross is not as strong, Jean Claude's motives don't seem to make as much sense, and the true bitterness Ross feels about robots isn't as telling in this film.My biggest grlpe is the voice actors. Elizabeth Berkeley and Keifer Sutherland give the most deadpan and lifeless performances that it really sucks the magic out of the characters.The OVA is far superior to this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the dough","review":"In this anime, people just have a problem getting along with the semi-humans (called thirds) they create. Armitage, a third herself, is a bounty hunter after a psycho bent on murdering the thirds. So begins the struggle against human and third, and of course, there's the classic and generic \\"I wonder what it's like to be human....\\" internal struggle. The story starts off promisingly, but it eventually lags to the point where I was left uninterested as to what would happen next. It tends to jump around a bit, though this movie supposedly smoothens out the gaps from the OAV series. The dubbing is above average though, as it seems there were some high-profile talents hired for the voice-overs. It's surprisingly lacking in action and doesn't have much of a soundtrack to intensify anything. I'd recommend seeing it if you're a fan of cyborg-ish anime, a la Ghost in the Shell, but otherwise, I wouldn't recommend buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A staple Anime!","review":"there isn't much i can say about this movie except it was outstanding!

The villan was greatly developed and wasn't just the typical \\"i want to rule the world\\" bad guy. And you never have to wait for good action scenes. however, I wouldn't reccomend this flim to people just getting into anime (quite a bit of nudity and very graphic violence). This movie is a must have for any serious anime collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Action Packed Anime!","review":"Armatige III is an anime that should have turned into bottom of the bin anime but instead it becomes what most animes never become, outstanding! With high energy action seqeunces laced through a indepth and compelling story Armatige III is a rollercoster thrill ride that you will not want to stop. Set in far future on a Mars colony, Ross is a cool level headed cop. His new partner is a trigger happy 19 old named Armatige. Together the two travel the streets in search of a vicious serial killer whose victims a female thirds, thirds are robots that have been programed to act human. While Armatige III is reminisent of the clasic film noir \\"Blade Runner\\" the stroy also runs on it's own origanality as well. The voice are outstanding and the animation is quite good, as well as the techno styled musical score. Armatige III is perfect for both action fans as well as sci-fi fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Armitage III IS THE BEST ONE OUT THERE!","review":"I've been hooked on Naomi Armitage ever since I saw Poly-Matrix on Sci-Fi a few years ago. I quickly went out and bought the movie. The story is excellent, including the best anime soundtrack ever created. It is very easy to become attached to Armitage as you watch the movie, and you begin to feel for her. Kudos to Hyroyuki Ochi on this film. If you like anime, or even if you don't know much about it, see this movie, I guarantee you will love it! With the realease of the sequel, Armitage: Dual Matrix, I went nuts. Of course I didn't buy the double set, but I grabbed the Lunchbox set instead, since I have the original version of the McFarlane figure. Let me not that Poly-Matrix started as a 4-part series, and was broken down to make the movie. I recommend buying the 4 part series as well, that way you'll get the hour missing from Poly-Matrix. I fell in love with Armitage III, and you will too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye candy, but nothing more...","review":"While I can see what the writer(s) were trying to go for with this film, I can also see that they did not even come near to achieving it. First, the storyline is nearly incoherent, jumping around far too quickly. Also, the characters are not particularly well developed. They are simply unable to express any subtlety of emotion, the only anything is ever developed is by blatent, and boring, statement of fact. In my opinion, this film's only saving grace its its artful directing and style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I really don't understand how this movie could gather so many positive reviews. The movie has story-potential but gives it all away by telling it in an extremely boring and sometimes a bit confused way. Next point would be the animation itself. Absolutely nothing special, but that's alright. The characters: I never found a protagonist in a movie as unpleasant as Armitage. She's just annoying. The dubbing wasn't helpful at that point. Oh and by the way: The dialogs are REALLY BAD, especially in this 'love scene' when I didn't know if I should laugh or throw over. The only cool thing about it was the city most of the story took place in. Very cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAHAHA!!!","review":"I like anime, I think. Quite a bit. And this, I have to say, was just about the worst one I've ever seen. The story itself is fairly ludicrous, with more than a bit of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (that's Blade Runner to you uncultured savages) influence, but much worse. The best bits are the voice acting and the script, however. Ordinarily I can't stand dubbed anime, but here the dubbing really helped, taking a film that would ordinarily just have been insipid and boring, and turning it into a film that was utterly, if unintentionally, hilarious. The acting was bad...very, very bad--not that the \\"actors\\" exactly had the best material to work with. I'm utterly astounded by all the high ratings. Apparently, this is the only anime many people have seen. Priceless, in a manner of speaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"Why did they do this? Armitage III the series was a 4 part classic, relatively low-key, release from Pioneer. Featuring one 50-minute episode and 3 thirty minute episodes it told the story of Armitage, a robot trying to help other Third types in a future Mars colony. But, the series was hacked up and assembled into this shambles of a movie featuring dire voice-overs by Kiether Sutherland (who is a good actor) and Elizabeth Berkley (who is not). Neither actor or actress seemed to give much of an effort and the original series, with it's increased length and full scenes and low-key voice actors give Armitage a much better run.Alas, it is virtually impossible to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This -- Get The OAV","review":"There are tons of great reviews for this movie. That's understandable if none of them have seen the original OAV series this came from. See, back in 1994-1995, a 4-part OAV series called \\"Armitage III\\" came out in Japan. \\"Poly-Matrix\\" takes that 140-minute series and hacks it down to ~90-minutes. Thus this 1997 dub-title is born. So a lot of the story gets cut and things aren't nearly as good as the original. If you've seen the original, you'll be annoyed at all of the cuts and poor edit choices.As to the dub cast (there is no Japanese cast on a dub-title as they simply re-edit an original Japanese product for American consumption), having big stars lend their voices makes it a better dub than a lot of anime titles/series. But it doesn't make up for the complete and utter hack job the series was given to form this movie.Bottom line: If you thought this was good, the OAV is tons better. If you haven't seen this, get the OAV instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action Packed Animation At It's Best","review":"If you like Japanese animation that is fast paced, but still easy to follow this is one of the best out there. This movie is easier to follow than THE GHOST IN THE SHELL and better suited for younger viewers ages 13 to 18, but still interesting for older viewers like myself, 39 years old. So if you want a good movie that takes place in the not to distant future in realistic surroundings this is a must addition to your animation library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful, Breathtaking, Thought-provoking Film!","review":"This film is created from the Armitage III OAV series, and the cuts are occasionally apparent, but only to the highly-attentive eye. There is so much happening visually and aurally, with narrative conflicts and twists, plus changing political tides and intense philosophical issues - all of which truly tax the mind in a great way. The only drawbacks to the DVD version of the film are: 1.) the lack of a Japanese-language version, and 2.) the corny sounds attached to virtually all menu selections. However, once the film begins, the experience will leave any spectator in extreme awe of the power of (Japanese) animation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A anime Classic","review":"Arimtage III is a truly great anime OVA. Sadly it came out about the same time as the original GHOST IN THE SHELL, and was overlooked for the overrated Ghost in the Shell movie. The story is far better, truly delving into whether machines are alive or not and could they be considered human, along with many other questions. Can they fall in love, or even have children. Then there are the two main characters, Naomi Armitage and Ross Sylibus. They add depth and bring life to the story. The action is great keeping you watching even in the quiet times of the anime. The animation isn't as great as it was after all it's been 13 years since it first came out, but it still holds up today. I would highly recommend this anime over any of the Ghost in the Shell anime"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This DVD, not the 2-Pack !","review":"This is my favorite anime movie that I've seen so far. I hear some people complain about the voices, but I love he voices. Especially Kiefer Sutherland's. The music is phenomenal, the action is great and perfectly distributed through the plot, and the plot is great if you can follow the last 10 minutes (just watch it two or three times tops and you will definitely have it). All this + Naomi Armitage is hot + Cool costumes = A perfect formula.On a final note:Dual Matrix [stinks], do not buy the 2-pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST ANIME MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN","review":"This is the best Anime movie I have ever seen. This movie is definitely worth purchasing. And Armitage is hot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great japanese anime...","review":"I think this is a great movie, and a full movie too. A lot of anime is 40 minutes long but this is full length. It's about a far future cop on Mars named Armitage, but she is an illicit robot and all of her kind are being murdered. Also see the Armitage series and try to find this movie subtitled if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I loved this movie. Made it on the top Anime/OVA and overall fav. movies.As a Elizabeth Berkley fan, I was pleased with her work in this film. Not her best, but it worked well.

But what do you expect from a Disney production, to just look for an opportunity for them to promote their own recording artists! As for kids not being able to handle any \\"deep\\" songs, just take a look at the soundtracks for movies like \\"Shrek\\" and \\"Hoodwinked\\" where they show you can have great music soundtracks that appeals to a wide age range. Disney, once again you fall short on the soundtrack side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left the good stuff out","review":"This movie had a great soundtrack, but they left most of the actual soundtrack out. Half of the songs they included on this CD I'm not even sure were in the movie. The great music that I enjoyed in the theater is not on this CD. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney doesn't do soundtracks","review":"This is not the first time that the Disney Corporation has blown a soundtrack. I really think that they don't know how to do a good soundtrack anymore. They seem so concerned about making it palatable to the tweens that they forget that they paid someone good money to actually write a background score. All they seem concerned about is including some pop tunes because they must think this sells soundtracks. Well, if anyone is listening out there in the world of Disney - people who collect soundtracks would have liked to have gotten one for this movie. There are about 74 minutes available on a CD - why not go ahead and fill them with both the pop stuff and the actual score. Disney either forgets the score (like they did for this movie) - or only includes a paltry amount (maybe 30-40 minutes). Somebody at Disney better wake up - and maybe release a complete score for this movie - otherwise, you're better off skipping this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I am a huge fan of One Tree Hill and watch it every week. This book is by far the best One Tree Hill book. It shows all of Brooke's feeling and emotions and they writing is really great. I am a huge fan of the Brooke/Lucas relationship and of Brooke. Now if you like the Lucas/Peyton relationship or just don't like Brooke then this probably isn't the book for you. The book is mostly based around Brooke recovering from the heartache that the whole Brooke/Lucas/Peyton love triangle caused her. It most shows Brooke's relationship with Lucas,Peyton, and her parents...which is a good thing that we get to read something about her parents cause they aren't involved in the show that much. Overall this is a great book and once you pick it up you won't be able to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"This book was great!

It is about one of the characters, Brooke Davis and gives insight to her life. It is about a girl in high school who is in love with a boy and it is a great love story also a great friendship story about a girl and her best friend (Peyton). I found everything she went through very realistic and loved the whole thing. I read it all at once (it took me almost 5 hours). I have read it 3 times and like it better each time.

While most Progresive Powerhouse Bands like Yes, ELP & Pink Floyd use artisic and sometimes abstract imagery, Starcastle seems to come off as poetic mush. Cheesy at best. Not everyone who owns a synthisiser and a copy of \\"Autobiograpy of a Yogi\\" has what it takes to make it in the art rock world. Even Kayak was better than this. If you liked this record in 1977...try listening again when you are older, and not so stoned. This slag did not stand the test of time...if it passed any test at all. In short, Starcastle sucked. They are the worst thing to happen to progressive rock since The Alan Parson's Project went Soft Rock.

So, I'm intimately familar with the content of these products. We have several Barney DVDs and this one is the absolute worst as far as usability. The content itself is fine; however, there is no way to fast forward through the ads or the movie because there are no chapters!! For the price of this DVD, I would expect these basic features. The only other DVD I have without these features I got for free in a kids meal! The first time my youngest sat down to watch this DVD she cried for the first 5 minutes because she was expecting to see Barney, not ads for Kipper and Bob the Builder!

I have purchased the Hayes books to get information about my automobiles. I like them because they use plain language and LOTS of illustrations. This book (Seloc) has the illustrations, but it lacks some of the clarity. I don't recommend this book for the average shade tree mechanic. It is loaded with technical jargon that I had to read serval times to get my brain around. The book does take great care in making sure that all parts are identified. There are many illustrations with call-outs to define each part during a procedure.The only other critisism I have for the book is that it is very broad in the models that it covers. Procedures are mixed together for different motors making it rather confusing. You have to know quite a lot about your particular motor before starting to make sure you are following the correct procedure."},{"rating":"2","title":"red band 135 hp manual","review":"Exactly what i was after.

His voice is solid, with an amazing range, incredible screams and he has the ability to turn on a beautiful tone to change the flow of a song. What's great about Heed is it isn't like every other typical metal band in Europe who tries to rehash Priest or Maiden.

I no longer find myself looking for that box of screws, or having to run back out to get things out of the vehicle. Also, if I am low on something, it is immediately apparent. The material, it is made out of, is super durable, and I am sure it will last, for a long,long time. Pick up one or more of these, and a 56 Organizer for your tools.

Why do most peaople enjoy Southern Rock? Its the guitars baby and thats where these guys shine. The guitar duo of Barry Baily and J.R. Cobb are not easily beat by any band.

These albums should be in the collection of any fan of Rock guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Camera Travel Case - Lowepro","review":"The best feature about this case is the belt clip that is velcro with an additional snap. You don't have to remove your belt or feed it through, it just slides right on any waist belt. I hook it on my waist bag I use when festival shopping, amusement park visiting and sightseeing activities. My Lumix underwater camera works great in this case. Some cases were not large enough to accommodate it. The velcro front flap that closes too is quick to open and close so you don't miss that picture opportunity. This was another feature that I insisted on finding too. I did not want a zipper to open & close all the time. The shoulder strap has clips that are so large and easy to work to remove when wanted.

I chose not to install the software it came with (\\"One-touch backup\\") as I personally have no use for it.

I have seen both the original \\"The Shop Around The Corner\\" and the Judy Garland-Van Johnson version, \\"In The Good Old Summertime\\" and this contemorary version is true to the theme. It is just the type of movie that Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan do so well together. I have heard it compared to \\"Sleepless in Seattle but the two main characters interact together much more in this movie. But, if you enjoyed \\"Sleepless\\", you will probably love this movie.

Everyone should see You've Got Mail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid and insulting","review":"This film is truly stupid and insulting. Tom Hanks, stars as a manager of a franchise of a mega book chain who moves into a new part of town. At the same time, he starts a e-mail relationship with Meg Ryan, who owns a small bookstore in the same area. As it happens, Meg Ryan's bookstore is utterly destroyed by Hanks chain, and has to fold up. Yet, when at the end, she learns of his identity, she stills agrees to go out with him! Is she a masochist or something?. This pretends to be a romantic comedy but, believe me, you leave this movie with a very bad taste on your mouth. That's a problem with many American movies that try to be critical of capitalism, but they end up embracing it (case in point: Jerry Maguire). Capitalism is too much in America's DNA for a Hollywood movie to be too critical of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unable to enjoy","review":"When I opened the DVD, I found the disc was loose in the case and damaged beyond repair from shipping.

Look beyond the fact that this movie is one long commercial, no other film has more product placement. The insidious message of the film is the inevitability of corporate domination. Meg Ryan, the small business owner, has her bookstore driven into the ground by Tom Hanks and his Borders type mega-store but all is forgiven in the name of love. I've never known destroying someone's livelihood to be an aphrodisiac. The rest is by the numbers romantic comedy. One star is beyond generous. Trite, shallow, saccharine, completely without merit.

The only thing I don't like about it is that they just HAD to have \\"Kathleen\\" (Meg) and that silly employee-girl talk about cyber-sex and they just HAD to show Patricia and Joe sharing a bed. THAT was unnecessary, thank you. (So... if you've got kids who you want to keep innocent to the crazy, disgusting ways of family-building we have here in America for just a while longer, avoid this movie.) But, be reassured, those two scenes are definitely NOT the point of the movie, and, when you look beyond them, \\"You've Got Mail\\" is adorable, funny, intelligent, realistic, and altogether a great couple hours of entertainment. I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Instant Video As Promoted","review":"I bought the DVD with the promise of an instant video so I could watch the movie rental free;.

In this case, they both obviously like each other online, but in real life have this professional opposition with the companies they own - with him putting her out of business, etc.But this is also a very realistic movie (putting the coincidence aside that they really know each other) in the fact that relationships fail, people get stood up, people have high expectations, and you never know what to expect online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping the Mrs. Happy","review":"My wife loves this movie. Every time it comes on TV, she has to watch it. So, I bought it for her as part of my wedding anniversary gift for her. Tom Hanks is true to form in this movie.

Being together with Frank Navasky, a well-known journalist, she betrays him by e-mailing secretly and anonymously with a also betraying man whom she met in a chat room. Suddenly, her business gets endangered by the opening of Fox Books discount store just \\"around the corner\\". She meets Joe Fox, son of the owner, and soon gets annoyed by his arrogant way of managing business matters. Although getting advice by her anonymous mail-pal, she has to close down her store. But Joe Fox's life suddenly gets out of control when he learns that his anonymous mail-pal is nobody other than Kathleen Kelly. Great movie, great performances, great music. To everyone who hasn't yet seen this movie rent it, buy it, enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Movie Of All Time...","review":"This is a dreamy New York City film that everyone wishes was their real life!Myself included.It's basically the beginning of the internet for personal use in the late 90's, and a love story of sorts plays out in a strange way online. To complicates things, a rivalry ensues.I adore the cast of charachters. Even the ones with small roles, like Birdie and Joe's grandfather. I love the wording of the emails that are sent from both Joe and Kathleen. I love the locations, and the apartments are to die for!New York is also one of the stars of this film. There are so many city scenes in this movie, and it makes you wish the New York of today was more like it was then.To sum it up, I think this is Nora Ephron's finest film (screenplay and direction) to date. I watch it several times a year. And even though it's from 1998, it is still the one movie which makes me truly happy every time I watch it. It's sweet, romantic, and my favorite movie of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie!","review":"Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan actually make you believe they are a couple in this story. In fact, it makes you wonder why they're not! They have a wonderful chemistry together and this movie is just exemplary of that. I particularly enjoy the part when Hanks finds out that his chat-room mate is really Ryan and then conceals it from her. He changes her hatred for him after her ruins her business by first bringing her flowers, then just by \\"happening\\" to cross her path almost on a daily basis. When Ryan finally finds out that her chat-room mate is actually Hanks, she is very relieved and hoped that he was the \\"one.\\" Truly a great movie to see on a rainy day and it even brings a few tears to the eyes!Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable, but sweet","review":"You Got Mail is a predictable love-hate relationship movie with a modern twist. From the moment Hanks and Ryan voice-over their first two email messages, you know that Joe and Kelly have got to get together, no matter how much they hate each other in person. The electric-as-usual chemistry between Hanks and Ryan saves the plot line from becoming tired and silly, and the musical score is fabulous, but unless you are a REAL fan of the romantic comedy genre (like me) I wouldn't recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"SWEET!","review":"I really enjoyed this movie.

The story is full of cliches. I enjoy romance stories with some hint of realism. How could Meg Ryans be so clueless when her associate knows so many details about her? The scenes and characters are sweet enough for Hallmark. Real people are good and bad. These characters lack depth.

With Meg, Tom plus a music CD I couldn't lose, right? Well I'll not make that mistake again. I gave away both because I don't want them taking up shelf space.What's wrong with this picture? Well the story has little going for it. It was easier to take interest in the supporting actors and skip the main characters altogether.The soundtrack does not enhance the movie at all. Just a hodgepodge collection of tunes. It would be difficult to find music that went with this flick.Meg is always brooding and Tom tries to be lively but there just aren't any sparks in the show or between the characters. When the 2 hours are up you ask yourself \\"what was all that about?\\". So what happened to the romance and comedy? It was just a story about friends who e-mailed and got through a difficult personal situation.Main theme: \\"life goes on...\\" Hmmm, I'm hoping these two hilarious and talented actors pick a better script next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid film about stupid people","review":"This is about as bad as it gets! The world doesn't need another brainless \\"feel-good-movie\\" from the US where you can guess how the end will be (and the whole film, for that matter) after five minutes. It's boring, unoriginal, unfunny, stupid, and so bloody romantic it makes you sick. And I dare say that even for Meg Ryan fans, there's a little bit too much Meg Ryan in this film. She's all cute, babbling and giggling a little to herself while wearing a cute pyjamas... give me a break! All in all, it's the most annoying film I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manipulative Crap","review":"God is Meg Ryan obnoxious. Her idea of being appealing is bouncing on the balls of her feet like an 8-year-old. Blechh! A goody two-shoes like this does not exist, particularly in Manhattan.Speaking of which, what \\"Manhattan\\" was this? In this film, butterflies flit in subway cars. Come on, Miss Ephron, what do you take us for? The bookstore and their environs looked like Santa Barbara -- not NY.And Hanks really phoned this sucker in. What a dull performance. I saw zero evidence of the vaunted \\"chemistry\\" between the two principals.A cool, calculated (and I guess successful) attempt to bring women's dollars into the theater. Come on, ladies, wise up! Just because Hanks and Ryan are in it doesn't make this a good movie.Just Say No!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended!","review":"This is a smart, witty, romantic comedy. I like anything that has to do with the internet so I bought this DVD without even seeing it first and I have to say, I wasn't disappointed. Okay, yes, it is kind of a chick flick but it has everything I like. The internet, books, romance, comedy, drama, and the list goes on. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"This is a good movie starring Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. It is about a small book store owner who has to battle the giant Fox Book Stores and she loses and then she falls in love with one of the owners of Fox Books Stores. The DVD is good and is great looking in Widescreen. If you want a better movie by Nora Ephron try When Harry Met Sally(1989).

That being said, I can't understand why the producers would have taken a charming comedy \\"The Shop Around the Corner\\" and redone the film, taking all the warmth, wit, and charm right out of it. The orginal, with Jimmy Stewart, is probably one of the ten best films of all time. I saw nothing remotely charming or interesting about the supposed remake, which almost can't even be called a remake with the heavy handed rewriting that went on. I have nothing against rewriting or redoing classic films, but if you're going to redo it, at least IMPROVE on the original, or there's not reason to try to redo it in the first place. Save your time and money. Forget about this one, and get \\"The Shop Around the Corner\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"MEG RYAN AND TOM HANKS DO IT AGAIN!","review":"You've got mail is another perfect movie for those two wonderful stars.

Unlike Sleepless it didn't drag out, the characters actually knew each other (and hated each other which only made it better) The supporting cast helped to make this movie great (who can forget Parker Posey freaking out over her tic tacs?) This movie is one of my favourites, along with When Harry Met Sally. They are both the kind of intelligent movie which can make you laugh and sigh all at the same time.

You've Got Mail is passable as a silent film. If you look up from your New Yorker magazine from time to time, it can be quite pleasant visually.As a regular film with sound, though, it is a stinker, and should be carefully scooped up, placed in a plastic bag, and discarded. It was unpalatably cynical, even to this cynical reviewer. It was dated, it shamelessly promoted brand names (probably for remuneration), and the plot was... hey, wait, I'm wasting my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLU-RAY REVIEW","review":"BLU-RAY ENDED UP BEING A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY...

(I wanted to rate this movie zero stars, but Amazon only allows ratings from one to five.) While I admit that I'm not the biggest fan of Nora Ephron's directing/writing work (Sleeples in Seattle, Michael, Mixed Nuts & Hanging Up), I was willing to give this movie the benefit of the doubt because I do like Tom Hanks. Needless to say, even Hanks couldn't carry this god-awful mess. The dialogue is so sappy and forced you tend to wonder how Hanks could pull off his lines with a straight face. Meg Ryan dials in her usual \\"look how cute I am!\\" performance.Here's the plot: Hanks is involved in a buyout of the bookstore where Ryan works. Unknowingly, Hanks and Ryan engage in a cyber relationship and slowly fall in love. A good premise, but in the hands of the overrated Ephron it falls flat.This movie is marketed as a \\"date\\" movie. Do your date a favor and watch \\"Caligula\\". Even that sorry film had more romance than this fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sentimental Dribble","review":"This film (if one would be so bold as to call it a \\"film\\"; I should think \\"garbage\\" a more appropriate title) was quite frankly among the worst ever produced. I found it an insult to my considerable intelligence. The dialogue lacks wit (I'm sure the screenwriters could have thought of something more epigrammatical than \\"You have mail\\") and the characters lack depth. The film is inundated in sentimentality and posseses a mindless plot (if it could be said to possess a plot at all). Mr. Hanks wasted his considerable thespian talents on this project. Ms. Ryan, I can at least say, is not guilty of this charge; she has no talent to begin with. A dreadful waste of time. I would just as soon leap from the top of St. Paul's Cathedral than see it again.P.S. I understand that the sentiments expressed in my review may be unpopular ones. I live at 1567 Windsor Lane in London, England. Feel free to come to my home and personally disagree with me if you wish."},{"rating":"1","title":"pap","review":"This film is utter pap.It seems that Hollywood is willing to slap these two together and regurge Sleepless in Seattle for a few million.And it seems that America as a whole has come like sheep to follow Hollywood.Tom Hanks has way too much talent to waste on a wooden flick such as this. Meg Ryan needs to get more sleep and get rid of the undereye circles before she can claim her cutsie status again.Not to mention, when is she going to grow up and start doing adult movies with real characters instead of fluff pieces.I felt like the time I spent watching this movie could have been better spent clipping toenails for gods sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"And then I woke up!","review":"What a boring movie this is! Very disappointing, bland, unfunny, unromantic and totally dull. Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks looked like they were just going through the same old motions. There is nothing witty or spontaneous to look forward to - forget it! Watching a wheel going round is more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched - This is no Sleepless In Seattle","review":"Meg Ryan's cutesy bit is out of control in this steaming pile of heavy handed romantic comedy. Fortunately the anti corporate message seems to fade into the woodwork as Meg and Tom down Starbucks lattes and trade dull barbs backed by no chemistry. Shop Around the Corner pulled it off in 1940, but a 90s setting really makes deceptive courting seem dated. I loved Sleepless, but Meg Ryan was subdued and Tom Hanks played a character with whom you could sympathize. The only sympathy here comes from fellow suffering audience members who also had to sit through the many needless psuedo-climaxes. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"A really bad \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" ripoff","review":"Boring, predictable and a complete lack of any substance and drama. I am a big Tom Hanks fan but this movie was hideous. Don't waste your time watching this film. Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks had zero chemistry and their characters could not be any less intriguing. I would truely rate this as one of the ten worst movies I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nora Ephron, give it a rest!","review":"Another cute little romantic comedy from Nora Ephron. It's so cute. Tom Hanks is so darn cute, doing that Regular-Everyday-Kind-of-Guy routine he does in every single film he's ever done. Meg Ryan is even cuter, doing that twinkle twinkle twinkle little gamine grin act of hers. The story is cute, too. There are two people who hate each other in real life, see, but they communicate by e-mail (that's a cute twist!) and fall in love with each other without ever seeing each other! Isn't that, for lack of a better word, cute? How do I keep getting suckered into seeing these movies? I must have been one of the very few people who saw \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" for the shallow, spiteful piece of yuppie garbage it was, and who thought that \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" portrayed two of the most unlikeable people ever to attempt to jerk the viewer's heartstrings. Well, this is on par with both of those movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst \\"Major\\" Movie I've Ever Seen","review":"This porrly written and dull clone of \\"Sleepless In Seattle\\" - a great movie - is nothing more than a heartless, passionless ad for AOL and Starbucks. Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless in NY","review":"One star is too many for this moronic debasement of the great Ernst Lubitsch's exquisite comedy The Shop Around the Corner. Tom Hanks runs a huge corporation but has endless time to mooch around Meg Ryan, who is constantly showing us how adorable she is (\\"Don't you think daisies are the friendliest flowers?\\"). You've never seen such unconvincing acting as the actors pretending to find the limp, banal lines amusing; even the dog has to help out with a funny face. Considering the sheepish, exhausted air of the whole thing, it's doubtful Ephron believes in her own (script as well as direction) movie. Please buy the Lubitsch and see what a difference passion and intelligence make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shop Around the Corner was a 5-star, what happened here?","review":"I like Tom and Meg just as much as the next person, but isn't there supposed to be a flowing story in a movie that keeps the audience interested. The central idea why Tom and Meg fall for each other seems a lot more realistic in this movie than in Sleepless in Seattle, but it looks like they just threw the movie together. Personally, I usually like the more modern remakes like the new Sabrina and A Perfect Murder, but Shop Around the Corner is a nearly perfect movie that they destroyed with this picture. I will have to say that Meg put on her cuteness on its highest level and it was refreshing to see Tom in something fun rather than Saving Private Ryan or Philadelphia, but let's make their future project more like Sleepless in Seattle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to snuff","review":"I think people are so anxious to put Tom Hanks and Meg ryan in ANYTHING together, that it doesn't matter to them if the movie is actually good. If you want to see a good Hanks/Ryan movie, rent Sleepless in Seattle."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true meaning of a sleeper.","review":"I love Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, but this movie was vey slow and I kept waiting for the climax. I was also disappionted in the ending. What happens next? I waited that long I could have waited for two more minutes for a bit more of an ending. Sorry but I expected more out of the two fine actors and this skript."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Sappy Ryan","review":"Hanks is great (although not in this), even he does not save this pathetic movie. I truly believe that Ryan is talented (and cute) but why does she continue to accept these sappy roles. Wake Up Meg!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough with Meg and Tom Pairings!!!","review":"I was excited about seeing this movie, because I loved Sleepness in Seattle, but what a disappointment this movie was. The characters were unreal and glossed up (enough already with the close-ups of Meg and Tom!!). Also the plot was uninteresting and unbelievable. The only thing that I really liked about the movie was Meg Regan's apartment, kudos to the set director. Also, the movie wasted the talents of a wonderful actress, Parker Posey, by making her whiny and annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but too fluffy & unrealistic","review":"'You've Got Mail' was a cute little movie, esp. considering that Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks were a couple in it, but it's definitely not a must-see. For one thing, it was very predictable. After the first five minutes I knew what was going to happen for the rest of the movie. For another, Joe Fox was just the *perfect* lover. He was extremly romantic, he treated Kathleen like a queen, he never thought of himself, he even set up the little rondevous where he reveals himself as the unseen man of her dreams. How many people do you meet like that? With some neat parts, a long running time and a corny ending, YGM will not go down as a classic, except in the minds of those who like those kind of fluffy movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no, not again!","review":"Well, Sleepless in Seattle II, this time it's in the same state. I enjoyed the first one, emotion, humour and against the 'tropic of cretinsm' regard it as more appealing. Tom and Meg now look less compatible as poor old Tom has let it slide over the last few years (hair included). It has its moments, mostly when they are both not on the screen, but it could do with the Dallas act, the amnesia in the showers waking up as different people. These two do not know different ways of acting in a romantic comedy, so i find this passes the time but little else."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best screen couple ever","review":"This is one of my favorite movies, equal to Sleepless in Seattle. As in that film, the music matches the scenes flawlessly. After viewing the movie \\"The Shop Around the Corner\\" on which You've got Mail is based, I realized that two shortcomings of that film (the lack of letters and weak content of what was read, and a heroine nowhere near as endearing as Meg) were fixed in You've Got Mail. Facial expressions on both Meg and Tom are near perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entertainment !","review":"Even though Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks are not trying too hard to act brilliantly, they are a perfect match in terms of natural acting.

Crazy what we will do for love!!!!I recommend this to anyone with a heart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two great actors","review":"One of my all time favorites. It is a \\"pick me up\\".

The only part anything happened was at the end. Many Romantic movie lovers may find that boring but the wit in this movie made it a very cute and funny movie. The whole movie is about knowing personality before looks or image. This made a very good love story. So watch and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you feel good and I bought the soundtrack the next day","review":"I love Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan together and was glad they got together much earlier in this than in \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\". I know it won't make as many millions as the big violent blockbusters but we need (underlined) more movies like this where you leave the theater feeling good and your ears aren't burning from the \\"F\\" word. It's used so much now when it doesn't even make any sense. From the first \\"Puppy\\" song, I knew I'd buy the soundtrack and I did the very next day. Some old songs and some new ones and they're all great! PLEASE MAKE MORE FILMS LIKE THIS ONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely movie!","review":"I adore this movie, is one of my favorites, even when now, for 2007 the technology in it is old. But the magic is there, the romance, the dinamic and the great performance of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, who have this sweet chemistry together.

I disliked it very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've Got Junkmail","review":"Meg Ryan tries too hard to be cute. Tom Hanks's character is illogically and unnecessarily caustic at times. The story is contrived, and implausible.(Why wouldn't the online duo even reveal their first names to each other?, because it wouldn't advance the story, that's why.) But it gets two stars from me for some moments of humor, (references to the Godfather) and for the happy ending. Emotions might make you think you like it, but you will forget it quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite cute but boring","review":"Thinking about who's in it - Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks - and about the up-to-date internet/chat/virtual reality topic I expected probably too much.

It's a great movie for young teenagers and good for a rainy Sunday afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves something to be desired","review":"The only reason I give this flick two stars is because I like looking at Meg Ryan. But this is the only movie I have ever felt like walking out on before it was finished. This movie wasn't the least bit entertaining, in fact, it seemed liked it was whipped together as an afterthought on the part of both actors. What's really sad is this doesn't help Tom Hanks. He makes awesome movies...why does he even bother with something so trite as this unless the money was phenomenal. It was hard to think that this actor was the same one I saw in 'Ryan'."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS SEEMS VERY CUTE","review":"I did not see this movie yet,,but my friend did,and she says it's cute and a great film.She would like to see this again.I will see this very soon beacuse it sounds very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment from such great actors!","review":"OK as a freebie Sunday night made for TV movie. Not worth renting, let alone buying this one. Just goes to show that the names alone do not a movie make.Not much of a story -- ho hum characters -- predictable ending. What a combination for a bomb. A truly forgettable movie. Nothing stands out except that it was somewhat like Sleepless in Seattle.It's supposed to be a romantic comedy. So where's the romance and the comedy? It was more of a story about good friends who cybercommunicate on an intimate level, but have not formally met.Interesting story but not interesting enough to make a full length movie about. A half-hour episode would suffice. Maybe Tom and Meg should consider a weekly TV sitcom and leave the movies to someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"think its is wonderful","review":"have seen this film and liked it very much think this is the most funy and succesful film ."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-day long movie","review":"I could put this movie on \\"repeat\\" and watch it over and over again.

I think thats what it was about I was too bored to function after the 1st hour and a half. I counted the skittles in my 3rd bag and sorted them by color. If you really want to see it then go ahead but please don't drag anyone under the age of 12 with you. It could be hadarzodus to their heath and possibly yours too!

Hanks plays an abhorrent character that no (emotionally healthy) woman would look at twice. The way he practically forced his way into her home as she continually asked him to leave was nothing less than creepy. What's with Tom Hanks these days? And what purpose did those Balkan jokes serve escept to show how low he has sunk. His character shows no warmth or effort toward personal redemption. He simply (and incorrectly) presents the character as posessing 'an overwhelming charm and forcefulness'. Give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"Predictable, boring, and annoying. The only thing I liked about it was the New York City scenery (I live there) and I would periodically gush, \\"Oh, I've been there, ooh..there too!\\" And Tom Hanks' performance wasn't bad either, but there was no part of this movie where I laughed out loud, or felt warm and fuzzy.

It does have some flaws though. AOL and StarBuck Cafe are advertised all the time, and there are more ads there too. It's not such a bad thing but it looks like a well-set-up ad campaign.

Definitely a good deal as I would have paid more for S&H; alone if I hadn't ordered this little gem. Ordered this on a Friday and received it the next Wednesday.

I have to see & know the person well before I can trust & maybe like him/her at all. In the movie, Meg & Tom made it possible for people to trust one another & even become the best of friends over the Internet. At times like this, it may not sound like a good idea but they made it appear so safe & sound & plainly aggreable.The movie is full of laughter & cute events especially between the two characters...a perfect teaming up for our lead stars.

That said irrespective of genre, a good film is a good film. This one falls short. It is just an update on the mistaken identity, bumping into each other, I hate you, you hate me guess what happens in the end sort of film that seems to be churned out by the low budget studios. The story is harmless enough. Tom Hanks is a director of a faceless big American bookstore and Meg Ryan owns a small handed down book shop around the corner. They meet often and obviously do not share the same principles. They both have been unlucky in love and both have an e mail correspondent they believe is their ideal partner.

I don't think so, really... He is clearly profiting from his position to maneuver Meg Ryan wherever he wants to. At least the moviemakers were wise enough not to make Tom Hanks offering Meg Ryan a job, that would have been quite cheesy...

Its a war of the book stores - Meg Ryan's small 'Shop around the corner' which has been around for 42 years since her mother started it is a charming, cosy, place where children love to come and hear stories.

Caroline Evans is intelligent, true and strong. Together they make a \\"dream\\" couple. I found the storyline exciting and real.

Rather than seducing Caroline into a relationship he basically just informs her that he will have her - no romance at all. He calls her \\"my woman\\" more than he does by her name, and their sex scenes are all lust, no tenderness. Yes, the sex is hot, but when Joe tells Caroline \\"you'll lose your cherry\\" I actually cringed. Is he a grown man or a frat boy? He doesn't hesitate to suspect Caroline of a crime and then just gives her a light apology afterwards.

Later, I heard it beeping and figured I had forgotten to turn it off. I turned it off, and it turned itself back on. It did this several times, and I finally pulled the battery out. Another time, it turned itself off while I was using it. My sense is that Stanley's quality has slipped in recent years.I was in the middle of a project, and so I bought a Zircon 3.0 stud finder...It performed perfectly on drywall and reasonably well on plaster, even though it makes no claim to work through plaster.

All of them came with the same disappointing results. Then a serach on internet revealed that almost all the people bought had the same results. What is disconcerting is that Stanley has not done a single thing to resolve this issue. Shame on Stanley. Next time, I will not be that trusting of Stanley tools."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Find a Single Stud","review":"Amazon could do us a favor by pulling this product.

From the other reviews, it looks like I'm not alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intellisensor not that intelli!","review":"To begin this product did NOT satisfy my needs in locating studs. I purchased this product and found it to be inconsistent in locating studs accurately. Ever time I re-caled the device I got different results. In addition the handling of the unit was awkward and not comfortable. I felt that metal locating and AC locating was also inaccurate. Due to this product I have 3 extra holes in my walls at home. I returned the device and purchased a MetalliScanner by Zircon. I found that product to work much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"love the mistress","review":"What a great thriller!

This story taught, to me, that it is improtant to know that two people may look alike, but at heart they are two seperate people.

And if Earle Bruce's performance at a prayer breakfast the morning of the 2006 game doesn't create a lump in your throat or bring tears to your eyes, you're not a college football fan.

Probably a good date movie. But the DVD we got was pretty poor. At various points in the movie the actors' voices would be in sync with their lips on the screen and at other points they would be out of sync by almost a second. It was like watching an old Godzilla movie. I would return it but by the time I pay the return charges and for gas I'd only break even. I'll keep it for the humor factor."},{"rating":"1","title":"a cheap copy","review":"This was the strangest video I've ever gotten from Amazon.

Movies like Shakespeare in Love and The Matchmaker prove that you don't need ruthless main characters to have a good movie. People can still be decent to each other and stick to their beliefs, to succeed. They don't need to demean themselves to make it in life. I thought the charaters were believable, the story was interesting and totally funny! I hope you find a chance to at least watch this movie once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, funny, with nice, if not great, acting","review":"I found all the characters in this to be interesting, although this is not a \\"Deep\\" movie, it is very easy to watch.

I also enjoyed the scenery and music throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"She should do more romantic comedies","review":"First, to the viewer wondering about the song \\"Haunted\\" - the song is a duet between Shane MacGowan (formerly of the Pogues) and Sinead O'Connor, and it's on \\"the Snake\\", an album by Shane MacGowan and the Popes.I think this may be one of the best romantic comedies ever; the interplay between Janeane and David O'Hara is priceless, the setting is simply stunning, and the supporting cast (particularly Miles O'Shea as the titular character) are all excellent. Good writing, good direction, well acted, great movie. My only question to the studio (to echo a common lament): why no soundtrack?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and charming","review":"I always love the story which sets in Ireland. Don't know why, maybe because the beautiful scenery and wonderful accent. Anyway, Janeane Garofalo played as Marcy, an employee worked for Senator McGlory. She was forced to go to Ireland, to Ballinagra to be exact, to find the senator's Irish ancestors. She arrived at the village at the perfect time for The Matchmaking Festival. Marcy met a local man, Sean, played by David O Hara and sparks were coming between them.I enjoy the whole movie. It was funny from the start. Try to imagine two guys, both were suffering a broken leg which made both of their left legs on cast, trying to work together to drive a car on an empty Ireland road. Hilarious! The soundtrack was great too (especially love She's The One) and the scenery was engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie","review":"Janeane Grofalo is so qute.

The image is grainy and colors are distorted and there are no special features worth having."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, middling \\"romantic comedy\\"...","review":"This is a rather bland film. It is the usual boring, insipid romantic comedy that Hollywood should stop making, as they are so silly and unbelievable. Janeane Garofalo, who I consider an immensely intelligent person and who is a very underrated and underused actress, doesn't seem right here. She has a disdain throughout the film, like she doesn't really believe in the material. She's far too smart and cynical to really pull this kind of fluff off, even though, if they cast another actress, it would still be a middling film. The film is not horrible. It has its moments of charm and sweetness, and a few funny scenes. The biggest asset it has is that it's filmed in Ireland. The locations are magnificent, and the filmmakers should be commended for shooting there. The film would be absolutely abysmal if it was shot somewhere else. It's an OK, middling film, nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, especially for Garofalo fans","review":"We found this video to have a rambling, disconnected story line with very few laughs. There are characters and side issues introduced with little relevance to the main story. We like Jeanine Garofalo - loved \\"The truth about cats and dogs\\", but found her and the entire cast to be flat and un-funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hollywood Irish film","review":"I bought the film based on the reviews. I thought it was a complete waste of time; a Hollywood take on Ireland.

Perhaps I saw a different movie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Help Falling in Love with the Story","review":"This was a great movie. The ending was totally predictable, especially after you see Sean standing on the car door watching Marcy's plane fly overhead. You just know he's going to come to Boston after her.

It was a beautiful romantic comedy, one you could watch over and over again, and just keep falling in love with the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking and truly remarkable","review":"I love this movie!!

It's a romantic comedy!! I don't expect some kind of \\"Most Important Film of the Decade\\" when I watch a romantic comedy.I want these things, in order: A sexy, quirky, and smart hero; an intelligent, attractive female lead whom I can identify with; sarcastic humor; and a believeable will-they-won't-they romance. The fact that this one is set in Ireland is a plus, as are the fun supporting cast, interesting political plot (how many romantic comedies center around campaign workers and the serach for Irish votes?) and the excellent soundtrack (which to my dismay is not available anywhere I've looked!).If you want an intellectual evening, or a movie that will make you think, there are a number of other movies I could recommend. If you just want to see two likeable people fall in love in Europe, get this one, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Matchmaker","review":"I saw half of this movie on the Romance Channel and went out to buy it the next day so I could finish it. In this delightfully funny romantic comedy, Janeane Garofalo plays Marcy Tizard, an ambitious campaign worker who is sent to Ireland to search for the lineage of Sen. John McGlory. Single Marcy winds up in Ireland just in time for the annual matchmaking festival...that's when the fun begins.Although the movie has its dry spots, Janeane really makes up for it with her quirky comebacks, and smart-alic remarks.

There are plenty of synopsis on previous reviews, so I won't rehash that here. In several spots, grammatical errors were not corrected, the plot has so many complications, it can't keep track of them, and the romance is awkward and shoved together. This reads like a poorly written first draft, not a published novel.

This book is priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply one of the best books in the field","review":"Laux and Addonizio have put together a supurb collection of essays, examples and ideas for poets and writers at all levels of accomplishment. The chapters are short, readable, written with ease and authority. The example poems they use are invariably superb and illustrative. Laux and Addonizio are particularly adept at demystifying the writing process for beginnners. The appendices in the back provide valuable information on a range of writing resources, such as literary internet sites, annotated lists of poetry anthologies and other books on writing. There are countless middle-of-the-road guidebooks on poetry writing, sometimes helpful, often cumbersome, lofty or skewed in their aesthetic toward the precious or the academic.

After reading the first chapter early one morning I went outside to feed and water my cats and came in and wrote a poem about flowing water, tangled morning glories and memories of my mother. It's one of the most inspiring, practical and encouraging books about writing poetry that I've ever read, and trust me, I've read them all. It has technical information and poems to illustrate each chapter, which is very helpful. The suggestions at the end of each chapter are down to earth and do-able, unlike some books that are just too high-minded for the average person.

This choppy, made-for-TV film has terrible dialogue, ludicrous conversations, and an awful storyline that barely goes with the book.You probably know screenplay is almost everything, and a poor one makes a film terrible, especially if the screenwriter isn't good in the genre of films he's writing. That was Lionel Chetwynd, who wrote the teleplay. He had previously written countless documentries, and Net Force was his first theatrical film.On a strong point, the acting is fantastic. Scott Bakula has a great performance as Alex Michaels, Kris Kristofferson delivers once again, and Brian Dennehy makes a good effort. Little known actor Paul Hewitt is wonderful playing the young computer wiz, Jay Gridley.Bottom Line: The acting is good, but screenplays kill and this one doesn't deliver. Net Force wouldn't be my first choice for viewing pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minus 5 Stars","review":"Absolutely one of the worst movies I've sat through....I could kick myself for wasting 2 hours and 42 minutes of my life.

We see in this movie a group of Internet hackers led by a Bill Gates clone (played by an amusing Judge Reinhold) and his charming computer wiz (a talented Anjul Nigam) and muscle man (the menacing Xander Berkley)take the controls of the Internet by breaking into the White House. Scott Bakula is the head of the FBI's NetForce division that investigates these computer crimes. This film is a must see for anyone who has been affected by the computer age: Everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Movie","review":"This is the type of movie where you would watch while relaxing after a days job. The \\"who-dunnit\\" scheme was well done, and Judge Reinhold's part as the very-obvious-reference-to-Bill-Gate, Janus, is spookingly well done. And then there's the honestly surprising surprise ending... Technology seemed a little ahead for 2005, and the romance between Scott and Joanna somewhat got in the way. But as a whole, it was an enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good action movie but the book is better ...","review":"I think that Tom Clancy's books are much better than their films. And this is again true in this movie. As a miniseries is very good and you will sure have a good time if you like this kind of action movie.For those interested in the spanish subtitles of this DVD, I can tell you that they do not work properly. There is a 10 to 12 second delay between their english pronunciation and the appearance of the corresponding subtitles on screen. It does not sound like much, but 10 seconds in a movie is a long time, and completely destroys your understanding and enjoyment of the film.I can not understand why some DVD producers disregard the importance of good quality second language subtitles or dubbing as in this case, if the USA and Canadian market have so many spanish speaking and french speaking people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy must not research his movies as much as we thought","review":"Very inaccurate depiction of computers.

The plot has a neat twist at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst thing to carry Clancy's name","review":"This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The only thing it had going for it was Tom Clancy's name in the TITLE! Their idea of technology 20 years from now is like \\"Back to the Future\\" on steriods. They used cheap gimicks like refering to \\"Star Wars 7\\" and an online court. They didn't even get many of the technological terms right! The acting was worse than daytime soap operas. The plot was nonexistant. The only good thing was the quality of the explosions. They were done well, but they were every five minutes... This is pure fantasy and anyone who has reached puberty won't buy it. This isn't a Tom Clancy flick. It is pure rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"choppy clint eastwood style non-sense","review":"I just watched this from an old VHS movie I got for $1 at the library. Scott Bakula tries to play a tough fearless agent working for the FBI but comes across as a Clint Eastwood wannabe. Cute and sexy Joanna Going plays his loyal admiring sidekick and does a good job keeping one's interest.

I felt I was bringing a bit of England home with me as well as a wonderful new friend. Upon arrival I immediately search out the sequel call \\"James, the Fabulous Feline\\" which I thought was even better. I am now hoping that there will be others as I am totally in love with Sir James. Please read these books if you love cats and are totally convinced that they are far more human than most suspect.

I have not seen the film and don't intend to as it is hard for me to imagine that it does the book justice.This is definitely a psychological thriller with a twist. I enjoy books that leave something to speculate on at the end rather than being spoon-fed every detail and The Hole delivers on this front. While the writing is a little choppy at times, it was overall a very good read. It certainly is not a book that I will forget. My only wish is that the fictitious doctor's fictitious report at the end actually existed so that I would have more accurate fodder for my speculations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not interesting until 2nd half","review":"I didn't understand a thing for the first half of the book. None of the dialog or text seemed important. Only at about 40% in (on my Kindle) did it get more interesting. I finished it because I was hoping it would get better. It did make me think at the end. I'm not going to re-read it though to get more out of it. Pretty much wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of the Flies???

I should have quit while I was ahead, since this was two hours of my life I can never get back. I don't know who told this individual he could write; perhaps the same person who told Britney Spears she could sing.

It is very dry, and I struggled to follow. I guess I do better with a narrative format, one that has stories and anecdotes that bring the history to life. Hilberg is obviously an historian of the highest level, but there is a reason I love history, but never much enjoyed college history classes. The book is well researched, and I must say that it offered me many great insights. I guess i just need to be more selective with the format I choose.

The new edition DVD is a big improvement.

It has a ridiculous plot with terrible acting. The movie has no point at all. It is about some lunatic man who has nothing better to do than be obsessed with plants. How can you make a good movie about a single man, 3 robots (one that flies off into space) and a dome full of trees. This movie is simply an hour and a half of garbage.

Twice, I fell asleep and had to force myself to the ending.In my opinion, the only redeeming factor of this movie is watching the robots. It seems this movie places the value of plants over human life and says it's ok to kill people as long as you have Peter Frampton hair. Only tree-huggers need apply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal Review for Movie- Silent Running","review":"This is a movie I watched as a kid and never forgot. Its about something important involving the care of the life on this earth. You don't have to be a tree-hugger to figure out that sooner or later mankind will have ruined the earth. He is in the process of doing it right now. This is a story about how mankind finally got to the point where every living thing on earth became expendable when a dollar bill became involved. Bruce Dern played a man in the future who wasn't ready to see this happen. The movie is well worth watching. But in reference to our real planet earth and the final outcome portrayed in this DVD: God Jehovah will soon bring to ruin those ruining the earth and establish all the earth as a paradise. This is just as he willed it in the garden of Eden several thousand years ago. This would be after man had his chance to rule by himself apart from God. So watch this picture. You may like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moody, Brilliant S.F. Film","review":"Silent Running is at times idealistic, and at times dark. It is, however, always quirky. The ending (which I will not disclose here) sums up the strange and beautiful nature of this movie, as does the lilting theme song appropriately sung by Joan Baez. The beginning of the movie is perfection, and it continues through murder, hope, crisis, and renewal (not necessarily in that order) to the ending which is both heartrending and lovely. It is very definitely a film of its time, and if you can accept what that means you'll be able to bask in the atmosphere of this early 70s eco-film. Movies are, at their very core, a form of escapism. Watching Silent Running means spending some time inside an uncertain and always disarmingily gorgeous future space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silent Running","review":"I saw this when I was kid. Nice story and excellent use of FX. I appreciated the fact it was another CGI movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what Science Fiction should be","review":"Silent Running is one of my all-time favorite films. Not because it had the best acting, special effects or Action, but because it tells a story of a possible future in a realistic manner. This film along with Solyent Green, Farenheit 451 , 1984 and Metropolis make up my list of the classics of real science fiction as it should be. The acting might need work, but the concepts depicted make you think about what the future could be if we don't pay attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic SF of the early 70s","review":"Long a favorite of mine, this DVD version is very good. If nothing else, it shows how the cultural climate of the times finds its way into a movie. The \\"Making of\\" feature is almost worth the price itself. Find out why the ship is named \\"Valley Forge\\", and how they made those little robots work. While many slam the Joan Baez songs, I think they are the essence of the movie and convey the feelings of the time in which the movie was made. In fact, I held back one star because they don't include the songs \\"Rejoice in the Sun\\" and \\"Silent Running\\" as separate cuts and the soundtrack album is long out of print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and stupid movie","review":"I'd like to say that this is the worst movie ever made, but it isn't. \\"Dark Star\\" was, but this runs a close second.I think that a child under 12 would maybe enjoy this movie?

I like sci-fi, but not like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This movie is unimaginably terrible. Overacting, underacting, a very thin plot with no development, poorly edited, and overall just plain sucky. The worst part is once you see the end of the movie you start questioning the whole reason for the movie to even have a reason for being made. Nothing is accomplished, nothing is resolved. This is just a bad, bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Science Farce","review":"Doug Trumbull's special effects are the only reason to watch this movie, but this is the worst script ever.Whoever came up with the idea that a botanist wouldn't know that plants die without light was partaking of a bit too much of the local flora.Bruce Dern's portrayal of an emasculated, uneducated, puerile, whining victim was fantastic. I think he caught the true essence of the flower-child movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"If a tree falls on this movie and nobody is watching....","review":"I have only walked out on two movies in my lifetime -- this was one of them. Absurdly bad acting from Bruce Dern, whom I have generally liked in movies and TV.

Avoid it like the plague, even on earth day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silent Running should be silenced","review":"I had such high hopes for this movie when I bought the DVD. I read it was directed by the man who was responsible for such wonderful special effects in 2001 and Close Encounters. What a boring, uneventful, uninteresting, badly acted, silly movie this is. I'm sure the message back in the early 70's was feelgood and all, but this was just toooooo lame for me to care about what was happening. It is plain to see that he did not have much in the budget for effects. Or even a script. Pretty amazing since Michael Cimino and Steven Bochco have their names attached to the screenplay. If you want to laugh at something that I would term \\"bad theater at its best\\", by all means, buy this movie.

Sometimes a 5 cent cigar is just a 5 cent cigar. I have seen this movie several times, it was never meant to be a 'classic' or anything other then what it is (was), a movie to entertain for that time. I had more than a passing interest in seeing the movie. The set used to make it was a old U.S. Navy ship by the name of the USS Valley Forge. In 1969, while traveling in convoy to Hawaii with many other ships, mine included, it ran into another ship, mine. So, I do remember it well.Being a Sci-Fi fan (nut), I really enjoyed this film, as I do many others, but please, when you watch this movie, DO NOT compare it by today's standards.

After reading for a while I felt that 30 pages later I was at the same point. I didn't find Steve or Carol to be likeable characters, in fact, they're really cruel to each other. The book didn't really make the case for why Steve and Carol loved each other. Neither Carol or Steve were well drawn characters at all.

This guide would be a good first choice for a beginning birder IF it had used drawings.I recommend owning the Peterson Eastern guide for a \\"real\\" field guide, and having the Stokes guide as a supplementary book.

I did like the layout of the information and the way you can find birds by color, but found it to be more useful, after you ID the bird, using another field guide.

I am sick and tired of these women being perfect little angels while everyone else around them are villians who ruin their perfect little lives.

If she really led the life portrayed in the book, she would have grown up quickly and her education would undoubtedly only added to her maturity, not made her such a naive nitwit as she is portrayed in the book.

Songs like \\"Clockout\\", \\"Wiggly World\\" and \\"The Day My Baby Gave Me A Suprise\\" are great rock'n'roll tunes while being gross and darkly humorous at the same time.

And the first scene is set in a diner with a girl and a boy talking, the scene later appears in the movie all over again, identical to.... yes you got it \\"Pulp Fiction\\". Other Pulp rip-offs include an outside drug-dealer , a character on extremely to many drugs, and corrupt cops. So if you want to get the real deal, than get \\"Pulp Fiction\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's a generational thing","review":"I tried. My wife and I watched about 20-25 minutes with an open mind trying like heck to see what the good reviews are about. It's not that the movie is terrible in the conventional sense. The acting is fine, and it has a moment or two to make you smile. Unfortunately though, it is mind-numbingly boring. We're both mid-30s, so maybe the new generation has different tastes, but at the 20+ minute mark we both looked at each other and decided that this was a complete waste of money and time. Luckily it only cost three bucks, but that's three bucks I didn't get any value for. I won't subject anyone else to this. The good news is that the DVD case has been recycled. The bad news is that the DVD is now part of our local landfill. I just wish DVDs were recyclable."},{"rating":"1","title":"go","review":"I was expecting alot more.

The only funny part was Sarah Polley's character limping to her car at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raving brought to a new level","review":"This film is witty, funny, beautiful, and sharp. The fast pacing and entertwining stories keep you hungry for more. Plus, you gotta love the cat and grocery store scenes. A teen flick and Tarantino love child."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wild ride","review":"If you're looking for one of those movies that just grabs you in and never lets go, using shameless entertainment and audacious humour to hold your interest, then \\"Go\\" is the utlimate ride. It's sort of like \\"Pulp Fiction\\" minus the extreme violence, and unfortunately, minus the hard impact. The film's intertwining stories are still cleverly laid out, and there are tiny gags that you will catch if you watch it more than once. The whole thing is created with such energy, and is loaded with trippy moments, including a look into a guy's drug-induced hallucination in a supermarket. It's pretty difficult to predict what's going to happen next, even if the events are a bit implausible, although the film does start to lost momentum towards the end. The entire array of actors deliver excellent performances, especially Sarah Polley, who is totally under-rated. \\"Go\\" may not be a perfect film, but it's still a lot of fun to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies.","review":"I didnt see this movie when it first came out. I didnt think it looked like anything special but I was wrong. I couldn't believe how good it was. I was hooked right from the begining. Its so cool how throughout the movie we see the point of view from a different main character. The movie has something for everyone. Car chases, shootings, raves and drugs, popular music, and its funny too. Easy material to follow. the guy who played the drug dealer is one of the best actors i've seen. he was so believable in his role. awesomeeeeeeeee movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"All \\"Go\\", non-stop fun!","review":"What makes this movie great is that it's told through different viewpoints. Each character has a fun story to share with you. You'll especially love Simon, the goofy Brit. If you want to see a movie that's smart, funny, hip, and cool then this is the one. A good movie to watch by yourself or with friends (maybe if you're between the ages of 15-25). I doubt this is a movie your parents would want to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"great, underrated film","review":"Good, clever film about youthful exuberance and energy. Hilarious in many places and always fast paced. One point that no other reviewers seem to have commented on yet is the fact that the film is also subtly melancholy, with all of the characters leading essentially bleak lives despite their youth. Great movie overall,- violent, funny, unsettling, almost frantic yet often sad- and not as mindless as one would think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why am I only the one who's sick of Pulp Fiction wannabes?","review":"Note to director: You're not Tarantino. You've got a great visual flair, but this script is the most derivative piece of writing i've ever witnessed. This is Pulp Fiction light from the get-go. Swingers was ten times more original than this. Decent performances all alround, but overall: you can afford to pass Go"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"What a good film! The script is just fantastic, the directing is assured and dynamic, and there's so much talent in the cast. A very young Katie Holmes shines in her role as a bored supermarket clerk, as does Sarah Polley (whatever happened to her?), whose attempt to get some money to avoid being evicted triggers this amazing story. Desmond Askew is both charming and hilarious -a rare and winning combination--and Jay Mohr and Scott Wolf make a funny couple."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Alternate Christmas Movie","review":"This clever child of Pulp Fiction and Rashomon is a sheer delight. If you are tired of Miracle on 34th Street and A Christmas Carol or are just looking for another Christmas film then look no further. Although not recomended for youngsters, don't let the talk of drugs and sex deter you. It is all done in a spirit of fun. You will see a lot of your favorites from TV (including the present Mrs. Tom Cruise) and find much to make you laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confusing....until the end!","review":"This movie reminded me somewhat or URn Lola, Run and Wild THings, the sort of choppy thing contributing to the thought of Run Lola, Run, and the synopsis at the end reminding me of Wild THings. I really liked GO, and enjoyed watching it over and over again, it's one of those movies in which you notice something different every time you watch it. Katie Holmes, Sarah Polley, Scott Wolf, and Jay Mohr (one of my fav. actors ever) star in this stimulating movie. Not bad, see it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of the Best Of 1999","review":"Prior to this film's release, I freaked out because I thought director Doug Liman (who gave us the classic 'Swingers') was about to put out a throwaway commercial hunk of hip plastic. But I gave it a chance, went and saw it, and laughed my ass off. The sugary, teen-pleasing cast is under great direction, and the pace keeps you connected. I don't even think about the accusations of 'Go' being a 'Pulp Fiction' spawn. There are many great scenes, but the ones that get me laughin' hard are the dance number in the grocery store produce section and the cat that \\"can read your thoughts\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOOO!","review":"I really enjoyed this movie, but its another one that can be played out if you watch it too much. So dont. But watch it when you have your friends over or you need an action/comedy/drama/brief nudity type film. Its good, its funny, the actress who plays Ronna is gorgeous, plus Nathan Bexton is in there, hes the guy who plays Manny. He was in \\"Nowhere\\" which is a film to buy if any of you liked Go. they split this film up into sections, not quite like Pulp fiction but its not one continuous story. You get to see all the angles in this movie which is nice for a change. Instead of watching Pulp Fiction and trying to guess whats in the freakin' suitcase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprisingly good movie","review":"I thought that I was in for another corny teeny-bopper, who's popular/who's not, WB Network alumni fame making feature, type of movie. I must say that I was pleasently surprised! It was Pulp Fiction clashed with Clueless. I love it when movies are paced like chapters in a book. It keeps you watching! I agree with the other reviewers when they say that the Simon story was the weak link in this movie, but I loved the comic relief from Simon's friends during the trip! The other two stories went together hand and hand brilliantly and I was at the edge of my seat. There were no boring moments. Anybody who is tired of the Jennifer Love Hewitt,the Freddie Prinze, or the Sarah Michelle Geller shallow flicks, I recommend this one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go get it","review":"\\"Go\\" was a truly underappreciated gem that didn't get nearly the audience it deserved. Calling it a \\"Gen X Pulp Fiction\\" does not quite do it justice. The out of sequence timing is much more intricate here and the characters are actually more likable. The amazing Sarah Polley gets the John Travolta role as the character whose story holds the narative together. Polley is one of the best young actresses working today. Actually, the whole cast is uniformly excellent and believable in their roles. Overall, this is the best film thus far to walk in the footsteps of \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" and it also has more heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives Up to the Hype and to its Potential","review":"With so many stars in one little movie \\"Go\\" could have gone bust by trying to support so many characters through out the many plots in this movie. Yes it had a \\"Pulp Fiction\\" feel to it and yes it brought back memories of \\"Swingers\\". But with a great new feel added to both concepts. This movie had everything todays hyper active audiences needed: Fast paced action mixed with great story lines and a great sound track to boot. The only thing that this movie lacked was a superb ending to it all. The ending kind of fell short. While the rest of the movie kicked and rocked. More than making up for the end. If you have a little extra cash, buy this movie NOW. If not, \\"Go\\" rent it. It's worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"a not so great movie","review":"This movie was pretty bad. The only thing that this movie had going for it was the inventive way of how they told each person's story. Though I might try and give this movie a second chance, by seeing it again. I don't recommend this movie. There are a lot of other movies that are more rent worthy, but if you have nothing better see then go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A witty must see comedy!","review":"Go is a witty, hilarious must see comedy! If you liked Pulp Fiction or even if you didn't you have to see Go! Scott Wolf and Jay Mohr have the best roles in the whole film has two gay soap opera actors who are trying to beat a drug rap by getting Sarah Polley to sell them some drugs which are really baby aspirin! I am not going to say anymore because I cannot do this movie any justice typing about it, just go see it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly entertaining movie, brilliant feature-packed DVD.","review":"I highly recommend Go to anyone who likes any or all of the following movies: Pulp Fiction; Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels; Very Bad Things. Go is another movie in the crime-comedy genre, although that's all I will suggest about the content; I had no idea what to expect when I watched Go for first time and I loved it. The DVD picture and sound quality is brilliant and it contains tons of extras (director's and editor's commentary, trailer, making-of documentary, music videos to three catchy songs from the soundtrack, and 14 deleted scenes/outtakes). Here's another suggestion: don't expect Go to be an imitation of Pulp Fiction. It isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"...A very durananged, but VERY good & funny movie!!\\"","review":"This movie is a very duranged, but VERY good & funny movie!! Katie Holmes is a very well acted CLAIRE. She brings the story to life! The movie does get confusing, but don't let it! Here's how you understand it: It starts out with the end & shoots to Ronna's night. Then back to the scene where Ronna walks in to the grocery's locker room. Then it flashes to another character's night. And so on...

While not completely poor or terrible, it just wasn't that interesting or engaging. I still hadn't figured out the plot after an hour about. The plot (if there really was one) was not coherent.

Try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can it get any worse","review":"I loved Swingers, and so, I was hoping for another great film with GO, but unfortunatly, all I got was that ugly kid from Dawson's Creek playing the same character from Dawson's Creek !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"This cinematic experience was quite horrid. This was quote masterpiece unquote got off to a sluggish start, and took the viewer through myriad of unpleasant imagery and monotonous story plot or lack thereof. The story-line seemed to go nowhere despite the fact that \\"some people\\" think this was the point, it was merely a ludicrous show of pretentious poppycock and balderdash. The acting was unseasoned and vapid. Every time Katie Holmes delivers a line the movie screeches painful halt. Mr. Tartentino probably was infuriated by the blatant plagiarism of his magnum opus, Pulp Fiction. In addition, Irvine Welsh the writer of Trainspotting, and Danny Boyle the director, may also have been offended by Go's counterfeiting of their brilliant film. Go was merely an artificial and annoying waste of time. Such videos should be avoided, and quite possibly burned in a large pile. The film was possibly as unpleasant as its soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does this movie stink? Let me count the ways.","review":"Amazon needs a rating of a negative number of stars for movies like this. There's absolutely NO plot, and therefore there is NO point. Ask any of the reviewers who liked the movie what the point of it was. They can't tell you, because it didn't have one.Since I had to give it one star as a minimum, I have to justify that star, so I'll say there was one good song on the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I find it insulting that the Director and writer(maybe one in the same) tried to pass this off as something original. It is a shame that Liman modeled it after Pulp Fiction because now Pulp is just going to get more bad press that it doesn't deserve. That was a great movie that yes, broke the rules by having a non linear screenplay that fused three stories together...however Tarantino is well schooled in cinema...and he understands the elements of characterization and screenwriting. As a result he was able to artfully take liberties and create something that was hip and stylized. Go, on the other hand reminded me of a script done by a filmstudent who pulled an allnighter: Hackneyed and cliched and sloppy. I would expect something a little better from the director and the people who gave us Swingers. But Hollywood is full of one hit wonders. Next time study the basics guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie blows!","review":"I did not like this movie at all. The cover said this was a dark comedy but I did not laugh at anything. There was a scene where a guy got laid by two chicks and there was a cool car chase but not much else. It repeats the story 3 times and that was so annoying to me. I give this movie 2 stars because I was at least entertained enough to watch the whole thing and the soundtrack was awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"PULP FICTION FORMAT DUPLICATED! WARNING! WARNING!","review":"This movie tries to capture the beat and pulse of the late nineties \\"generation\\" of teens and twenty somethings. I am a proud member of the generation X and maybe I'm either \\"too old\\" or just didn't get it. This film represents and exaggerates the styles and mentality levels of today's youth. And let me tell you, they are a disgrace! This film has characters that are drug addicts, jaded!, pretentious, phony (one white character thinks he's black...pathetic!).I did not like the style to this film either. All the boys in this film need to WASH THE HAIR GEL OUT OF THEIR HAIR, AND TRY COMBING IT. That spiky looking ninties hair is so blah I want to throw up! I can't wait until the next fashion trends get here. This movie epitomizes everything that is going wrong in America today. Columbine ring a bell? And not to mention this is a total rip off of the premise of Pulp Fiction. Get your own ideas Doug Liman!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected","review":"When I saw the trailer for this movie I asumed that the story line was going to be based around a rave scene and when I actually saw the movie, it reminded me of Pulp Fiction (style wise). I found the story line lame as ... and in reality they focused on the rave for approximately 2 minutes of the movie which disappointed me, because that part of the trailer was what got me interested to even watch the movie in the first place. I personaly would NOT recomend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"More from the Tarantino-Train","review":"Doug Liman did a WONDERFUL job of this movie. Although finding his way to step in the footsteps of my personal favorite director, Quentin Tarantino, he did it in his own unique way, focusing well on three different lifestyles of modern America. Maybe I'm overpraising to you, but I mean every word of it. Every single performance is an entertaining one. From Simon (Desmond Askew)the British grocery clerk who goes to Vegas for the weekend, to Ronna(Sarah Polley) and her friends Claire(Katie Holmes) and Manny (Nathan Bexton) and other great performances by actors like J.E Freeman, Taye Diggs, and an especially entertaining performance by Breckin Myers, this movie is definately one for the ages. I own it, and suggest you all give it a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet","review":"All 3 stories were funny and it was really good how they wee combined the acting was great the pace was perfect what more could one say"},{"rating":"1","title":"Swingers","review":"My mate Nigel 'spunky' Turner and I settled down to watch this on the couch the other night.

The sad thing about this movie is that it is unrealistic by not protraying the true life threatening consequences with decisions that involve activities that include drugs, sex and violence. What was most appauling is that it was centered around Christmas, a day meant to be filled with love and peace.

As released, there wasn't much room to take away much of a theme, other than go for the gusto, despite what it costs everyone around you.

All in all the film and the acting were of a reasonable quality, but other than a few laughs, it did not appeal to me at all.

It really captures the mood and anxiety of being a young adult in the 90's.It has 3 big things in its favor.#1: the cast. What a great cast- Sarah Polley, Katie Holmes, Scott Wolf, Jay Mohr, Timothy Olyphant and others have great chemistry together.#2: the script: funny, dramatic, great dialogue, and fresh. Basically, it is a story of generation Xer's (like myself) coming of age. They are trying to pay their bills, be independent, have relationships, and experience some excitement. Along they way they get into trouble while attending a rave party when everything goes wrong.#3: the soundtrack. The music fits perfectly with the film.If you are a gen Xer, this film will resonate with you emotionally."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the few recent movies that is very worth the time....","review":"I first watched this with four of my friends.

Of course, being a big fan of Lou Reed's work before (VU and his 70s solo work) and after (New York, Songs for Drella, Magic and Loss), I thought I couldn't miss with this album that so many people had called a masterpiece. How wrong I was. With the exception of the title track, there are no excellent songs here, and many are just plain embarassing. Women is a piece of dopey patronizing schmaltz while The Day John Kennedy Died is a ridiculous stab at optimistic insight that falls quite a few feet short of the mark. I just don't understand how people can consider these lyrics to be among his best. Lou Reed was masterful at depicting seemy underbellies and such, but he just is at a loss for decent words when he's happy. And his divorce from his then-wife shortly after this album should let you know just how sincere he was in all his loving tributes.

After a while I closed it. When tried to play again, I noticed the resolution got back to 720p. Ok, got it set to FHD again, and when clicked on \\"accept\\" it crashed to desktop. 100 times I tried, 100 times it crashed. I had to swallow the default config to be able to play.

I guess I thought Harvey Smith made some great games, so maybe this was a rough gem. Nope! Just a boring, vanilla, limited-in-every-way-possible wack-a-mole shooter. The worst part is that the weapons have literally no kick or feedback, you might as well be using a laser pointer.

The only two weapons you found yourself using was the assualt rifle and sniper rifle. I'm the kind of person that judges a shooter based on the different weapons a game gives the players, and how these different weapons offer different tactical advantages and disadvantages(metal arms was awesome), and in this regard blacksite is epic fail, in fact the original area 51 was better in this respect.

I think it is either an attempt to explain Buddhism to Psychologists in terms of psychology or an attempt to sell Psychology to followers of Buddhism using some parallels between Buddha's teachings and Psychology. But as I have read in some other books and as I believe myself spiritual experience cannot be rationalized; else anyone will become Buddha just by reading the well explained concepts in such books!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for no-thought","review":"Epstein's books are brilliant. They all form a kind of mosaic and should be read together. \\"Open to Desire\\" describes the movement to a more subject-based (as opposed to an object-based) way of being and relating; \\"Falling to Pieces\\" counsels on how to be authentic in the face of your most difficult emotions; this one is about the Buddhist concept of anatta, or no-self, as applied to psychotherapy. The idea of gradually disassembling the self, of un-becoming a person, isn't very appealing to most people. It can sound either very dull (who wants to be a nobody?) or it can be very frightening. Epstein shows how it can actually be an opening to a felt sense of aliveness, a true healing, that the ego could never deliver. His explanations are way too subtle and profound to encapsulate in a short review. But if you are interested in Buddhism and self-work, Epstein's books are a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bump Your systems","review":"Great album- that ends with a soul song called Momma.

I love the way the women connect with each other. But what Kathryn asks for as her revenge seems a little extreme to me. I know what the men did to her was horrible.

I like the books by Fern Michaels, but was a little reluctant in buying it at first because I was thinking it was going to be another romance novel and I really didn't want romance novels because of late I am more into the mystery/suspense. I am so glad I did purchase it. I cannot wait to read the rest of the books in the series. Midway through the book I am already deciding who I like. Almost cried in the beginning when Barbara was killed. The fact that it is women out to get revenge makes it even better. There is a problem with the justice system, it doesn't always work, so the idea of vigilantism with women taking the problem in their own hands makes it even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good, fast paced.","review":"I think Fern Michaels is a great writer.

Too often, I feel the sense that he's showing off his skill and just not getting to the point. Maybe I'm not the kind of reader he intended to write for, but I just don't enjoy the way he spins the stories in his novels, with the exception of Lolita. Surprisingly though, I find that his writing works well in short stories, or in this case, novellas. Quite frankly, I enjoyed the fact that the focus wasn't so much on the plot, but on the changes that the character undergoes psychologically. We take the initial premise of revisiting first love, and we see it being used as a cause for change. I'm not going to go into too much detail on major themes of the book, but I do want to put focus on one way of reading what Mary means to Ganin; yes, what spurs on the connection between the two is that of young, first love, but ultimately, it is memory, not love, that drives the man."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works sometime!","review":"I haven't had much luck with this sensor.May be it works fine in drywall only.

I followed the instructions though!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this one","review":"Do not buy this oneunless you want to pay $5.00 for the colour!! Buy the blue one from Amazon instead. They are IDENTICAL but with different prices and colour. The yellow one is $15.44 and the other is $9.99!I am sure there could be copyright issues but don't even go there. Do NOT buy the \\"Pack of three\\" as suggested by Amazon. Buy two blues ones if you want two subamarines.By the way, neither are much good actually, unless you have a bath that is 20 feet long!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"dragged me in","review":"I can't say enough about this book...and its successor The Glorious Cause. This book is what dragged in me to try to join DAR and learn all I could about the birth of our nation.Jeff tells this all in a voice that is not condescending but informs while entertaining. I feel these books are a must for any American History class or history buff. As a matter of fact I think all Americans, or those wanting to be should read these and understand the odds, the struggles, the remote chance that any rag-tag army could defeat the most formidable army on earth at the time!Exceedingly well written; I could not put it down and had to wait for The Glorious Cause!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charmingly written","review":"The author of this book accomplishes what is genuinely difficult: giving voice to figures who are both historical and beyond history. Franklin, Washington, Adams- three names that we have heard countlessly in school and as adults who are interested in history, yet who were real men with dreams, sorrows, ambitions. In this book, the thoughts of these great people are conveyed with compassion, and the novel shows us how history can unfold from everyday events. The descriptions of the Boston Massacre, Franklin's days of diplomacy in England and the Congressional debates are vivid and just plain interesting. I am already reading The Glorious Cause, so Shaara obviously hooked me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeff Shaara recounts events well.","review":"I have read several books by the author, and have not been dissapointed. This book falls into that category. His writings are well researched and presented. Looking forward to his next book due out in May."},{"rating":"2","title":"History Comes Alive","review":"I loved this book!!! It truly made history come alive. The reader got such a sense of the way life was at the time of the Revolution. WE met the characters, we talked with them, listened to them and felt their feelings as the momentous day of our independence came closer. Ben Franklin was a most interesting character. Truly well written and inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best fiction history I have ever read","review":"I am a junior in high school and i hadf to read this for summer reading and it was a great book. If you know and love American history then this book is definitely for you. It shows both the American and British view of the war, which was really different for me because I had only read about the Americans view of the war. If you like this book you should seriously pick up the sequel called \\"the Glorious Cause.\\" That book is even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Browsing in the bookstore","review":"Saw this, love all the Shaara books. Could not wait to read it. Not as exciting as the Civil War books, but a great lead in to the next one; which I bet will be fantastic. Adams (getting tired of him these days), Franklin, Jefferson, Washington- all the lead players. Could not have a better script."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent History Lesson","review":"I'm taking it on faith that, like other reviewers have said, Shaara's books are well-researched and historically accurate. I don't know because I'm not a historian. However, if that is true, then what a great way to learn about our nation's history! Like his (and his father's) other novels about the Civil War, I gained a much greater understanding of the events that led up to the Revolutionary War and the major players involved. When books like this are written, it makes reading and learning about our history more enjoyable and, therefore, gives us the motivation to actually read about it. This should be standard reading in schools across the country.I finished this book yesterday and am heading back to the bookstore today to get the sequel -- The Glorious Cause. Although I already know how it ends (we won!), I can't wait to read about how it happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding way to present history","review":"I have read the entire Civil War series by this author and his father, and each time they make history come alive. In \\"Rise To Rebellion\\" the events leading up to the American revolution are presented in a fashion that humanizes history rather than as usually found in a dry textbook. The people portrayed are seen as real persons with all their virtues and shortcomings. This is history as it should be written, suitable for all ages from high school through adulthood. It was a pleasure to read, and I could not put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary","review":"I am a huge fan of any material relating to the revolutionary period. I belive Mr. Shaara did a fine job relating the events as they actually happened. I could not put this book down until the last word was read. I recommend this book for anyone remotely interested in our founding father's or how our great country came about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pleased","review":"I have read Jeff Shaara's other war stories and hoped that this book would be just as exciting. However, I found the book slow in comparison to his others and was not pulled in enough to even finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"rise to rebellion","review":"I ordered and paid for a hardcover book and recieved a paperback with a hardcover. I read hardcover for a reason. Larger book, larger type, etc. I feel I have been \\"taken\\" by amazon and am very pissed. I will be more careful in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"History is alive","review":"Jeff Shaara is quite simply my favorite author of historical fiction. The main reason for this is his writing style is as close as one can get to being non fiction and still being a novel. Rise to Rebellion starts by giving the backdrop to the American Revolution and the beginning battles of the war itself.You will be able to see the personalities that were at workin this drama versus just the boring names and places that you learned about in school. Shaara does this for both sides of the revolution and is in no way pro America / anti British propoganda. This is history as it should be, well researched and vivid.It is also a 2-part series. The second part is called The Glorious Cause. I would highly recommend purchasing that book as well because once you finish with this one you will want to dive right into the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rise to Rebellion - A review","review":"In \\"Rise to Rebellion\\", Jeff Shaara takes his successful style from the Civil War venue to the era of the Revolutionary War. Written in a style which is more like a novel, we get to understand the persons and personalities which shaped this vital part of our nation's history. I would recommend it to any reader, particularly those who consider themselves to be students of history. As with the works of both he and his father, Shaara leaves the reader feeling that they are right on the battlefield or among the those writing the Declaration of Independence."},{"rating":"2","title":"History","review":"The Mexican War is not the most recognized part of American history atleast in the New England area. I thought the story was good but would have pefered that the characters were developed more in preperation for his follow on novels which I think, were all 5 stars.The Mexican War was condensed into one book unlike his Civil War books about specific battles. All in all a good read and a good brief insight into the Mexican War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with purchase","review":"I have just started the book, but it is excellent so far. I purchased the book used and the condition of the book was exactly as stated by the seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - even for an 'historical fiction/romance reader'","review":"I usually stay away from historical fiction that focuses on war. But this book surprised me, entertained me, and kept me extremely focused.... even through the detailed battles.I highly recommend this to any reader of history or historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"The revolution made easy!!","review":"This book was a great and easy read. The people we all read about in school are brought forth, in this book, as people we can relate to. I have always loved history but I believe that even those that do not would like this book. Mr. Shaara has put a human aspect to the characters and also why they were so ardent in their beliefs that a break from Englan was the only course. One never reads in school how there was great debate on breaking with England and starting a new nation, but Mr. Shaara brings that forth in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"DREAMY","review":"IF YOU LIKE SONGS THAT TELL STORIES, YOU WOULD LIKE THIS CD. SOME SONGS ARE HAPPY, BUT SOME SONGS ARE SAD. WHATEVER MOOD I'M IN I LOVE THIS CD. IF YOU BOUGHT THIS CD JUST FOR ONE SONG I ADVISE YOU TO LISTEN TO THEM ALL. MANY OF THEM THEY DON'T PLAY ON THE RADIO LIKE MY FAVORITE, LITTLE SISTER. THIS IS A ALLOVER GOOD CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewel...mmm... :)","review":"I don't know what CD some of these reviewers were listening to, but it sure wasn't the one I have, which is the one your viewing the page for right now. Jewel's music touches me and brings many different emotions out of me. It doesn't matter to me if some people think she needs more mature songs or she has no talent. In fact, it *is* the simplicity of her songs that I love! Simple message, strongly sung! I especially love \\"Painters\\"...Get this CD and *enjoy*! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The CD was not as great as expected","review":"I love Jewel songs on the radio, but on the CD she just seems to be singing off-key. As for the other songs (the ones that I've had the patience to listen to), they're just plain weird. The CD just wasn't Jewel's best singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewel is defenily cool! I love her CD, It is the bomb","review":"Hi all you people Jewel is top out of my three faveorite artists. Her voice is increadable and she has such a wide variaty of types of music! Every once and a while i switch favorite songs but weather I want Happy or Sad, It's always Jewel. She will keep you happy FOREVER! Luv&Tears, Cheecho"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD, but Uneven","review":"This is a good CD, but the material is uneven, so it loses a point it might have otherwise gotten. The best songs have been overplayed on the radio, and the whole album shows a diversity of style. Many of the songs have a distinctive country bent (\\"You were Meant for Me\\"), but the album manages to remain in mainstream rock. Good album, but her next release will show if she has staying power."},{"rating":"2","title":"A misunderstood masterpiece?","review":"Certainly, Jewel, who is still young yet, can occasionally veer into cliched platitudes. However, it seems that most critics and fans alike who dispense negative reviews haven't even listened to the album - probably based judgement on faulty memories of the singles in heavy radio rotation. Songs like \\"pieces of you\\" or \\"adrian\\" are lyrically as gritty and disturbing as anything being pumped out by the likes of Korn or Marilyn Manson. It seems that Jewel, being a young, attractive woman with a positive attitude, is a sitting target for the jealous venom of emotionally dead critics and listeners who think something has to be ugly to make a statement. Well, there's enough ugliness in this world (and, contrary to what many say, Jewel does not hide from this fact). But, thank you, Jewel Kilcher, for bringing us a little beauty instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's really good. The best are they lyrics.","review":"I went into the music store with the intention to buy one CD but I ended up buying Jewel instead. i didn't even know one of her songs. I enjoyed it. I almost got offended to the lyrics for \\"Pieces of You\\" but then I payed attention. She's a talented poet/writer/singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst CD of the 90s","review":"Yes, the winner is THIS CD, who, despite plenty of competition, has won (by a narrow margin) the uncoveted title. Jewel is the worst. How did this yodelmeister ever garner more than a single star in any of the reviews? P.T. Barnum was right, I guess. When she's not going all soulful and whispery--after all, as one of her song titles informs the listener, she's so \\"sensitive\\"--she's trying to get scat and Ella Fitzgerald, quite unconvincingly. She'd be hooted and pelted with rotten fish if she ever tried to pull that act at the Apollo! Sitting through this CD was like suffering through dental work--all queasy and nauseated, praying that it will end; yet, having inhaled laughing gas, getting an uncontrollable attack of the giggles during the procedure, waiting for the next moment of pain-hilarity to ensue."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was I thinking?!","review":"I bought this CD when it first came out, thinking all her songs would be as good as the ones they play on the radio. Boy, was I wrong! Most of the songs deal with drugs, sex, and violence. I think that is OK for 1 or 2 songs, but not a whole freaken' album! If you want the GOOD songs, bye the CD singles. They are less expensive and you get just the songs you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad. Bad. Bad.","review":"Here's me when the Jewel album had just been released in my local CD store: \\"Hmm, a new female folk singer, eh? Might not be too bad. Haven't heard any songs yet, but what the heck? I like woman folk singers with acoustic guitars.\\"Bad idea. Jewel's weak voice and amateurish melodies get on my nerves And all of that forced emoting about sex, drugs, violence, and...well you know, all that \\"bad stuff\\"...would be laughable if it weren't so unlistenable.Oh well. About the only thing worthwhile about Jewel CD is the jewel case."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding","review":"This is probably the worst CD that I have ever had the misfortune of buying. Granted she has three/four good songs but the rest suck! She is an idiot and her music follows suit (listen to Adrian and you will understand how dumb Jewel really is) Wow was I disappointed. ALL of her songs sound exactly the same. Alanis Morissett blows her away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please go back to your street corner","review":"Horrid. Jewel you get one star for this one. (Only Celine Dion could get no stars, if that were an option we were given). The girlish voice is annoying, the lyrics ripped straight from an angst-ridden teenager's diary. No this is definitely not for everyone. Jewel will do well in Nashville with her hurtin' songs and high-pitched wail. There is a definite lack of maturity, depth and insight here and it has taken a few good years before a lot of people have woken up and rightfully pitched this CD onto the no-talent scrapheap overflowing with bubble-gum chewing teens, Dion and Madonna et.al"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Vacant.","review":"I have to admit, I like looking at Jewel. I mean, what's not to like? She's hot...and I just adore that crooked nose and that screwy smile. And her hips. Child-bearing. Very enticing. VERY! Oh, yeah, I like Jewel. Alot. Now, if she'd only stop trying to write, that'd be nice. Because she can't write for her life. The title track on this album, 'Pieces of You,' is delivered as if she's Mother Theresa in heat. Sexy voice, but sanctimonious, self-righteous, politically-correct, insipid to the max. So bad, quite frankly, had I not known it was meant seriously, I might have thought it was a Saturday Nite Live skit. If you're looking for great female singer/songwriters of today, try Hope Sandoval (see also, Mazzy Star), Fiona Apple, Sheryl Crow, Stacey Earle, or Julie Miller. To be fair, however, Jewel does have a great voice. Too bad she has nothing of consequence to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to honesty with a purpose","review":"I was incredibly disappointed about this album. My friend lent it to me, just to see what I thought. The first time I listened to it, I loved her voice. The second time I said, let me actually listen to the lyrics, something that might be useful. Well, after hearing about her opinions of the world, which actually weren't really opinions, just questions that sounded like a five year old asking,\\"why is the sky blue?\\" I shut it off. Come on Jewel, I think you may have more intelligence than you show in this album. And if you don't I feel sorry for you. She creates solutions for problems that are unrealistic. Overall, the songs on this album go on and on and never really reach a climax. The music and melodies are weak, and the lyrics actually confuse me about whether I want to be happy that I don't fall for it, or to cry that some people actually do. For people who want music that's in your face honest, I recommend Tori Amos. Now that's music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewel's country vocie rocks!","review":"I've always been a big fan of Jewel. Her songs are great too! The song \\"Little sister\\" talks about drugs and stuff. \\"Foolish games\\" is kinda sad cause it talks about how someone broke Jewel's heart. You'll love this song.Make sure to see her new album \\"This way\\" with the new hit single \\"Standing still!\\" Well, please purchase this album?It's really good, and I know if you get this album you'll feel so happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"near me always","review":"near you always is the best jewel song in her career. just this song deserve to bought the album. this is her first album and her best one, the songs come from her hart and we can understand that by listening to all the songs on the album. thank you jewel."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her better albums","review":"This album is classic Jewel; with her traditional \\"why can't we accept everyone the way they are\\" songs and some unique and heartfelt ballads thrown in. \\"Near You Always\\" is by far my favorite track. It's definitely a CD worth buying, you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut CD!","review":"This is one of my favorite CD's. Just goes to show that the pop world now is just plain un-original. Where are the modern day Jewel's and Blus Traveler's? Not to mention the self-exiled Hootie and the Blowfish. Anyways I love this CD it brings back so many good memories. My favorite songs on the CD are of course the ones that were released (\\"Who Will Save Your Soul\\", \\"You Were Meant for Me\\", \\"Foolish Games\\") and the non-released \\"I'm Sensitive\\" and \\"Little Sister.\\" Though the songs on the album are different then the radio, I actually like it better because I sometimes get tired of the radio's versions...and if you want the radio versions you can just get the CD single or Download them. It's not rocket science! LOL Anyways if you enjoyed Jewel's songs and want more of an acoustic feel and want to be reminiscent of the days where Pop music was not totally Dead, check out Jewel's \\"Pieces of You\\": A true example of modern day talent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good effort","review":"I like Jewel as much as the next person. I admire her talents, songwriting abilities and uber-poetic phrasing. '03's shockingly pop-like 0304 is NOT the folksy lived-in-a-van girl that we once all knew with her haunting ballads \\"Foolish Games\\" and \\"Hands,\\" but here on her 1995 debut Pieces of You it becomes crystal clear: Jewel is IT. She has a sound reminiscent of her native Alaska and can compose soft sit-on-your-porch-and-strum-your-guitar melodies. Jewel's music is perfectly suited for listeners who'd like to just sit in their favorite chair with a cup of coffee, read a book and just mooch to the music. No wonder she played in coffeehouses - she's perfect for that mood and lifestyle, especially heard in \\"You Were Meant For Me.\\" Though her overtly poetic-ness can spoil the mood at times, it is her raw, fresh sound that pulls this record through. Pieces of You is indeed a boxful of Jewel's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic album","review":"I bought this album somtime ago and found jewels words to be as inspirational and personal as they are in her poetry. Pieces of you is an album of fantastic acoustic tracks that take me back to many evenings spent listening to live artists in bars who have often credited this album as one of their inspirations for playing. Like all music it won't be to everyones taste but then it is always worth trying somthing new, pieces of you deserves a place in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but ....","review":"A good collection of folk stories which shows this lady knows how to grab the attention. I like the sparseness of the arrangements and \\"Adrian\\" and \\"Painters\\" are wonderful tracks amongst a selection of studio and live tracks (very brave - and it works). The only downside is that sometimes her voices becomes too intense and starts to fray at the edges.I totally disagree with the previous reviewer. He is entitled to his opinion, but if Jewel started the trend he describes (of talentless artists who think they are talented) and then says she is copying Joni Mitchell, then Joni must have started the trend...and she is a massive talent.This album is a pretty good start and she got better with the next couple of albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"An artist with a social conscience","review":"The woman is sexy, smart and ethical. Did I mention she is also extraordinarily talented ? This is another album that gets the tears flowing. Some of the songs are heartbreakingly sweet and sad. Some are just sad, and honest. Some are just adorable. She runs the spectrum here. And again, I am a better human being for having experienced it. She has a little girl voice somehow, but she grabs your heart and squeezes. Be careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wishing","review":"I alway's had a problem with this CD, some songs released on this cd are different versions than the song's played on the radio ( the radio versions are better)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pieces of \\"Jewel\\".","review":"Despite the fact that this had a few hits like \\"You Were Meant For Me\\", \\"Foolish Games\\", and \\"Who Will Save Your Soul\\", most of this album is not radio friendly. It's good, but mostly kind of pop-folk. Just her, singing/talking her poetry over acoustic guitar. Most of the songs are very pretty and pleasing. I like \\"Adrian\\" and \\"I'm Sensitive\\" alot. \\"Angel Standing By\\" is another standout. Many of them do kind of blend together though. Still, if you like that cute-young-girl-singing-in-a-coffee-house sound, you should love this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleeaaaaaaseeeeee!","review":"Today there are lot of untalented artist that claim they arereally talented such as Avril Lavigne and Vanessa Carlton and those kind og garbage. The one who started that was Jewel. This girl from Texas or whatever made this album which has probably one of the most non-exicting collection of songs ever put on an album before. Her voice is not very good and when she sings it's like she has a fever or something and has just thrown up. It's that bad. The music isn't very interesting. She is clearly copying Joni Mitchell ( who is another overrated singer, but has created some amazing songs). The lyrics are not good either and knowing that over 11 million people bought this album just shows how the music industry is becoming more like a circus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"This album reeks of pretentiousness. Most of the songs are overwritten and just too damn serious. Jewel has a gorgeous voice but this doesn't do it for me. Come back brighter...and lighten up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas Album Fantastic","review":"Jewel's Christmas Album, JOY, is a joy to listen to. Her beautiful voice catches your attention through the entire CD. On the other hand, this album was not at all a pleasure to listen to. All she does is tell weird stories in song. All the songs sound the same. Jewel, do more albums like your Christmas album. It is a jewel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is pure garbage.","review":"I wouldn't be surprised if this was the worst CD in my collection. For some odd reason I thought it would be a good idea to get my first Jewel CD and this one should be it. I don't understand how anyone could sit through this whole CD because it's boring, pointless and a big waste of time. Not to mention 13 or so bucks down the drain.Who Will Save Your Soul and You Were Meant For Me are this CDs best tracks. Foolish Games isn't bad either. But sadly, it wasn't enough to save us from the other tracks' suckage.The worst part is that almost all of the songs sound the same.1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"jewel cusses too much","review":"why do you have to cuss in these songs? i don't understand. i'm glad her newest album, 'This Way' bombed on the billboard charts compared to her previous albums. she's getting worse! just think...step by step she might actually fade out of the spotlight soon, and she will not be cussing any more. her bad self. she is so bad, i am telling you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A crown \\"drool\\" of an album","review":"Jewel's attempt at a pop gem is a complete, utter and wholly unmitigated failure. The songs all sound the same, her lyrics are sad at best and insulting at worst. Should be a hit with the less intelligent end of the Pre-Teen demographic. Saps. Ignore this album and her poetry book as well, spend your money on the new Kenny G album instead! He has better hair and lyrics..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: NOT what you hear on the radio/videos.","review":"I listened to the singles from this album, \\"Foolish Games\\", and \\"You Were meant For Me\\" on the radio and on VH1 and loved them so much I figured the album was worth buying for these two alone. I stand by that thought. The problem is that when you actually GET the album, it's like some sort of horrible bait and switch! The songs are the same, but the recordings are different. The accompanying music (especially in Foolish Games) that sounds so melodic and beautiful on the radio and in the music videos now sound entirely mediocre, as do the rest of the songs. I was SO dissapointed. Thank God for mp3's."},{"rating":"1","title":"did i mention she sounds like a five year old?","review":"jewel, you have a magnificent voice. so lets get some lyrics in there that actually mean something? 'i break the yolks to make a smiley face'? jesus, if i wanted to hear that, i would turn on some weird al. there is little diversity in songs, and her voice (actually very good) is often reduced to a soft moaning. that was my exact reaction i had by the second time i had heard this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Jewel's first, and best, album is strikingly honest and poetic. She has a pretty voice that compliments the songs perfectly. It's a shame that she went so downhill, with the atrocious 0304 and not-quite-there This Way. Hopefully she will channel the talent that is so evident here into making another worthwhile album before her career ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic Voice But Weird Songs","review":"I bought this album when \\"You were meant for me\\" came out having liked \\"Who will save your soul\\" before that and loving the latest single. I was really disappointed. The rest of the album is nothing like the previously mentioned singles plus the beautiful \\"Foolish Games\\" the last single released from the album. Her voice is positively amazing but apart from the three singles the songs were not my taste. The best word i can think of to describe them is weird. I think her lyrics are much better as poems and just don't work as songs. But hey, its just my opinion and obviously she appeals to many people. I must say that her second album \\"Spirit\\" is much much better. The songs are great and her voice is even better especially on \\"Enter From the East\\". So, if you are buying this album going by the success of the 3 singles I'd tell you to get \\"Spirit\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like sitting through a high school poetry reading","review":"Virtually the entire album can be summed up in one word: TRITE. Is Jewel a poet? Yes. Is she trying to wrestle with big concepts? Sometimes. Is she honest and simple about her feelings? Sure. But does it make for good music? Not on this album. It reminds me of some very earnest but amateurish and unbearable bands I saw in high school and college. This is the kind of music that inspires characters like John Belushi's \\"Bluto\\" in Animal House to grab the guitar from the singer's hands and bash it to bits on the staircase.There is one exception: the first track, \\"Who Will Save Your Soul?\\" is excellent. I bought this CD when I first heard this song, before anyone had even heard of \\"You Were Meant for Me,\\" and I still love it. But the rest of the album is terrible. Every once in a while I dust it off and give it another listen, but it never gets any better. This one's destined for the used CD shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crossover Country","review":"The artist Jewel is really a country- pop crossover, sent in several years after its actual 19994 release to clean up MTV and be the main American-Euro rock star. Her material here is incredibly simple, not even basic folk music. A following release This Way just defined country, but this here is the major label debut. I like it, not love it, This Way is much better, it just defined country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songwriter, serious musician","review":"Getting away from the typical \\"diva\\" category that many female vocalists are limited to, Jewel is a serious musician, singer, song-writer, and shows a depth to her style that indicates serious study of her craft.She Brings a fresh, easy sound that has a light acoustic instrumental drive, allowing the lyrics to stand out and be appreciated. Not beautiful, happy songs, but songs with soul. Jewel's vocal style shows influence from diverse artists such as Joni Mitchel and Bob Dylan."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful and honest","review":"Defenatly Jewel's finest, Pieces of you is very powerful with strong, honest, and sometimes brutal lyrics, the best example of this is in the title track \\"Pieces of You\\" lyrics like \\"You say he's a jew, do you wanna kick his face in?\\" the whole album is wonderful and moving"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut by Jewel!","review":"I must say that this CD is GREAT! Most of the songs were recorded live and just have a gritty soul feeling about them. ALL the songs on this album are great! Her writing might seem a little naive, but its still great writing. It rips at your emotions and just makes people feel human. Its, simply put, a great CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewel is ... hard to take","review":"If I were going to slit my wrists, sit in the bathtub, and feel sorry for myself for a while, this is the album I would put on. Get over yourself, babe. You can sing, but you're as yet to write a song that doesn't make all those vocal histrionics embarassingly empty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try","review":"People, please stop reviewing albums in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE YELLING AND UNDERMINES YOUR CREDIBILITY BECAUSE YOU LOOK LIKE A HYSTERICAL TEENAGER. Now, as for Jewel, she has an odd voice that wavers between opera, little girl, and kermit the frog. Her lyrics are mostly depressing, and her attempts to paint herself as an outsider in the press are contradicted by this thoroughly-in-the-nineties-zeitgeist recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"a psuedo-poet's attempt at hitting it big time...","review":"This has got to be some of the worst music I have ever heard. Not only does Jewel manage to turn such trivialistic matters as leaving the cap off the toothpaste tube into a life and death situation, but the lyrics are incredibly melodramatic, evoking the same drama any kindergartener is apt to exhibit after realizing mom mixed the jelly with the peanut butter on his sandwich. Every now and then one hears some glimmering hint of decent musicianship, but overall Jewel is just a would-be poet attempting to sell her b.s. poetry on record to a music scene already riddled with nonsensical,untalented,playground angst. I only gave her two stars because she at least is good looking..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pair of catchy singles don't a decent album make","review":"With a pair of catchy singles, Jewel's debut offers some promise, but, burdened with lots of filler, is unable to deliver the goods. Those who seem to have her pegged as the great female folkie hope, would do much better to look into the works of Tracy Chapman, Michelle Shocked and Lucinda Williams.Better luck next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think that Jewel's CD Peices of you is one of the best .","review":"I love this Cd. I listen to it when I'm studying or as I'm going to bed or if I just want to relax. She so bold about the world in her songs . It's very neat(EX The song Ugly girl)Although as much as I like it , it is somewhat depressing to listen on how the world is through her eyes a song that reminds me of this is (Adrian) but I still think she's an amazing singer/songwriter. She 's got talent . I like her soo much that I bought her newest Cd Spirit.It's really good too. Almost better than the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I love all of Jewel's music, have bought this album 3 times trying to obtain the album version of You Were Meant For Me and had no success until now.... great, love it, rock on Jewel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cd that lets you listen at anytime and feel good!","review":"I love this CD and I never stop listening to it. I have favorite songs but I do not dislike any of the other ones. I think I really enjoy \\"Little Sister\\" and \\"Adrian\\" the best. Some of the songs are depressing but some make me happy. Whatever mood I am in, I can always listen to this CD over and over again. I DEFINITLY THINK THAT EVERYONE SHOULD GO OUT AND BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A few good songs","review":"I got the CD for my birthday. I thought it would be good because \\"Who Will Save Your Soul\\" was good. I saw the video on VH1. But when I actually listened to it I found out for the most part the CD sucked. The only songs I really liked were \\"Who Will Save Your Soul\\", \\"I'm Sensitive\\", \\"Near You Always\\", \\"You Were Meant For Me\\" and \\"Morning Song\\". The rest sucked. If you are thinking of buying this CD I suggest you just borrow it and record the songs you like on a tape. I wish I had gotten a different CD for my birthday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This is Jewel's first CD and I enjoyed it especially Foolish Games and You Were Meant For Me. I can't wait for her latest."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent intoduction to become a Jewel fanatic","review":"Jewel you are such an inspiration to so many people and your music speaks to us.\\"Pieces of You\\" inparticular is an album that clearly demonstrates your abilities not only as a singer- musician but as a poet.I have enjoyed your other albums as well...your poetry is very much enjoyed by all and we are Jewel fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still My Favorite","review":"Jewel's debut is still my favorite work from her. This recording, with a mix of studio and live work shows the artist/songwriter that first caught my attention. Her unique vocals on Save Your Soul and lovely interplay with cello on Foolish Games still reaches a very personal level for a performer. Her expressive style is an extension of Joan Baez and leads into new artists such as Mary Bristow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous debut","review":"What a fabulous album. Jewel not only has a beautiful voice, but she can play guitar, and has a knack of writing wonderful songs about real life. 'Pieces of You' has very intelligent and truthful lyrics to it. More people should pay attention to the lyrics of her songs. 'Painters' and 'Adrian' will bring tears to your eyes, 'Daddy' will send chills down your spine, others are warm love songs, but all have a story to tell in the true folk tradition if not quite the true folk style."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the heart","review":"When someone puts all his or her heart into a work, the outcome is always something special. But when you also have talent like Jewel in this case, the result can be breathtaking. Songs like \\"Foolish Games,\\" \\"Who Will Save Your Soul\\" and most other songs on this CD just touch your heart as they come from the heart. Especially at her age at that time, these songs speak volumes of what moves her emotionally as these songs will also move every listener. The craft of songwriting is very well demonstrated on this excellent album and the sound is fresh and unique to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to like it...","review":"I just can't. Jewel really tries with this album. Her potential is clearly there. The problem is that these aren't songs - they're poems. As such, they just don't work set to music. The themes themselves are, at least in a few cases, interesting and important. I'm just not sure that Jewel has anything new to say about them. And while the guitar playing isn't bad, it does seem repetitive after a while. All the songs sound the same (save for Meant for Me and Foolish Games).Little Sister, Daddy and Pieces of You are really underappreciated songs, probably because the themes are controversial. That said, they aren't so well done to warrant buying the album. Of course, Meant for Me and Foolish Games are wonderful. The rest is iminently forgetable. The good stuff from here will be on a greatest hits CD, or can be acquired through a CD single, or a compilation CD. Get Spirit instead, or listen to other folkie types like Tracy Chapman, Tori Amos, or Ani DiFranco."},{"rating":"1","title":". . . z z z z z z z z z z z","review":"Listen up Jewel fans. If you want to hear a female singer who is full of poetry, maturity, and relevance, check out Joni Mitchell. She's been the queen of folk for 30 years for a very good reason - she has TALENT."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Good Song and a Demo Tape","review":"I bought this album because of the for the one song that was on the radio. The one song was wonderful and obviously professionally written and produced. The rest of the album sounded like a self-indulgent demo tape. It sounded like she was in her room singing to her barbie dolls. Nothing is worse than a talented musician with nothing to say.Jewel and her friends have fooled me for the last time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please! Take this off my hands!","review":"I sympathize with the person who threw this away in disgust. I got this for Christmas. What were they thinking!? I tried to return it to the cd store, and they wouldn't give me a dime for it. I tried to give it to some friends: they said \\"eeewwwwww\\" - no, thank you. I don't know any bubble-headed sentimental fourteen year old girls, I guess.Jewel is the folk version of the Spice Girls. I like the Spice Girls better: they try to dance, and don't pass off banalities as revelation.Yucky yucky cd. Crummy lyrics. Consistently annoying. Shallow. Silly. Weepy. Gooey. Childish. Dumb. You get the idea...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad","review":"The additional \\"bads\\" were necessary because this system forces me to give it at least one star.This is perhaps the worst music recorded in the past ten years. Childish pap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pieces of crap","review":"My friend bought this CD and then threw it in the trash a few days later. After listening to it at the music store I can see why. Jewel sounds like Tiffany with a guitar, or a Tiffany for the 90s, whichever way you want to see it. The only thing about her is that she writes her own lyrics. Unfortunately, those lyrics are of the teenage diary type. She offers up observations like \\"You were meant for me/And I was meant for you.\\" That's so profound it belongs on that \\"Really Deep Thoughts\\" skit on Saturday Night Live. I'm sorry, but I prefer to hear a WOMAN's voice. Jewel sounds like she should be doing voice-overs for Sesame Street. While Pieces of You is well intentioned, it is so full of saccharine it makes me want to vomit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating album of the year or maybe decade","review":"This is the only CD I've ever purchased that I threw away in disgust. Only for the die-hard fans of Jewel. There's just two or three songs that don't sound like they were written (and sung) by a 10th grade high school kid who just broke up with her boyfriend. If you love her voice (and I do!), but hate sophmoric angst or treacle, buy her CD single."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really a review, just a comment","review":"This is the BEST damn coaster ever. The music? It's like you've heard it all before, but now it's said in a way that's both cloying and tone deaf all at the same time. I guess if I had to live in a car, I'd recycle bad 70's a.m. radio and sell my soul too. But hey, if you've got condensation running down the side of your beer can, just throw this baby under it and leave the water-stains for another day. P.S. One of my cats killed himself after listening to this album. I love you, Fluffy, wherever you are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good voice bad music","review":"Although Jewel has a very lovely voice her CD is summed up in the title above. I got her CD after I heard her music on the radio but when I listened to it the songs weren't even the same versions that I'd heard before. And as for the rest of the songs, they all sounded the same and the horrific lyrics made me instantly hit the stop button. Especially the song \\"Daddy\\". After listening to that one I felt like saying \\"Shame on you, Jewel! Shame! Shame!\\" I don't listen to it at all now, and if you don't like lyrics that make you want to put your hands over your ears then don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a sleeper","review":"This CD is boring as hell. I bought it because I liked 'You Were Meant For Me', but that's the only song worth listening to. All the other songs are painfully slow, and each and every song sounds exactly like the one before. It's pure torture to sit through this CD, so save yourself some money and don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you heard on the radio","review":"I should had come here for the reviews before buying the CD. I liked what is played on the radio, that raspy, halting manner of hers is what sets her apart and what hooked me. In this CD, I agree with other reviewer, she's just a 90s version of Tiffany and the arrangement here isn't catchy for this pop guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why???","review":"When I bought this CD, I felt I was cheated for they made different editions of \\"Foolish game\\" and \\"You mean to me\\" which sound very good on radio. I was so disappointed. I just can't understand this, it's really weird and I never met before. Jewel, if it's not your will, how could you stand this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"a perfect blend of compasion, vision and laughter.","review":"Jewel has a soft spoken but powerful voice in her songs. She has a perfect blend of compasion, vision and laughter that everyone can enjoy. Saying things that are often felt but seldom said is hard enough without making it sound as wonderful as Jewel does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, beautiful songs with personality","review":"Jewel lovers and haters abound- which is a shame, because the album itself is so simple, it doesn't really need as much hype as its gotten, be it positive or negative. I love it, but I'm only one person. I listen to Lilith Fair types like Fiona Apple, Beth Orton, Sarah McLachlan, and alternative folkies like Ani DiFranco, and similar stuff, but I have a friend who listens to Metallica religiously and loves Jewel. It's worth a shot to give this a try, at least. It offers nothing particularly profound, and I would be inclined to dislike it if it hadn't immediately entrenched itself into my psyche the way it did. Best for rainy, quiet days with a blanket and some tea, this can be listened to straight through, is refreshingly flawed rather than over-produced, and can evoke a mood, which the latest trend of teen pop sell outs fail to do. I highly recommend it, with the full knowledge that my personal opinions aren't worth anything to anyone but myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this one and the next seems even better!","review":"How could you not love the smoth voice of Jewel. She has made a life long set of folk and smooth ryutm and blues mix. This is one of the CD's of the 20th centery that will never be forgotten. With the new CD she has put out and this new CD Jewel has said it all in very song. A filrty voice, lerics that could touch any soul and looks that make a churib look like a devil, Jewel is by far the best out there right now to experss the generation and the over flow of feelings we have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"This CD is great. Many people say that it is too depressing but the things she sings about are the truth in the world today. She has an amazing voice. It's a great CD to listen to. I bought it the week it came out and still listen to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimaginative","review":"Many of Jewel's singing reminds me of a bad amateur coffe-house folk singer, with a lot of forced emoting and overwrought melodies about not a whole lot other than found love, lost love, and other typical topics.And am I the only one that thinks that the chorus of \\"You Were Meant For Me\\" sounds a whole lot like that old Kenny Loggins \\"Even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with ya honey\\" song?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Word \\"AWESOME\\"","review":"I really like this album. Jewel is an extrodniary singer and song writer. I like the issues she writes about like love,hope,and hatred. She is very talented. I have listened to this C.D. over and over again and still LOVE IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is a terrible CD. The songs that they play on the radio every half an hour are great but the other ones on the CD are not worth your time listening to them. I could not decide if Adrian or I'm Sensitive ranks as the worst song of all time. There is a reason that her album sat on the shelves for more than a year before MTV started playing them and she became popular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewels undesribably emotional sound will captivate you","review":"Its Jewels ability to show raw and uncensored emotion that makes her the terrific musician she is. Her debut album is beyond great it is spellbounding. Her music is not only for your ears, it will play in your heart. Jewel will captivate you with her enticing lyrics and truely emotional rythms. I reccomend that everyone go out and buy this cd, and then buy the other one. It will be the best money you spend."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think it was too depressing","review":"I do like Jewel.

But they are good."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love it!","review":"when i listened to peices of you i was astonished. never had i heard vocals to be so thought provoking yet touching at the same time. jewel's songs are honest and are about human nature. she combines folk with pop with poetry. and it's a wonderful combination. two thumbs up to jewel! it's a shame we didn't notice her ealyer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but goodie","review":"This is a great CD for relaxing. Its has some very gritty songs full of emotion and beauty. Breakthrough early Jewel Cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"With Strong Lyrics and a Nice Voice....","review":"With Strong Lyrics and a Nice Voice Jewel's debut album remains, in my opinion, her very best. Her poetic lyrics are deep and personal and they are set to the acoustic guitar, which she plays very well. Coming from someone who does not particularly like the genre of pop, I found this cd to be beyond my expectations. Other albums put out by her, particularly the newest ones, lost it's acoustic charm and meaningful lyrics. I recommend purchasing this album before her others. It relly is the only one worth buying. From one who likes very much lyrics that reach down into the soul as much as they can, through the deep words of artists such as Kurt Cobain, I do recommend this album if you would like to get away from trashy pop and into something more meaningful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fabulous","review":"Now, I don't usually like folkish music. I'm a huge fan of loud rock music (with some exceptions). My friend was moving away, and they were giving some CD's away, and my mom brought Jewel's CD home. I'd never really liked her that much. I'd go through stages where I'd like her, and then I just didn't really care. It took me a while (at least a couple months) to actually play the album, but when I did I was really impressed, more then I thought I'd be.It has a lot of her likeable, famous singles \\"You Were Meant For Me\\", \\"Who Will Save Your Soul\\", \\"Foolish Games\\", and tons of other fantastic ones that never made the top 40.She can really write songs. She's amazing. She has a very good voice. I don't really like the fact she recently became more pop-ish, but then again, a lot of singers are these days.It's a very good album, I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great variety of Jewel. Very expressive and heartfelt","review":"The CD \\"Pieces of you\\" is a remarkable collection of songs. The album's namesake song is complex, blunt, and heartfelt...a great mixture of what you expect to hear in Jewel and her genre of music. The famous song title- Foolish Games is also on the album. It lives up to all expectations and perhaps goes a little beyond. Jewel puts her entire soul into her music, and the way she performs this song leaves you awestruck. If it were any longer, it would bring those of the sensitive heart to tears. My personal favorite is Near You Always a non-love song : ) it inspires me to stay single. But I also think that Adrian has impressive lyrics.Probably the best on the album (in terms of effect and meaning, and connection to the listener) The first time I heard it I nearly cried. Well, I could go on...but the entire CD is just inexplicably awesome : ) buy it buy it buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If her voice had matured....","review":"before the creation of this album - every song would be worth listening to a million times a day (if possible). The only thing I am going to say is this - what you hear on the radio off of this CD will NOT sound like what you get on this CD. Buy the singles if you want, but her second album is FAR better."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply the best","review":"wow, this is the purest & sincere album i have ever come across. she is talented! she should earn a Grammy for her work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Inauspicious Beginning","review":"I orinally bought Spirit after hearing of Jewel and listening to \\"Hands\\" while Michelle Kwan was skating to it. I was impressed enough to seek out other material by Jewel. In her debut album, she shows her immaturity as she comes across as an angst-ridden teenager (which she may well have been when she wrote many of the songs). She may relate well to you if you are also an angst-ridden teenager, but this is unlikely to play well with an older audience. At least based on this album, I would not compare her favorably with such other contemporary sing-songwriters as Beth Nielsen Chapman, Richard Schindell, or Dar Williams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny as hell","review":"I don't know what to think about all the previous reviews for this piece of drivel. I feel almost sad for a generation of teenagers that thinks this is the deepest emotional sentiment they can find. I will say her voice is heavenly. If she could just drag herself out of the 60s, maybe she can make some real music. Since I've been a fan of people who can real lyrics like Neil Peart (Rush) and Peter Gabriel, it's a big disappointment to see how popular meaningless crap like this has become. I'll really like Jewel if she grow up and puts some real meaning into her songs, but for now I won't waste my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid boring tone-deaf and off-key sung childish lyrics","review":"I must say, I got this CD as a birthday present but... what an appalling performance.

I think is BAD BAD BAD too! (Sorry!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Jewel in this Crown","review":"My first experience listening to Jewel was actually in concert. She opened for Edwin McCain and as it seemed, more people were there for her, though I couldn't understand why. Then I realized. They wanted to hear her do everything but sing. Talk about being from Alaska, not sing. Speak her \\"songs\\", not sing. YODEL, not sing. Like many before her (insert 80's female pop star here), Jewel is just hitting at the right time. Her songs (both spoken and sung) are nothing but simple little jaunts, one liners turned into short but boring stories. (\\"Who Will Save Your Soul\\" and \\"You We're Meant For Me\\") Pieces of You demonstrates exactly how, given the right mixture of looks, promotion and timing, a person like Jewel (and enough with the one name thing already) can soar without having a ton of ability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sell What You Advertise","review":"This was the first CD I bought only to find that most of the songs getting airplay were not the same on the album. This is not only irritating but false advertising by the DJ's that continuously play these songs (and I liked the songs) to get you to buy the album only to listen to watered-down acoustic versions. No wonder there are so many \\"used\\" Jewel CD's out there. Mine is one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!","review":"How can anyone listen to this fodder? Ani Difranco absolutely destroys her on every level. Jewel's nursery-rhyme lyrics about toothpaste and pj's are nauseating to say the least.

On top of that those two are light years ahead of her in the songwriting department."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pocket-sized positive","review":"In Attitude 101, Maxwell outlines his key thoughts on the importance of a positive attitude from his earlier (and larger) books.

It would be a good graduate's gift.The whole book is a quick read, almost outline in format and delivery, full of Maxwell's trademark memorable and applicational illustrations. Hard core cynics and others with superiority issues may sniff at it, but real people will benefit from it. Superior cynics are never leaders anyway.Buy a few, and give them out.

It comes in a compact format and is a quick read. The content on the other hand is full size. Attitude 101 really covers all angles regarding attitude. The book is broken down into three sections:I. The impact of Attitude- How does attitude impact leadership?- How does attitude impact the individual?II. The formation of attitude- What shapes a person's attitude?- Can attitude be changed?- Can obstacles actually enhance an attitude?III. The future with the right attitude- What is failure?- What is success?- How can a leader keep climbing?Attitude 101 really covers all the bases from the impact of attitude to the formation of attitude to how the right attitude can change your future.

But do not be fooled by the need to complete your personal naval library. I am not knowledgeable in all the campaigns described but the chapters concerning the south american wars are waste and I have my doubts about the japanese civil war.

Hearing this voice is much needed in American political discourse, and the public would benefit if the media covered events in line with Zinn's approach.At the very least, Zinn is honest about his approach and bias, and indeed admits that no history can be told without bias.

He explores little known and frequently disregarded aspects of the American experience.The only criticism I have of this work is that, since it covers more than half a millenia of history in one volume, it can be a little overwhelming. Perhaps a less ambitious focus, say of a hundred years, could offer more in depth coverage of the events and personalities involved.

My problem with it is threefold, but simple:1. Mr. Zinn does not seem to grasp basic economics or political science.2. Mr. Zinn's historiography is spurious at best.

When that magician is killed, Skeeve has to find a way to save his own life and find justice for his mentor.Aahz: a Pervert, (oops make that Pervect), a demon rendered powerless by a practical joke gone awry.Tanda: A beautiful, voluptuous green haired assassin with a firey temper and wicked sense of humor.And Gleep: A loveable but dumb baby dragon.This book is ideal not only for fans of fantasy but for humor fans as well.

It's that good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You or your child will be happy with this book","review":"Another Fine Myth is a fun book to read for your child. If you have someone in your life that is about at the age where they might pick up Harry Potter or if they are looking for something akin to it, this is a good direction to turn. I feel that Asprin modeled these books on the old Hope and Crosby \`Road' flicks. The banter between Skeeve and Aahz (the two main characters) is quite enjoyable. The worlds that Asprin creates are also very imaginative and fun to encounter.This is quite an engrossing book and wont tire you no matter what your age as long as you have a sense of humor and a bit of wonder left in your heart.Other series' in line with this would be the \`Stainless Steel Rat' by Harry Harrison, and the \`Xanth series' by Piers Anthony"},{"rating":"2","title":"Start Here and discover a series you will cherish","review":"I am reading this series through once again.

Whenever I find that I do not have enough to laugh about, I can read about the misadventures of Aahz and Skeeve and count on having a good, whole-hearted chuckle.

As for my darling Golden boys (18 months and 2 1/2, 90 lbs each), they had a very, did I mention very, minimal amount of ice buildup after a 1 mile hike. I am very impressed. My only suggestion to improve the application of Mushers Secret Paw Protector would be that the container be wide enough to rub the bottoms of their feet in it to facilite the process.

Figgis directing this Strindberg work, however, never manages to let us forget that we must be watching a play. What does work here though is a powerful tale of how sex is used in the battle against the class system and in the war between the sexes. Miss Julie, one of John the footman's employers, goes after him sexually one night, despite his being already engaged. The rest unfolds from there.

I think part of the problem was that it was adapted from a play, and I prefer films that develop character like in novels. It was very slow and completely devoid of character development. Explanations of the characters' motivations were practically nonexistent and seemed rather arbitrary.While highly literary people might like this movie, I think anyone who enjoys a real story should avoid it. To be fair, though, the acting was good; my problem with the movie is entirely due to the material. If in doubt, rent it first to make sure you want to own it.

For instance, there is a \\"chapter\\" (ie 2 pages) about the biochemistry of the body, where the author says you can become \\"cleaner\\" and \\"tighter\\" on a cellular level by eating raw foods, but never explains what those words means (I suspect it's because he doesn't know). Half the book is an interview with Dr. Fred Bisci, which I found interesting.

The body is hard to identify, clothing tags are ripped out - but there are distinct tattoos on the toes...Despite being warned off investigating the body dump, Gunther follows the leads. And his life is turned upside down. Soon Gunther is under suspicion... who has he crossed?But the promising beginning quickly descends into convoluted chaos. The people behind the crime are thinly written and cartoonish. The writing is hard to follow and motivations seem invented out of whole cloth instead of being able to be contributed to the characters. The long connection between Joe and Gail is tested which seems an unnecessary drag on that fragile relationship.An amateurish offering from someone as skilled as Mayor has proven himself to be ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Archer Mayor really write this book?","review":"Having read and enjoyed most of Mayor's earlier works, I was prepared to sit back and enjoy a good plot sited in a scenic part of New England. But this attempt to entertain fell far short of Mayor's past books. Hence the title review blurb. The plot and character development are convoluted and inane, and it seems to have been written more for a \\"Die Hard -3\\" audience than for readers who like a bit of credibility in their mystery novels. Come on, Archer, you can do better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistent Mayor fare...","review":"This latest entry in the Joe Gunther series is a worthy successor to the previous installments. Once again, the small town of Brattleboro, Vermont is in the midst of an unexplainable crime, and the locals are on the case, only this time it is Joe himself who comes under suspicion, and has to work to save his career and reputation. The story, tho' tinged with intrigue, is believable, and Mayor's depiction of small-town Vermont and its people is once again dead-on. Mayor is one of a few who have really crafted outstanding series based upon small-town law enforcement (others being Stephen Havill for New Mexico and Gerry Boyle for rural Maine).

Drury, who began as a Senate reporter, really has the feel of the Senate down pat as he tells the story of the nomination of Robert Leffingwell, a one-time communist sympathizer, to be the Secretary of State at the height of the Cold War.While Drury's later writing became somewhat stilted and out-of-touch, this book is dead on and creates real and believable characters.A fun game, for those really in the know, is to try and guess which fictional Senator corresponds to which real-life Senator from the era.(A freebie- Brigham Anderson of Utah is reportedly based on John F.

At the end of each chapter we reflect on the events and incorporate them into our own life experiences.

Freak, however hilariously funny it is (and it won't disappoint on this end), has a much more serious tone, and those who have followed his work for years will find its brutal honesty as piercingly painful as it is profoundly entertaining. I remember seeing Spic-o-Rama live in a small NYC theatre in the early 90's and although this is a much higher-budget production (now featuring a major star) it retains the same gritty, bare bones style that keeps Leguizamo at the center of the performance. It certainly won't disappoint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"John Leguizamo is a effin laugh riot! I love his style of comedy because it is a mix of comedy and drama.

The science was very thoroughly explained (and I can see why a reviewer called it a textbook on neutron star physics cleverly disguised as a sci-fi novel), but it never felt like too much to me. To the contrary, in fact: I loved the descriptions of how chemistry would work in a neutron star environment, where the orbital shells of the protons and neutrons interacted with each other the same way electron shells do in normal matter. Finally, without spoiling it, the ending was fantastic, and by itself made reading the story worthwhile.I would recommend this book to any fan of hard science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life on a neutron star","review":"What if there were intelligent creatures living on the surface of a neutron star, one that's twenty kilometers in diameter with a surface gravitation 67 billion times that of the earth? Robert Forward thinks through, in great detail, what such creatures and their history and civilization might be like, and he tells a good story about the cheela (as they are called) and their interactions with some human explorers--interactions complicated by cheela's and humans' vastly different experiences of time.Highly recommended for fans of hard science fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting science, but um...where's the storytelling?","review":"I read Dragon's Egg years ago, when it first came out, and found the physics imaginative but the characters & plot laughable.

In this respect, I don't have any complains. Though written before the microcomputers revolution, and thus completely missing it like everyone else in the world, this is a book whose limits are set by science.More than that, it falls in one of the most fundamental sub-genres of science fiction, impact of new knowledge on society, as we see the rise of an alien race from it's very early beginnings.What the book _does_ lack, though, is a certain amount of conflict. There are a few page turners here and there, but nothing that will take you from the first to the last page. For younger readers, who are usually more enchanted with \\"wonders of new worlds\\" books (as I was, once :), it probably rates five stars, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Neutron fast breeder encounter.A human expedition to a Neutron star finds an alien race living there, but stuck in a low tech level of development.

You'd never know it from this revival, but Grease is not a silly, brainless 50s parody -- it's a smart, insightful, fairly alternative piece of theatre (inspired in many ways by HAIR), and this awful 90s revival missed everyting that's special about Grease, robbing it of its muscle, its attitude, its rawness, and its thrilling, subversive, over-sexed energy. If you want to hear what Grease SHOULD sound like, if you want to hear the real sound of early rock and roll, get the original 1972 recording. That's Grease."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"This was not the version I wanted. My bad. I will probably just throw it away.

(Actually, we attended a middle school production of Grease a few weeks ago, and those kids sounded better than this.) Many of the leads can't hold a tune! And the \\"reworking, redesign and reorchestrating\\" of the musical detracts from the original. It is less \\"boppy\\" and fun.

Jane and the Unpleasantness at Scargrave Manor is contrived at best. There are far too many betooks and bethought me's (in one sentence, mind you!) for my taste. The real Jane Austen didn't write like that. It is missing the characteristic Jane voice that is sarcastic, feminist, judgemental and proper all at the same time. The footnotes and accuracies of Jane's life are interesting, but probably not interesting enough to make me pick up the second in the series. If you are a true Jane Austen fan, from Emma to Northanger Abbey, you'll probably read this book anyway, but I don't advise it. And if historical mysteries are your thing, it is probably worth your while.

What a task Barron took on--assuming the voice of English literature's Queen Mother--and what a colossal mistake! I had high hopes for this book, being a lover of mysteries and Austen. But I found myself scoffing at the language, annoyed at the affected tone, and irrate that Barron steals sentences right out of Austen's books and plops them down amidst her own ridiculously un-Austenesque sentences.

Stephanie has tried to create a life from which Austen's novels might spring - with an awkward and implausible result. The conversations and situations which supposedly inspired Jane's memorable characters and dialogue made me cringe. Unfortunately, Barron's only vocabulary seems to have come from Austen novels and her use of it is repetitive, clumsy and lacking in imagination. In spite of obviously knowing the Austen novels well, she has completely missed their spirit. Jane's characters captivate us with subtle delicacy. Ms. Barron's characters are flat, cliche and melodramatic; they drown us in sentimentalism and knocks us over the head with their passion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful and agreeable mystery...","review":"Stephanie Barron has written a delightful mystery in the style of Jane Austen, with Jane Austen as the main character. As such, the author stayed true to the times, and to the character that I perceived fitting for Jane. It was surprisingly well written, with a mystery that kept me intrigued. It wasn't tied up all nice at the end, but seemed somewhat more realistic.

Reagan proposed the largest tax cuts of the middle class and poor. This jolted the economy by giving spending power to the people.

He also said \\"It's a war in which we will hunt down those who hate America, one person at a time.\\". I'm sure he wasn't drunk when he spoke that. My favourite bush quote is this: \\"It's a different kind of war than we're used to in America. It's a war that requires patience and focus.\\" If we want to defend our freedom to steal oil and harrass poorer countries we're just gonna hafta put on our thinking caps get all camouflaged up and try not to get drunk for a few hours, perhaps even days if that's what a war with Iraz requires."},{"rating":"2","title":"Babies love this book!

There seems to be an effort to translate new vocabulary as it is introduced, but this is not entirely successful; I found myself repeatedly having to look up words in the reading sections that were not included in the vocabulary lists following the readings.

I guess after trying a movie career and having TV shows canceled for virtually every network, the comedy album was one of the few unexplored career routes. I guess it is a good thing that Norm has recently put some effort into resurrecting his stand-up career, because this album of lame skits wasn't going to take him anywhere.The only reason I am giving this two stars is because there are a couple of funny moments, but those moments are not enough to make up for the hundreds of unfunny moments.

Well, yes and no. This is Norm MacDonald and it is ostensibly comedy, but it is not a comedy album per se. This is NOT an album recorded at a performance of any of his stand-up routines. This is a collection of random audio skits which range from really funny to utterly terrible. I'm not sure why he chose to make this his first comedy CD.

It is a collection of miserable people who undergo no character development. Nothing happens, except that everyone is miserable. None of the characters are sympathetic--the reader cannot connect to them because they are pure creations of meaningless beautiful words, self-pity, and inexplicable neuroses. The narrator, eighteen year old Rose, fails to make an impression. She is so absolutely passive that she has no personality.So I could not recommend \\"Heir to the Glimmering World\\". It is pretentious, plotless, and uninspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"More hype than substance","review":"This was a long book about very little. The reader is expected to take a great deal on faith: the Bear Boy's neurosis, the mother's virtual psychosis, the family that lives in an improbable world of coincidence and luck. I have read other books by Ozick, most of which were masterful (The Shawl, The Puttermesser Papers, numerous short stories) but this book left me irritated. I couldn't stop reading it but it wished I had.

Sadly, all I can say is, Big Deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat, not glimmering","review":"While the author does know how to construct an image-laden and sometimes beautiful sentence, the book lacks character depth and motivation.

I merely want to stress that you don't have to know anything about ancient religious sects to love this book. It's a plain old good read. The action's well-paced, the characters vivid and memorable including a couple of hilarious ones such as the amorous Dr. Tandoori), there are twists and turns of plot a-plenty, and the writing is sublime. If you happen to be a feminist, here you'll find an attractive heterosexual male character who's the most nurturing motherly figure I've ever read of, and totally convincing. Yes, it's a work about faith, interpretation of texts, dealing with displacement, etc., but most of all it's a great story that satisfies.

Margaret Wise Brown is an old favorite but I wouldn't call her a master of the pen. Her books are dear to us because of the magical combinations of low-key narrative and old-fashioned art.

With the pilot being a b grade copy of the movie, it left a bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the series. Mark couldn't win me over with his portrayal, especially with his outfit inspired from the movie that I thought looked horrible, specifically the coat. As I have mentioned before in a review elsewhere, the only good things to come out of this that it showcased the moments for Eric and Shelly that possibly could have happened before their deaths and that Katie Stuart and Mark have had quite a few good roles since then:X2(for katie) and Brotherhood Of The Wolf/Cradle 2 The Grave(for Mark). The only way this concept will ever work again is with a fresh new character, on HBO.

They claim the Series is based on the Comic strip by James O'Barr but it appears that the have watched the film and neglected to eaven go out and buy the comic as it is full of old cleshays from the Brandon Lee film. This first episode is basicly the same story line as the first film except with bad actors who don't suite there rolls and don't fite the film or the comic. If you are a fan of the crow like I am go and buy it, it's got a new twist to the story of Eric and Shelly but it is still undoubtebly a cheep ripe of. Marc is terrible as Eric and if you see this before the film you will want to know what all the fuss is about. I suggest you get the film first then the sequell and then the comic and if you have any money left over then get this.

It features cheesy production values, bargain-basement acting and a grade-Z script. The first hour of this movie is basically just a cheapo remake of the classic movie starring the late Brandon Lee, except this made for TV version gets rid of everything that made the movie great, the dark atmosphere, the poetic dialog. The second hour expands the story into some hokum about Crows vs. snakes or something like that. What's next?

The actors are ALL different and barely look the same. It is not nearly as beautiful or dramatic. Some lines are repeated, but with different context and no feeling. It feels rushed. The city is not dark or rainy like the original. It almost looks like it was made for a tv series. It's not really worth the money, and I'd rather watch the crow 2 than this blasphemous remake. I don't really know why they made it. It wouldn't make sense for this to replace an out of stock original; it can just be re-released. I rented it thinking it was the crow 3, but was disappointed and disgusted. it's not worth it; they asted time and money in making it.

The acting is wonderful, the story is immersive, and the insight into the Christian mind is unmatched by any contemporary film.Robert Duvall plays a preacher who is in the midst of a political battle to remove him from his pulpit. He then finds out his wife is more than friends with the youth minister. Duvall snaps and lays a baseball bat upside the head of the slug that is sleeping with his wife.Duvall then leaves town and goes under the radar screen to hide from his crime.

I've always been a big fan of Duvall, and I had heard nothing but good about this film from critics-- including critics who I usually find myself in agreement with. And in truth, Duvall does give a stunning performance as a passionate, devout, committed, and yet very flawed and very human evangelical preacher. Nonetheless, I found myself quite bored with this movie. I just didn't find the character he portrays to be that *interesting*. Nor did I find the circumstances in which he found himself (i.e. the plot) to make for that exciting of a story. Maybe my expectations were just raised too high by all the praise of the film that I heard. Or maybe, if evangical Christianity were a personal issue in my life, I would have found this character study more engaging. But, sadly, the story really just didn't do anything for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was extremely dissapointed with this film.","review":"The portrayal of this Evangelist and of his flaws was not exactly uplifting! If he was supposed to be putting his life \\"back together\\" it sure was a strange way of doing it. First he comes on way too strong with the secretary at the radio station and then he goes on to have an all out brawl with a fellow right in the middle of a church service. As he quotes from the Bible after the fight \\"we are supposed to turn the other cheek\\" not beat the crap out of him! For all of those non-Christians out there I don't believe this would be the best movie to base your beliefs on. It was very mis-leading. I gave it a 2 because Robert Duvall is, after all, a very talented actor. But, I would suggest for him to stick to being an actor and not the writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"robert duvall was excellent","review":"but something about this film i just didnt like. maybe because i'm not a baptist southerner. i dont know."},{"rating":"2","title":"captures the small-town South perfectly","review":"This movie was excellent. I particularly loved the scenes filmed on the Mississippi River. Duvall captures the small-town South perfectly. His portrayal of a flawed preacher is touching, and the love he finds in his small church even more so. I would highly reccomend this film to anyone. The soundtrack is also wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New York Audiences Stunned","review":"Seeing \\"The Apostle\\" in a New York theater was a powerful experience, in part because of the way the audiences reacted (I saw the film 3 different times during the course of 4 weeks). With almost no exception, New Yorkers sat in silence during the film; there were few catcalls or smirks, and in my opinion the faces of those leaving the theater bore expressions of thoughtfulness, not scorn. In a city known for world-class crassness and insensitivity, it was quite notable to sit with strangers in a darkened room watching Duvall portray a powerful, but utterly human, Southern preacher. The Collector's Edition DVD offers many insights into the making of this remarkable film, and for me the value of \\"The Apostle\\" is enhanced by the additional material. Not a perfect film, but one made from the heart that may go straight to the heart of many viewers, whether they identify with Southern culture and religion or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Duvall at his best.","review":"This movie blew me away the first time I saw it.

Great actoring by Duvall.. Five Stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance and a big statement about christianity","review":"Other than the teriffic performances, the most noticeable thing about this film is the underlying theme that, no matter how sordid Sonny's life gets, he always comes back to his faith.

I could see past the flashy car, talking in tongues, pentacostal, bible thumper and see a complex character who I liked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is by far the best movie I've seen in a long time.

Robert Duvalls performance was fantastic. I'd love to see more movies like this. {Here is one I'm not ashamed to have my grandchildren watch}"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Performance, Boring Story","review":"I found the plot extremely repetitious and boring. Nothing much happens except a lot of preaching and good intentions. Some nice acting by Duvall. But I couldn't believe in him as a genuine man of God because he showed no deep emotional remorse over his killing the pastor or over the abusive way he treated his wife. He just runs away and tries to start a new life. This showed he was a coward, unready to take responsibility for his base actions. If he had any sense of conscience, he would have given himself up to the law and accepted his punishment for his vicious act. The movie was much too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a Christian Movie","review":"If you are a christian please do not buy this movie. This movie is not for Christians. I'm not an old fashion old man or anything like that. I'm male I'm 22 years old. I bought this movies reading the great reviews about it not knowing what to expect. This movie tells the story of a \\"pastor\\" who gets drunk and beats people up and even commits murder. There is scenes about sex well kinda. hes also a liar by the way, at the end he goes to jail after running away from town for murdering a man. The only good thing about the movie is that the guy built a church but he wasn't really a man of God ( I'm not judging) Even Jesus said you'd know them by their fruit but where is the fruit when this guy is all about cursing?

The movie itself was horrible. I had no feelings for the main character. All main characters were horribly immoral. I don't recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly moving performances","review":"Robert Duvall's \\"Apostle\\" is a deeply moving portrait of a man's struggle to maintain a relationship with God and be a faithful servant, despite many obstacles and character flaws that he encounters and possesses. At first, I thought \\"Sonny\\" was a bit shallow and pompous; then, when I saw him sitting in the pup tent, nothing left to his name, in deep meditation and anger and sorrow, I began to pity him. By the end of the movie, I had really begun to sympathize with Sonny's situation and realize that he was a man who did indeed take his calling to the ministry seriously--in his own way. To me, the most emotional part of the entire movie occurred when Sam (Walt Goggins) accepted Christ as his saviour, and stepped forward. I don't know what Goggins felt or thought during that scene, but it must have been profound. All in all, an incredibly emotional movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to read","review":"We like this book. But it isn't a favorite like 10 little ladybugs or 8 silly monkeys.

The illustrations are really engaging, and I like the fact that the farmer at the end of the book is female.I don't like the material that covers the bees--it's similar to velveteen, which gives me goosebumps. Also, I'm a little skeptical about some of the ideas in the book--would a bee want to play with a dog? Would a rooster drink honey?

Neatly juxtapositioned against the horrors of the pitched battled in Jerusalem's streets is the struggle to survive thirst and despair. The clearest example of this is made through a child...ain't that always the way. Once you read the book, which I hope you do, you'll understand how important hope is to life itself.Thunder From Jerusalem is just like the last book, yet still interesting...I picture it more as a continuation of the first story, rather than a sequel. Well written - very nicely described scenes, appropriate insertions of humor, etc. Classic Thoene, in short."},{"rating":"1","title":"More photos than text.","review":"I was very disappointed and will be returning this book because it was little more than a collection of photos of various keeshonden.

No creativity or imagination can be found in this movie. It is not worth the 3 or 4 dollars it would cost to rent it. I very much enjoyed Legaly Blonde and was expecting a similar level of enjoyment.

Aside from the laughs, though, the political overtones were appalling. Yankees consist of witch-like feminist Democrats who manipulate weak men. Southern men are sympathetic, caring, harmless, Bubba-Republicans who can win their women back from the evil Yankess by being smart and working hard, creating products that will even sell in NY (well, W sold in NY, so why not). Blacks are----well----maids. Otherwise, there are apparenly no Blacks in Alabama. Candice Bergen, it was good for laughs but where are your political principles in this age of world domination by right wing religious fanatacism and neo-classical economic ideology? You gone over to the other side too, like most of the other Democrats?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment - big one.","review":"I can't say much without spoiling the plot.

This is a nice movie that still has a few surprises even though you kind of get the feeling you know where things are going. The one thing this movie is lacking that usually shows up in most romantic comedies is a seriously dumb moment in which the characters look goofy and completely unbelievable. That's a plus. The movie has fun with sterotypes about the south and big cities like New York without going too far over the line.

Forced to slow down, she rediscovers herself, and finds out what true love is all about.After it was over, it made me want to move from the city to some small town like what I grew up in.Another show like this one is Doc Hollywood with Michael J.

I watched this movie in a plane thinking, \\"hey a movie, that i wanted to see for free\\" afterwards I would have rather been listening to the lady next to me as she sang to headphones than watch that movie ever again. The plot was predictable beyond anything I have ever seens, the lines were cheesy, it was broadly stereotypical, and the best thing that the movie had was the clothes that Witherspoon wore. And you think i am a cynical \\"I hate Reese\\" but I don't I loved her in Cruel Intentions and in Legally Blonde which surprised me greatly.

If you are thinking of purchasing this movie now, save some money and get the DVD because there is no reason to waste extra $$ for the Blu-Ray.

She is now engaged to the dashing son (Patrick Dempsey) of the Mayor of New York City (Candice Bergen). Seems like she forgot to mention to her fiance that she still has a husband back home, and she goes down to Alabama to get him to sign the divorce papers.Witherspoon is beautiful and plays the dumb blonde very well, but she never convinced me she was a fashion designer. Dempsey and Josh Lucas, who plays her drunken-bum husband both are forgettable. Bergen is a hoot as a manipulating mayor, but looked too young to be Dempsey's mother. The plot was too corny and predictable for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Sorry, I'm a guy! This movie was just not good, if you are female and enjoy the typical chick flick then buy this. I enjoyed the twist on the usual plot, this time it is a woman who is after more then one guy and not a he whore. Unlike most movies like this you end up really hating the person she leaves, not in this one. Both guys are really great, but nonetheless she proceeds to emotionally scare both of them from beginning to the end! At the end of these movies you expect the main character to learn a lesson, not in this one. Nothing changes she just chooses, that hurt the movie for me.

But before the announcement can be made public, she needs to return to her Alabama hometown for the first time in seven years, to tell her parents and to get a divorce from her high school sweetheart.It's a sweet movie about a small town girl who's made it, who looks down upon her past and then learns to appreciate it. While the characteristics of Alabama and New York residents are sometimes overdone, it does a nice job showing both the positive and negative of small-town southern life. And Witherspoon does a good job in playing a \\"hoighty-toighty Yankie\\" who viewers can also sympathize with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern Reese is great!","review":"I saw Legally Blonde and loved it so I had to see this.

It had led me to believe I would be seeing a madcap screwball comedy of the gag-a-minute variety. Sweet Home Alabama is none of the above. It's a standard heartwarmer. The gags, such as they are, could have been focused to better effect. For whatever reason, they weren't, and they may not have been intended to be. Screwball comedies aren't the end-all-be-all. In fact, they're quite superficial... but then so are standard heartwarmers, and they aren't funny. If they didn't want a screwball comedy, they shouldn't have advertised one, that's all.For what it's worth, Reese Witherspoon does a great job. Her character is very like someone I know, and I'm sure convinced. It's a pity here effort is lost in a cliché.Even more's the pity, cuz if they got the guy who edited the trailer to edit the movie, they might have had something."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"cute\\" movie but way too predictable","review":"I was disappointed after seeing Sweet Home Alabama.

When she gets home she starts to realize that she has missed home. She is torn between her old love and her new. Her old way of life and her new. Has she been living a lie?

And Reese is cute, but she's no Kathryn Hepburn, Audrey Hepburn, or Doris Day from years past -- when romantic comedies were really romantic comedies.However, this young Josh Lucas reminds one of a young Paul Newman and what a hunk. His portrayal of a young southern gentleman takes the cake. I would stay married to him any day of the week....Will probably watch the movie 10-15 more times just to view this \\"hunka hunka\\" guy.

But that cut scene just put me over the top. This has got to be one of the cheesiest, intellectually deprived, and most idiotic romantic comedies in recent memory. Aside from being the typical cookie-cutter plot, without any speck of originality, there was not even enough humor to keep me awake. The best actor in this movie was the dog.

Don't even bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet Home Alabama is not that Sweet","review":"I watched this movie with my husband after we had heard all the rave reviews about this movie and expected something funny, comical and just clever. Sadly disappointed, because you have to watch almost the entire movie to find out what drove Melanie and her husband to be apart for 7 years!!! It had some humorous scenes, but nothing outstanding. Candice Bergen plays a typical \\"Murphy Brown\\" role but as a mayor, which really does her no justice.

To settle matters straight, she decides to go to the south quick and make him sign the papers. But when things don't turn out the way she planned them out, she realizes that what she had before in the south was far more perfect than the life she had in new york city.

Ummm...... none come to mind right now but the movie just seemed to familiar for us to care. Plus the ending gets so jumbled that i think even the cast did not know what was going on. The movie does have its laughs, but all in all turns out to be a ridiculous and awkward premise for this type of movie.I'm sure some women will still flock to go see this movie and make their boyfriends go see it as well, since now favorite Reese Witherspoon is in it and it has already made quite a bit of money. But as for pure intelligence and originality it has none. I would recommend the movie for its minor laughs or if you would just like to laugh at the movie itself for its silly storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"I got to see this for free and I still felt ripped off. The story is awful. There isn't a single ounce of character development, so poor Ms. Witherspoon comes across as a total beyotch. It does have the distinction, though, of containing the most emotionless marriage proposal scene ever (the materialistic ringfest at Tiffanys) and the character with the dumbest job ever (lightning-sand sculptor). And if it was funny, I forgot to laugh. Or, more likely, they forgot to put in the jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"So this was a comedy???? Maybe it was a typo....","review":"This film had so much potential to be funny. There was bubbly and adorable Reese, hunky Josh, and a rich girl goes back to hometown plot...but with the predictable script, it was just, well, too predictable, for a lack of words. At times, you wanted to yawn and wait for that boring scene to end and get to the good stuff, but there just wasn't any! Unless you have the humor mentality of a 10 year old teenybopper, there was no way this could be funny! I consider myself a very open-minded when it comes to humor, but when you can guess what's going to happen next the first time you see the dang movie, it gets tiring waiting for that unpredictable moment.

The southerners come out ahead in the end when Reese's Witherspoon's character, an up-and-coming fashion designer, leaves the son of New York City's mayor to return to Alabama and the redneck husband she had been trying to divorce. Predictable, not even remotely funny, downright depressing. I know Reese Witherspoon is from Tennessee, but she's supposed to be intelligent and not exactly a Rush Limbaugh disciple.

Well, here's the movie that proves it ain't necessarily so.I'm sure the public will generally enjoy (or at least not be offended by) this trifle, but if like me, you enjoyed seeing Reese's talent blossom in harder edged fare like Freeway, Pleasantville and Election, you'll hope one of these romantic comedy bon-bons tanks at the box office so she can get back to making real movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classless warfare.","review":"First of all, how can a woman be named Reese Witherspoon? I guess my only complaint about this movie--besides its absurdity--is all those Hollywood actors talkin' with them phony southern accents.It might seem like a small detail but it reinforces the stereotypes of the two most disliked groups in our country: New Yorkers and Southerners. Some will say this is deserved and I can't disagree but snobs vs. hillbillies just isn't very funny or touching to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Sweet Home Alabama was an adorable love story that keeps youguessing until the end!

I don't watch these movies to suddenly have an epiphany. It's good fluffy fun for a lazy Sunday afternoon or a way to unwind after a stressful day at work.Not the best romantic comedy ever, but the performances by the actors keep this movie going. Great acting by Reese Withspoon (Melanie) and Josh Lucas (Jake). Mary Kay Place and Fred Ward put in great performances as Pearl and Earl, Melanie's backwards parents. The storyline is decent and the ending makes up for everything. There are definitely stereotypes in the movie, but they're there to emphasize the contrasting attitudes of \\"hoity-toity\\" New Yorkers and Southerners.It's a rent before you buy movie unless you're a Reese Witherspoon fan or a fan of all romantic comedies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"I liked the movie.

I knew it was fake when I didn't see a diverse crowd at the fair.Also, if you are bored enough to watch the deleted scenes. Even the director noted that the two best scenes, one was the best scene and the other was the funniest, but he cut them anyway. How is that going to make a movie?

An hour into the movie, my girlfriend and I (yes, this was our pathetic, dateless Saturday nite...haha) both looked at each other and said, \\"Where is this movie going??!!\\" I felt like its only redeeming quality WAS the acting, although I felt that \\"Melanie\\" and her husband totally lacked the romantic chemistry needed to make this movie believable.

The taste, texture, and appearance is completely different than cheesecake. This dessert is lighter, contains more air and has a texture more like a thick custard.

A very funny satire.","review":"If you liked SCTV or enjoy movie satires, this is a \\"must see.\\" Eugene Levy and John Candy play two Leutonian polka-meisters who, through one ploy or another, try to climb their way to the top of the mid-western polka circuit. Their \\"retirement\\" is a last-ditch effort to overcome a disasterous concert (where they try to capitalize on Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" success). Just seeing John Candy dressed up in Jackson-esque attire is worth more than a few laughs. The Last Polka features Catherine O'Hara (as one of the Lemon Twins (all three of them)) and Rick Moranis (as Lynx Minyick (sp?)) a Leutonian mix of Pepe Le-Pew and Neal Diamond. It's a movie that you have to watch several times to truly enjoy all of the subtle humor and wonderful character acting. I really wish this was back in-production, because I've worn my tape out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest music mocumentaries ever.","review":"John Candy and Eugene Levy have taken humor to its finest level. A story about two lutonians who became polka legends (as if this were possible) have come to a decision to retire from the music business. There are appearances from many stars such as: Rick Moranis & Catherine O'hara. The schmenges spoof in \\"Home Alone\\" was a direct rip of this made for HBO Movie. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who remembers the comic genious of John Candy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let me tell you.","review":"This is one of those albums in the eighties you bought on record,in the ninties you bought on tape, and in the twenty-first century you bought on CD. I love this album it has a raw timeless quality to it. Mike and co. were one of the few punk bands at the time that could actually play and were extrodinary song writers. their songs could be released today and still have the same dramatic effect they had in '83 (now even more so that punk is now acceptable). I've bought this album three times in the past twenty years and I'm sure if the come up with a better form of media to print music on I'd buy it on that as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old school","review":"This is Social Distortions first album, and it is very different from the later releases, if you loved Prison Bound or Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell, it is no guarantee you will like this album. It got a much more raw punk sound to it, it is basic punk, and the production lacks some compared to their earlier releases(although this adds to the \\"authentic\\" feel). The album is pure raw power and the tracks are short and powerful outburts against society. Despite its difference I love this album with all its hardcore punk feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks rawness and energy...","review":"I had always heard Social D. on the radio for years, and I thought of them as a pretty mediocre, tame, rock band. When I found out that they had been one of the original bands in the early 80's SoCal punk scene, I eagerly bought this, their 1st album, anticipating a great punk album. I was disappointed to find that I was left with the exact same impression I had of Social D. before I bought this album: that they lacked a certain \\"punk\\" energy and rawness so apparant in the sound of their early contemporaries (i.e. Black Flag). As a \\"rock\\" album, this holds up pretty well, but I don't recommend this if you're looking for a really good punk album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dateline Troy","review":"This book is about how events over 1,000 years ago still occure in the news today. In the book Paul Fleishman recreates events of the Battle of Troy and finds clippings of newspaper articles that are similsr to the events. An example was during the Battle of Troy servants sacrificed cattle for Zeus so the Greeks could get an edge over the Trojans. The artical reads\\" Woman kills herself after war protest.\\" As you can seeevents still make headlines about things similar to events that happened in the past. Overall I liked the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Troy","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read difficult books, because this book is full of big words. Or anyone who likes war, the book has alot to do with that. But the biggest reason to read this book is if you like and secretly raised him. Paris awarded Aphordite the golden apple and in return she made him invincible in love. The Trojans started a war with the Greeks, But eventually they called a truth. Of course it was broken and the war started up again. At first I didn't really like it but as it went on I did. By the end of the book i thought it was a really good. Like the newborn left to die i didn't like that. But when the war started and the action I liked it then. Another reason I liked it was that it had a big picture on every other page.

I have been listening to Chieli, George (rest in peace) and the group since the 80's.First, the good: Chieli's guitar playing is as good as ever; the supporting cast is also very good; and, the DVD contains some of my favorites.The not so good: video quality was not as sharp as other DVD muscic productions; audio quality was somewhat muted; and, more importantly, the DVD only has 7 songs(!). Chieli has an extensive library of music (over 17 CDs), why limit this effort to just 7 songs and 60 minutes? At the end of the day, I was left wishing for more.All in all, if you are a Minucci and Speciall EFX fan, this is a nice to have DVD.

I really like the Ott-lite lamps I have purchased to date and have recommended them to family and friends. This is the first of the Ott-lite products that has disappointed me. The metal base is very scratched and unattractive. A small screw that was included to secure the bulb housing to the L-shaped portion of the shaft does not fit the hole. Consequently the bulb housing is very wobbly and makes the entire lamp feel cheap. Also, the type of bulb supplied with this model wasn't what I was expecting. It is the coil-type of fluorescent bulb that has a tendency to buzz and, yes, this one buzzes very loudly. I will not recommend this version of an Ott-lite lamp to anyone at any price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great album from U.P.","review":"Unleashed Power latest release amazed me!

Guapo's take on the Zeuhl sound combines some distant eerie tones and a foreboding atmosphere which gives the music a real David Lynch kind of creepiness. the results are like a meeting between Goblin and Magma. on this album, Guapo has added a keyboard player and their sound has benefitted greatly from this additional member. the centerpiece of this album is the 5 part 46 minute title track. there are a few extra tracks that seem to be a bit unnessesary, almost feels like they are sort of just tacked on to the end to make the record a little bit longer. but that's a minor complaint when the album is this good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guapo - More Great Off The Wall Stuff","review":"Another great album from Guapo that I once again find very difficult to describe. This is more driving instrumental prog rock with a sound like no one else. I have seen someone else describe this music as like the soundtrack to a David Lynch film and I think that describes it pretty well. Put this on in conjunction with Eraserhead and I think it would go together like Dark Side Of The Moon, and The Wizard Of Oz. The album consists of only 3 tracks. The 45 minute long \\"Five Suns\\", followed by a moment of silent intermission, then the two final tracks \\"Mictlan\\", and \\"Topan\\". The band follow in the Magma meet Goblin tradition of their previous disc. There is very little soloing to be found, yet the band build on progressive chords so that you never really miss them. This music is not for everyone, and this is really not the kind of thing that I normally listen to, but Guapo is able to pull this off so well, that I really enjoy it everytime I put this one on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Gothic Here","review":"This bulky collection of stories, like most which span a writer's life, have patches of unevenness throughout (and my edition goes to 622 pages). The consistent theme of Welty's prose is that the south is definitely a world apart. There are the odd nick-names, the long shadow of racism, and the sense of defeat and enclosure of the post-Civil War South. It is an odd testament of a people and a culture; a part of America but also separated from it; this sense of being at one with the nation but also severed from it makes for interesting, although sometimes tiring, reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every story is like a novel or poem","review":"These mysterious stories are compressed like poems.

As a child of immigrants from Australia I find a special connection to the Motherland both in the film and in the music of ABBA (I know, they're Swedish, but it was what my older brother's listened to when I was growing up.). The story is hilariously funny and just a delicious foretaste of what Toni Collete will go on to do in her career. It's a fun movie, perfect to enjoy for a girls' night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another dvd ready for an UPGRADE.","review":"This excellent film, in the vein of \\"Romy & Michelle's High School Reunion\\", has excellent performances and an ABBA soundrack in 5.1 surround.

Maybe even inside yourself.THis movie is hilarious and touching. Everyone in the movie is a tragic, really. But that's okay. THey're just human. Muriel does make us want to laugh and cry with her. Toni Colette is a great actress--I hope she takes over USA, which she's starting to with her Oscar nomination in \\"The Sixth Sense\\". Muriel's mom depressed the hell out of me--her husband cheating on her, no one helping her, and eventually she loses her mind and kills herself. She was the most real character next to Muriel. Great performance.Every scene is a favorite. I can't stop watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So would you feel comfortable lying? DO you think you could do it? Muriel: \\"I could try...\\"","review":"This movie is one of those movies that makes you think about your own confidence in who you are in life. You want to cry and laugh all at the same time. At some pome points you wonder exactly where the movie is going and you wonder how could all this end? In the end you cant help but smile and no matter how much of a saint you think you might have been throughout your life, you think about that one time when you really pulled one off.

It is wonderfully hilarious, and at the same time painstakingly sad. Toni Collette is fantastic, as is Rachel Griffiths. I'm from Australia, and I'm proud to say that this film is australian. Under the comedy, is the realism that depicts suburbian life better than I've ever seen.

There is not one single redeeming morsel to hang onto from this waste of time. Fat, ugly, loser from a loser family in a loser town hopes to get the guy? Please! I wouldn't even hook up with this girl if she was the last female standing at a frat party.This is the movie to show Osama Bin Laden's henchmen to make them choke up his whereabouts. I would hand over my own mother to keep from having to watch even one more second of this chick-flick black hole.Please stop watching this movie so they will stop printing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muriel's dysfunctional life","review":"This film was first brought to my attention in a crash course on Australian films. I have a lot of trouble calling this a comedy because of the tragic overtones. In a classical sense it is a comedy because it starts out with a conflict and ends happily. Overall the tragic and sad scenes overwhelms the comic aspects. Muriel's family could hardly be any more dysfunctional if they tried and for much of the movie Muriel's main obsession is to get married and after she does, she realizes how silly it was. I like her confronting her family and fake friends, but I would have trouble recomending this movie to many people. Yes there are many comic scenes like Muriel's mother getting tired of telling her son to mow the backyard and torching it, but overall it isn't the comedy it claims to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This movie intersperses prolonged and whiney ugly duckling boredom with an occasional humorous scene. Certainly not as good an Austrailian comedy as Ballroom Dancing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly disjointed adolescent movie making","review":"to be fair, so i saw this on the heels of watching \\"goodfellas\\", perhaps one of the best directed films in recent memory. i would say if you are a person who gets easily absorbed in character as opposed to technique, than you may enjoy this movie. though it need be said that some of the characters are so highly clichéd (the circle of girlfriends...for example) that it might be hard to appreciate their subtleties if one is not from Australia.For me, this genre (pathetic, black socio-familial comedy) was accomplished better with films like \\"welcome to the dollhouse\\", \\"happiness\\", and \\"life is sweet\\". The movie was too broad in plot and setting and very hackneyed in its transitions. (as in when the heroine runs off with her friend at the end). And the device of her mother's death as a transition point was done ever so lamely. She just wanders around in a daze and then...poof...wakes up.Not a film geek flick by any stretch. But my girlfriend loves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst - Movie - Ever!!","review":"If it wasn't for a bet that I had going with a friend, I never would have spent the $3.50 to buy this movie.

I think giving it an \\"R\\" rating will help ensure that young, impressionable girls WON'T see this movie. The only two funny scenes in the entire movie are when Muriel and Rhonda are on vacation and singing Waterloo in a talent show, and when Muriel is walking down the isle to get married, and the song \\"I Do\\" is playing as her wedding march.

Finally she acts on her dreams, has a series of mishaps, and makes progress. There are so many quick witted moments that you'd have to watch them more than once to get everything.

Collette is an excellent actress and vividly portrays not only Muriel's desperate, self-centered, and mis-guided search for love and acknowledgement, but also her usually hidden and even unconscious pain. I recommend this movie highly, but I also warn that more sensitive viewers may be caught off-guard by the powerful undercurrent of despair waiting just behind the jokes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Georgie girl for the nineties","review":"Muriel's Wedding is one of the best films made in Australia or anywhere else in the world and I thank the Aussies for being less than \\"beautiful\\" and being more than honest. This is life and the giddy illusions of Muriel become breathtakingly sad when one comes to understand her home life or watches her mother's slow destruction. The movie is also optimistic and proves that we can change our fantasies for reality and yet survive. This is one of the most beautiful stories ever put to film and requires more than one viewing. I salute Australians and Australian film making. When Americans are through blowing things up and wallowing in special effects, maybe they can return to the small and intricate beauty of the human soul and how it's formed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too unpleasant","review":"I confess that I couldn't watch the movie for more than the first 30 minutes and then bits and pieces from later portions. The part i watched deserved one star but, to give the movie the benefit of the doubt, i made it 2 stars.The reason i couldn't go on watching was that this \\"comedy\\" was too painful for me. Here's a homely, overweight, dismally stupid young woman. She can't help that, admittedly. But she is also lazy, dishonest, and irresponsible, and, despite her resolutions, does not reform her ways.I did not find it amusing, and i did not find her girl friends amusing either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful ordering!","review":"Be careful when you order - I ordered the UK version and would not play on my computer or DVD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sam Brown is a Superb artist...","review":"...and this album was her debut release from 1988, though it spawned a couple of top twenty hits she has spent little time in the charts since but continues to produce some great work.She has a huge cult following and has become an artist on the fringe of the mainstream which is a place many artists chose to be, and I believe she may be one of them; here they do not have to bow and scrape to popular demands and the whims of record producers. Here they can work freely, develop a strong fan base and maintian robust artistic integrity.\\"Stop!\\" is recognisable now because Jamelia released it last year for the film, \\"Bridget Jones the edge of reason\\", but she has not even half the depth and richness of voice to belt the song out like Sam does on this original. It's an oldy but a goody and a descriptive work in terms where British pop/soul was headed in the late 80's before the manufactured craze took over.

Not even close. Info on EPIRBS and contact info for LL Bean and Steger Mukluks wasn't what I wanted in a book with this title.Although there is useful winter camping information it falls into the elementary catagory and group travel sounds like the old British Himalayan expedition style.

Some functions are shown in great step by step detail, but other sections skip over crucial steps without explanations. A revision from the publisher is greatly needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"For whom are these marketed?","review":"So, this is the thing: these bars are wheat-free and they taste ***good.*** But who cares about the whole wheat-free thing? I'll tell you who, folks who are wheat intolerant or allergic! So, it's all well and fine that this company is touting them as wheat free but they're made with oats as well as barley (gluten ingredients) so that's a big turn off. I don't get it. This product suggests that it is intended for a specialized market but it's made of ingredients that would prohibit purchasing it. Illogical. I wish Barbara's would make this product w/o the gluten so that I could buy it for my family! Meh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!","review":"HAS TWO TIMES THE FILLING OF FIG NEWTONS WHICH MAKES THEM TOO GOOEY AND STICK TOGETHER.

The expiration date was always just a few months away--but I love them and had no problem eating all six packages in a short time.This time, I got my shipment May 2009 and the cookies all had a \\"best used by March 09\\" date on them. So....Amazon has now sunk to shipping goods past their expiration date.

Because I can't have sugar, I have to seek out products like Barbara's sugar free/fruit only fig/blueberry bars.The only problem is that the expiration date on this product was Jan 9 2008, and this product was sent to me in March 2008. When I asked for another batch with a later expiration date, I was sent another 6 boxesin April with the same Jan 9 2008 date.Get with it Amazon, that's not okay..... The product gets noticably goeyand is not a firm cookie past the expiration date. I really wanted thisproduct, but had to ask for my money back due to this expiration date problem. Amazon gave me a $10 coupon for other Amazon products,but no cookies. Oh well, I guess I'll loose a few pounds...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy!","review":"These fig bars are naturally sweet and so tastey.

My 80 year old mom loves them and raids the jar every time she visits finishing them off! My husband likes them and he hates healthy food, haha! They are yummy berry flavor and the cake part is very moist. Just enough to hit the sweet craving without blowing tons of calories and fat. And no wheat!! Yummy, yummy. I take them out of their pack and put them in a glass jar as soon as they are opened. Now I buy them by the case on Amazon since the groceries around us charge about $5-$6 a pack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beats the competition","review":"Not hard. Not too sweet. Full of fiber.

I'm a single gal - so that means I'd have to chow down 2 of these packages each month just to consume them before they expire.For the health concious - these are fruit juice sweetened which means no white sugar is added! They are 60 calories per cookie with 13g of carbs, 1g Fiber, 8g sugar, and 1g of protein.I had to leave a rating of only 2 because of the taste - just \\"ok\\" for me. They have a very heavy flavour almost a slight fermented after taste to them. If you're a die hard fig lover, these might be for you but I personally prefer the whole wheat version by Nabisco"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive","review":"If you live a natural, organic prone life, eating these newtons are addictive.

They are moist and have a delightful flavor - much better than even the other brand name fig bars made With wheat! Barbara's other wheat free fig cookie with raspberry is just as delectable! I buy a case every 3 months from Amazon and with the automatic shipment discount, the price can't be beat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, inconsistent quality","review":"The pack of 6 is a great deal and the product itself is generally quite good and healthy. There is some variation in the freshness of the packages, even within one shipment of 6. Sometimes they are stale. One time, one of the six packages had a tear in it, spoiling the product inside. The vender refunded me the entire purchase price for all 6, so I was very satisfied with that experience. Definitely worth a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sweet","review":"As some other reviewers have also pointed out, these fig bars are extremely sweet.

They are moist and I can't keep them in the house. Once the package is open it's gone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty little treats but not organic","review":"If these little cookies were organic they would get 5 stars plus, but alas they are not. They are extra sweet with only 60 calories per bar, mostly from concentrated fruit juices. They do have a definite raspberry taste and I'm a sucker for \\"anything raspberry\\"!We are not gluten sensitive but do not eat wheat. I bought them because they contain no wheat or refined sugar and the price on Amazon is very good. I just wish Barbara's bakery would change to organic ingredients because they make such tasty treats.All that said, two bars and a nice big glass of soy or almond milk make for a satisfied evening tummy!

I firmly believe they were broken at the point of origin since the outside boxes were intact and the inside boxes were damaged at the point of breaks in the panel.

The reason I gave it two stars was because it was so corny that is was funny. The toilet scene was classic, and definitely gives a new meaning to the word, flatulation. I was cracking up! The plot of the movie is supposed to be serious, but the acting was really bad, so bad that you couldn't help but laugh at most of the movie. And the action sequences, when they have a punch or a kick repeated three times, is a riot as well! I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a movie that is so bad, that it is funny. If the movie was rated on making you laugh, I would have given this four or five stars, but since it is supposed to be serious, I would have to give it 2 stars. Anyway, if you want a good laugh, go to your local Hollywood or Blockbuster and rent this, I guarantee you will be laughing out loud! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The first reviewer is right. \\"Don't let the cover fool you\\"","review":"I rented this film (thank god I rented it!!!) thinking that it would be the next Black Mask or the next Revenge of the Ninja, but it turns out that is a stupid poor productions with \\"home cameras\\", HORRIBLE fight choreogrhapic,FATAL acting and in each fight there is a background music singing \\"Black Ninja\\" in Rap mode.This is the worst ninja movie ever because every scenes are copies of Batman and some Sonny Chiba's classic movies, I prefer to watch Batman of the 70's than this garbage.P.S: THANK GOD I RENTED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a practical book","review":"I got this book upon recommendation from a colleague who is a statistician.

This book didn't make any sense to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book would make a great movie.","review":"I found myself looking forward to the time I could spend reading the book and then felt sorry when I finished it. I hope he writes another. Throughout the reading, I pictured it as a wonderful Grisham-type movie and hope that happens soon. There were several moments in this book that were total surprises and I appreciated the unpredictabilty of the book right up to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disaster from Start to Finish","review":"I have to give the two writers some credit for tackling a very tought issue. Abortion is one of the most polarizing issues on todays political landscape. Unfortunately, all Mr. Shapiro and Becker did was muddy up water that was already quite murky.From the beginning the characters were one dimensional and the plot was predictable. The normal cast of characters, the feminist, the conservative politition, the socially minded docter, and the abortion bomber, all showed up and acted their part. The minor twists and turns and the almost surprising twist ending could not save another poorly concieved ideol-novel.The issues that were raised were intriging on the face, but the characters were so stereotypical and the plot so manufactured that by the end you felt like you just watched 24 hours of CSPAN."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Underwhelmed","review":"If I were Mr. Shapiro, I'd be embarassed to acknowledge my association with this book, much less do a book tour. The characters are stiff, cardboard caricatures of standard poorly-written novels. The short chapters contribute to a feeling of plot movement, but leave one wondering about true plot development. Background on the RU drug was interesting. The typos were numerous: aquittal, for one. Some situations were tritely absurd and the dialogue suffered. Sorry to say, Mr. Shapiro does better in the courtroom (how much of this book is attributed to him?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great summer read","review":"Very gripping tale that reads like a good movie of the week you will not want to put this one down. Mr Shapiro's expertise in the court room shine brightly in this tale of the political and moral issuses surronding the right of a women or man to choose to have an abortion.The media frenzy depicted here must be simular to his most recent experience with the infamous Simpson case.Ending doesnot dissapoint but leaves us with one to think on.Would be an excellent summer easy read for one on those rainy days or whenit's just too hot to go outside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad for a first novel","review":"The book was interesting but I was kind of disappointed that it was not really about a mans \\"right to choose\\", as you knew the main character was being portrayed as a \\"good\\" guy who had strayed. The promo on tv by Mr. Shapiro led me to believe the Mans choice thing would be more evident. Otherwise it was an interesting book. The point of view was kind of expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interfit Standard Snoot for Colorflash Monolights","review":"It got an email saying that it was on backorder. I was disappointed because it was for my husband's birthday. Strangely enough, it arrived 2 days later. It was however, damaged. It had a fairly good sized dent in the small end.

I actually do own this album, and it is definetly not worth buying. There are 2 great tracks, \\"Deep Cover\\" and \\"Bridgette\\", and one mediocre track, \\"Nickel Slick Nigga\\", but other than that, this album is COMPLETE garbage. As a previous reviewer stated, the rest of the tracks sound more like techno as opposed to rap. Download those 3 tracks, but leave this album on the shelve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragonball in it's perfection","review":"A must have for every Dragonball fan out there. There is tons of things to read, literally. Besides having a world map, it also has a universe guide with information about other planets, and other rare locations are included. One of the best parts of this book is the fact that almost every item shown in the manga is included with a picture and a summary. Every weapon, vehicle, or any other miscellaneous item is included. This is wonderful to have in your collection just for the sheer amount of information provided. If you don't get this book now, you'll be kicking yourself in the future when it's no longer produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"great costumes but no historical accuracy","review":"a low budget movie that has no historical accuracy at all but yet i liked this movie - great costumes and the native sets are good though the spanish ship was as low budget as it gets - and any movie with joyce is worth seeing - its always fun to see the evil spanish getting their due even if it didnt happen the way it does in the movie - a lot better than the average low budget philippine movie and worth seeing - 4 stars for the costumes, beautiful philippine scenery and of course joyce"},{"rating":"1","title":"I have no idea what's goin' on here,","review":"I kinda liked Jet when I heard their Cold Hard .... song. But personally, I don't like the fact that these guys are so banal ALL the TIME. I read an interview of them, and they sure seem to be lovin' the rock star style, with all their women and drugs. Well, good for you guys. But here's a tip. Next time, at least create music that deserves that lifestyle, and not the same song on every track. I seriously thought my player was skipping like mad, everything sounded regurgitated. All I'll give them is that they can play good (and that's mostly because the licks were borrowed from old masters.) But then again, I know 10 year olds that can play Stairway to Heaven. So try a little harder, guys, and maybe I'll have a listen, but for now, I think I'll stick to something a little more authentic."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Rocks!!!","review":"These guys may not be the most original, groundbreaking of bands but when they cook they cook!!! \\" Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\" is probably the most overexposed song on the planet along with The Black Eyed Peas \\"Let's Get It Started\\" but it is rather catchy. \\"Cold Hard Bitch\\" was the tune that got my attention and made me purchase this CD. Could've done without the overly long power ballad in the middle of the CD. These guys may be a hybrid of The Stones and AC/DC but is that all bad? At least they're better than Oasis and other copycats of that pretentious ilk!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take This, don't leave it","review":"Jet is an amazing band. Finally some real rock n roll. No more of that depressing grunge or rap metal. Finally this album takes the origings from The Who and AC/DC. I love Jet. I met them, and went to their show.

This band embodies all that rock-n-roll stands for. 'Get Born,' their major label debut is a solid listen that will ring in your earholes for months. It has not left my CD player since I purchased it. This album has it all, in your face rock-n-roll attacks, and thoughtful acoustic numbers, but never a dull moment. 'Get Born' should be purchased by everyone who is reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album RAWKS","review":"Picked up this album after hearing it played in a record store. This album really rocks! The harder rock songs sound like some kind of twisted merging of BTO, T Rex, Kinks with a little AC/DC thrown in. The melodic ballads range from Beatles to Badfinger. In all, a great recalling of '70s rock at its finest. Full of energy and fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"The record companies wet dream....","review":"....a Strokes clone with more \\"edge\\". A more accessible \\"Strokes\\". Pathetic. How much would you like to bet that these guys were playing grunge 8 years ago and nu metal or pop punk 4 years ago?

This is the kind of crap Creed fans would buy to say that they have \\"diverse\\" musical tastes!!! LOL!! : )"},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is way overrated by most","review":"I read a fair sampling of the reviews here and decided to take a chance on this CD because most seem to be solid four and five star reviews. Boy, did I make a mistake!!! There's no way this disc deserves any more than two stars and I'm probably being generous in giving it that. This band is in desperate need of a lead guitar player. The rare attempts at playing anything that remotely resembles a decent lead guitar lick are laughable on this disk. At times they do sound like some of the groups others have mentioned, but never as good as any of them. If this band last for four albums or more I'd be very, very surprised. I just don't hear enough talent on this disc to make me think they can put out more than one or two more CD's before everybody looses interest in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too high of a rating!

It's part of a current movement towards retro (White Stripes, Strokes, Vines etc) but at least the White Stripes and Strokes come across as having some talent.

The style is very similar to other groups (see the amazon review above). I actually find myself humming the originals as they sing. Even the cover is quite similar to one we've all seen before (Beatles - Revolver). The tunes are catchy, but I have a hard time listening to the album. I'm amazed these guys aren't in court. My advice is listen to the classic rock station, then buy the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"REVIEW FOR 'ARE YOU GONNA BE MY GIRL?'","review":"I can't believe that everyone has not figured out that their hit song has EXACTLY the same guitar riff has the white stripes' song \\"Screwdriver\\" did on their first record.

Repeat as needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"Some singers might be afraid of being too personal in their lyrics - letting strangers in on more than they should know. The isnger for Jet gets aroudn this problem by writing really bad, uninspired lyrics that could vaguely be connected with somebody's life. If this was their 15th album and they were 80 years old, that might be ok - they'd just be played out. As it is they're good at doing coke, and that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unfair Jet bashing","review":"Unfortunately Jet have become the new band to bash in certain circles for no good reason other than the fact that they are successful. It's gotten to the point where I've been asked if I was a Jet fan and my integrity as a music fan was at stake based on my answer. It's alright to not like a band but the endless bagging of Jet i've witness is ridiculous.All I've got to say is don't dismiss this band because people with a holier than thou attitude say they are fake. There's some good stuff on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"JET's just...jammin'!","review":"Nirvana, Nine Inch Nails, Radiohead, Smashing Pumpkins, Blink-182. These are some of the first bands that come to my head when you ask, \\"What's a good Alternative band?\\" Add Jet to that list; because for me, at least, a band must perform well on EVERY track to even be considered for it. \\"Get Born\\" is one of the very few CDs that, like albums by the aformentioned groups, can be played straight through without ever hitting an utterly unlistenable track."},{"rating":"2","title":"New band - old sound","review":"While their music might not be revolutionary, this is still a good CD. Good riffs, catchy lyrics are in many of the tracks. Cold Hard B**** is probably the best offering. Roll over DJ is also good. Are you gonna be my girl is the currently getting pop attention, but is still decent. Overall, its not a bad CD. And considering there arent too many current bands playing this genre of music, I couldnt pass it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"When I first heard \\"Are you gonna be my girl\\"....","review":"I thought to myself \\"Hmmm maybe I could rewrite a George Thorogood song and make a quick buck too\\"Honestly, if you're a classic rock fan, as I am, why listen to a cheap imitation when you can listen to the real deal? Why take Sierra Mist over Sprite? Why watch the Psycho remake when you can see the original Alfred Hitchcock film? Why choose Webster over Arnold from Different Strokes?Don't support plagarism, go to your local store and buy albums by the bands that it made it possible for crap like Jet, the Darkness and Kings of Leon to exist in the first place. Don't let dumb retro nostalgia trends, brought about by the already crappy state of fake grunge and nu metal, dictate what's cool to listen to and what's not.Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I hear the Stooges' Fun House calling me from my stereo....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Album is nothing like the single","review":"To buy Jet's album \\"Get Born\\" based on the single \\"Are you gonna be my girl\\" is misleading. There are 13 or so tracks on the album and about 6 of them are boring ballads that show Jet's gentler side. Add to that the fact that the ballads sound like an Oasis cover band and you've got a pretty boring and uninspired album in your hands.The bands lead singer has a good voice and there are a few promising rock songs on the disc (including the single), but I just can't get past all the generic ballads.If you want all-out rock, I recommend either UK's THE LIBERTINES or NY's BONA ROBA."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP","review":"Worst excuse for a rock'n roll band ever.ONE WORD: BORING!Whatisname from the Manic Street Preachers is right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You buy it for whats on the radio...and that's all you get!","review":"Ok, I'm not going to go on a long rant, but I would like to say I bought this CD based on its superb ratings on amazon and the three cool songs already released on the radio...what a mistake. Beyond \\"Cold Hard B*tch\\", \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\", and \\"Rollover DJ\\", there is nothing to this album. The lyrics are weak and the music uses the same three or four chords of every other crap rock band, not to mention that it all sound the same. Truly a waste of money and time. Download the three good ones and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more","review":"OK, this will teach me to buy a CD based on the 2 or 3 songs I hear on the radio. After \\"Are you gonna be my girl\\" and \\"cold hard b*tch\\" and a few seconds of a couple of the other songs, I though, \\"cool!\\" After listening to the entire CD, however, I can tell you that the 2 above mentioned songs may be the high point of the CD, while the other tracks will likely get skipped over more often than not.If you are so inclined to buy this CD, catch it used and save yourself a few bucks. There is better music out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it","review":"I don't like it because the songs they write are most of all copied and it's really a wast that they don't write an album on they're own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring!","review":"When I've listened to this CD I wonder why I'm not listening to Oasis or ANY other band instead. There's nothing on it that isn't generic and predictable, like a cartoon of 50's rock. It has energy, yes, but so do many much better bands that also have depth and soul. Try Stellastarr* for instance, if you want music that not only gets you going, but has some staying power and EDGE. This is ridiculous. I just want to know who Jet's publicists are. Whoever they are, they are awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry, but this is not good","review":"I have nothing against all of this new music, but it just doesn't fit my style... it's all being done already. Buy the original, there is no need for soemone to try and re-do the 70's hits, other than to sell to people who is stuck in them. No talent playing, song writing, or nothing at all. This is plain crap. i hope this trend is over soon and it will be another pityfull memory like Disco, New Wave and Glam.Highlights: do you wanna be my girl is pretty catchyLowlights: this is just a plain waste of dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"just... terrible.","review":"wow...what is the point of this band, what have they brought to music that has never been brought before?that's what i thought.playing-it-safe lyrics over predictable backdown guitar riffs stolen from all your favorite bands.they ride on the same wagon as the star spangles.dont waste your money, be smart about it like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon Australia","review":"I know they can make better music than this.I wonder, why is it that the people I've known who enjoy this record don't own, let alone have heard of, any great records by Cream, the Stooges or Led Zeppelin? I hate how nostalgia trends in music(see the 90's swing band revival) dictate what's cool to listen to. No one in the mainstream pop music public would care about 70's style classic rock if these dumbasses and the Darkness wheren't around to do so.Listen to real classic rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this!?","review":"what the heck, this cd is total garbage the music is boring with very very stupid lyrics, this band is a discrace to classic rock style music. Don't get me wrong I love classic rock but this is just retarded, posers trying to make aname for themselves. What is up with the lyrics, Are You Gunna Be My Girl has some of the dumbest lyrics ever, and don't even get me started on Cold Hard B**** I read a interview in Guitar World with Jet and they said themselves that the chorus had nothing to do with the verses and visa versa. what is that about? In the same interview they dissed on Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, and Yngwie Malmsteen, if you don'tknow who those guys are then checkthm out, they are 3 of the most talanted guitarists in the world. P.S. I only gave this cd 1 star because it is the lowest rating there is."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun,indie,and catchy doesnt always mean good","review":"ok ill admit it.\\"cold hard b****\\" is a good song.i like it.not afraid to say so no matter how much beef i get from friends of mine.we all listen to bands like sevendust,shinedown,etc. but it doesnt bother me to branch out.the rest of the cd,other than \\"CHB\\" is just awful.i mean nothing was bearable for more than 5 seconds or so.i just couldnt swallow any of it.just not my style but \\"CHB\\" is a way cool tune.\\"are you gonna be my girl\\" is just annoying and \\"rollover dj\\" sux mega.anyways,the point is,if you want a GOOD side of jet, get \\"CHB\\" on itunes or something and keep to the positive side of things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"These guys are such poseurs. Saying that they wear their influences on their sleeves is a massive understatement. Jet are essentially a cover band, and a crappy cover band at that.If you own this album, you really, really deserve to get punched in the face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeds Expectations","review":"I was at first hesitant to buy this CD. The song \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\" is undeniably catchy, and great as a single to intoduce Jet to the masses. However, I was afraid that it would turn out to be the sole good song on the album, and that Jet would prove to be a mere one-hit-wonder.Despite my assumption, I went ahead and bought the CD, and, much to my surprise, I found the entire album to be fantastic. I was especially surprised at the number of slow, mellow songs on the record. The album's producers did an excellent job of intermixing the Stones-evocative rock songs (\\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl,\\" \\"Cold Hard Bitch\\") with the ballads (\\"Look What You've Done,\\" \\"Timothy\\"). Obviously I was wrong in assuming Jet a one-hit-wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh..","review":"This album makes me want to die. Seriously, I've never heard more ambiguously derivative music in my life. The lyrics sound like a random sampling of every rock cliche in the book. The music sounds like a Stooges cover band made up of 13 year olds who just learned how to play. Britney Spears may as well be singing these songs, because Jet is just as phony, trite, and ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm.........","review":"Sample lyric from Rollover DJ -\\"I wanna move but I don't feel rightCause you've been playing other peoples songs all night\\"Oh the irony."},{"rating":"2","title":"great rock album","review":"get born is a nice rock album along with permission to land from the darkness get both the albums and rock out.five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jet Rules","review":"ok, we live in a world of rap, hip hop, and pop music. rock had disappeared, UNTIL NOW. jet comes out of the gates with hard-core chords and amazing vocals. this Australian band, has an amazing mix of fast and slow songs, that all fit together. if you want the return of rock&roll, buy Get Born or Dirty Sweep EP. you will be amazed"},{"rating":"1","title":"man, these guys are so un-original it's sad","review":"they would get two stars, but instead they get one for ripping off iggy pop - - - I don't understand how the musical public can give this band a hit song which is blatenlty stolen from Iggy's \\"Lust for Life\\" - they took the music from this classic song and put pussy lyrics over it - this group is shockingly unoriginal and uninteresting and the lead singer has a foolish looking mullet, so...peace out babybitches - don't buy this. If you want some seriously kick ass rock that is inspired by classic rock from the past, check out The Deadly Snakes, a great band which doesn't just rip off its influences, but makes original, good music instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a 3-song album","review":"These guys play with energy and excitement, and are very reminiscent of the early Who. But the song writing just isn't there. Besides the radio hits \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\" (which is The Who's \\"My Generation\\" played sideways), and \\"Look What You've Done\\" (John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" played sideways), there is really only 1 other decent song on the album.The rest are just rambling junk with no hook, no interesting solos, and forgettable lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Predictable","review":"After one listen to this CD, which thankfully I don't own, here's the low(let)down. I heard their radio singles and thought to myself, here's the next band who will be loved by the same folks who buy in to music by the likes of the White Stripes, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and the Hives among others. To me, all of this music sounds like a rehash of mainstream material coming in part from the 60s 70s and 80s. AC/DCs definitely in there, yeah--rip from a band not originally known for, well, originality. To get back to my point, sure enough, this CD has shown up in collections of folks I know who also have the other aforementioned albums. Predictability. You buy this album and you are cool because every goon out there with a radio knows every lyric to every song--not because the music and lyrics are at all new, heartfelt, or groundbreaking. It won't be long until this music gathers dust in a bargain bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, I'm not impressed...","review":"I was really hoping to like this album after hearing how it was supposedly a break from the mainstream alternative rock sound. And while I love the songs \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\", \\"Cold Hard B****\\", and \\"Take It Or Leave It\\", the rest doesn't really appeal to me. There's hardly anything original, if you ask me. The slow songs are just too...dull. The song \\"Lazy Gun\\" starts out great, but then turns into this slow dull song...much like the other slower tracks on this album. While I appreciate Jet's effort to take us back to classic rock, I think I'll just go back to the 70's and listen to the original instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half of the Album is Good","review":"If they would just cut out the stupid ballads this album would be a lot better. There are 4 or 5 good songs on this entire album and that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, consistently pleasing set of tracks","review":"I first got into this band after hearing their song \\"Look What You've Done\\", and after I put the CD in and listened to the whole thing, I was definitely quite pleased with the variations in tracks I heard. Some are great for driving to (\\"Gonna Get What You Need\\" and \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\"), and others are great for simply listening to while doing work and singing along to (\\"Look What You've Done\\"). With the diverse track arrangement, you will be kept on your toes, regardless of what you are in the mood for. There is some slight resemblance to The Strokes, true, but Jet has their own sound and pace, enough to hold up on their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cant give it zero stars!","review":"All of those positive reviews for this crap compare it to \\"good rock\\" and \\"classic rock like AC/DC\\" as if the two phrases werent as far from each other as possible. Which they are. So please kill yourself if you like this band. I'm just kidding! Seriously though, why would anyone find any appeal here? Because they sound like a joke band, maybe Jimmy Fallon playing sing along and dress up on SNL? I mean, they are on VH1 so they have got to be great! I usually dont ever do negative reviews because who wants to waste time dwelling on the negative? Well, I suppose I do. So there. Turn your head and look away. Please dont listen here. You are better than this. You really are. Nobody should do this to themselves. Isnt this the music they torture Iraqi prisoners with in Abu Ghraib?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-off","review":"Can I just say that \\"Look what you've done\\" rips off the lyrics of the Beatles' \\"Sexy Sadie\\" and the melody and style of Oasis' \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" and Fastball's \\"Out Of My Head.\\" This band is fake."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad....","review":"My, my what an awful album! Sure they sound alright as far as sound is concerned- heck \\"Are you gonna be my girl\\" is catchy enough, but the complete lack of any originality on their part is horrible, without excuse. Even the band themselves have a lame excuse when asked why their hit single sounded so much like several other songs; they said \\"you can't copyright a riff.\\" Pick this album apart and I dare anyone to find a scrap of something new. The band's name? From a Paul McCartney song. The album title? A lyric from Bob Dylan's 'Subterranian Homesick Blues.' The album art? The beatles' 'revolver.' Luckily I don't forsee anything coming from this band in the future; but I may be very wrong, if the populace still is able to consume this stuff. In conclusion; if you've been living under a musical rock since 1959 this album will sound new and fresh. If you haven't you might still like it to play at your school dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get plunger","review":"...Because this piece of crap doesn't flush very well. I agree with every other 1 star review. Jet rehashes every cliche known to mankind and then we are all in for a treat because the radio staions are all dying to make us listen to it 50 times an hour. I have one friend that likes Jet. That same friend likes Outkast. I don't think were friends anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jet needs to \\"get bent\\"","review":"OMG, there's a new band that's bringing back rock from the days of AC/DC! You gotta check 'em out! Yeah, right. Jet is just a cheap imitation of AC/DC. The lead singer is annoying and the guitar riffs sound JUST LIKE AC/DC. If you're such a fan of classic rock, then just listen to classic rock. We don't need any more cheap imitations of classic rock, just be original. That's why AC/DC was such a great band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelieveable ripoff","review":"What's a good way to lazily get rich off of stupid people? Rip off all the most popular bands since 1960."},{"rating":"2","title":"JET rocks!","review":"JET rocks the music world with their new CD \\"Get Born\\". You can find it in electronic stores near you. It is my new favorite CD, and I bet you will like it too if you are into the classics such as the Beatles, AC/DC, ect. I knew I wanted this CD ever since I head the song \\"Are you gonna be my girl\\" on the radio. Check it out, I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest new Band out there!!!!","review":"The first time I heard Jet was when they performed live on Saturday Night Live. I couldn't stop thinking about them afterwards! They are an absolutley amazing band! The best thing is that they are a real band!!! Not like a lot of these wannabe groups today. Jet is real! The day after hearing them on SNL I ran out to get the CD! The CD is great! Not a single song on it that I don't love. Jet is going to be a huge group! AMAZING is all i can say! Everyone should get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumps up for Amazon!!!","review":"I live in Thailand which is so far from the US, but the CD still arrived far earlier than estimated date without any scratch! Thank you very much Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath of fresh air","review":"Jet is the perfeect modern day band for people who's music collection is made up of music that wasn't even recorded this century. I am a die-hard Beatles fan who people thought would never listen to a band from today. Jet's first album 'Get born' managed to turn the right gears in my head and prove others wrong. When I saw the album cover it was obivous that great classic Rock bands had influnced them, and i could tell. Jet has an orginal sound and I recogmend buying this album!~Madison (madelfgirl)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting reviews this band gets....","review":"The fact that they rip-off of other works shamelessly doesn't sink into many heads. It's not them being \\"creative geniuses\\"; it's them being plain lazy. If a band's hits (all four of them) have to be ripped off in order to be made, I feel that there's no real talent there.Think about all the people who hate Quentin Tarantino. They say he rips off shamelessly, but he has all these people who hate him. Jet doesn't, and they are widely accepted for copying.Maybe our generation has sunk so low that it's alright to copy music endlessly. I don't get it.Now look at Interpol, The Darkness, Franz Ferdinand, and Modest Mouse. They copy the 70's or 80's STYLE, but what they don't do is copy. They make up their own riffs and drumbeats, and are a bit more original. I suggest you check them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock and Roll that got this mom's heart racing","review":"After hearing Are You Gonna Be My Girl on the radio I bought the CD cold-knowing nothing at all about the group. The music has a 60's 70's classic rock feel with a modern edge that gets me going at anytime. I think I would even go see them in concert although I have not been to a live rock and roll concert since the late 70's when I saw Led Zeppelin as a teen.(Why didn't I save that black t shirt)?This CD rocks for all age's."},{"rating":"1","title":"They've Been Playing Other People's Songs All Night","review":"From the start, Jet look like a band with potential. Their lead singer has an outstanding voice and the band sounds tight together. They try too hard, but that's not what makes this album below average. The problem is they're \\"influences\\" are too pervasive in this album. The Bassline to \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\" is a straight rip off of Iggy Pop, and \\"Look What You Done\\" has just about the same melody and lyrics as the Beatles' \\"Sexy Sadie.\\" I didn't give the album one star because Jet have the tools to become a great rock and roll band. But the cliche's in this record are just too much. Next time, Jet, put substance over style."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is creative then the world is becoming a sad place-","review":"I will give the jets a compliment- There music is pretty catchy and the instrumentals are very decent, if not well put together. The vocals are not all that good, they can sing better than me- not that that is saying much. I would have rated the band 3 stars, if they had better lyrics that were more original, creative and deep. I mean- Are you gonna be my girl and Rollover D.J, come on guys don't you have anything better to sing about? Well the one thing that I despise of is that when you listen to The Jets for a long time it starts to disgust you how sexist they are! Some of the comments they make really makes me lose respect for them.\\"Well it's a 123 take my hand and come with me.Is it cause you look so fine that i really wanna make you mine?I said you look so fine that I really want to make you mine.\\" That just sounds really offensive, is he talking about a prostitute? Very disrespectful to women in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Name that tune","review":"I give this a 1 because 0 isn't an option. I liked their first single \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl?\\" better the first time I heard it, when it was called \\"Lust for Life.\\" The rest of the album pretty much falls into that crappy new (though strangely unoriginal) style being populated by the Strokes, White Stripes, Rooney, etc. Boy I can't wait til three years from now when the people who buy these albums are gonna be thinking \\"Wow, I had horrible taste back then.\\" Please pass on this album. It has no value other than you could use the disc to make an art project like in that AOL commercial and use the case as a coaster.
