But, I have been waiting for a nice box set and allowed myself to splurge. Just arrived yesterday, and I unboxed today. All things shaming WB aside, this thing is insanely nice. The box opens, then the sides open like a cabinet, revealing little drawers and nooks with goodies. The Blu-ray/DVDs are housed in really nice, thick books.

It's the packaging and extras that really win me over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it, no way!","review":"I agree with the other reviewers, this is ridiculous. I postponed a purchase of the HP movies on Blu-Ray because I'd heard the rumor of a fantastic complete set this year. I am a big HP fan and enjoy the extras and behind-the-scenes stuff. But $350????? No way. I thought it'd be more like $200. I don't know why companies keep releasing the Blu-Ray/DVD combo -- if you are buying Blu-Ray, it's because you don't need DVD. And I have no use for the digital copies. I am so irritated by this blatent marketing ploy that I will not be buying the movies on Blu-Ray until something better is offered. In the meantime, hopefully someone will post the extras on YouTube."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there anything new?","review":"I don't know who I'm their right mind would fork over money for this box set.

No, I have my entire HP collection on Bluray, plus the 3D versions of DH's 1&2 for less that 100.00. That included my \\"digital\\" copies as well. Which are of no use what so ever.

It doesn't matter that it is one big box. What would matter to me would be if the set included the extended versions and outtakes from each movie. I don't understand why they changed the the original strategy of releasing \\"Ultimate Editions\\" with all the material the fans wanted. After releasing the first two movies with extended versions in the UE, subsequent movies did not include the extended feature, only the theatrical version. All this new box set contains is all of the same UE content repackaged with one additional disc.

To be really honest, my dad is already 76 years old, and he loved Harry Potter. I'm not going to waste another 2-5 years waiting for all extended cuts and THEN only buy the blu-ray for him. So what I did was I bought the normal blu-ray editions recently (just before you recall all them back), and having bought that, I have decided not to wait for any extended cuts and will never buy another Harry Potter box in ANY WAY!I can survive without the extended cuts since I have the books. But that is really silly. If you have released all the extended cuts by now I would have bought it.

This huge box has will not fit on my shelf, I don't need 8 DVD's (6 of which I already own), and for $350, it should AT LEAST include a working Nimbus 2012.... the bare bones 8 disc box set for $80 is looking better and better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter fans - open your eyes, and don't let them get your money","review":"Still pissed off that they haven't even finished releasing the ultimate editions (oh yeah, they were supposed to be the 'ultimate' cant get any better than this' dvd releases right?) and now they are trying to get us to buy films we already own, plus pay for the blu-ray discs when a lot of us won't even have blu-ray players so we can access a few cheap props thrown in and 4 extra hours of special features? The only way they could get me to buy this would be to throw a new book written by J.K Rowling in and even then I'd be pissed. It's just so they can sell the same product multiple times... Each to their own, but they're not getting my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOWER THE PRICE!!!","review":"So let me get this straight. The James Bond 50 collection has 22 blu-rays in it. That means 22 MOVIES. And contains exclusive items. And it's only $180.00 or so right now. Yet, we have this collection, with only 8 MOVIES and exclusive items, and this is double the price? Where is the logic in that?Even if this was the penultimate box set, that $350.00 price tag is astronomical. I only have this pre-ordered because I'm hoping they come to their senses and lower this ridiculous price. If they don't, they can kiss my pre-order goodbye because I'm not spending double the funds on less than half the entertainment of the Bond set.Good God!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting","review":"There is virtually no new content.

Bad form WB. Bad form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Thanks but no thanks. This is a huge waste of money from a greedy company. After all of the support from the fans, you'd think they would treat us a little better. There really isn't anything that new here.

I am purchasing no more HP merchandise."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh...","review":"Honestly not all that excited for this after seeing it.

Actually highly disappointed in WB."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you serious?","review":"People who are saying this package is massive seriously have a bad case of Stockholm syndrome for spending a wasteful amount of money. I walked into Costco and saw 3 of these box sets that had obviously been sitting there awhile. First off they are about the size of a box holding a basketball. Tiny. Not some huge trunk like its advertised by idiots and Warner bros alike. 2nd it was marked down from the price here on amazon and it still wasn't even worth the marked down price.Anyone giving this a 5 star review has to be a concerned Warner Bro employee. This isn't even a product, it's a joke. Anyone who buys this is throwing away their money. I wouldn't buy this if I was a billionaire on principle alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all 3D???","review":"I don't understand why this \\"magnificent\\" set doesn't contain ALL the movies in a 3D version.

What a rip!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough is enough","review":"If your even looking at this set, then chances are you already have all the movies.

This \\"ultimate\\" boxed set does NOT include extended editions of all 8 films. I already got burned buying the collection of all 8 blu-rays only to discover they weren't the extended editions.

What a rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a waste","review":"I am a huge HP fan, and WB is spitting in all of the fans faces. I see no reason to buy this, there are no new deleted or extended scenes, no extended versions of the last 6 films (which going over all of the released deleted or extended scenes, 7 part 1, and part 2's could have easily been put back in for extended versions of the films), and all of the bonus content from the Ultimate Editions of 1-6 with nothing added it seems. I am clearly disappointed at not just the content but the OUTRAGEOUS price. Nice try WB but you won't be robbing me (or a lot of other fans) blind with this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a rip off!","review":"No extended additions so not worth the money, it's as big a disappointment as the ultimate editions were (I didn't buy them for the same reason). I refuse to buy any Harry Potter DVD that does not have deleted scenes added into the movie. I so don't buy that nonsense that there wasn't enough material left on the cutting room floor to add scenes back into the movies.

Sorry WB, no more Galleons from me until you put out a boxed set with ALL EIGHT MOVIES in extended editions."},{"rating":"1","title":"25% useless","review":"It's bad enough when you buy a blu-ray movie for $15-$20 and you're forced to pay for a regular DVD copy that you don't need. Now with this set, we're paying $350 for a 31 disc set where 25% of the discs are useless. Even if you have never bought a HP movie, why do you need to pay for an extra regular DVD copy of each movie? I try my best to support special edition packaging, to encourage more stores to carry it and for the studios to make more. I figured I'd buy whatever Harry Potter set that came out, despite the fact that I already own all the films and bought them knowing there would be an \\"ultimate\\" set.Now? Forget it. Tell ya what, knock 25% of the cost off and take out the normal DVD copies I have absolutely no need for, and I'll re-consider buying it. Until then, Warner Bros can take their corporate greed and shove it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets all take a deep breath","review":"People, people, people.....this is exactly what WB wants with this HP collection. The price will start high ( lot higher than I thought ). After a few months of fan complaints it will be lowered; as we see.

Even at $30.00 each that only comes to $210.00 - What IS Warner thinking?! Rowling is already a multi-millionaire so she can't possibly need the residuals.

I for one will not be spending $350 for only 5 hours of new bonus features (give me a break). Actually, Warner Bros. should be held accountable for misleading the public over the fact that they said & advertised that they would be releasing the ultimate editions of all of the movies with extended cuts, but in reality they only released the first six films and only the first 2 had extended cuts.

Cruel, greedy, lousy, money-mongering, ungrateful--this is what Warner Brothers has become towards HP fans.

I have an older APC Ups attached to the same outlet, that was running 3 monitors and a rather beefy pc (no issues). All self performed tests unplugging it from the wall etc worked great, however every time we experienced an actual outage the devices attached to this UPS lost power. If you cant rely on the UPS to be UN-INTERRUPTIBLE then its worthless.

It was about 90 days after I bought it, not 30 as it would be expected. I contacted the company that sold me this device and, to my surprise, they contacted the vendor and got an approval for RMA. I got a complete refund for this box. Excellent job, people! I will definitely recommend you to all my friends and will buy from you again. Maybe I was unlucky this particular time, I have idea, maybe the device was a little defective, switching between the modes a little slower, than my desktop was expecting.

This is even though I was told by a supervisor that a letter from the company would be sufficient in lieu of them having purchase record on file.In short - they had told me to get a letter for them, I did, they still dishonor the warranty.DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THEM --- NOT ONLY DO THE PRODUCTS NOT HOLD UP, BUT THEY WILL NOT HONOR THEIR WORD, OR THE WARRANTY!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: 4 UPS protected sockets but can only control 1 computer","review":"I was disappointed to find out that in spite of having 4 Battery protected sockets on their system, the CyberPower CP1350AVRLCD UPS system/software can only supervise the shutdown of one computer (or device?)in a power out event.This doesn't make sense to me.

Replacements go for $13.00 each on the net. Give this little wonder a try. If I have to find something that I would change, it would be that you cannot lock out the beautiful control panel on the front of the UPS so, if you have small kids around, you need to keep them away from the UPS or you may find your system(s) down.

The included software makes it easy to check on the units health. There are some critics that report the information screen on the unit stays on and that it is bright and annoying. That isn't true. Like my APC ups unit, the screen comes on for a few seconds if something additional draws power through the unit. The only light that stays on during normal operation is the on/off button.

Don't calculate your own power requirement based on this test, but I'm confident it will work just fine for the brief power outages we occasionally experience during thunderstorms.

Yes, the Cyberpower units are more expensive than the APCs I used to use, but you get what you pay for.

This is one of the reasons I purchased this UPS so it's good that it functions correctly.Pushing the power button on the front will turn off the UPS without warning.

I also had problems getting power from one of the regular surge sockets. I'm not sure if this particular unit simply cannot handle my basic Compaq PC or if I needed the Pure Sine Wave version or if it was defective, but the experience has me considering APC next time.

Folks who purchase UPS devices need to be aware of the Wattage limits. Low Wattage UPS devices are of little to no use when the combined rating of all electronics exceeds the min UPS rating. In short, total up the Watts for all of the items to be plugged into the battery side of the UPS and that is what you should use as the basic power rating when buying a new UPS. Pay attention to the Mfg. specs. It may pay to use more than one UPS to get the desired protection. NOTE: It is important for you to have a good GROUND system at the electrical box. Your power company can help you there. Poor grounding contributes to serious damage to electronics during a surge. The UPS can only help do its part, but it is not absolute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I've had this unit for about 6 weeks now. We've lost power to the house several times due to a hurricane and summer thunder storms. The UPS kicked in flawlessly everytime and kept our computer and routers running.

The UPS gives us about 35-45 minutes of runtime before we need to shutdown.I tested the auto-shutdown feature and it worked fine...once the battery was drained to the threshold I set (10% left), the iMac shutdown.Also the unit is completely silent under normal conditions. When the power goes out and the battery backup kicks in, a fan turns on. Yes, you can hear the fan, but it's not loud at all.I'm very happy with it so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Requires little space and works great!","review":"Works great out of the box.

I have a 55\\" LED TV, PS3, DVR, Receiver, and bunch of other accessories all running of the UPS and it works flawlessly. The LCD displays a wealth of information (just wish the back light would stay on instead of going off after a few seconds!). Had it's first test a few weeks ago when we lost power in a snow storm. All the lights went out but I was still watching TV as if nothing had happened! Safely was able to shut everything down. Don't expect to run all your electronics for any extended period of time - that's not what this UPS is for. At about 50% load I had about 8 minutes of run time. Also be aware that you cannot run this unit off of a generator (unless you have one of those expensive inverter generators). The power is just too variable from the generators and the UPS kicks on and off constantly. Other than that, great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"I have enjoyed it alot.

A friend and I were browsing in a store of imported goodies and she recognized the candy from one of her many trips to Hawaii. She bought a couple boxes and I immediately fell in love. If you are unfamiliar with rice candy, it is basically a very chewy gummy candy (lemon flavored and sort of tastes like a Jujubee), wrapped in rice paper.

It gives enough information to initiate you into what is expected of all members of the camera crew, but is not overwhelming with technical info (not that you are not going to want that info someday, but if you are new, it can be confusing and even discouraging.) After this book, get David Elkin's Camera Assistant's Manual, which goes into much further detail. As you work with different cameras, download the manuals from the panavision/arri/aaton/etc websites so you can feel comfortable with the differences in individual cameras. Lastly, get a used copy of the very expensive American Cinematographer Manual for all the technical bits in one handy portable reference book. This, and tons of set experience, is probably all you need (and keep in mind some of the greatest cinematographers who ever lived worked without any of these aids).

The beautiful illustrations are placed two on a page rather than singly like in the individual books. This throws off the timing of the story & is visually less appealing as the pictures are crowded & much smaller.Yes - the stories are the same & are still charming. However, spend the extra money and purchase the books individually.

However, I LOVED this story. As I read it, I could almost see exactly where I was being taken as a reader. I knew I was about to be pulled in, but I loved every moment of it! The story, quite simply, is one which could be said of any child's favorite Christmas toy. Eventually, that toy is replaced by something -- be it another toy or simply the heartbreak of every child's growing up. Reminiscent of Silverstein's _The Giving Tree,_ the rocking horse keeps vigil, waiting for the little boy who used to have great adventures with him everyday. A happy ending rewards readers who know in their hearts that it is coming (but keep a tissue handy!).

I was very disappointed given the natural drama of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly academic","review":"I found this book through a newspaper review and eagerly bought it. I was very disappointed. It is overly academic, dull, poorly organized and excessively wordy. As a journalist, I understand the powers of brevity and clarity, but the author does not. Even the organization, by month, leaves a lot to be desired as the author still skips between months. The political background becomes so laborious that it is impossible to follow a chain of events or personalities.

The young man who sings Night Show should get some airplay for this sultry love song. The religous views of Hammer are less obvious on this album as heard in Inside Out or Family Affair but the track Spittin' Fire is an impressive Gospel Hip Hop cut characteristic of the Funky Headhunter album.

The few bright spots really stick out (\\"Our Style,\\" featuing some skillful rhyming from the Stooge Playas, and \\"Ain't no Stoppin' Us\\") because of the weakness of the rest of the album.

There is little to no bass, no high trebles, and only muffled mids. Plus, the maximum volume is very weak. My laptop speakers (Armada E500) reach about the same volume as the A.L. speakers.Also, the shape is not very functional...they tip easily because they are supported by thin, light metal stands.Overall, I would highly discourage the purchase of these.

Crumb, the weird cartoonist of the sixties, that a person with female anatomy is going to come.

Ok, well maybe not that \\"horrorible\\" but the youthful adventure aspect of this adventure is soiled (in a cruddily good way) with knives, blood, and drugs (mainly: Whitley's, Old Skull Popper, and Corpse Reviver, Creeper, and the ancient smokeables).The story is certainly not for everyone (especially if all you read are best selling drivel fests), but anyone who's had a bit of an oddballish upbringing will find that it strangely resonates.Oh, and the illustrations are brilliant like a charcol Bill Sienkiewicz (circa Elektra Assasin).Last, writers should take note of Lynda's peculiar method...using a paintbrush to write the original manuscript!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cruddy","review":"very engrossing book, not for the timid.

Terrific Read.","review":"I don't know that this would be classified as ya fiction, though its main charcter is a young adult. This is the story of a troubled youth, in a troubling world. Had I not been familiar with Ms Barry's other work I doubt I would have bought the book- the title just does not draw you in. The story does. Well writen, engaging, brutally honest, a book I would recommend to all teenagers/adults to provide some insight into a world of which most of us are unfamiliar."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"Whoever said it was like \\"Rule of the Bone\\" and \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" hit it right on the head...this book will grab you by the shirt and haul you through all sorts of unlikely situations. Barry's writing survives even detailed analysis, tough and flexible and capturing perfectly the feelings of despair, exhilaration, and hope for each of the characters. I read this book when I was sixteen; Barry has an innate understanding of the way things can accelerate and snowball in teenagers' lives. I remember it every time a train blows through the station going full out. It is the kind of book that will dig its way into your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have you ever craved a popsicle and all you had was a cigarette?","review":"I make everyone I know read this book.

What it DOES do is keep the dog from roaming around your car, or jumping out as soon as you open the door. But we have had a few times when we have had to brake quickly, and it kept our dog from flying toward the front seat, so it did keep her (and us) safe in those cases. We wish we could use a dog safety harness, but she just won't wear one... so this was the next best thing, since we could use it with her current harness."},{"rating":"1","title":"more silly than scary","review":"OK, there are a lot of Halloween-type sound effects CDs out there, and being a sound effects colllector, I like to check them out every so often. However, I'd have to place this one at the botom of the list. The sounds are really more silly than spooky, what sounds there are. Most of what's on this 25-minute CD is music--poorly played music. This is the price we pay for having easy access to synthesizers and samplers--we get CDs like this. AS far as the sounds go, there's nothing in here that even reminds me of a haunted house--no wind or rain, howling wolves, insane laughter, not even one measly little space alien. The supposed horrific screams are amateurish and comical, and the ghost effect? Just some woman going \\"oooooooooo\\" through some special effects. Why don't they make them like \\"the Chilling Thrilling Sounds of the Haunted House\\" anymore?"},{"rating":"2","title":"WWII 7th Army","review":"I used this as a reference book to pull out precious details, as I was researching my father's WWII service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial, disjointed & mildly racist","review":"This book is less a work of serious military history than it is a written version of a series of Movietone news reels of the US 7th Army's campaigns in the Mediterranean and Europe in World War 2, right down to the racial overtones typical of the period.It jumps around in time and place, from one action item to the next, rarely fully developing anything. It leaves the reader with the distinct impression that the only troops of any value are white American boys, blacks (the author's term, not mine) are only good for driving trucks in the rear areas, and that whilst using napalm in the Pacific on asians was OK, using it in Europe on white folks wasn't.If you want to read a thorough, yet accessible history of the US Army's campaign in W.Europe in WW2 I recommend \\"Eisenhower's Lieutenants\\" by Russell F.Weigley.

The subtitles are a little annoying because they are actually closed captioning so there are moments where you will read-rapid firing and humming.I can forgive them for having this type of subtitle becuase the movie itself is just fun to watch and there isn't a lot of dialogue.This is a very well-crafted movie. There are subtle references to the Hornet's Nest title throughout the film (watch for them!) and there are sufficient action sequences.

At the end of the movie, bambi is still little and he shows off his little antlers. I studied deer in class, and deer are all big and grown up when they start to get their antlers. Maybe disney didn't know.The songs were pretty bad. I like country songs, but I wanted to hear disney songs. Bambi and Thumper talk too much, too. Bambi calls the great prince dad. Bambi was supposed to call him father, because he calls his mom mother. And when Bambi falls off a cliff, he gets up again like he was never hurt.

He is then chased by hunters and his father comes to his rescue only to yell at him after leading him to safety (this is the part my daughter had tears in her eyes).The father does bond with him at times, but then sends him away with a foster mother. Only after an almost replay of his mother's death, does Bambi father decide to keep him.I know Disney likes to kill off a parent or two in their movies to make a dramatic story, but come on!

The artwork is superb, the storyline excellent, the characters' development fuller, and the sequencing flawless. Here, Bambi grows up, trying to gain the approval of his aloof Great Prince-daddy, and ends-up gaining his respect as well. A Word of Warning however: while the movie generally is light and sweetness, there is a tense and dark sequence where Bambi and Filene are chased by a pack of Man's Dogs which can be scary for the very young-uns --but it's conclusion became a major subject of \\"wow!\\" afterwards --as did the whole movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift","review":"This was a Christmas gift for the grand children.

I recommend this CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Retro Design & Bang for the Buck","review":"I got these speakers to add a little more oomph in the sound department for my basement TV (which is the only place in the house my wife lets me play video games.... sad, I know). Hook-up was a snap; they connect to the audio out ports on the back of my 27\\" flat-screen Toshiba. The left and right speakers have a very generous cord and their stands allow them to be adjusted to provide some directional sound control. The base is a hearty 8\\" and quite powerful.What's also cool is that the volume control unit also has two ports for headphones, so my friend and I can use those if my wife needs it quite in the house. Overall a great bang for the buck! I also think the \\"grill\\" look of old fashioned microphones is cool; very retro. They don't look like the garden variety speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap!","review":"The knife handles are a tad too short for comfort when being held, and the weight of these utensils is very light, meaning made very inexpensively.

My problems are that it hit when I typed in Civil War so with the title I thought it would be letters to soldiers during the Civil War. No description was given to tell me otherwise. So you know how it is when you expect one thing and then a couple chapters in you finally realize it isn't anything close to what you really wanted how the disappointment sets in? That's what this book did for me.

While the treble sounds fine, perfectly clear...this system has NO BASS! My husband recently bought a $35 set of 2 computer speakers and subwoofer and his setup sounds 10x better than mine!Because the subwoofer feeds power off the stereo/reciever it's hooked up to, and does NOT have its own direct power supply or amplifier, it literally lacks power. This subwoofer is the biggest joke ever! I can barely hear the bass on most things, even with the volume cranked up.Bose products are extremely overrated and overpriced. Do not waste your money -- buy something worthwhile (for a fraction of the price!), and make sure the subwoofer has its own amplifier/direct line to outlet."},{"rating":"1","title":"no impressed with the acoustmass system","review":"I figured that anything from bose would be excellent but I have to say that this product is an exception. I have it hooked up to my samsung 55\\" flat screen lcd tv. One of the most annoying things about this product is that the remote has to be pointed directly at the receiver for it to pick up the command. The bose wave system picks up remote signals from a far wider angle range and you dont have to be right on it but the accustamas isnt made the same way; unfortunately. The sound quality of the speakers seems average but the sub woofer is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try before you buy!!!","review":"Buy these if you must, but before you spend $400 on them, please visit a local stereo shop and hear how much better $400, or $300, or even $200 spent there will sound. Really. I bet you'll find that any decent independent stereo shop will have a multitude of options superior to Bose for equal or less money, and you'll be supporting a locally owned business that will almost certainly offer you vastly better service and advice than that you'll find in a big box store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bose: The power of advertising.","review":"Proof positive of the power of advertising, Bose has made a name (and money) for itself by designing mediocre quality audio equipment.Unlike AKG or Sennheiser and other high-end manufacturers, Bose uses cheaper parts and less than average electrical engineering principals. These are highlighted especially in their speakers. Their principle of direct-reflection, while novel in 1969 is now incredibally antiquated and is far surpassed by high and mid-end manufacturers whose products outperform Bose. The company was so humiliated by Consumer Reports who compared Bose with other products that it sued (and lost).Someone once said \\"There's a sucker born every minute\\". Now that's appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOSE STRANGE ANIMAL","review":"In the last 40 years I have listened to people critique BOSE speakers. I have owned the 501 series IV since 1984. The extremely LARGE wood grain box speakers that have not produced for many many years. 100% WOOF AND TWEET. They still perform as well as they did in \\"84\\" and any compact version of this or any top brand will never compare. Two years ago, I purchased the 301 bookshelf speakers also from BOSE. They produce a very clean, yet super midrange sound. The case in point is that SIZE, DIMENSION, and decade of manufacture can triumph or put SHAME on technology. The BOSE name is now pretty much just a logo. STRANGE ANIMALS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"I paid what I thought was a premium price for premium speakers which sound like cheasy 1950s paper spekers. No bass, buzzes, no dynamic range, etc. , etc. etc. These speaker are all ads, ads, ads. No delivery at all. I have them hooked up to a good Denon 200 Watt receiver, and zip performance. Nada. They sound a thousand times worse than the rotted out 20-year-old Radio Shack speakers they replace. Bose is all puff and guff!!! No wonder they dont sell in regular audio stores; no one will handle this junk!!! Garbage!!! I was ripped off!! I am going back to Radio Shack. At least I dont feel bad paying nothing for junk then. And their junk is at least priced right. Jim Isham, Penfield, NY. God, this pisses me off. Bose can go jump in the lake and take their overhyped overpriced speakers with them; tied to their feet!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big struggle to find the suitable cable to connect it","review":"Bose unfortunately provides little support. It does not come with any information on how to connect it to even LCD TVs. If you are buying this for an LCD TV or other home theater systems, you are in for a surprise. It is going to cost you many hours of search in locating a cable to connect to an RCA audio output.I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin sound","review":"I should have read all the negative reviews that are out there about BOSE. They sound super thin.. no middle tones. The passive sub-woofer is a joke. I did a comparison on the same Onkyo receiver I have between my super old, cheap floor standing speakers (some off brand from BestBuy, bought in 2002) and this system. Every single song I played, sounded better on my old speakers.Just go for JBL, HK.. or whatever else.. just not these here. Sad, I was really looking forward to de-clutter my living room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consumer Reports Correction","review":"Another reviewer said: \\"Consumer Reports who compared Bose with other products that it sued (and lost)\\"Bose won... the ruling said: \\"The District Court found that Consumer Reports \\"had published the false statement with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard...\\". The ruling was later overturned only because the higher court did not find \\"actual malice\\". [In short the courts agree with Bose but didn't award any money because there was no proof that Consumer Reports did the report to be mean.]Reviewers don't like to be sued. Every since the law suit, reviewer tend to be bias against Bose.With that said... Bose aren't worth the retail price but are great speakers when you can get them on sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acoustimass","review":"I'm a speaker lover, and not a Bose-hater. Bose makes some incredible speakers: like the 901, some of the best I've ever heard. The Bose Acoustimass series are not very good, frankly, but obviously fine for most people. Missing a significant portion of the midrange is OK, apparently, if they look cool enough. The bass is one-dimensional. If it weren't for an advertising budget, I'm certain no one would own an Acoustimass, since they will lose any head-to-head challenge at almost any price. My sister-in-law gave me her system since she knows I like speakers. I very quickly gave this system to my son for college, since it won't matter if it gets stolen."},{"rating":"1","title":"this system blows (not in a good way)","review":"do not buy this system. for the money there are much better systems out there.I bought this for my family room mainy for the small size of the cube speakers. The main problem with the system (which bose has corrected by the way) is that the \\"acoustimass\\" component (bose's fancy name for a subwoofer) is not active (or powered) which means the base is totally inadequate and is overun by the cubes which have no mid or bass ranges. The result is that you get a very \\"tinny\\" sound out of most applications including dvd's. I ended up getting a sony active subwoofer and it sounds much better.In hindsight I would have bought a different brand than bose, but already had to much invested in bose to scrap the system completely, and the size of the cubes is nice. Still pissed that I spent that much money on a substandard system, but hey, got sucked into the bose marketing machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acoustamess","review":"My best friend bought one of these systems and eagerly called me over to hear it. I thought it was a simple minimal system good enough for a kids room. Then he told me how much he paid for it. I nearly fainted. The surround speakers that I built myself For under $300.00 should go for $100,000.00 by these standards. The acoustimass is not Hi-Fi. Distortion, Boomy unfocused bass, no lower mid range, no low bass, no high treble, poor sound stage and generally cheap. I thought Bose was high end stuff. This really burst my balloon."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good monitor","review":"having previously owned a gateway monitor with a diamondtron tube which was very good, i bought this one. the unit i got had horrible vertical convergence (NEC-Mitsubishi has a sofware utility with test patterns for you to try to adjust everything) and a 10% dim spot on the right side of the screen. this was not due to some local magnetic field, as moving the monitor changed nothing. The vertical grid wires were loose near the dead spot. NEC-mitsubishi tech support kept telling me to \\"whack\\" the monitor to get the wires unstuck, but the problem is that the wires move *too much* and aren't aligned (you can see the wires on that part of the screen vibrate upon whacking). after much wrangling with tech support they very very reluctantly agreed to ship me a new one. the new one had good convergence but had the same exact dim spot on the right side. so i give up. if it takes more than 2 tries to get a nondefective monitor, it's not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me","review":"We're currently using a dozen of these monitors at my office for CAD and Presentation drawing.

I insisted that we buy an HP because our old HP printer was so reliable. This printer, however, drives me batty. It gets frequent paper jams, and I cannot get it to print envelopes straight. Currently, it is printing black print in varying shades of brown, despite the fact that I just replaced the black ink cartridge. Most infuriating, however, is its tendency to just stop working midway through a print job. This happens about 30% of the time. It will simply stop, and I have to go into the printer box on the computer to restart it. It is a huge waste of time and paper (it spits out the half-printed page when you restart it and starts that page over), and just plain irritating. I think maybe I'll check out the other brands when I finally lose it and pitch this one through the window."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Great Printer!","review":"This printer is one great printer in its price range! Fast and well built for its weight. The cartriges last a decent time and the colors are good. It's easy to find replacement cartriges too.

This is not the best ink jet but it may be for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible paper handling","review":"I bought this printer for a few reasons. First was the print head cartridge combination. I had gotten tired of the innefective print head cleaning of my Espon c-80 (soon to head to the junk pile since I can't get the print head to print reliably anymore) and wanted to avoid that issue alltogether. The second reason I bought it was its footprint, which is great for a small desk (or under the desk in this case). Lastly was price.However, its paperhandling is horrible, and I concur with a few of the other reviewers complaining about the same issue. The ONLY way it will feed paper (standard 24# white) is by my moistening two fingers and gently pressing the paper forward as the printer seeks the next sheet. Frankly, this is NOT an acceptable alternative. While it seems that some reviewers are not having this problem, the machine I have is a lemon in this regard. I would not recommend this printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another bad home printer","review":"This printer is so much worse than the \\"Office\\" printers that HP sells.

So, when I talked my friends into seeing Soldier Blue when it was released, I wasn't as surprised as my friends. I knew the history. I knew How We Won the West wasn't as 'clean' as the history books told. Colonel Chivington, the officer responsible was asked why he killed women and children and he replied simply, \\"nits make lice.\\" Of course, I grew up in suburbia living in lands we took from the Indians and the Mexicans so I was a mixed bag of outrage and bewilderment. I believe in films like Soldier Blue even if they do show America in a bad light. I think it only makes us stronger to hold our faults up to the light than to sweep them under.

Why?\\". Good question: \\"Why make such a movie?\\" I can't help but recall that BOTH sides in the Indian Wars perpetrated atrocities with equal ferocity.

A single mom who agrees to marry a guy after only knowing him for 3-4 weeks is just not realistic, even in a story. Especially getting engaged to a guy who seems to be borderline stalker.

I barely make it through the whole book. There was absolutely no plot, unless you count the little girl wanting a dad and not having one a plot. Or maybe the plot was that her mother didn't trust people to not leave her. Either way, they were both able to overcome these \\"problems\\" in a matter of two seconds (yes, I'm exaggerating a little bit, but it was a pretty short time). There was a lot of repeating the main character's doubts. I don't know how many times the story had to talk about her fear of people abandoning her, but I just started skimming those parts.

The story was just about alright in that a child's wish for a dad for Christmas but that's where it ends being good I'm afraid. Unbelievable plot and then there were the mistakes, in one scene the hero was dark haired the rest of the scenes he was blond (Yeah maybe he coloured his hair, I'll give him that) but the lack of an editor was gaping in almost every page, very unprofessional. One line toward the end of the story and I quote: 'And hoped her parents were hurt by Kristen's reaction.' OK we have major issues so we'll forgive that. Another line was again niggling. 'Kyle drew up around her resting his and on her shoulder' I thought he was from America not the East end of London!!!If you want a read for free and couldn't care less for plot, character or mistakes then you'll enjoy it but if you want a good book to get lost in and read and enjoy then this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimaginative","review":"The book is a really quick read read, but not really worth the time.

The heroine is totally dull, the hero is a nice guy but it's hard to believe that he would fall for someone so cold and again BORING. I thought ok a single mom with a semi interesting background can't be all that bad. She's bound to have something that would attract this guy. Nope she doesn't. Besides her looks I don't get what the guy likes about her. Her mood swings from nice to contrite, then from fun to frigid. I've never deleted anything from my Kindle until now.

The overall feel of it was too rushed and pat for my taste though. Also, there was too much 'cutsie wootsie' and internal dialogue. The overused device of 'anguished misunderstanding' is yet another thing I absolutely do not enjoy. I found the idea that the heroine going from total distrust of people to becoming engaged in such a short amount of time, as well as the neat little wrap up of her 7 year estrangement from her parents ridiculous.This was an okay read on a cold afternoon, but I'm not sure I'd seek out other works by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"This was an okay read.

It started out promising, but went downhill from there. In a matter of a few days, Lauren went from being wary and not trusting men to being completely in love and in bed with Kyle (with her daughter in the next room). The book dragged for me and wasn't hard to put down at all. In fact, I didn't finish it and deleted it from my Kindle.

I thought this story was pretty good. Kyle seemed almost too good to be true considering how he grew up but he had his faults, too.

Rarely have I enjoyed a Christmas romance. This one was such an enjoyable read. I will definitely read more by Lisa Mondello in the future. Although I think, she is a Christian author (she has been published by Steeple Chase which I think markets Christian books), there is no mention of God or any other Christian aspects of Christmas (not that I would have minded if it did), there are also no actual sex scenes. I find that refreshing and a rare combination. In my younger days, I loved a good bodice ripper, but it is nice to read something more low-keyed, but still quite sweet and romantic.

True, it is based on a libretto by Metastasio, but that's really not a problem. And it has the potential to drag on if in the wrong hands, although it is one of Mozart's shortest operas from his maturity. I would recommend the version with Hogwood conducting for newcomers to the work, but this one sheds new light on it. One reviewer said there was too much ornamentation for their taste, but it IS an opera seria. Perhaps the best thing, however, is the casting of Padmore in the title role. His light tenor seems to suit the demands of the composer far better than a heavier one would. Along with that, Jacobs alters the recitatives slightly, supposedly in the style of Mozart. This keeps it from feeling longer than it actually is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance, flawed mastering","review":"This is a terrific performance and a beautiful recording.

I consider myself to be an intermediate knitter who loves beautiful clothes and modern fashion but I found the fashion style in this book to be 'daggy' and most suited over 40s. However, a few accessories items are beautiful and I would consider knitting them one day.To give this book a credit, its graphic design and photography are clean and modern, shame the knitting doesn't match the cosmetic look of this book.

I was hoping that this book would inspire me to strike out on my own and try writing my own patterns, or alter published patterns without fear, but I was ultimately disappointed.The knitting \\"exercises\\" were silly and the patterns included in the book are for the most part things that I wouldn't spend my limited knitting-time on--a knitted screen door being the best example of such.

If you don't need a fan, Microcenter has a house brand \\"PowerSpec\\" that seems solid - though the drive is not completely \\"snug\\" in the unit.

For a theory to stand the test of time and be proven, it must be attacked from every angle. These people did basic experiments giving one simple answer; plants respond to a stimuli. They just throw out a solution as to what must have caused that stimuli and never found the real reason. Futher experimentation must be conducted from all angles if these ideas are to be accepted as fact. Please further your reading into chemistry/biology and physics to understand why or why not these theories are correct/incorrect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Trash","review":"Perhaps the worst book about plants I have ever run across, this ridiculous piece of pseudo-science spouts half-truths, speculation, and 60's phony-spiritual mysticism and calls it \\"science.\\" It has led to some of the worst science-fair projects I have ever seen, and it has no doubt helped confuse thousands of middle- and high-school children. Spend your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Pseudoscience at its Worst","review":"A breathless, credulous, vast and poorly informed excitement fills this book. Its approach to fantastic claims of vegetable sympathy is non-critical in the extreme. I would recommend this book to people who wish to enjoy fantasies and dreams, because the authors share a certain sympathy with their subjects. The actually verified secret life of plants, however, is interesting beyond description, and deserves a more truthful and honest exploration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny","review":"This books supports the theory that plants have can mentally receive human thoughts and understand them, and it also claims there is scientific evidence for this. However, one scientist they cited, Bakster, later admitted to *never haved repeated his experiments*, thus only doing one test. That's hardly scientific. One researched cited in this book claimed that plants sulked when he insulted them. To understand this, the plant must understand English. I think people are willing to believe anything. However, of the \\"successful\\" experiments listed here, other scientists haven't been able to replicate these findings (which some blame on \\"hostile scientists and plants who don't want to cooperate\\", which is just ad hoc logic)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Secert Life of Plants","review":"I acquired this book in the early seventies, when I was a young man. Mr. Tompkins and Mr. Bird did an excellent job with a difficult subject of plant life and the science of Botany by making it romantic and interesting. Over the years, I have added thousands of books to my library, moving numerous times and even married a librarian. But I have always known which shelve in my library this volume could be found. My copy is like an old friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me feel very small minded","review":"This is a rare and spiritual book that connects the lover of nature to its more esoteric aspects that many scientists completely ignore. It reaches and describes the material that only a few know about or are sensitive to and shows one that there is so much that we do not know or understand.We need this sort of knowledge to connect us to the unknowable and the special in nature including its rich, peaceful, lifegiving, sensitive and benevolent aspects.A gem of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative outranks technical","review":"This book succeeded in shocking me into an awareness of our abuse of plant and soil resources, albeit in a tedious, statis-tical manner. The research presented is incredibly interesting.But the presentation itself is unwieldy, with seemingly endless lists of names and specialized scientific data. The greater message it carries outweighs it's cumbersome nature. Whether you have a doctorate in mechanical engineering or not, read it - you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surely you are joking, Mr Tompkins and Mr Bird!","review":"Okay, okay, I will admit reading this book, but only because I foolishly thought this book was about plant biology and scientific progress into plant habitat and their reaction to their environment and to other plant species. But what I got instead was a book that talks about ESP, mind-over-matter, Yoga, hynopsis, extra-terrestial plant seeds, and some very questionable scientific methodology of experiments. There is even a section of how to become \\"one with your houseplant\\"! Consequently, I felt as if the book's two authors are still stuck in the hippie, drug-culture of the 60s when they wrote this book. If you even believe an iota of this book, I recommend Carl Sagan's book The Demon-Haunted World. For your sanity, people, avoid this book like the bubonic plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filled with thought provoking information","review":"The Secret Life of Plants is a great read for anyone seeking higher understanding the consciousness of plants.

Ms. Beckerman is about my mom's age,also from New York and so it brought back a lot of pleasant memories for her. I also enjoyed the simple charming illustrations of styles from the 40's to the 90's and her memoirs about each item. Best of all,it does make you realize how important a part clothes play in our lives,especially for women.

I read the book on the way back to Dallas, (I was at a convention in Chicago). I thought it was a wonderful, tender book, perfect for any age. So, I gave the book to my mother (a woman exactly twice my age [I'm 33 - she's 66 yrs old]) and she thought it was very sweet. Books that make you feel good or make you reflect on the times in your life (good and bad) have been on my gift giving list.

It just took \\"that look\\" to begin the spice tray search. This insert was the exact type she enjoyed for years in our old home. It was straight forward how to trim the insert for a custom fit, but with patience and some sharp tools (I used a coping saw and a sharp knife to trim) it was done in a half hour.

Even with a small size spice jar (even the smaller size in which they are typically sold at the grocery store), the edge of its lid would not clear the drawer opening due to the steepness of the \\"ramp angle\\" of the trays.

The middle two will only hold the rectangular tin/plastic spice containers, and only lying flat so this takes up a lot of space but you can clearly see the name of the spice. I purchased this insert for another house; it fit perfectly and held all containers so that I could arrange them alphabetically. Probably my fault for not measuring, but I was disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trim to fit Vance Spice Drawer Insert","review":"I did not realize that you need a saw to trim the insert.

Maybe it's because I'm playing on a PS2, but this game felt somehow un-finished. My biggest gripe is the squad AI: it's a bit on the weak side. When you highlight an area where you wish them to go, they only move somewhat near to it. If it happens to be nowhere near cover, too bad, they end up dying. It's pretty frustrating because you need your team mates to make it through this game.It seems as though the makers have ignored what other squad based FPS's have already accomplished, which is strange considering it's Ubi soft.

Plus the book is full of humor and wit, he is a great writer. I would love to see an updated version come out! I rented many movies based on his recommendations and was thrilled with the results. A book like this helps the horror fan to sort through junk like \\"The House where evil dwells\\" to find a great flick like \\"Black christmas\\" (honestly, the cover of that vid is cool but it looks like it would be super gross instead of the intelligent chiller it is! ) I can't say enough good things about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have book for horror fans","review":"I would highly recommend this book to any horror movie fan.

You won't have to worry about that with this book. In it you will find an extensive list of movies and reviews to help in your movie hunting. It contains all of the well known horror movies as well as the hard to find or lesser known movies. My only complaint (if any) was the fact that the movie Meet The Feebles by Peter Jackson was nowhere to be found in this book.

Kronk can get no one to help him so he goes to Cuzco to give him land, pose as his wife, etc. While Cuzco's gone, Izma takes over. Or something like that. The funny moments were random.

The late Eartha Kitt also returns as Yzma as she tries to spoil Kronk's happiness. This DVD is perfect for fans of The Emperor's New Groove.

Anticipation for obvious reasons, but dread due to Disney's love for half-baked straight to video sequels that aren't worthy of being in the same area code as the original.Kronk's New Groove is a great movie, holding to the same light-hearted fun as the first, if not being quite at the same budget, which shows a little. But Kronk's Groove holds some of the same great characters while introducing a few more. I must admit, I was fearful of what politically correct love-interest they would bring out for Kronk, but Miss Birdwell was refreshingly not any expected stereotype.

Rolling film stock, interruptions in the story by characters who make comments to the audience, even the \\"pull the lever\\" joke is repeated, and it was it was used twice in the original film!That said, young kids will probably be taken in by the vivid colors and frenetic action.

I recommend it to anyone who loves films from the 1930s.The angelic conversion plot is trivial; what makes this movie fascinating and horrifying are its simplistic, bare-knuckle, constitution-be-damned solutions to the country's problems. I truly believe the image of a crusading President curing the nation's ills through overwhelming force and iron will was inspired by Hitler's recent elevation to the leadership of Germany. The movie plays like a totalitarian dream before the nation awoke to the dangers of fascism and national socialism.The only similar movie I can think of is THINGS TO COME (1936), with its idealistic image of benevolent scientists bring world peace through world domination.Besides, any movie that includes the Mob executing a drive-by tommy gun attack on the White House is a must-see!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Conservative/Religious Right/Fascist Wet Dream","review":"This movie, despite its often hilarious moments (that are usually unintentional), serves well as a serious fantasy about what the consequences would be of having a President who was fundamentalist, born-again, and power hungry, and who would not stop at his attempts to seize total authority until he was running the country the way he wanted to. Wait, no, sorry, this isn't about the current president, this movie is from 1933.But, how prophetic! One of the many ironies in the film is that the horn motif that shows up during the moments of \\"divine intervention\\" was lifted from the last movement of Johannes Brahms' Symphony No. 1 in C Minor. Brahms himself lifted it from a Swiss alphorn player. It's from a piece called \\"High on the Mountain\\" and is an alphorn melody that Brahms heard while hiking in the Rigi area of Switzerland. The irony here is that Brahms was a noted agnostic.In sum a mixed bag, fun to watch, but also a little scary.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase","review":"I will make it short - really great and high quality product.

Compared to last year, this game is almost a carbon copy in that regard, as are the graphics and sounds. There are no new features worth mentioning. Simulation is very bad (worse than last years game), as the ball seems to be coated with jelly. Teams turn over the ball ridiculous amount of times, averaging about 80 turnovers in a game between two teams! Every fast break resulted in a turnover as the computer would try to pass the ball full court which ends up being stolen and then re-stolen. Even simple short passes a few feet away ends up being fumbled and stolen. So if you are mainly buying this game for the legacy mode and prefer to simulate your games, then you should stick with last years edition and save $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst b-ball game ever... seriously.","review":"i didnt purchase 2k6 last year, but this year i decided to pick up 2k7, having seen a duke player on the cover and thinking that the rosters contained actual college players. well, i was wrong. the players are all computer generated, which i dont mind as much as the gameplay. almost EVERY pass ends up being stolen, i mean, there are like 50 turnovers every game, all because of the steal. A long pass cant be thrown without being stolen. and then the legacy mode is something that confused me.

Then, for Cinco de Mayo, instead of holding regular class, my Spanish professor took us down to a guest speaker room where Correo Aereo happened to be playing. After an hour I was hooked and purchased this CD. That afternoon and evening I listened to it over and over again and I am listening to it right now.

I was blown away by it and it is still my favorite album. This is the Tribe's 1st album and their best album. Since this album, the band has become more musically refined and the production has become more technically refined but at the cost of emotion, feeling, soul, and creativity. Their has been a lot of turnover with this band over the years and today's TOG are missing 2 key members: Dean Ortega and Shay Baby.

I don't even want to think what it would be like with a vehicle powercord adapter.On the plus side, you really can place the bracket anywhere on your windshield. This means you can adjust the GPS for optimum viewing and a minimum of visibility interference.As far as the GPS performance while in the bracket, I have noticed no degredation of reception, in fact placing it so close to the windshield probably helps it receive satellites.I would say that if you use your SportTrak while in the car, this is a definate good buy.

It also would not keep the GPS stationary unless it touched the dashboard. It would vibrate.If you use it you better get the lighter power cord because changing batteries is a nightmare.All in all, a big mistake buying this bracket.You would think that Magellan would have done a better job since they designed the GPS unit in the first place and should know what the design problems would be for a bracket to hold the unit.This is a real monstrosity and ugly as can be hanging off of your windshield."},{"rating":"1","title":"just a person","review":"mounting will not work with the Magellan sportrak 800 which I purchased.

You have to very carefully jiggle the ends out of your stereo inputs by grabbing the tips or the wires will literally RIP out of the cables and you will eventually have a dangling wire or two sticking out of the side and now you have horrible sound.

It became obvious that these sheets were coated with some agent to make them feel very soft and smooth. However once this was rinsed off they lost any quality they had. Don't buy.... and if you do, reserve judgement untill have a washing."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"I bought these sheets because of the thread count (410) and because they were cotton sateen. I had previously purchased another brand at a 400 thread count made of cotton sateen and love them. You cannot even compare the two. For them to say these sheets are \\"soft\\" is totally untrue. I even used fabric softener and they are totally a plain pair of cotton sheets which are the farthest thing from being soft. I am not even sure they sent me the item they advertised. Big disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy camper","review":"This set of sheets is the worst I have ever purchased. I would say they are \\"industrial strength\\" but outside of a prison, I don't know what \\"industry\\" would accept them. Certainly no one in health care or a knowledge of fabrics. They are not like any 400 count or sateen sheet I have ever seen; they are rougher than 200 count, they do not feel like sateen. I washed and used \\"ultra soft\\" fabric softener, to no avail. I attempted to put them on a bed and the corner seam of the fitted corner split open.I am even hesitant to give them to Goodwill. I would not recommend these to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"not sateen","review":"the sheets say they are sateen, but feel more like basic cotton or flannel.

They also don't fit my matress quite right. However, they do feel like they are of a good quality and would last a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Egyptian Cotton Queen Sheet Set","review":"The fabric is soft, with a close weave and smooth feel. The bottom sheet fits snugly with minimal wrinkles, and the top sheet is of adequate size to tuck in. I rated it four stars because the packaging had a small tear and in 12 places along the top sheet there was some color fading, as if the package had been exposed to intense light for a period of time. The pillow cases could be a tad wider to fit high loft pillows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Sheets","review":"Thread count wise this was the nicest set of sheets I ever bought. However, when I unfolded them I noticed there was a discolored line across them, possibly from where the cardboard was, and it was faded. Otherwise they are nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like sleeping on Sandpaper","review":"I ordered these sheets because of the higher thread count. My experience with sheets of thread count over 400 has always been great! These are garbage! When I opened the package, they felt smooth and nice. I immediately washed them and put them on my bed. They felt like sandpaper! I had to get up and remake my bed with other sheets! These sheets are rougher than any I have ever seen. What do I do with them now? Money wasted - don't order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pike Street 410-Thread-Count Egyptian Cotton Sateen King Sheet Set, Taupe","review":"I love thse sheets. They are very soft.

I am sorry that I bought them. My queen mattress has a pillow-top (like many new mattresses). These sheets were very difficult to keep on my mattress. More annoying, the pillow cases were too small for my new pillows. I don't know what size pillows I bought. But I thought I was going to have to return them until I put them in other cases that I own. All of a sudden, the pillows flattened out and felt as perfect as they had in the store. They were just too squished in these small cases! Don't bother with these sheets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleached out color","review":"Received this item new and it had bleached out color.

The label says: 100% Egyptian cotton made in Spain ... But you can find better quality in any store as Marshall s or TJ Maxx for the same price.

I always wash my sheets before using them and I always use a premium softener. After the second use I started noticing the fabric was pilling. Then after 3 uses they were looking very thin and worn. After one year (I have 5+ sets of sheets so they only get used 10 weeks out of the year total) they were bordering on uncomfortable. So, if you use these as backup sheets or only plan on someone actually sleeping on them once a year (for a week or two total) you should get MANY years of use out of them!After reading other Pike Street reviews I will never buy their brand again or recommend them.The bottom line: you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally uninteresting","review":"The characters of this book are astonishingly flat.

Needless to say when I purchased it I was a little disappointed. It was very cool to have in my hand a tribute to my favorite band but when I spun it I found that most of the songs were bare discernable as the W.A.S.P. tunes I knew and loved. There were a couple of descent track that I thought made it worth owning the disc. Black Earths rendition of \\"Wild Child\\" is a very good cover, along with Mystifier's version of \\"The Torture Never Stops\\". But as far as the rest of the disc goes, if you are a W.A.S.P. fan and you like the \\"Death Metal\\", \\"Cookie Monster\\" type vocals, you will love this album.

Either way it is a CD worth having a place in you W.A.S.P. collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Show no mercy","review":"This cd is bad ... The best covers in my opinion would have to be \\"the torture never stops\\" and \\"tormentor\\". great cd. awesome bands. bad... covers.

I tried repairing and reinforcing it, but the piece is so unbelievably weak that no amount of work could get it to function as it should.I put a lot of furniture together, and everything I have bought in the last year that I have built works like a charm, in some cases better than expected, with the exception of this.

Well okay, you could consider me a fan.This DVD isn't endorsed by Kate and does not live up to her high recording standards. It's mostly made up of interviews with four fairly knowledgeable people about Kate's life and their take on her music, some very short (old) interview clips with Kate and a few poor quality snippets of her videos. The entire DVD is of VHS quality IMHO and doesn't really offer anything new.For a newbie it might be a good starting point, but for anyone looking for quality Kate Bush material it will be a disappointment.

Zach was the standout element in this summer's The Hangover (a film which on the whole I wasn't too impressed by). In Visioneers, though, Zach is the leading man and proves he can carry a subtle, darkly comic role as George Washington Winsterhammerman, a corporate drone working for the Jeffers Corporation, the largest and friendliest and most profitable corporation in the history of all mankind.This film is fresh, unexpected and sincere. With throwbacks to Brazil, Schizopolis and (underrated) Idiocracy, Visioneers builds a universe that has just enough similarity to our own to feel genuine, but is far enough out there to descend into total chaos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice re-imagining of Fahrenheit 451 - until the 2nd half","review":"This starts out as a quirky, interesting, slow attack on corporate and suburban life, which is ruined by the 2nd half.

Optically, it's amazing. And the ability to focus so close at 180mm allows you to capture some amazing macros. Or, if you prefer, you can use the focal length to shoot from a little further away and still get pretty good close ups.I haven't had the problem that a few other reviewers have had with focusing. It doesn't have its own autofocus motor, so it depends entirely on your camera's screw drive. I've used this lens on three different Sony alpha cameras (A550, A77, and A850), and have had no problems. (Perhaps the other reviewers were using very old cameras?

Whereas Don De Grazia's \\"American Skin\\" was a cohesive, inventive narrative revolving around finely developed and believable characters within an admittably \\"fringe\\" subculture, \\"Ratz Are Nice\\" immediately climbs uphill with a narrative style that is incomprehensible, gimmicky and just plain boring. Quite frankly, Braithwaite's writing here is pure gibberish. Often it wasn't even clear to me who was who or why certain \\"characters\\" (for lack of a better word) were included in his story at all. The best three things about \\"Ratz Are Nice (PCP)\\" are (i) the front cover photo of a group of interacial skins and streetpunks, (ii) the entertaining (although sometimes inaccurate) \\"Author Notes\\" and (iii) the fact that the thing is short. Avoid at ALL costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another voice searching for tongue space","review":"Short and sour. \\"Ratz Are Nice: (Psp)\\" is a small book that pushes big buttons. Author Braithwaite obviously knows what he is about and tells a story from the intra-abdominal site. Characters are believeable and he makes us care about them. But the problem with wading through the hieroglyphics and lingo, page layout and punctuation oddities in the end detracts from the idea of the novel. It just becomes kitsch. If you feel you must read this book, I suggest you start with the Author's Notes: this reads with great ease and wit and venom. For the rest, the work involved in getting there doesn't seem to justify the payoff.....at least to this reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I fell in love in Tolkien during high school. After reading The Hobbit, I flew through The Lord of the Rings, and made myself read The Silmarillion. I've been reading all 3 every year since. I'm guessing most readers who look up the Folio Edition of The Silmarillion have already read the book; so I just have a few notes about this Edition.Last year I decided to stop using the library. I picked up the 50th Anniversary Edition of The Lord of the Rings (Houghton Mifflin) and Collector's Edition of The Hobbit (Houghton Mifflin). Since The Silmarillion has a sort of spiritual essence, I didn't want a popular Barns and Noble copy. I chose the Folio Edition because it's got that wonderful old school design. It's also wonderfully done inside too. I finished reading through it a few weeks ago, totally content with my choice.I think this is a great choice for any Tolkien shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"My dear lord!!!!!!!","review":"What the hell happened here? did midway accidentally release an unfinished game?

Jean Rhys grew up as a white woman in the Caribbean and went to study in England when she was 17.

She read Jane Eyre and felt that she related less to Jane and more to the minor character of Bertha. (I won't ruin it for anyone who hasn't read Jane Eyre.) So she wrote a beautiful story with Bertha as the main character. It's meaningful and interesting, and talks about zombies!

Antoinetta needs major therapy from page one, and Rochester is the proper English gentleman who is corrupted and broken in a thousand ways, for he has no idea of the disaster he has been lured into.We already know Anakin is going to be Vader, and now we know how Rochester and Bertha turn to the Dark Side.

Containing 8 out of 10 tracks from her 1983 release Catch As Catch Can, plus a few non-album singles and B-sides from the same era, this CD finds Wilde hovering somewhere between the energetic new wave sound that she initially was known for and the more commercial dance-oriented pop she would explore for the rest of her career. The brash \\"House of Salome\\" stands alongside \\"Kids in America\\" as a post-punk masterpiece, while the lyrics of \\"Child Come Away\\" continue the story-song approach cowriters Ricky Wilde and Marty Wilde frequently mined. The ballads \\"Can You Hear It\\" and \\"Stay Awhile\\" rank as some of the Wilde's best recordings.

He gets a bit too cute in a few poems, but for a young poet this a remarkably strong collection, certainly far superior to anything Rita Dove had done in the last ten years, and she got to be Laureate. Robert Pinsky would probably sneer at titles like \\"Ava Gardner, Queen of Earthquakes,\\" and that alone is reason to buy the book. \\"Monster Fashion\\" is well worth the price, and Keene a poet to keep an eye on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stunning Variety of Verse","review":"This book is utterly amazing. Keene somehow manages to synthesize completely autonomous universes through which the reader is invited to wander; the end result is a vast array of experiences that get better with each visit. The sheer versatility of Keene's talent is delightful to behold. He is one of those truly gifted writers who can write psuedo-acid trip free verse couplets (\\"RPM\\") one minute, gritty, reality-oriented recountings of proctological probing (\\"Scoped\\") the next, and still come back with darkly irreverent analyses of Wile E. Coyote's misguided efforts, all without missing a beat. What you get with Keene is a voice that is free of any trace of pretension, dishonesty, or fear; he's a monster talent. Read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kicks/Rocks","review":"Keene's poetry is the transfusion contemporary American poetry needed. He joins the ranks of the great ones like Jim Daniels, Charles H. Webb, Denise Duhamel, Ron Koertge, and yes, even Charles \\"The Buk\\" Bukowski.

But as I got farther into the game, the missions became so repetitive that it became extremely boring. Every mission has about 5 other missions in the game that are nearly identical. And if you are expecting it to be a Simpson's version Grand Theft Auto, you are going to be disappointed. I would recommend this game to rent, but not to buy, just for the experience of walking and driving around Springfield."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grand Theft Auto. Meet the Simpson Family.","review":"Overall, this game is actually pretty good. Aside from the few gameplay issues and graphical glitches here and there, the game is great. The controls are responsive (although sometimes a bit too touchy) and the loading screen is good. You get to collect coins and cards along the way to obtain new gear for your character. I love the ninja costume for Bart! Typical Simpsons humor is laden throughout the interactive city. Before I forget, there are even \\"unique\\" jumps that is prominent in Grand Theft Auto. The only major con that I have noticed is that the storyline is weak, and I wish Vivendi would develop it more. Overall, this may be the beginning of a good franchise for Vivendi in the future.

The second installment in the series is a major dissapointment, which I hope the developer will view as a mistake. The camera is the worse I have ever seen and you'll want to kill your x-box, especially during jumping sequences. They changed a lot of things I liked about the first game, such as the wider camera view and the exciting fighting sequences. Combat in Chaos bleeds is boring in comparison and is apparently made for a younger gamer with its oversized characters and easier fighting. I wanted to like this game because I'm a fan of the show, but, unfortunately, its not very good. I find myself constantly trying to adjust the camera when fighting or exploring new locations.

They did 60s rock covers (Stooges, Velvets, Kinks, Troggs) with completely fuzzed out guitars, accompanied by a drum machine. Doctor Mix's entire output was a few 12\\" EPs and an LP, but the great Acute label put them all together, with bonus tracks (like \\"Brand New Cadillac\\") on Wall of Noise. This is the stuff that Jesus and Mary Chain went after on Psychocandy. Si bon!

I find it virtually useless, it puts out so little light.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Soundtrack","review":"This soundtrack is great. With the weather getting warmer it is the perfect cd to accompany long drives with the window down. A great mix of music feature classics like Tina Turner, and Barry White!! Robert Downey Jr's addition's are definatly worth the money for this cd!-Now if only he could get his life straightened out. As Always, Vonda Shephard is a treat. All in All, I would definatly recommend buying this cd-I am sure glad that I did!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be disappointed . . .","review":"I have always enjoyed the beautiful voice of Vonda Shepard on the Ally McBeal show.

To add extra pleasue, the CD also includes beautiful songs performed by Barry White, Sting, Tina Turner, and others. You won't be disappointed by this one . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Album for Fans of Ally McBeal or Anybody!","review":"Another great album of the Ally McBeal collection. The 1st album reflected the innocence and beginning of Ally's character. The 2nd album had more of a sad self-reflection side (but still comforting and optimistic) of Ally during the 2nd season. This 3rd album brings the new, rejuvenated side of Ally in the 3rd and 4th seasons. The collaboration with other artists and Robert Downey, Jr. make this a great album because it gives a new \\"flavor\\" compared to the previous 2 albums. Sadly, this is the last CD of the Ally McBeal collection (cancelled the show after the 5th season) but this CD will bring the great memories back of the show or for those who didn't see the show a great collection of remakes (some better than the original) about love.(Being an Ally McBeal fan...let's hope somehow Ally can come back, not only the TV series but it's great music!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Marketing Masterminds Messed Up","review":"Anticipation turned to disappointment when I found Vonda's lastest chapter has been sadly diluted by Sony Marketing. Robert Downey Jr.'s efforts are simply not up to standard. Al Green's \\"How Do You Mend a Broken Heart\\" is unlistenable. But Vonda's versions of \\"Reason to Believe\\" and \\"Alone Again (Naturally)\\" are peerless. It's too bad that her version of \\"Young Love\\", featured in a recent 'Ally' episode did not make the cut. Next time - more Vonda."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vonda Does It Again!","review":"Having become a Vonda Shepard fan through Ally McBeal, I waited for this new album patiently. I was so excited to go out and purchase it today. I must say I was pretty surprised. The reason why is that I do not watch Ally because it is on against another show I like better which will go unnamed=). This cd has a simpler production sound than the previous 2 soundtracks. I like it but it will just take some time to get used to. Vonda has her trademark torch sound and Robert Downey Jr. does a good job on his 3 tracks! The duet with Anastacia is the highlight of the cd!!! I am happy I bought it! Enjoy fellow Vonda fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vonda Shepard is the problem","review":"Stand along songs by Ms. Shepard fall short.

For Once In My Life is a pretty mixed bag really, the core of it is based around Vonda Shepard, but there are other artists like Tina Turner (When The Heartache Is Over), Love Is Alive (vonda and Anastacia) and Chances Are (Vonda and Robert Downey Jr). This cd is the one out the series that is the best to have as its the most complete to date and the standard of songs is so high"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, especially for Ally McBeal fans!!","review":"I really liked the songs on this CD as they relate to the show Ally McBeal of which I was a big fan.I think Robert Downey Jr. is extremely talented musically and wish he would make his own CD. He has showcased his talent in many of his films and plays musical instruments and writes music as well. He has joined Elton John in concert recently. I think he doesn't get enough credit for his abilities both as an actor and a singer.This CD is great, especially to Ally McBeal fans as I can picture scenes from the show when I hear the songs and it is like reliving some of the great episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Songs","review":"Was re-watching some of the old Ally McBeal shows in re-runs and liked the music.

It is a subjective thing of course, but Vonda in my opinion has the sort of voice that is so distinctive, so soothing, that she can get away with rehashing *really* old tunes and making them just seem very, well, very *Vonda* rather than the saggy old covers which they should appear to be.It loses one star for the blatant marketing pitch of slotting in those famous stars who merely wanted the exposure of being on Ally and so went on and sung one of their big ol' favourite numbers. The appearances of Tom Jones with It's Not Unusual, Tina Turner, or Sting with Every Breath You Take are obviously not unpleasant - those artists are very very good by themselves -but they take something away from the feeling of hopeful loneliness that permeates the series and the rest of this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A picture book","review":"Somebody said that wars are too important a thing to leave them to military men. I would say that the history of the jesuit missions is too important a thing to leave it to jesuits. The book is a collection of bromides and uncritical descriptions of the mission's history.

I encourage reading biographies that are written for the appropriate age level of the child. Children are inquisitive and soak up information like sponges.

I can't wait for the new series Campbell is writing to come out.

I do huter/jumper, so I love jumping and I think eventing is great, but I'm reading the series for my other love, racing, and I'm not interested in hearing Christina whine because although she had one of the best racehorses in the world, she can't jump it so she'll trade it for some claimer that may not even be interested in eventing. This is just a crazy book, and the series doesn't really pick up, but I'm told Joanna C. has returned so I'm happy and I have faith that she will turn this back around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get your hopes up too high","review":"Hey all you eventing people out there!

After all, you probebely wouldn't guess that in book #38 Christina sells her BELOVED Sterling so she can fo off and ride race horses (not that that's a bad thing.)

I kind of liked Cindy but you got rid of her, and I just loved reading about Samantha and she's \\"gone to Ireland\\". And Christina is SUCH a brat. And where's Sierra? And Tor, and Mandy, and Max? You guys really screwed up. Now I'm only reading the books because they're supposed to be about horses, but even that seems to be gone. The books seem to be more about Christina, Melanie, or Cassidy's personal life, instead of what they should be about. I'm extremely disappointed, and about ready to stop reading Thoroughbred books.

These books are way too expensive for crappy storylines that I could write better. I started to get irritated when they switched authors that got horse's names wrong but this is ridiculous!!!

What happened to the series? I know they fixed it and turned it back to racing,but still,it leaves the whole eventing epidemic just it's own story!

They have a half interest in this horse so how can they just give him away. Samantha took off to Ireland?!?!!? what? how? when? is she still with Tor?? what happened.

I'm nineteen now, by the way. Anyway, as the series progressed I kept noticing continuity errors. But this book takes the freaking cake. Seriously. Where the HECK does Melanie fit in? Look, I like the girl. Really, I do. But no matter how I wrack my brains I cannot imagine any chance for her to exist. If Mike had a sister, why wasn't she at his and Ashleigh's wedding? Heck, most future sister-in-laws are made bridesmaids. The series NEVER mentioned Mike having a sister. EVER.Oh, and I hate Christina. And Dylan. Just saying. What's up with Mona, too? AFAIK she and Ashleigh never saw each other again after she moved, and how they're best friends? Does every adult in this darn series have to be connected?Sadly, guys, it just gets worse from here. I eventually gave up on the series because of the continuity errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok...maybe...","review":"i had a real problem with this book. First I hate Chistina so that might be part of it. But in the book she trades a stallion that's worth in the millions $$$$ and get sterling a broken down nag that can jump. She did't trade and million $$ colt either. it was her mom's mare wonder who christina saved from a foal.and it was going to be her last foal, but after she traded legacy she bred wonder again she had a colt and wonder died. star was sent to townsend acers and he was being mistreated.and all because of christina's supid behavior.

I have a few questions. 1) Where is everyone, and why are they there? 2) When did everyone get a personality transplant? 3)Why didn't Ashleigh have to consult the Townsends before letting Christina trade Legacy for the psycho horse? they own half of him. I, unlike Christina, only want one thing, and that's to end this tyranny. So, Ms. Campbell, what do you say? Can you grant me my wish? Oh, and Estes needs to stick to her series.

And who in their right mind would give up the son of a famous racehorse? I mean, Ashleigh had to fight just too keep Wonder's foals at Whitebrook and she just lets her daughter give Legacy up (the word stupid comes to mind.)

In Cindy's Honor, Christina was still a toddler, not a 12 year old. Why did Samantha move to Ireland, and what happened to Tor. In Samantha's Journey, Tor had proposed to Samantha, and she was also a new trainer at Whitebrook. Why would people want to read about Melanie. And what happened to the Townsends. They would never let Christina sell Legacy, much less let Ashleigh him to her. Why is Wonder so old, and what happened to her foals Pride, Princess, Mr. Wonderful, and Champion.

She knew Wonder's Legacy was really important to Ashleigh, since she was Wonder's last foal, but she still wanted Sterling even more. Cindy doesn't seem to be mentioned in this book, either.

I would go as far to say that they should be prosecuted for literary fraud and highway robbery. I can forego the money that I spent on this book. But the hours that I pined away at trying to figure out the crap contained in the book is something that I'll never get back. I will never in my life buy another book from Astle, et al. This is the kind of writing that smells of wannabes. Please do not be taken in by these snake oil sellers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book!","review":"When I bought this book I knew C++ pretty well. I new non OpenGL at all. When I was finished I was able to create small games. I was able to create good first person shooters also. This book goes over the math ( real helpfull ), and explains almost everything in detail. I got some signs of the author getting bored at some parts. This is an excellent book if you are good with C++ and want to start programming games. This book gets you started with game programming. You can go out and program a huge excellent game making tons of money after you read this book. But this book is an excellent start... With the addition of a few more advanced books after this I was able to program games at a professional level. This book also shows tips on keeping your games with low frame rates!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Costs way too much for the content","review":"I am just starting to develop games. While I have learned about game programming through this book, it never gave me any solid info to wrap my brain around. The book writting does not flow. The prose is way too \\"touchy-feely.\\" If you are looking for a book that gives a direct treatment of the material, do not buy this book. It tries to cover too much material with too little space. And it does so at the expense of content. The section on math should be removed as should the section on windows programming. Neither is written very well and that content can be found in abundance from other sources. Plus some the code does not work correctly (this in my opinion is a very poor reflection on the author/publisher.) On top of it all the book is fairly pricy. Overall this book has been a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy book","review":"The book is crap. Many of their examples wont even compile (because the code has errors) but somehow they managed to give you .exe files but those just crash because the code is wrong (I have no idea how they managed to compile this crap). Their coding style sucks especially when they try and give you OO (object oriented) examples. If you want to learn OpenGL I would recommend \\"OpenGL Programming Guide\\".I found absolutely nothing usefull in this book.It's hard to explain how bad this book sucks so I'll put it this way: I have purchase 40+ programming type books from amazon.com (and read them) and this is the only book I've reviwed because I thought it needed to be known how crappy this book is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I thought this book was going to be a useful reference about OpenGL programming because it was nice and thick and contained lots of examples. But Most of the book is just filled with sloppily-written code, a lot of it Windows-centric. Topics are poorly explained, the code doesn't even work half the time, and a lot is left out. The authors are obviously not qualified to teach this topic well, and the book has an amateur-ish feeling to it.

I expected better, given the cast. The so-called shocking twist at the end of the movie is something I fully expected to happen--it was pretty obvious to anyone with any imagination.

So... the movie's point is what? There really are no \\"good guys\\" in this--I didn't feel like there was anyone to root for. Just a bunch of people caught up in unsavory situations.

As for the story, it's truly a gem -- a finely spun tale of fantasy, with a satisfying lesson for young readers. The heir to throne in a mystical land of elves, unicorns, and wise owls must confront the fierce, flying, fire-breathing dragon, with ramifications of significance to the young prince, the angry dragon, and the kingdom between the worlds. It's a fable filled with mystery, adventure, fantasy, and intrigue artfully told without frightening young readers or glorifying violence.

Really different look into Japanese prison work camp for Scottish, English, American prisoners. Based on the story of Ernest Gordon. Also made into the movie Bridge Over the River Kwai.

Kiefer Sutherland plays a part in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Based on what book?!!","review":"From the rave reviews of most of the reviewers, it would seem that noone has read the book upon which this film is approximately based. The book was simply used as a point of departure for an all too predictable Hollywood rewrite. It is pathetic when real lives are reduced to plot devices, expedients and screen writing liberties. These men deserved better treatment than this. Try reading the book - skip this farce of a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good But Derivative","review":"It was a good movie but heavily based on films like the Bridge Over the River Kwai and King Rat (among others).The performances were good and the rationale behind motivations solid but this film is not as good as some reviewers are leading you to believe.A good movie, but maybe not one to add to your dvd collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb, Dumb, Dumb and Dumber","review":"The movie starts off good, ok, not bad. Starts getting a little bizarre, POW's studying - Plato? A group of POW's start a school behind their captors backs, while another group instead uses their time to find ways to escape. Here is were it gets really, really sappy. The group of prisoners who want to try and escape are portrayed as the \\"Bad Guys\\" - morons. The other group, the passive group, instead wants to read books and pretend they are going to college. They are portrayed as the \\"Smart\\" intellectuals, and attempt to use appeasement and not revolt or try to escape from the Enemy (Japanese). The end is pathetic, using visual references to Jesus on the cross and also attempt to show how by being passive appeasers it is possible to win wars.. WRONG!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sadistic, Messianic Mess","review":"In spite of a good cast and decent technical production values, \\"To End All Wars\\" seemed an endless torture fest, interlacing brutish sequences of POW camp violence with heavy-handed Christian allegory. On both scores, the film has all the nuance of a sledge hammer, and ultimately feels both over-blown and over-bearing. After viewing \\"The Passion,\\" then this, I'm prompted to wonder what is it about sadism that gets \\"Christian\\" film makers so turned on? For a real movie on the POW experience in WWII Japanese war camps, stick with \\"Bridge on the River Kwai,\\" of which \\"To End All Wars\\" is but an inferior imitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgiveness Triumphs","review":"Granted there are some flaws (like how could the prisoners get bag pipes and narration that is somewhat over done) with \\"To End All Wars\\", but considering the limited budget, the film accomplishes its major task of conveying a mesage of forgiveness that transends cultural differences.Christians who critcize the film because its not \\"Christian\\" enough to read Frankie Schaeffer's book \\"Additcted to Mediocrity\\". What does the film need, a complete reading of the New Testament to satisfy the most legalistic amoung us? There are other films that do that and quite well (The Gospel of John) I might add. (Insert Sarcasm here) For those of you not schooled in the arts , this film is an exercise in metaphor.I encourgage anyone looking for a cinematic example of \\"laying down one's life for a friend\\" then \\"To End All Wars\\" is the movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kip the Movie-Buy the Book","review":"The movie is a watered down Hollywood version of the book. The power of the story is in the sacrifice and submission to the principles of peace that change the characters lives for good, not the blood and guts that Hollywood focuses on. To really appreciate the experience portrayed in this amazing story you need to read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vengeance or Forgiveness?","review":"This movie offers a strong message of characters that choose vengeance or forgiveness. Choosing vengeance and pursuing hatred destroys by the end of the movie the men who embrace them. Choosing forgiveness and displaying mercy rewards the men who exercise them.\\"To End All Wars\\" is definitely a violent, gory, blood-and-guts war movie, but is very well done. The theme is definitely Christian in nature. It's a good film for Christian men who may be trying to understand the nature of Christ's unconditional love and substitutional death. It's definitely not a chick flick, but a great film for older male teens and men."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very pleasant surprise","review":"Presumption: a movie I had heard very little about.

The horizontal position of the iron is much more stable and safe;the wire guards around perimeter also help to prevent from such accidents.My iron goes into sleep mode, when it stays in vertical position for several minutes, which is a good safety feature - in case I forgot to turn it off and left,but inconvenient, when I have to wait for it to warm up.2) It adds more free space on the ironing board."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice item","review":"I like having the full use of my ironing board - does not work well with all irons since some do not stand up enough to stop the steaming action - small inconvenience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polder Iron Rest","review":"I was not pleased with it because I never was able to receive a complete product.

Shabanu, the narrator, is static and one-dimensional; a very boring and very annoying main character for a novel to be based upon. The novel reads very slowly, never going anywhere. I can only wonder why this novel would be given to an Sophomore Level 4 Honors English class to read. One major factor that describes how slow this novel is the fact that the professional review of this novel on amazon.com tells of a story that has yet to happen where I am in the book; that is, more than halfway through \\"Shabanu\\" and less than 100 pages to the end. I cannot wait for my future English teacher to ask us how we felt about this novel. I already have an answer prepared: \\"I learned how not to write a novel.\\" Don't waste your money, time, or exercise in reaching for \\"Shabanu\\" off the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHABANU IS WASTING MY LIFE","review":"I'd have to admit \\"Shabanu the Daughter of boredom\\" is quite tedious to read! I would recommend not to even bother to read it because it is quite horrible. The author creates a very boring, pitiful, angry, unappealing, uninteresting, suspense less, and mundane environment. It is quite monotonous, un-provoking, spiritless, and very degrading. The story is very plain though it has the main elements of a story. I can't believe those mean horrible teachers forced me to read this book for eighth grade this summer. There is no adventure and I frankly don't acknowledge or apprehend why this book received a newberry award. It should receive the boredom award. This book does have some inappropriate info about puberty. It does inform of Muslim culture but is horrible story. DO NOT WASTE YOU TIME READING 288 PAGES OF MISCELLANEOUS SHABANU!!!

Her life as been perfect since she was born, taking care of the camels, climbing thorn trees, and running free in the desert. But when an evil landowner murders the person her older sister Phulan was betrothed to. Now she must sacrifice everything she's dreamed of to save her family. Sounds like a pretty okay plot, right? WRONG! This book tries to make you hate it. It's boring, depressing (her life really sucks), and repetitive. There are some really good parts, but they are just drowned out by the badness of the book. And worst of all, it just ends. The plot actually starts getting thicker, but it just stops.

I would be scared to visit the author's house for a minute... because I would probably be bombarded with perverted posters of camels (hint) Read this book and I promise you will have frightening images of camels and weird obsessed girls planted into your brain (hint hint) But if you enjoy mating camels... go ahead and buy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Camels","review":"I'm reading this book for my English class. Shabanu is the worst book I have ever read. ONly the end redeems it. All they talk about are CAMELS! Camels this, camels that!But that is not the main reason why I don't like this book.My main reason for the dislike of Shabanu: Daughter of the Wind is that they portray many Muslim women as having no rights whatsoever. Moreover, it also offends me because not all Muslims are like SHabanu's family. Women in Islam have more rights, and earlier than many of the women in our country today. They wear CHADR only outside the house, not all the time like at home, during sleep as Shabanu's family does. ANd also, very rarely are girls married off as young as Shabanu and PHulan were.I believe this book should not be used as an example of how many Pakistanis live. Much of this information is not inaccurate (there could be some Cholistanis who live like this) but it is not a complete picture of daily Pakistani life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shabanu Got On My Nerves","review":"Okay, I had to read this book for my Freshman English class, for our unit on the Middle East.

Shabanu complains about being oppressed. Shabanu \\"rebels\\" against oppression. Shabanu is beaten. Shabanu cries.The end.I've met Pakistani girls before, and they're nothing like Shabanu. They're proud to be Muslim- they are proud to follow the rules of their faith.Shabanu, however, is not proud. She never stops whining about it.And then the ending bothered me, too. It was just such an obvious set up for a sequel, it totally disgusted me. It wasn't even much of an ending, really.

Plus; if some people consider this book action filled for adolescets; this is also not the book for you.I do agree that maybe on your own this book might be good. But I just can't bare to read it again. So teachers/ school offcials, I do not reccomend you require the book to your students. I seriosly think that would not go over so well.

It was very informative but it lacked the excitement that is appealing to young adults. It had one or two exciting chapters but they were all in seperate sections of the book.

One part, in the Sibi Fair chapter, There is a sandstorm and when you read that part, you can really picture Shabanu in a sandstorm. This book was very well written, but boring at times.

Shabanu's story is that of a typical girl in this part of the world. She must endure a very difficult life in which she and her family struggle to survive in the harsh desert and struggle to overcome the corrupt wealthy land owners who control the region. The story is compelling because Shabanu's life is so different from that of 13 year old girls in the Western world. I would recommend this book to those seeking to learn more about life in Pakistan's desert regions and about the Muslim culture. The book examines the treatment of women in this part of the world and makes a subtle comment on the injustice of their situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was great!","review":"That was a great book.

Well you shouldn't do that with the book Shabanu, Daughter of the Wind. This book isn't choppy or rugged. It's smooth and thick. It seems like you are the characters instead of just reading about them. This book also gives you a little taste of culture and reality in other countries.

Not very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay","review":"I'd say that the only problem with Shabanu is that it doesn't get really exciting until the last few chapters.

I felt a sincere longing to make the most of my life and situation, which Shabanu does even though she has no real control over her life like we Americans do, and she does so almost without remorse or longing because it is the way of her culture and people, which is amazingly mature and almost unbelievable for a character so young. Such strength and honor is seldom seen, and I feel that if taken seriously and understood, this book could be an influential teaching tool. Aside from this, Ms. Staples has done wonderfully in helping one culture relate and understand another, which is almost a miracle. She has through Shabanu, written a spell-binding adventure with a heroine so sincere and innocent that one's heart goes out to her and her culture with love and admiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutally boring novel","review":"I read this novel for school. It is perhaps the most boring novel I have read. I also felt like it insulted Islam in many ways, because it is so surface on so many things.

My friend hated the book so much, she stopped reading"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a children's book","review":"I have a feeling this is one of those books that grown-ups would like children to love, but that children themselves won't much appreciate. It's too bad, because it deals in simple language with cultural and gender issues that kids should probably hear about. Unfortunately, the pace and density of the plot are not great enough to sustain the attention of most young people.This is a decent book that has no audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was ok, but a little boring","review":"I had to read this book for my 7th grade reading book.

I was unwillingly forced to read this book by my english teacher. I hated this book so much I almost couldn't read it. This book isn't worth the lint in my pocket $5.99 what a joke. this book seems like it was written by someone that never has fun and doesnt like seeing other people having fun either. this book drives me insane. I am not usually a negative person but reading this book has made me be one on occasion. Nothing good ever happens to Shabanu. Shabanu seems like a good charecter.but they ruined her in the book.

DO NOT GET THIS BOOK IT IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Suzanne Fisher Staples can't write a decent phrase.","review":"From the start, this book was horrendously unrealistic. The author writes in the present tense, mixing Pakistani vocabulary with English, creating a confusing arrangement without tense or setting. \\"It was all the water we could get from the toba, the basin that is our main water supply.\\" The book is full of such sentences. It is completely unclear as to who the author is speaking to, and who the main character Shabanu is speaking to. Altogether very confusing.This book has literally no plot and terrible writing. The author cannot decide who her audience is. The reading level is for fourth grade girls, yet the content is for adults. I read this book to learn more about Pakistani culture. The extent to which I learned was random information about camels, about as useful as knowing that the plastic tip of a shoelace is called an aglet.Suzanne Fisher Staples needs to think before she writes."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING TO PARENTS","review":"WARNING to parents--please read this book before allowing your child to read it. If it were made into a movie, it would receive a rating of \\"R.\\" There are vivid depictions of breast development (complete with a self-touching/exploration scene), camels mating, thoughts of being with a man while self-touching, a discussion of how to please a man sexually, and a father beating his daughter until she is bloody. The plot turns on an almost- rape, also vividly described. This is being recommended by major Social Studies and Literature curriculum publishers. Fortunately, I read it before my daughter was allowed to read it in her 7th grade class and found it to be inappropriate for her. I suggest you do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mislead","review":"So I looked at the pictures and read the reviews. They seemed okay so I ordered it.

Alice White is a werewolf. She seeks out someone who can help her and ends up with shrink. Of course he believes her to be delusional but, quite fascinating. Alice tries to keep everyone at arms lenth for fear of what the truth will do to them and her. Along the way, she meets and falls for a wonderful professor, Erik Summers, and hopes that he'll be the one that accepts her for all she is....Of course that is when things get complicated. This book so honestly depicts relationships that you hardly notice that one of the factors involved is the fact that Alice is a werewolf.It's really a great book. It is the ONLY book I have read 4 times and refuse to let others borrow in fear I may never get it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm...I Don't Get why everyone likes this book.","review":"I read this book about a year ago and just stumbled across the listing for it and was amazed at seeing 4 or 5 stars for all the reviews. This book was completely misleading. If you are looking for an exciting, fast paced werewolf TAIL (I had to write it that way!) this is NOT the book for you. This book dealt more with a woman's internal conflicts as she deals with her love life and having to change under the full moon. I was bored out of my mind through the whole book. There was nothing even remotely interesting in this book! I didn't even find the romance sections interesting or sexy. If you want a good werewolf novel think twice before buying this book...Try something like Donna Boyd's THE PASSION.

Also included on this, is Dark Train, a great song to dance to if I have ever heard one. The CD ends with Burts, a superb piece of throbbing techno to give your speakers a good work out. You must buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too bad there isn't a 6th star for this one!","review":"When I first heard this cd I could kill myself for not buying this cd any earlier.

I can't believe they put such amazin tracks on such an obscure CD, at least for someone on our side of the Atlantic. Dark Train is one of the best tracks they ever made, the perfect thing for driving a fast German car, not to mention dancing. I'm going to go out on a limb and call Thing In A Book one of the best electronic songs ever made, just do whatever you gotta do and go on the journey....Tip - I found it on Germany's Amazon site for only 30 euros (including shipping), or about $38.

It contains works of art that either picture a representation of Christ or allude to Him. I found my reading to be a delightful and awe-inspiring theological journey. Each chapter deals with a different aspect of how Christ is perceived. Several authors have compiled brief descriptions of the works that explain their significance and meaning. The book traces it course through predominately Catholic art. This may have been done mostly out of necesity because the plethera of art from the 13th to 20th centuries is largely by Catholics. However, it would have been nice to see some more Protestant imagery to complete the respesentation of Christ in art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under 33 hours anyone?","review":"OK, so I'm a Zanzarah junkie.

The style of writing is very appropriate and doesn't get in the way of the story. Some of the characters have distinctive yet believable personalities, although curiously the main character is somewhat bland. But the story moves along at a good pace, with just enouigh description to paint the scene, without feeling like it is causing the action to become bogged down.

You think, what is the style of this man? About what does he write? And why are the chapters so short? And could he not choose more hideous type in which to set the names of those chapters?Ah, now you are beginning to truly love Calvino. For it is only when you recognize that the man maddens you no end, that his \\"style which is no style\\" (as he says of himself in IOAWNAT) is gentle and beautiful and feels like an old friend-but an old friend that you never met-that you can truly begin to live inside one of his novels. And you will never want to leave. Savor this book. Read it slowly, one magic city at a time.

I read this book in university and admired the richness of detail, the broad sweep of the panoramas explored, the simple beauty of Polo's \\"racontage\\" to the great Kubla Kahn. Reading this book envelopes you in other worlds effortlessly, beautifully, majestically. So much so, your immediate surroundings melt into anonimity. Passionate writing, exquisite imagery. Weaver's translation is sumptuous! 'Nuff said!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous prose","review":"Generally I like my books fast and plot-driven, with minimal description and at least quasi-linear plots lines. While Invisible Cities is none of those things, I would rate it among my favorite books. The prose is incredible, rich, almost erotic. At times I felt my heart beating faster as I read it.

This software is the only means to put MP3s on your MD player and it has a check in/check out feature that limits the number of times you are able to transfer one song (in MP3) to your MD player.

This time around, the story centers on a young Danish student's efforts to help England discover how the Germans are able to shoot down so many British bombers.Thematically, Follett explores the difference between a life (and a society) run according to duty, rules, and order---whether it's a Danish police detective cooperating with the occupying Nazis, or an evangelical minister destroying his son's dreams for one youthful \\"sin\\"---and one of principle, liberty, and the individual pursuit of happiness---from listening to jazz music and riding a converted steam-powered motorcycle to get around wartime petrol rationing, to pursuing the deeper values of career, politics, and romance. Interesting and inspiring.And as usual, John Lee's narration of this audio edition is highly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good story if a little predictable","review":"I listened to the Audible version of this, the reader did a much better job than many I have heard, though I can't speak for Danes about whether he sounded like an authentic Dane speaking English. The language choice is interesting, do you have an accent when you are speaking your own foreign language in a book.The good guys aren't perfect and the bad guys aren't stupid. The characters are real, imperfect but not unrealistically foolish, they make some mistakes but overall they do well.The technicalities don't all really work out 100% in the real world, but they don't really interfere with the story for any but the occasional person who really knows the details of the technology. Even then some are arguable.Well worth a read or a listen, but not in the top class of stories I couldn't put down, so just the four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic -- decent writing style but that is about it","review":"This is not a bad book -- it just seems pretty formulaic and uninspired to me. I saw the romance angle coming from miles away -- Follett uses variants on the same formulas for almost all of his WW2 thrillers (Eye of the Needle is the big exception--but this is the identical formula he uses in \\"The Key to Rebecca\\" and \\"Code to Zero\\" to name just two). Follett's writing style, as usual, moves right along, but this is a quick read, and not a particularly memorable one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Engaging","review":"I've lately been reading through a few of Ken Follett's World War II era novels - including \\"The Eye of the Needle\\", and most recently, \\"Hornet Flight\\". While many of his dedicated readers seem to prefer the former, for some reason I actually preferred the latter in terms of reading interest and entertainment value. Perhaps it was the fact that this story took place in a relatively unique setting for World War II spy novels - namely, Nazi occupied Denmark. \\"Eye of the Needle\\" was likely too familiar to me, having seen the movie years earlier. \\"Hornet Flight\\" offered an interesting tale of the Danish resistance and its effort to inform British intelligence on the existence of a German radar installation in Denmark responsible for the downing of many allied bombers. While it may not be the greatest spy story, or even to be found in those ranks, I found the story quite engaging and fun. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"I love Follet's books, and this one is as good as they get. I love the way he picks a historical event and makes it come alive with the interwoven plot and characters. This one is impossible to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, I cannot recommend this book","review":"I am a passionate fan of Ken Follett's work, but this is the worst story he has ever written. I am so sad. I will hope for his great skill to reassert itself in the next offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, Predictable, and Lackluster","review":"This was dull throughout, with the only excitement at all coming at the very end, and even that was very easy to anticipate, and hardly novel. The premise was weak, the plot illogical, and the characters mostly uninteresting. The abrupt character change in Peter Fleming seems to have been designed to ensure that the reader not sympathize with anyone who cooperated at all with the occupying powers; earlier, Fleming had seemed a loyal and charming police officer with a strong sense of duty. I had hoped the book might go beyond the usual stereotypes and examine questions such as whether those British bomber pilots whose lives the hero wanted to save were doing the right thing in fire-bombing German cities. Incinerating women and children from the air might just possibly be viewed as evil, even if carried out by our British allies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WheelChocksAboard?","review":"The Denmark Resistance smuggled papers to Stockhom.

Follet seems to be coasting on his reputation. How many authors could get away with having a plane explode when one of the characters on the ground throws a lit cigar at the fuselage?The book is probaly good for an airplane ride but if you are looking for something a little meatier go back and reread Follet's Eye Of A Needle ot The Pillars Of The Earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Failed research","review":"One of Follett's research assistants must be suffering a premonition as he has a PV444 Volvo in the story (in 1941), a car that wasn't introduced until 1944."},{"rating":"1","title":"very average","review":"This work by Follett left me feeling a little cheated. While a good enough read, I felt the overall story was rather too simple and a little unbelievable. Characters are not fully enough developed. Anyone who has more than the most basic understanding of WWII history will feel a little insulted by the way situations and references are too obviously spelled out.

While this is not up to the level of his finest books (Eye of the Needle and Man from St. Petersburg) it is very good. The characters are interesting and well thought out. Anytime he chooses to combine spys, murder, sex and Nazis, it is a sure winner in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic crap from a former master","review":"Yeah, I read the whole thing, even gasped several times. But as the plot contrivances began to pile up, I just got depressed. The whole thing is a series of cheap coincidences, manipulative character \\"development\\" (oh gee, the evil policeman takes care of his invalid wife--he can't be ALL bad!) and transparent obstacles the plucky young heros must overcome. There's never any doubt what's going to happen, so you slog through all these tedious plot-delay tactics, yearning for an actual surprise.Bottom line: Creaky, crappy, and mechanical. And this from a man who wrote some of the best books of the genre. I'm beginning to suspect he's created a computer program to plot his books--he just feeds in the old storylines and clicks commands, in this case, \\"Norwegianize!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"AMATEURISH EFFORT","review":"Since a few other reviewers have rehashed the plot of this novel, I won't get into the specifics of it. I just want to say that it is not a very good one. It breezes along like an old Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew story---amazing coincidences popping up everywhere, stilted dialogue slipping from every character's tongue, and action sequences which are unrealistic to the point of being downright silly.Years ago, Follett wrote three great action/suspense novels: Eye of the Needle, The Key to Rebecca, and Triple. If you want to be enjoyably entertained and save some money to boot, buy these novels in paperback. Don't waste twenty bucks on Hornet Flight."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY REVIEW OF HORNET FLIGHT","review":"After not reading books for 20 years, I bought a Kindle Fired ND and AND STARTED looking for books I might enjoy.

It's tedious and unbelievable. I found noone to root for and only kept reading in hopes that it would get better. Sadly it did not. The story, character and dialogue just doesn't work and the payoff is a snooze."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jackdaws clone","review":"See book description above.Written in the same vein as \\"Jackdaws\\", This World War 2 novel is also about some unlikely heroes.Ken Follett can certainly tell a good story though his last couple novels are not his best. They have good depth and characters but the story is not as thrilling and involving as his older works. As everyone else seems to think, his earlier novels are much better. 'Pillars of the Earth' is one of my all time favorites. I'm not yet giving up on reading Follett but I certainly hope his next novel will be like his old novels.Still Recommended for the Follett fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is History!","review":"This story is about a 18 year old kid who took a shortcut from the beach to his home across the German Military Base and he discovered a big machine he never seen before. after he discovered, he feels he must tell someone while MI6 is talking about Freya. this is more than just a story. It also tells about Wilston Churchell, the Prime Minster of England with is aide, Digby, Lulfwaffe, the Danish traitors, the Danish Military, and of course, the Hornet Flight, including love stories, and almost civil to the germans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hornet Flight","review":"Very disappointing, but like many authors who write a few really good books and develop a following, Follett has now begun to turn out poorly written, simplistic penny dreadfuls. Sad, since the history of Denmark during WWII deserves better remembrance. What bothered me most was that the book was written for the average middle-schooler, both in language and content. Another author crossed off the list. sigh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting WWII tale","review":"Ken Follett can usually be depended upon to deliver a story full of action, adventure and suspense, and his latest is no exception. Once again we are back in the dark days of WWII when the Nazis are at the height of their conquest of Western Europe. In this tale, the location is Denmark, a place not usually the subject of wartime espionage tales. We are given the story of how the Allies were able to overcome the German advantage in early radar, and it is told with all of the old skill of this famous author. We have the intrepid hero, the conflicted Nazi-leaning policeman, the spunky female love interest, and the regular host of supporting characters that we have all come to know and love from Mr. Follett's books. It's formula writing, but it's formula writing at its best, and the reader keeps turning the poages from beginning to end. That's all one can require from a book of this type, and the author delivers. It's great escapist entertainment, and I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hornet Flight","review":"It's hard to believe Ken Follett could write a book this amateurish. It reads more like his first rather than his latest. The sentences are simple; basic statements are explained; the situations rather simplistic. The storyline is credible; the characters are not...much too naive. It's hard to believe this is the same author who wrote The Eye of the Needle; The Key to Rebecca; The Pillars of the Earth (which I loved) and many other really fine books.If you must read it, check it out at the library and save your money for his next book. Hopefully, he'll return to his former style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ken Follett has done much better","review":"I am a great fan of Ken Follett and his many wonderful books. Unfortunately, Hornet Flight is not one of his better books. It is an ordinary and predictable spy vs. spy story set in World War II Denmark. The characters are one-dimensional people, with unlikely affiliations, and unlikely luck. They get into trouble because of their foolish decisions or bad luck. They rely too often on unlikely good luck to get them out of trouble. The story lacks the intensity, credibility, suspense, rich intrigue, and intricate interconnections between interesting people and events that make his books like Dangerous Fortune and The Pillars of the Earth so special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up to Standards","review":"Follett has written a number of wonderful books including Jackdaws. Hornet Flight like Jackdaws deals with penetration into occupied Europe, but unlike his past efforts the characters were not believable. Harald the hero and his girl friend Kathy are totally dependent on unreal coincidences to move the plot along. There were opportunities of character development especially with Kathy's and Harald's parents but instead they were made comic book, as a prior reviewer said, figures.In short I would rather invest my time in reading some wonderful prior Follett's than this effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Another great novel by Ken Follett.

Disappointment because he obviously knows good writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Belly Flop into Concrete","review":"This was my first Follet book, and I was somewhat excited to get my hands on it. I had heard of Ken Follet's books, and they seemed to enjoy a wide following.In \\"Hornet Flight\\", the setting in WW2 Denmark, the characters are well developed and the descriptions are well balanced between the detail and pace. Follet also keeps a reasonable level of tension thoughout the book.And then you reach the middle to the end. What would have been a difficult book even for someone of Follet's skills turns to unadulterated tragedy. The ending is predictable and a disaster, a thorough disappointment after a reasonably good build-up. It seemed shallow and without any real thought or climax. The delay of the flight, (this is after the two main characters slaved and scraped to repair the plane right under the Germans' noses), because of a dance performance was ...well....bad.Despite Follet's obvious skills as a writer, this book can't be among his best work. I would not reccommend it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Excellent Ken Follet","review":"All of his novels are fun and entertaining, this one takes you back to WW II and the Nazi occupation of Denmark.

Using cotter pins would prevent this and a solid axle is really a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phew!! It IS stenchy! But nicer than expected.","review":"This cart is like a box of chocolates...you never know which one you're gonna get. :-) The one I rec'd is considerably nicer than the one in the pic. The front wheels are on swivels which I had never seen before on a cart like this. The only real advantage to that is it makes it a little smaller when folded up. It is black with very comfy foam on the handles. My hardware is fine and it was all there. All there was were 4 nuts and washers to attach the wheels and a mini wrench was included. The smell of diesel fuel will about knock you over when you open the box. I am guessing it's from the solid rubber wheels. I left mine in the garage for a few days and it's gone.

Just keep in mind that the small wheels may come loose after using it for a while. My cart happened to rust in some spots despite it never being wet. There wasn't that strong of a smell when I opened mine that others reported. I bought it b/c I live alone and thought I'd need the help carrying down groceries to my 2nd floor apartment or if I needed to move loads of laundry to the laundry mat. I thought it may make it easier on my back than trying to carry everything, which it has...however there is only so much you can do when you live in an apartment that only has stairs and no elevators so obviously the cart can only do so much too. Overall I'd have to say it's decent and I'm glad I bought it. It'd be easier if it had the larger wheels for all 4 of them when using them on stairs, plus the larger wheels seem to be more sturdy. But what can you do, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended - didnt even last me a month","review":"This cart looked fine when it arrived (and I did not notice a stench). However, the wheels are atrocious. Both sets fall off all of the time, and the do not roll well. Have the time the hind wheels slip out, and the metal piece bends, forcing the wheels to fold underneath the cart. I cannot push it most of the time because the front wheels skid, so I have to tip it on the two hind wheels and pull the cart.

I was expecting to get at least a biographical sketch of Paganini. Instead, I got what appears to be a children's novel. It is 144 pages, all double spaced in something close to a large, 12 - 14 pt font with many crude illustrations on every other page, each taking up half of the page. In other words, there's not much here. I would sum it up by simply saying that it is an attempt at an historical novel with the central character being Paganini. You could write this yourself if you can tell a story and are willing to spend an hour on the internet getting some of the basic background information on Paganini. If you're looking for real information about Paganini, you would do much better with a simple Google Search.I've never written a review before but felt compelled to here, this was that bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, Loud, and Hard.

This box-set seems to have been assembled by the corporate music industry intent on homogeneity and filler.

Like-wise a rushed version of Mon Legionnaire which was made to be a slow song of devotion.Thankfully there are no winded ones done in a recording studio since she loved singing to a live audience.She had an ear for a true melody and then she put heart and soul into it. Eternelle is a complilation of one after another of her classics. I can only suppose being an instition demanded new repotoires and there were not enough talented and original song-writers to keep up with her public. The French would have loved any thing she did which is probably the cause and they tend to have a homogeneous taste in music of which she was an out-standing exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"A difficult read","review":"I do not like this book.

The book was very consistent with my Secondary Band Methods class, and reading it allows outsiders to share in Dr. B's funny anecdotes and useful tips. It's almost like taking a class with him. It was interesting enough to read beyond the assigned sections each night. He touches on lots of useful rehearsal techniques and also gives advice on how to deal with different situations. Well known for his conducting, he breaks down different methods in Laymen's terms.I highly recommend this book, for it an extremely useful read to keep on a nearby shelf for reference.

It's not meant to be \\"Classical Music for Dummies.\\" It is meant to help future teachers through the personal experience of one of the most talented teachers in America. It is definitely worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational required reading for all who teach music","review":"The most inspirational book I have ever read. This very readable book does not teach you the mechanics of conducting, but how to lead effectively and with sound pedagogy to produce real musicians.

But only for self-serving pride.

He cites examples with The Home Depot, US Marine Corps and Southwest Airlines and how they create pride in their organizations. Read the five paths offered and a starter list for pride-building when seeking a process to instill greater institution-pride. According to the author, \\"the secret to success is applying the discipline and focus required to sustain institution-building pride among those employees who make a competitive difference to you.\\" If you think it's all common sense to create pride, why do many organizations try to spend their way to success?

Serious problem: the software included does not permit to upload songs to the computer not downloaded before so you can not transfer it easily to other audio formats. I asked Sony customer service and basically after three tries of their complex web support system I got either no response or authomatically generated useless responses."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best sony personal audio ever","review":"when i first looked into getting an md player, this was the first one i saw. i saw the price was a bit steep, but when i got it, i realized it was well worth the money!!it has everything from a backlit remote, to a clock display.you can also record from any other audio device with the right cable. some of the other people in the reviews said it wasn't good, but i don't know what they're talking about. it is great. the supplied accessories are good too. the software is a little complicating, but you get used to it. definetly buy the Sony MZ-N1 Net MD Player/Recorder!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just right!","review":"Bought for daughters Colorado outside wedding, wore it all night.

To this day, one of my favorite albums is DJ Hi-Tek and Talib Kweli - Reflection Eternal. Not only is the production on this album amazing, the lyrics are tight. What puts Talib in a different category is his message. You rarely hear him speak of money or things like that. If you like true lyracists, you will love this album.

With this album he has proved that he is the BEST. I don't use this term lightly. His lyrics are unbested in the game. With producers such as Kanye West, Kweli manages to take the best beats and combine masterful flows and lyrics to do it all exceptionally well. May fortune smile upon Kweli on his next album. Support Talib Kweli, support GOOD MUSIC (buy this before you THINK about buying Eminem or Spears)."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 stars","review":"Once again Talib proves he is one of if not THE best lyricist in hip hop today.

But after i listened to it, somethin was missin. then i realized it was the beats. the beats didn't seem to pronunciate kweli's flow,(like blackstar/train of thought/hip hop for respect) and aknowledge his amazing battle metaphors. the beats were more soft like those that u hear in clubs or dances.

Talib is still that same hip-hop artist that teaches us our black worth in a messed up society, of course to a hot beat. My favorite songs goes as follows on the album- Gorilla Monsoon Rap,Won't you stay, good to you and countless others. Kweli is the truth in a more fresh way I encourage all to get this album it is a must have in the Kweli collection. If you are new to Kweli then you will still enjoy this let it play from beginning to end, real underground flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talib Kweli - Quality","review":"Talib Kweli's first main album Quality is a very good true hip-hop album.The lyrics on this album are really good, Kweli's flow is definitely nice and everything around his concepts ties in together really well.The production on this album is really dope. Some of my favorite beats are \\"Get By\\", \\"Shock Body\\", \\"Talk To You\\", \\"Guerrilla Monsoon Rap\\"(Really dope beat), \\"The Proud\\", \\"Wont You Stay\\".There is not much to say about this album expect that the beats are on point,. and the lyrics are especially on point. This is actually the first Talib Kweli album I have picked up on, and I think its definitely worth the buy for some Quality hip-hop. Check this out, you won't be disappointed. Overall I give this album 4-4.5 stars.My Top 5 Songs1.Get By2.Talk To You3.Guerrilla Monsoon Rap4.Shock Body5.Wont You Stay"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not meet expectations","review":"After seeing that this album was highly recommended by most of the Amazon reviewers and because it was featured on numerous true hip-hop themed \\"listmania's,\\" I chose to buy this CD. Sadly, I really feel let down, especially after hearing the single \\"just to get by\\" which is one of the redeeming qualities of this album. To be honest, Quality is chock full of lackluster beats and average lyrical content. So if you're planning on buying this album like I was, beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is hot!","review":"Talib does it again...this CD was worth the wait. Only listend to it once, but am buying it today. My favorite is the single that's out now...\\"Waiting For The DJ\\" Stay up, Kweli!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant MC","review":"I've been checking for Kweli since I first heard \\"Brown Skin Lady\\" back in 1998. After copping the Blackstar album, I copped everything I could that had Kweli on it. But the song that really changed my perception of Kweli from being just a dope MC to one of my favorite MCs was \\"2000 Seasons\\". Anyway, this album isn't necessarily better or worse than the Reflection Eternal album, but it is different. In this case, different is good. We get another kind of vibe from Kweli. Just imagine if he did an album with Hi-Tek, Premo, Alchemist, and Kanye West. Well, maybe that's just a little bit of wishful thinking, but hey. All in all, I think the Reflection Eternal album was a slight bit better because of the constant vibe throughout the album, but if you disagree I can't really argue with you. Still, a brilliant album from a brilliant MC."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect album","review":"talib kweli is my favorite MC..this album is perfect, but reflection eternal - train of thought had a few better cuts...overall this is classic material..cop it.1"},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to the TRUE KWELI-TY","review":"first this is definetly not a classic.. it's a disgrace for what Talib Kweli stands for. His wordplay is killed by the wack mainstream beats.. it seems the industry has gotten to the underground and is starting to kill all the dope emcees. I pray talib finds the correct path again and does another collabo with mos cuz BlackStar is incredible.. and Reflection Eternal.. i never thought they could split like that.. but for hip hops sake they better get back together.. i gave Kweli 2 stars cuz he was my favorite emcee till i heard this.. now i think ill stick to Mr. Lif and Binary Star."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO QUALITY","review":"Talib's music used to emerge from the void sparkling, progressing harmoniously with the bass line--lyrics painting a picture though adrenalin and pure soul. This..... is whack.I suppose the industry turns every solo artist out sooner or later but I really had my fingers crossed on this one. In fact, he used to be one of those artists you get hype about like \\"aw ..., he got anotha hot joint about to drop, I'm gonna snatch that on-line before it's even released.\\" And then you get soft beats, soft lyrics, mushy hooks and too much singing. If you want something that will get your head nodding saying \\"tru dat\\" or \\"oh ...!\\" or even original and unique flavorful beats...DO NOT, I repeat...DO NOT buy this album. Keep the old rotation: Mos Def, Blackstar, Roots, Reflection Eternal, Like Water for Chocolate, Slum Village. QUALITY is a fall of creativity and potential from one of my favorite MCs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a studio MC","review":"Talib Kweli strikes as the type of cat who, if I was at a party and he was freestyling in the corner, I'd be impressed; if someone put on a beat and put a mic in his hand, he'd get off; or if he was rhyming on the corner with someone else beatboxing, he'd sound nice. The problem is, on two different albums, that ability hasn't translated well.The beats on this album are adequate at best; the song featuring DJ quick (number 10) is the best track. Kweli's lyrical ability, while impressive for what it is, just doesn't sound good when placed over top of overproduced tracks.kweli is an old-schooler; he needs a minimalist touch, a la the Fugees, Tribe Called Quest style. He's a b-boyer from back in the day, And when he tries to spout lyrics that have substance behind them, he just sounds awkward.Ironically, though, i like listening to the album, but I recognize that it's not a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, but what did you expect","review":"Never has an album that I was filled with so much expectation for satisfied me so much. As soon as I heard Kweli was doing a true solo disc, I had to buy it on the release date. I've done this with albums in the past and been satisfied but left empty by unmet expectations. NOT WITH THIS ALBUM THOUGH. It is great top to bottom. This is real hip-hop and if you're a fan, you'll buy this and love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talib Kweli....Divine","review":"I've loved Talib for a minute, he brings tears of joy to my eyes everytime I listen to this cat....

KWELI'S DOPE RAP, HI-TEKS DOPE BEATS. MOST OF THIS ALBUM IS LIKE NOISE TO MY EARS INSTEAD OF MUSIC, ALOT OF THE BEATS ARE NOT ARRANGED RIGHT MUSICALLY. 'WAITIN 4 THE DJ' AND 'PUT IT IN THE AIR'(PRODUCED BY DJ QUIK) IS WHAT I CALL MUSIC, 2 TIGHT STAND-OUT TRACKS. JUST LISTEN TO EVERY OTHER SONG, STOP 4 A SECOND, THEN CHUCK ON 'PUT IT IN THE AIR' AND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHAT IM SAYIN. IT'S LIKE A RELIEF FROM A HEADACHE.

Kweli needs Hi-Tek or Mos Def. He has too many collabs on this LP. He shouldn't even consider himself a solo artist. He should have also kept the producers to a minimum. Kanye West is no Hi-Tek. Why did he pick those soft J-Dilla beats that he chose? What was ''gun music''? Yo Talib, I love your music, but next time around you gotta do better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who is Talib Kweli?","review":"Who is Talib Kweli? Sure i had heard of him before this album, but an entire cd of his is crazy good. He opens off with rush as his first song and you can tell from his first lines that he's gotta be one of the top 3 lyricists in the game today. The album is, as the title says, quality throughout. There are maybe 4 skipover tarcks total and the rest easily make up the difference. Get by is amazing, the proud is great, where do we go and the other finally 4 tracks are heartfelt and insightful and guerilla monsoon rap is off the hook. I would say that this cd is a must have and if you dont have it already, you better go snag a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great skateboard","review":"My daughter is very pleased with this skateboard and rides it all over the house.

I document mushrooms and using this lens to exhibit the finite detail of fungi does a fantastic job. I have also done some portrait work with it and for bust vignette shots where I want the background blurred out it works for me. The 2.8 aperture is excellent for low light settings without bumping up the ISO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lens","review":"Well I picked this up during Christmas season for my gift. I know, I know...lets get on with the review. Ok...simply put this is a great lens. I love taking macro pictures and needed a dedicated macro lens (note if the lens is not a 1:1 it is not a true macro). It is the middle of winter here in the Chicagoland area, so there are no flowers or bugs to take photos of. This is when I discovered that when people call this the portrait macro they are not lying. This lens takes beautiful portrait shots. Beautiful bokeh.Now to talk about what others say about this lens. I do not mind the manual/auto focus clutch ring. I actually like it quite a bit. The only thing that I noticed is a touch of focus creep sometimes when I am zoomed in fully on a close subject. That's my only complaint. Can't wait for winter to go away and I can get my macro on!I would recommend this lens with no reservations...a great lens and a pretty good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent prime lens","review":"I bought this lens based upon Amazon reviews, and I was not disappointed; it has exceeded my expectations in studio photography applications. The lens body is plastic and the AF/MF selection on the lens takes a little getting used to, but these characteristics are not of practical consequence in my applications. I use manual focus exclusively with this lens.The low f/2.8 provides a narrow depth of field and great bokeh with reduced light, while with high strobe levels, higher depth of field can be obtained in macro shots. I've had great results in jewelry and portraiture photography with this lens, a great deal especially with the $50 rebate until 12/31."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!! The Series and Burke Continue to Grow","review":"The search for a missing teenage girl propel Burke on journey where he encounters the fall-out from 1960's radicalism, the disappearance of prostitutes, and a disparate group dedicated to relieving the suffering of those in pain. More is revealed of the complex emotional make-up of Mr. Vachss' \\"protagonist\\" Burke as he continues to evolve. Mr. Vachss has created yet another novel rich in both information and entertainment value. Enthusiastically recommended to both fans of the series and newcomers alike ... a highly imaginative and important book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent writing","review":"The prose is tight, it's really wonderful. Vachss is really getting to be an outstanding writer, in a technical sense. He also is great at developing characters and making them really three dimensional. However - the \\"infomercial\\" part of this book was too much a part of the plot element - it took too much time and was very obviously a heartfelt pitch on a subject I also find compelling. But it got in the way of the story...Anyone who really likes any of Vachss books should really read Flood, the first book in the series and really the best in terms of depth of character. It's really remarkable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-flight as usual","review":"Here comes Burke again, as resourceful, violent, tough, single-minded, stubborn and vengeful as ever, and always on the side of the angels (although it's not always easy to tell!). There has never been a more readable crime series or a more compelling protagonist. Don't look for the cliches of crime writing -- bam! wham! bang! bop!

Every time I think Vachss and his work have topped out, he exceeds himself again."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Uncharted Waters","review":"Mr. Vachss brings us back to the gritty, paranoid life of Burke and the underground in which he survives. But Burke is not at home, New York is on the other coast, and he is out of the know in this strange yet similar city of Portland.Here to find a missing child, Burke is forced to dig deep and put his trust in those who are not part of his \\"family.\\" This gets him digging in several worlds; from comic books, to \\"pain sympathizers\\" in search of drugs to extinguish terminal anguish.Burke also shows us a deeper maturity as he levels with a few who he needs to trust him, and compromises his privacy and past.Ultimately Burke loses control and is manipulated into doing other work before he can accomplish his own goals further showing us his own abilities at PAIN MANAGEMENT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pain managment","review":"Of all the burke books this was the most dissapointing.

I found I was bored throughout the movie but made it to the end but my brother gave up halfway through. I would not recommend this to even the most devoted John Sandford fan like myself. Mind prey was a much better movie and even though Lucas was played by Eriq La Salle, who is black, I thought he was much better as Davenport. Harmon just couldn't pull it off. Anyone want to buy my copy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark Harmon/Lucas Davenport","review":"I loved the movie because I love Mark Harmon.

I doubt it. They did refund the cost of one sarong. Fine, but I still bought a product I assumed was new but sure didn't arrive that way.I'm also disappointed in the size. I am a large and although this fits my waist, I won't be able to wear it as a dress tied at the neck like I wanted.That said, the fabric is soft and the colors are pretty so I'm sure they'll get used for something.

The main problem is that the point-of-view character is dull as dishwater. The treacly tone is also jarringly out of line with his frequent allusions to Mark Twain (who knew how to write a sermon without preaching), and the mystery aspect of the story falls flat. Pohl covered the same coming-of-age territory much more effectively in his wonderful novel Homegoing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book.","review":"This makes an Okey-Dokey read, though it tends toward the better part of the statement. A good book, plenty of interesting characters and excellent personification of the main martian.

It has large numbers making it easy for her to call people. The on/off buttons are colored green/red so she can easily figure out how to turn it on/off. The display is clear and bright with simple icons making it easy for her to select the phonebook and pick out the names of people to call. With her previous phone, she could never figure that part out, and typed every number each time she called someone. I only give this phone 4 stars however since the builtin camera and FM radio present major challenges for her and I have serious doubts that she will ever figure out how to use them. Nokia should make a phone that a complete idiot can use, then I would not need to do tech support. Thank god for the Apple iMac and iSync as well, since this allows her to update and sync the phonebook."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I've had several of Nokia's phones before and have never been disappointed with them until now. When using the hands-free headset, whoever I was talking to sounded liked they were talking into a tin can. Since I use the hands-free set the majority of the time I'm on the phone, this was a big problem. The other problem I found was that the phone did not have a very powerful vibrate mode. I sometimes did not even hear it when it was sitting on my desk next to me. The one plus of the phone (other than Nokia's easy-to-use menus) is that's it's very light and compact. Because of the problem with the hands-free set, I had to exchange it for a Motorola V360. This phone is a bit heavier, but has much better sound quality and vibrate mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheaply made.","review":"I've had this phone less than a month and the finish is already chipping off.

I can now sit at my desk at work and have a conversation without any problem! It also has many of the \\"extras\\" that people have come to expect today - camera, radio, voice dialing, loudspeaker, etc. My only complaints: the loudspeaker feature can be activated only after you have placed a call and the radio works only if you plug in a headset that acts as an antenna."},{"rating":"1","title":"sound should be lounder!!","review":"I got this phone from T-mobile for free last week. I tried to find out how to make sound lounder. I barely hear when I talk on the phone. I went back to the store to find out what's wrong with it and they said it's normal. It's easy to tell that this phone is lower than normal if you compare with another cell phone in the same price. So far this phone on froze 4 times. I'm thinking to take it back with in this week.

It's the same story, but in colour as it should be. The \\"Essentials\\" are all in black-and-white, on low-quality paper and badly bound - the cover on my copy came off within a day. The only thing the \\"Essential\\" edition has to recommend is it contains specials and annuals like \\"Giant Sized X-Men #1\\" (where the new team are recruited), whereas the Masterworks contain only the regular books. But get your act together Marvel, these should be collectible books, not throwaways. Print the books in colour!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do buy this... if you want backstory for cheap","review":"These are not collector's items. The Essential series is a cheap alternative to the collector's items such as Marvel Masterworks. The editors wanted a way to get these stories into the hearts and minds of readers who either couldn't afford or didn't want to pay for those volumes or to track down the back issues. You get cheap stock paper and no color, pure story and pencil/ink artwork drive these. Bravo Marvel for printing this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contrary to popular opinion...","review":"I actually LIKE the fact that this book is in black & white. The art in this book is amazing--very representative of the period in which comic book art reached its zenith. Without the addition of color, one gets a better feel of the craftsmanship involved.As for the stories themselves, the title is correct--this IS essential for any X-Men fan. It tells how the New X-Men get formed. Also, the tone of comics darkened in this period, so we get X-Men fighting demons and the like. We see the New X-Men's first encounter with Magneto. We get to journey to the Savage Land, and we get the Phoenix Saga.Definitely worth the investment for X-Fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"starting point","review":"now, although the title of this is essential x-men, its not like the other 'essential' titles, it doesn't pick up at the very beginning of the series. if you want that, look for 'essential uncanny xmen'. sometime in the original run, the x-men stopped being published, then a few years later, it was picked up again, & a whole new team was formed. essential xmen starts there. these stories are great, they are what made x-men what it is today. the origin of phoenix, the introduction of the shi'ar, a battle with magneto, this book has a lot. the only reason this gets only 4 stars is because although it is good, volume 2 is even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Comics Great Buy","review":"I just want to say that the essential are the best and this a great price because the comic book stores want $16.00 plus tax and online they are only 9.72; great deal"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential X-Men is essential! reprints X-Men#GS#1,94-119!","review":"Essential X-Men is essential!

Almost every single review I read was positive. They talked about good graphics, good voice acting, and a generally good game. None of that is true. Sure, some of the voice acting (from the actual cast of the show) is fine, but the horribly long pauses between each line of dialogue ruin anything that might be there. And that's not even counting the game play, which is simplistic \\"run around and click until you find the right door to open\\" and \\"fight badly.\\" Which brings us to what could laughably be called a fighting engine. I spent most of my time yelling: \\"No, don't kick the air, kick the vampire. Turn around, turn around. No, go the direction I'm pointing.\\" I press the punch button, and two seconds later, I punch.

BUY IT!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun being one of the Scooby Gang!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Chaos Bleeds. As a huge BTVS fan, it was interesting to play within the sets (some levels) that looked just like they did on the show. The Magic Box, the high school, Sunnydale, it was super cool! The voice work was great, yet would have liked a better Anya...and Willow was \\"okay\\" as well. I am not the best at games, so my boyfriend had to help me beat levels, but I got to sit back and enjoy- as if I were watching a new episode of BTVS. We had to use an online cheat at times, as it was just sometimes too confusing to figure out certain sections. They all fought so cool and it was neat staking/dusting the vamps and other big nasty's.

In and of itself is a fun game and it's appeal increases from there based on how much you're into the series. It's made to be another episode of Buffy where the crew is transported to an alternate universe from which they have to find their way home. You'll encouter a number of characters from throughout the series and actually get to play as a number of them, including Buffy, Spike, Xander, that mannequin from the ventriloquist episode in the first season, and some others. I play a fair amount of video games and in terms of difficulty, I was able to complete it but didn't find it all that easy to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a licensed game that doesn't suck.","review":"Chaos Bleeds captures the spirit of the tv series and is a very fun game to play. The only problem I had with the game was the camera problems (it doesn't take away from the gameplay), and the few save points. You can't save until you pass a level. Not good when you have to work in fifteen minutes. But other than that, the game is good. The controls are good, the weapons are decent, ranging from stakes to hell fire. The dialogue is funny and witty, with a lot of the cast supplying voice overs (Except for Sarah Michelle Gellar, Alyson Hannigan, Emma Caulfield, and a few others. At least they got James Marsters to reprise his role as Spike), You feel like you're The Slayer when you're playing this game. And you even get levels with Xander, Willow, Spike, even Faith and Sid The Dummy. Bottom line, if you're a gamer and a fan of the show, this is a good game to add to your collection, and it's only $20. So go get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy, she slayed me!","review":"The game isn't the best but it is far from being the worst I've ever played. While it was semi-challenging, it was very entertaining and true to series. The voice overs were well done by the actors portraying Buffy, Willow and Anyanka. As the others said though...Buffy (fabulous, five stars), Willow (3 stars, the voice was good but the actress obviously dislikes Willow as she made her sound like an utter moron but then Alyson Hannigan does have a distinctive voice), and Anya (0 stars, no other comments needed). The humour was there and I found myself smiling at most of the self-deprecating quips that accompany the actions. I'm not a graphics specialist but they seemed alright. All in all, the game is worth buying, especially if you are a fan. Hey, the series is over but the show goes on. Gotta get those BTVS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Controls are great","review":"I'm pretty much a novice gamer but that's not for lack of trying. I have to disagree with the person who complained about the controls. The controls are a big part of why I loved this game. They made sense and were simple enough for me to get. Even at first when I didn't know what the heck I was doing, they enabled me to catch on quick without dying. Can't wait until the next game. The only complaint I have is Willow's voice and the multiplayer games. The multiplayer games are really senseless and unfun.And Willow's voice is awful. Very whiny.

If one has an interest in understanding (and not rabid polemics), this book provides a wealth of research and context invaluable in trying to get a handle on what in the world it means when we refer to \\"Arab-Americans.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Issues of Identity: Kayyali's volume is long overdue","review":"Who's an Arab American? The fact that most Americans have no understanding of Arab American identity makes Kayyali's book timely and appreciated. Her text is an important reference for all interested in Arab affairs, especially Arab American affairs. The volume clearly explains the importance of immigration issues and their impact upon identity as it carefully denotes religious, national, and geographic differences. The book also offers helpful information as to how Middle Eastern Arab culture continues to influence Arab American ideals and ideology and the impact of Arab American identity upon Middle Eastern affairs. Readers will glean from this volume an increased understanding and a sad realization of how little has been known about Arab American identity until Kayyali provided this gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for students of Arab-American culture and history","review":"Arab-Americans have made major contributions to U.S. society and yet many of their immigrant patterns and achievements receive relatively scant attention compared with some other ethnic groups. Kayyali, a Ph.D. candidate, opens with a political and social history of the Arab world and moves quickly to narrow the focus to Arab American history and culture, surveying assimilation and immigration experiences, adaptations, and Arab American communities across the country. Part of the 'New Americans' series, its focus is important."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lebanese American","review":"I have to admit I couldn't finish reading this book. In fact, I wasn't able to move beyond its sickening Introduction; a frantic piece of propaganda, gasping for some historical depth to the recent \\"Arab\\" addition to the American mosaic. What better better way to offer that longed for depth than by hijacking 19th century Lebanese history, and the history of the migration of Christian peoples of the Middle East to America, and attributing it to the Arabs. Only bankrupt cultures resort to such tactics. This book should have been titled \\"the Lebanese American\\", but then again, the Lebanese don't need a rabid Arab Nationalists to tell their story to them. We know who we are, thank you very much! And please, stop hitching rides on our backs simply because your culture has nothing to show for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Rubbish","review":"I agree with the commentators below!

Personally I found the \\"crazy\\" pathologist the truely likeable actual hero of the book, although she also seemed to take a back seat at times.

Between the lines lies Reznikov's well-deserved worship of the man who foresaw (at least in lingual terms) the rise and fall of the Third Reich and the Soviet Union. Also, Reznikov suggests (again, between the lines) that, just as Tolkien originally conceived Middle Earth in order to create a separate reality where characters could speak Elvish, Orwell's greatest fictional work, 1984, probably grew out of his desire to display his theoretical language, Newspeak.This book is a must for those who love Orwell and 1984; it will help you to understand both better. The book is dry in subject, and a bit repetitive, but wet in enthusiasm. Reznikov enjoys his concept and may well have a future in literary non-fiction beyond Orwell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written, careful analysis of Orwell's theory","review":"Aside from the astute observations Reznikov draws from Orwell's writings to tease out the theory of language that follows perhaps what is most astounding is that this wonderfully well-written book is authored by a person whose native language is not English. I came to this book convinced that Orwell had a theory so Reznikov's task with me, at least, was less daunting. With others, I suspect, his work may be less convincing. Nevertheless I am genuinely impressed with the scholarship that supports this book even if the subject is a well-worn topic. In his case, Reznikov sheds light onto an aspect of Orwell's writing that few of us have thought about before, and for this reason alone I submit that those truly interested in the corruption of language will be most interested in this book.

After reading the book, I was able to write my own pages and they worked. The first part of the book was a nice review and provides a good reference of VBScript. The second part was essential. It provided a detailed description and good examples of ADO and stored procedures.

I took the right analog pad's rubber off since I don't use that as much and put it on the left. That gave me about a further 50 hours of play. Then the same analog stick stopped turning left. Everything else worked, but I couldn't turn left or up/down left in any game. I eventually took it apart and played with the calibration until I managed to get it working again.

The book focuses on the negative aspects of adopting older children, usually using personal anecdotes and horror stories to illustrate the author's points, and almost always placing the blame on the adopted children. While I didn't find any of the information useful or practical, it is an excellent tool for what not to do. In many of the anecdotes, it is easy to see how the parents' responses to difficult behavior only serve to exacerbate the behavior.

Unfortunately for me, he was just \\"playing\\".This book was good because it went deeper into explaining the way men think and what motivates their decisions to be with one woman or another.

Twilight Zone actually has some flamenco-style guitar in the middle. It sounds crazy, but it makes for a nice change if you're getting tired of the fantastic original studio version. The heavy bass used during Radar Love sounds great too. I was dissapointed with this version of Weekend Love, though. I was surprised that Long Blond Animal actually worked pretty well performed acoustically, but it'll always be an electric song. I personally prefer Fully Naked, since it includes wonderful versions of Yellow And Blue and As Long As The Wind Blows that are, in my opinion, better than the 1970 studio versions. All told, the acoustic albums are my least favorite of the live albums. While they have proved that they are great acoustically, I really prefer their live electric albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another reason why","review":"Once again this tremendous overlooked (in the U.S.) band delivers.

When I finally went to purcahse a camcorder, it came between sony and canon. Canon had 2x more optical zoom and 300x more digital zoom, but the Sony had better picture and the camera just sat better in my hand. The buttons were placed in more manageable spots, except for the light switch. Anyhow, the picture on this camera is crystal clear, even when I use lower quality 8mm tapes.

And she sings with the voice of a sparrow, oh so sweetly.Every song is so inspiring, from upbeat, contemporary songs like \\"God is Watching\\" and \\"A Man Named Jesus\\" to more traditional songs like her cover Edwin Hawkins' \\"Give Us This Day.\\" This album truly lifted my spirits at a time when I really, really needed it, especially \\"Worship Him.\\" This song is like a gospel sermon-symphony with an additional reprise at the end--truly a classic!What's great about this album is that when Lisa opens her mouth, you know that the words she sings come from her anointed spirit. And that makes her words all the more inspiring. She is a diamond in gospel music, and Just As I Am is a precious stone.

Producing fine black and white images in digital form is not easy and I was expecting all sorts of information on doing B&W conversions from colour files, but there's very little of that. It has very little good information on producing a professional standard digital black and white at all. The author talks a lot about very basic digital stuff such as selecting a camera, basic lighting for digital, exposure for digital and composition, everything you see here can be found in dozens of other books. The REAL info on fine quality professional B&W is either missing or just barely touched on. He does have quite a bit of info on Infrared but he has authored a different book on that subject so why the extended coverage in this book? There is info on special effects such as handcolouring that is interesting but the info on producing fine B&W that I was hoping for is missing. A disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This book lacked information on most of the things one would expect given the title, such as exposure response of digital cameras, contrast control, grain control, lighting, and digital manipulation. It contained a lot of images which often were not tied at all to the text, lacked captions, and were boring. Some of the images seemed to be examples of what not to do, but were not labeled as such, given one the impression that the author was proud of these crummy pictures he took. Two things that were covered in some detail were making ragged looking borders and infrared b/w photography - both gimmicks.

It's the first time I've seen her, and what a great surprise. She dominates every scene she's in--even those with Thomas Haden Church--and she does it with perfectly-honed understatement. Lillian Gish once said (something to the effect): \\"never let 'em catch you acting,\\" and Ellen Page doesn't.UPDATE (9-5-09): I have seen two more of Ellen Page's films. \\"Juno\\" for which she received an Oscar nomination, and \\"An American Crime\\" in which she was downright outstanding. She reminds me of the great French actress, Isabelle Adjani, [who, coincidentally, was the same age as Ms. Page when she received an Oscar nomination for her powerful performance in \\"The Story of Adele H.\\" (1975), the setting for which--though not filmed there--is Halifax, Nova Scotia, where Page was born and raised]."},{"rating":"2","title":"SMART MOVIE","review":"from the producers that brought us \\"Sideways\\" comes \\"Smart People\\". If you enjoyed the wit of \\"Sideways\\" you will enjoy this also. This has to be Dennis Quaid's best movie in years. \\"Sideways\\" alum Thomas Haden Church returns for another funny, goofy role. Ellen Page is refreshing and touching. Sarah Jessica Parker's role is some of her best work.The writing gives the actors a lot of juice to work with and good writing makes good actors and the writing here is good.I will not give plot details...so rent this one TODAY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"for smart people comes a movie of the same title","review":"Smart People is a situational dramedy that's about the everyday rather than a grand plot. However, there's enough description, cinematography, and character development and a sheer respect for the characters to make the movie delightful and sympathetic. Ellen Page is marvelous in her role as Vanessa, the exemplary daughter, who takes on the role of being \\"the perfect little housewife\\" as her brother exclaims and Dennis Quaid shines as a middle-aged grumpy professor for whom life is a series of seeming success that are actually demeaning failures. Smart People took me by surprise. It's not often enough that a little gem like this - with an intelligent script and interesting, if majorly flawed, characters - hits the Silver Screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stereotypical stereotyped charaters","review":"This movie was fun and funny to watch. Having a high IQ doesn't mean someone is smart and that applies to myself as well. I have had a lot of friends and have known a lot of people that fit these stereotypes. A college English professor who is literature smart and social dumb raised his daughter and son alone after his wife's death. The movie seems to have several themes going at once. The professor's seventeen year old smart perfectionist daughter falls for her homosexual half-uncle. The professor alienates his son through poor communications and can't make it with a stereotype dumb blond so turns to a relationship with his homosexual half brother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart Script","review":"I don't usually enjoy romantic comedies, realistic slice-of-life dramas or other standard mass-market genre movies -- but SmartPeople is not simply one of those. It is so well written and intelligently directed that it stands out as a thoughtful and sometimes a very funny film. The film's writer, Mark Poirier, seems to be the same Mark Poirier who is the author of such quirky-smart novels as \\"Modern Ranch Living\\" and \\"Goats,\\" and the extremely good short story collection, \\"Unsung Heroes of American Industry.\\" He's a strong literary writer who seems to be able to make the transition to penning entertaining screenplays without losing any of his intelligence or his eye for human idiosyncracy. The film is well cast and well acted, but it's worth it just to see how an intelligent script can lift the level of a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Bother ?","review":"Given the cast I was looking forward to this movie.I have appreciated Dennis Quaid since Breaking Away. However, what is going on here? His performance feels so inconsistant. At one point it's like he's doing a bad Donald Sutherland imitation on zanax. Stop the freaking mumbling! Sarah Jessica Parker was just so dessipated and mundane. She flatlined. The supporting cast's work which at times was favorably noteworthy, could not balance out Mr. Quaid and Ms. Parker's downward spiral. At times the script offered a little something something, but for the most part this poorly metered, badly directed movie was numbing. There was nothing redeeming to be found in the set designs, hair styles, lighting, interiors... no where to run! It all just contributed to the uncomfortable fragmented muddy design of this boring production."},{"rating":"2","title":"educational","review":"love this movie for its educational value as any other work of Ellen Page's.

Sarah Jessica Parker is not credible as the high-heeled E.R. doctor who has time to casually chat up her patients and give injections that are usually delegated to nurses. Ellen Page reprises the implausibly wisecracking character in \\"Juno,\\" sans the teen pregnancy. Thomas Hayden Church delivers his flat catatonic lines as though he is on anti-depressants. (I wish I had some before inserting this DVD...)Add in a creepy semi-incestuous romantic relationship between the desiccated uncle and a teenaged niece and you have a recipe for a real stinkeroo.To buy into this movie, you not only have to suspend your disbelief, you have to suspend your intelligence.I had high hopes for the movie and had read the positive reviews but would recommend you pass on this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY would anyone make this film?","review":"\\"Smart People\\" is a film you watch,and have no idea WHY?I've been a fan of everyone in the movie,and there all great,but WHY would you make a movie like this?You have no idea Why these charaters are interested in each other.No wonder they released \\"Smart People\\" after Ellen Page's huge hit \\"Juno.\\" That's the only SMART thing they did."},{"rating":"1","title":"dumber by the minute","review":"I felt really dumb watching this.

I agonized over format and decided to go with 8mm over a digital product. My reason for this decision was cost, and the reality that the only thing this would be used for is casual taping.So far the camera works perfectly. The battery system is very good and does not suffer from the memory problem that nickel-cadmium batters have. It charges quickly and lasts for quite a long time if you use the flip out screen conservatively. The night vision system is really cool and works via an infrared beam. You can record in total darkness and make your oun BLAIR WITCH PROJECT! I have not experimented with all the features offered but will slowly explore these over time.

First of all, there is no information about how to put the keyboard on or take it off (even though it SHOULD be self-explanatory). I tried to put it on first without the black protector that comes with the iPAQ, but it was a very loose fit. So I put it on with the case, and it fit perfectly. The only problem is, I can't get the keyboard off now. The release button grabbed onto my iPAQ, but won't RELEASE! I can't sync-up to my computer anymore, or put it in ANY case because the keyboard is too thick.When I called iConcepts tech support, I was told to press the release button.

I absoluletly love her first two books. Family Style is grasping to fill pages with basic recipes such as mashed potatoes, herbal ice tea, apple pie, scambled eggs and mac and cheese. The book is lacking the stlyishness and finesse her first two books offered. The recipes in her first two books are creative and inspire you to be resourceful in your entertaining! It appears this book was frantically pulled together before the holiday spending frenzy just to make a few bucks or perhaps the success of her first two books and recent TV show has gone to Ina's head making her think we will rush to purchase her third book regardless of it's lackluster content. I wish I had not purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like her first book","review":"I love The Barefoot Contessa's first cookbook, and Ina Garten's second book Parties is nice as well. This third book is most disappointing. The recipes are so simple, and who needs a recipe for French toast? and a whole section on kid's recipes.

The actually recipes in this book are side dish heavy.The best thing about this book is the text. Thouroughly enjoyed reading Ina's thoughts on cooking for friends and family. Her thoughtfullness and the joy she obviously feels from preparing flavorful dishes and her presentation are what makes her my favorite cook!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Basic Cookbook","review":"Though it doesn't explicitly say so, this is a companion book to her cooking show, with all the recipes from the series appearing in these pages.

Probably an excellent gift for housewarming or for kids moving into their first real apartment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy- but that's the point","review":"For all you complainers out there who claim this book is too 'easy' and not 'gourmet', THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT!!!!! The cover even says 'Easy ideas and recipes to make everyone feel like family.' To me that indicates that there will not be difficult and challenging food that guests can't even pronounce the name. It's the kind of book that you can depend on when friends and family come over to always be good. It's comfort food and food that you're familiar with while kicking it up a notch. And it's very good comfort food. My father loves the Orange Pound Cake, which can then be turned into a Raspberry Orange Trifle. My mom says the Sagaponack Corn Pudding is better than her own, and my brother can't get enough of the raspberry cheesecake. The Tequila Lime Chicken was enjoyed by everyone. I can't wait to try more recipes for this book.

I would rather recommend a latest find on the shelf that came out recently Catherine's Kitchen ISBN 1420832123. It contains great appetizers and a fantastic mexican soup that is to die for, it also have a couple of anekdots that are very entertaining to read.

The apple pie, home fries, linguine with shrimp, jam thumbprints...all ranged from average to good, but none yielded picture-perfect results that I expect from a perfectionist like Ina. The last recipe I tried was a major disaster--the home fries. I followed the instructions exactly, and the potatoes never browned--cooking them at a low temp (as instructed) just wouldn't work. Perhaps her quantities are off (maybe less potatoes would keep the pan temp hotter)? I'm very, very disappointed when I follow a recipe EXACTLY and the results are so far off. One or two failures, I could take. More than that...I'm done with Ina."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty Recipes","review":"I like this cookbook just as much as her other two, probably because I enjoy serving comfort food for company.

I watched the TV version of Leg of Lamb, and saw the picture in the book. Recipe calls for an 8 lb boneless Leg of Lamb, but the picture shows a Leg of Lamb with the bone it it! Such a Leg of Lamb would be HUGE! I saw one. Wouldn't even fit in a large pan. After shopping around to one butcher after another, and finding the only Leg of Lamb with a bone in that would fit in a pan to be between 3-4 lbs, I gave up and bought a large one with no bone. It was OK, but not as tender as I would have liked.It bugs me when the recipe isn't the same as the presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten Thumbs up!","review":"Ina is the only Chef that can write or talk to an novice and guide them into becoming a professional like herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply delicious","review":"My mother gave me this cookbook for Christmas and it has been the only one I've used since.

If not, a reader of her earlier offerings could just duplicate the instructions for her roasted carrots (first book) or roasted cherry tomatoes (second book). I own the thing now, but don't see myself turning to it half as much as I do the other two. Could it be that the Barefoot Contessa is played out and has nothing new to offer?

There is just nothing in here that I have any desire to make (or that I don't already have a million good recipes for).Also, a stylistic thing that drives me nuts: nearly every single recipe in all her cookbooks is attributed to \\"My dear friend [so-and-so]\\" -- OK, we get it, Ina, everyone loves you -- and her constant chirping of \\"How easy is that?\\" starts to grate after a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Cookbook","review":"This is my go to cookbook when I am looking for something I know will turn out perfect every time.

Although they do have a fine R&B routine and are very whimsical vocalists, it just seems less polished as the crooning in the \\"if i didn't care\\" era.

The case is very good with metal clasps that are durable, however the built-in storage area inside the case never stays closed so every time I open the case I have to stuff the spare blades back in and close the storage cover. I have had some problems with this saw that include the quick blade change mechanism, it would not release the blade easily and would not tighten all the time. I had to return it and get a new one, I bought it at Lowes so it was easy to return for a new one.

The black knob on the handle that tightens the blade is a joke because it pops off all the time and is poorly designed. Recently the trigger only intermittently worked and the variable speed feature stopped working which made cutting metal a nightmare. I've been a long time user of Bosch tools and I expected much more from them. To be fair I've never had a problem with any of my other Bosch tools. Maybe I should have paid for the higher end model.

Perhaps went through 20 blade changes. One would expect a thousand more before this tool goes to lala land, but that's not the case. The tool is now rendered useless because the mechanism for blade changes has gone caput. I am past warranty as far as bringing it back for replacement or refund. The other choice is repair which isn't worth the hassle from my perspective. In my opinion this tool will not stand the test of time. This is a twenty dollar tool if the blade mechanism is flawed. {{I suspect it is}}.I don't want to disparage anyone from buying Bosch, just this particular model.

Surely there is a more user- friendly option available!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for graduate students","review":"This is a good advanced book in econometrics. I would definitely not recommend it to undergrad students unless they are really comfortable with matrix algebra and statistics. It is not an introductory book, but, if the reader has already taken some econometrics courses and needs a more advanced text, this book is very useful, especially for graduate students. It is particularly good at explaining concepts in a way that slightly easier books do not.

I would only suggest using another book for understanding time series since Greene's coverage on that is not great."},{"rating":"1","title":"No unified framework","review":"This is an okay book, but certainly not all too clear. The authors do not distinguish between the important and the not so important topics. The order of the chapters is not well chosen and summaries of the most important results are missing.

I strongly recommend it. As an economist, researcher, and consultant, I find myself constantly referring to it. Gives you the softest landing on the harder technical literature in professional journals. Well organized, with logical notation, lots of well-chosen examples, and succinct explanations.

If like me, you've never played any of the GTA games because you own a Gamecube instead of a PS2, they buy this game TODAY.

Your can command such lovable characters as Apu, Lisa, Homer, and Bart; also that rude fat guy from the comic store. The story has no true path, which as we all no is what makes the show great. The game has many side tracks like racing for the DMV with Patty and Selma. The game is not very difficult so less serious gamers can enjoy it but, it is still entertaining for the expert players. I would recommend this game as a must buy to faithful Simpson followers and definitly worth renting if not buying even if you have no clue who Apu is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simpsons Hit and Run Review","review":"Simpsons Hit and Run was a game like no other. It took place in Springfield and was based off The Simpson cartoon. The game had seven levels having five characters to play as. You could play as lovable Homer, rebellious Bart, intelligent and caring Lisa, overprotective mother Marge, and Apu the owner of the Kwik-E-Mart. The game was very similar to Grand Theft Auto, although had no guns. Instead the missions usually were all about using cars. There are types of car missions. The types are chasing after a certain car, avoiding a character or car, destroying a car, and collecting certain items. These missions take the character to different sections of the level. Also there are races and bonus missions. The game also has a Hit and Run meter when filled up completely, has the police of the game hunt after your character. The dialogue is also very funny. Simpsons Hit and Run was the best Simpsons game, and one of the best games I ever played."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly Simpsons Fun","review":"This game is the Simpsons.

Being very brief, the game is fun and allows for a lot of entertaining play. Don't buy this game for multiplayer mode though."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last, a good simpsons game","review":"This is the first Simpsons game that is any good. It's very amusing with a lot of Simpsons related humor involved. The graphics are excellent 3D renditions of the 2D versions.Springfield town looks fabulous and driving through, knocking over people is excellent (but harmless) fun. Characters fall in ragdoll style and shout insults. Too much mayhem results in a police chase.The game is based around a series of GTA style missions. These are varied, reasonably challenging but not too difficult and fun. There are plenty of hidden elements and the replay value is very high.When figuring out the controls I was stood in front of an old ladie (I think it was Principal Skinner's mother). I pressed the red button only to hear Homer shout 'take that' and kick her hard enough for her to collapse on the floor. It was so funny. I proceeded to go and find flanders and kick him up and down the street.Contains all of your favorite characters.

In its roundabout way, it's education through entertainment. As a parent you just hope the education sticks long after the entertainment has stopped.This game is fun for my young ones. The object is to stop a thief based on the description of the bystanders. You not only deduce the description of the criminal but also the country that is currently housing the thief's next target.This can be fun for the whole family. I play with my children (ages 8-10) in order to assist them in finding the geographic location.

As you know you are waiting too go to deathrow when all of a sudden something strange happens...this is where you come in. this game has a really creepy feeling too it, like when your outside the prison and its pitch black then suddenly your surrounded by ghosts. this game in my opinion deserves five stars because of the way its atmosphere is, like for one as i mentioned above outside of the prison. i bought this game when it came out and am very pleased with it, midway has pulled of yet another outstanding game."},{"rating":"2","title":"best horror game made","review":"i loved this game! the grafics were great also, and it was very frightening. iam definately gunna buy the 2nd 1!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay Game.","review":"My favorite genre of games are survival horror. This game isn't as good as Silent Hill three. Plus it won't sell good because many parents won't let their kids buy this game. The Suffering is also scary, but not like Silent Hill 3. The graphics aren't great and it's too gory. Their is a lot of pointless gore. They tried to make it like a Grand Theft Auto with more Gore. If you want a better game check out Fatal Frame 2 or Silent Hill 3. These are better games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Game","review":"This game is awesome. Don't listen to the Rez Evil/Silent Hill 2 fans. This game evolves the survival horror genre. MAtter of fact it isn't even survival horror its action horror.The controls are awesome, pretty much exactly like Halo. I really like the fact you can go into 1st person if you want.The graphics are good but its the sense of environment that really works in this game. THe story seems really cool to.The main character is really tough and animates really well.The creatue design is awesome. I heard something about the guy from Terminator designing the creatures. I dont know who designed them but they were sick in the head.Overall this is going to be a GREAT game. Solid action, good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way to go Midway!","review":"The suffering is by the best game Ive played in 2004 so far.When I first read bout it I just knew I needed to have it.When sliped the cd in my ps2 I kina had doublt BUT I WAS WRONGThis game is awsome. The story is great and the game is just flat out fun! There is so much gore in this game that the main character is covered in it! The language is too much that its ridiculus but that didnt bother me.The graphics are simply awsome. The best gun is the dual revolvers. This game truly makes Resident evil zero and silent hill 3 look like a bunch of kiddie games made from disney........Ok maybe not but This game rocks! The fun factor is very HIGH and you wont be dissapointed. Trust me.Midway Did a great job making this game.......This game should definily beat True crimes for action game of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Suffering ROCKS!!!!","review":"This is one of the best PS2 games I have ever played.

Especially if you are interested in Turbo system. But, sorry no dice. This book will come without the front cover it shows. To start off things, It will come with a Ford Mustang. Inside the information is not bad, but when you are going to look for specific information about Chevy engines it will give you Ford, Honda, Mazda (piston engine). It is a little deseving.

It's wonderful being able to offer our guests something that will nourish and not harm them.The size is not really an issue, as it's easy to carry and does not need refilling that frequently..Between my husband and I, and refills for our cat, we need to refill about every 7-10 days.The peace of mind alone is definitely worth the money to buy this.

I was pleased to find a BPA bottle and while $20 seemed high, I didn't mind when I thought that I was getting a high-quality long lasting item. I was hoping to store the bottles on their sides, but that didn't work because the caps weren't water tight no matter how hard I screwed them on. We're pretty gentle on the bottles so I haven't had a chance to test their stength, but this week, my grocery cart was bumped and a filled bottle rolled out of the space under the cart. It only dropped a few inches, and not at high speed, but the bottle shattered spilling water all over the grocery store. I contacted Blue wave and they told me to work with amazon, but amazon's return policy isn't helpful either. Disappointed.Update: a few weeks later, another bottle broke when it tipped over.

I was going to order another since it was my fault that it was damaged but realized there were several reviews about it cracking at the seams and not being very sturdy.

The trilogy begins with the Battle of Hastings (invasion of England in 1066 by William the conqueror) and its immediate causes, but I was expecting a closer look into the previous origins of Normans. While it was not new for me, the second part dedicated to the Normans in southern Italy is quite interesting. Finally, I would say the few words about Richard the lion heart were a bit surprising to me (part 3). Overall then, I would recommend this documentary set as it is well done, with nice photography and entertaining narrative. While no subtitles are provided, the narrative and interviews are spoken in very clear English.

Anyway, I finally received my hard case today. I believe it will solve the button/battery problem; however, there is definitely a problem with the flimsy metal tabs that are supposed to \\"make it secure in place.\\" After fiddling with the things to try to get them to hold my Clie even relatively securely, one of the tabs has already broken off.

Poorly designed.","review":"I guess I should have known this product was worthless when I saw the pricing disparity between it and the well-known Rhino Skin case (which I can't review because I've never owned one). The Sony won't stay in place in the case and it's hard to open. Also, very difficult to get to the stylus. I purchased this because on my Sony Peg S-320, the cover constantly came off. Now the factory flip cover locks on and seems more secure. I still would prefer a hard case because I am always concerned about it getting scratched in my bookbag. Bottom line, under no certain circumstances should you purchase this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me","review":"I was a little wary ordering this item, based on some of the negative reviews here. However, the Palm Vx I've been using for the past five years had a hard case, and I've become accustomed to this level of protection. I haven't done extensive field testing yet, having just started using my Clié and this hard case. However, it seems to fit great and the styling complements the Clié. I suppose if, as some of the other reviewers have, you plan to use this cover to drop your Clié from tall buildings, you might be disappointed. However, if you want to spend less than [Amazon edited price here] to replace the flimsy cover included with the Clié, you'll be pleasantly surprised"},{"rating":"1","title":"Contradictory!","review":"My girlfriend and I got this book after she recently became pregnant. We're going through the food section and getting ready for our first trip to the grocery store for pregnancy food. And we're running into all these contradictory statements... for instance, one page says swordfish is a high risk fish for mercury and it should be avoided, and two pages later there's a box that includes swordfish as being a good thing to get.

And Chandler isn't a very good writer.Can I have my money back please?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty too","review":"I enjoyed the earthy, impudent and skeptical tone of the narrator-detective, and found the first novel great at conjuring up the atmosphere of Berlin in the early Nazi years, but was disturbed by the vicious homophobia in the second novel, THE PALE CRIMINAL, which plays in part in the gay subculture. While the hero objects to Nazi anti-semitic policies and stresses the need for moral backbone, he apparently fully ENDORSES --without irony-- the Nazis' persecution of homosexuals. The novel is filled with invective against gays, and the protagonist not only endorses sending homosexuals to concentration camps, but enjoys (!) shooting them \\"between the eyes\\" himself. I'm frankly surprised that of all the people writing here, nobody has even noticed these hateful diatribes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historically informative","review":"I found these stories interesting with respect to the the conditions described in pre-WWII and post- WWII Berlin if the author was writing from extensive research into that era. The mysteries solved were not the typical mystery thrillers, but I looked forward to following the main character in each of the next novels. Reading this trilogy also made me think about just how fortunate I am to be living in 2012 and in this country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular","review":"I've never come across anyting quite like this one.

I agree with other review regarding the apparent maturation of Kerr through the three works.Thought last novella set in Vienna was the most developed with insight on German / Austrian differences as well as postwar Germany occupation."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just historical detective fiction","review":"Most of the time Berlin Noir is a fascinating well-plotted mystery set in a finely drawn 1930's Berlin. There is fascinating historical detail in the descriptions of the institutions, psychology and officials of the Third Reich and Berlin. There is plenty of tough guy banter and detective fiction similes, but sometimes, especially at the end of \\"The Pale Criminal,\\" Kerr's writing transcends the genre and modern fiction as a whole to describe the aching and anxiety of the historical moment. The three stories describe the passage of a sane and decent man through the mad evil of Nazi Germany and into the post-war rubble of occupied Germany."},{"rating":"2","title":"great reading","review":"very interesting detective and setting.

The minute and a half with Eckstine is wonderful, but the rest of the film is embarrassingly bad. The swimming numbers and lousy songs were low budget, the \\"training camp\\" Wave scenes were ridiculous, the acting...well, let's just say that Barry Sullivan was miscast and Vivian Blaine had already done all that in \\"Guys and Dolls.\\" Oh yes, and you have to see Keefe Brasselle trying to sing!

While the author has created an interesting world, only glimpses of the world are shown, as the main character simply has event after event happen to her. It read like a series of short stories that were written about a character in different points of the character's life, then strung together the day before deadline.There wasn't much of an ending, which isn't a surprise since there wasn't much of a middle either.

This is the most lonesome story I ever read.I have always wanted to go into space. Just to visit a space station would be sufficient, but the idea of exploring new worlds and new civilizations is my wildest dream for my children. Now I read a book that points out the lonesomeness of being in space -- a long way from home, forgot and forgotten, lost in more ways than I can imagine. Jan/Janna has even lost her personal identity. That she lived and had any sense of social responsibility at all was interesting.I loved the ending. How else could the book end but with words of hope and promise? The last 3 pages were worth the wait. Lyrical, beautiful, sad, and lonesome.

I kept waiting for something to exciting to happen, nothing ever did.Don't waste your time on this book - I'm sorry I did. Read CMZ(5*) or HTDIN(4*) instead. Those books were MUCH more interesting and engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good self help book!","review":"I would recommend this self help book to anyone struggling with low self esteem.

A quick read, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Before you get this you may want to know....","review":"This may be a great book for some, but not for me. Wish I would have know before I got it that it is a Christian based book.

I am sending this book back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"As a pastor of a small church and only experiencing two parent families, I found this book very helpful in appreciating the unique challenges facing stepfamilies.

Wonderful group study book.","review":"I lead a stepfamily Christian study group. We are using The Smart Stepfamily as a study guide for the group. Everyone is getting a lot out of the book. Mr. Deal really seems to understand the true needs of the stepfamily.If you take Mr. Deal's advice seriously, you and your stepfamily will be changed for the better. His 7 steps are amazing. All 7 steps are very Biblical and all are essential. They are presented clearly and logically.I highly recommend the associated overview DVD \\"7 Steps to Stepfamily Success\\" which is presented in lecture format by Ron Deal. It quickly discusses each of the 7 steps in the book.If you are in a stepfamily and are Christian, you need this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Preachy","review":"I am a recently-minted step parent who needed to work out some issues with my stepdaughters. I started looking for books on the subject and read an excerpt from this book on a blog, so I ordered it. I was not prepared for the overly religious tone of the text. Yes, we do go to church each Sunday. But religion is not the overriding factor in our life, as Deal would want it to be for our family. Therefore, I haven't read any further than the first couple of chapters in the book. This would be a good book otherwise, but Deal needs to tone down the Christian angle a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed Alliances","review":"This is a comic book. Unfortunately I did not discover this until after I had placed my order, for this product but thought \\"Hey it's still SoSS of it's bound to be good right?\\"Wrong. Or rather, it was OK but nothing more than that. The drawings are good, but the story is nowhere to be found. If this work is designed to draw readers into the series, I fear it has failed. Not only does it offer HUGE spoilers but it fails to bring out the most basic intrigues and plots that make the series great. Words cannot express my extreme dissapointment when I read a $12.00 comic book that offered me nothing that I hadn't alreadr read in the novels.If you like pretty pictures this product is for you.To the rest of the SoSS fans, skip it. And to you who haven't read SoSS, go pick up a copy of Hidden Empire today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Comic Book","review":"I recently read all seven novels of the Saga of Seven Suns and came across this title thinking it was a prequel to the original stories. I was surprised to receive a comic book! A very quick read, and nothing new learnt about the main story line. Buy it for completeness of the collection, but don't expect an interesting or riveting reading experience.

Having lived in South Carolina previously, it was easy to recall the environment and customs of the \\"low country\\" and its inhabitants. The romance between the embittered Beau and the well-intentioned Rachel is wonderfully steamy and sweet. Would be really great if this book were reissued so many others can enjoy such a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious - Hits a little close to home","review":"I received a copy as a gift and did not know what to think. After reading a few stories, I found myself laughing out loud. Literally laughing out loud! My wife read it as well and had the same reaction. The stories are hilarious and you know that they are true as I don't believe anyone could be that creative. Frankly, a few of the stories hit a little bit too close to home. I highly recommend the book, it's a quick read and will most definately put a smile on your face!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The shoes are pretty but are not confortable","review":"The shoes are very pretty however the leather is very hard.

Road rage was funny how bad it was but this game improves on that game 100 times over. You can get in and out of cars, explore the city on foot, have races, do missions at your lesiur, buy cars, and a whole list of other things. The storyline is decent, and the voices actually sound like the real simpsons charecters..But this game also has some of the flaws of road rage. Sure, some of the lines are funny the first 2-3 times you hear it, but when you get to a difficult mission and have to hear the same line 30 or 40 times, it gets very lame and annoying. Also, this game IS teen, and the asking people for rides and no guns at all is kind of lame, they could of worked that in there. There could also be a couple more building you can enter and a better storyline. Based on this i give this game 4 stars, leaving 1 for another Simpsons game that improves on some of these things."},{"rating":"2","title":"hit & run, hit & win!!!!!!!!!","review":"A fab game this is.

This game is appropriate for kids and is really a must have for 'Obsessive Simpsons Fans'.THE GREAT:-All the voices are done by the Simpsons cast, and you can find almost all the main and 'B' characters. Gil, Captain McCallister, Bumblebee Man, Comic Book Guy, Snake, Hans Moleman, Jasper, Cleatus, Frink..-The dialogue is really really funny.-The game is very open ended and has hours of game play.-The town of Springfield seems like the actual town.THE NOT GREAT:-Made by Vivendi.. see Spyro Enter the Dragonfly.-Camera can get stuck. I mean absolutely stuck without view of your charachter.-Almost all of the gameplay is a 'timed mission' game. This can get old and frustrating.BOTTOM LINE:If you are a PS2 jockey & a Simpsons fanatic you will not be able to stop playing this game.Cannot hold a candle to Ratchet & Clank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetition.. repetition...","review":"Simpsons Hit & Run deserves kudos for its great graphics, sound and resemblance to the tv-series. It's fun in the beginning.After playing for a while though, the repetitive nature of the game becomes evident. For example, you have just one minute and thirty seconds to get somewhere, and you have to race like heck. It is funny in the beginning, but then it gets frustrating. About every second task is a race against the time, and the time is really really pushed. It gets so frustrating to race, race and race against time.. even for the most stupid objectives, that it becomes a truly frustrating game. With such great graphics, why not vary some more?I'm dead tired of timed races and to have to start over and over again for being a second or two too late.Go watch another Simpsons episode over again instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Mighty Homer","review":"GTA style...U'll have endless fun watching Homer rampaging and saying funny catchy remarks.

That's what I thought until I spent several days playing the exact same three missions over and over.....and over again. Every single missions is either one of three things: racing someone, hiting something with your car, or getting somewhere by a certain time. The fact that its set in Springfield is its only saving grace, as gameplay is marginal at best. This is a rental if I've ever seen one.....don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's not that great","review":"this game can be described in one word. mediocre the graphics are poor and since when is the family car a convertible? missions are tedious and arn't even fun. if you get the police on you there's no running all they do is ticket you if they get within 20 yards...Rent dont buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Simpson game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This game really rocks.Its like road Rage but you can walk steal cars.You can be Homer,Lisa,Marge,Bart and Apu.You Do missions for people venture around town see people from the show.The last car you drived becomes your when you load up its in the driveway.You gotta try this game for real.Its the best simpson game ever.Its almost a jack off Gran theif auto but its still good."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has it's moments (I mean MOMENT....singular)","review":"The ONLY thing I liked about this game was that you could beat up little kids, which is fun, admit it. I was dissapointed, being a huge fan of the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"After a Few Hits You'll Want to Run","review":"This game is not worth anything. I played this game and it was okay for about 3 missions. Then it got extremely dull. The missions became repetitive and didn't make sense. The driving in this game is lame, along with graphics. If you want a real racing game get Need for Speed Most Wanted. If you liked Destroy All Humans then you might like this game. I didn't like Destroy All Humans, which also got repetitive with missions. Also if you fail a mission, you have to go back and redo the entire mission over again, which is really annoying. Watch some gameplay on Youtube before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit & Run","review":"I'm a huge Simpsons fan, so I was excited about playing Hit & Run. In the game you can either play as Homer, Bart, Lisa, Marge, or Apu. You get to go on missions driving different vehicles across Springfield, in which you get to crash into buildings and run over characters. The graphics are great, but once you have played one mission, you have played them all. The game gets boring quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simp Hit n run","review":"I think hit n run is amazing and but reasonably difficult.

Even a couple of the timed missions(like the meat(mission 5) and monkey one(6) on level 2)there isn't enough time to complete. This game is a Headache in more ways than one. Too hard for kids and a tad challenging even for adults.

Solace and Logan, what a pair of mixed up, brave confused young adults, living in the harsh medieval world, where relatives were vengeful and self-serving, but friends were loyal. I also loved the very light mystical thread throughout the story with the Falcon. In this medieval period some writers have gone for \`shock value' with graphic details on warfare, sex, misery and the cruelty, however I believe Laurel O'Donnell got the balance right, because as I was reading this novel I was \`booing' the bad ones and \`cheering' on the goodies.

It has been over mastered. Many of the songs have limited dynamic range due to over compression evidently in the pursuit of getting maximum level.

Several memorable tracks include \\"Only Time\\" \\"New Classicism\\" \\"Alabruham\\" and \\"Clocks\\" (the rendition on the Coldplay song) The traditional chinese instruments give a very exotic, almost haunting air to the slow tempo songs, and adds a bit of whimsy to the up tempo ones. The Bonus DVD as well is a good extra as you watch the women play live in a concert from Japan. Seeing their expressions as they play their songs shows how passionate they are to their music.This is definatly a CD worth buying.Oh and I messed up with the stars, this is DEFINATLY worth FIVE STARS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!!","review":"I have never heard of such a thing.

The subtle hints that are imbedded throughout Mageborn Traitor and Ruins of Ambrai are entertaining and attention grabbing. I personally liked the fact that women are dominant over men on Lenfell, and it shows a lot of creative ingenuity. The only thing that I found a slight problem with is that one of the three most popular characters, Collan, was killed off. I sincerely hope that in the Captal's Tower his story will be revealed.

If you like fantasy and especially mage-lore it is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apologies - but it's still predictable","review":"Melanie Rawn created a a winning formula many years ago and adhears to it. Her characters from \\"The Dragon Prince\\" series could interchange seamlessly with her characters from \\"Exiles.\\" I don't wish to cause offense but that is my honest opinion.As a personal aside I would like to defend my intelligence. With an Honours degree in English Literature, and a recently completed Masters degree in Critical Literary Theory, when it comes to good literature.....I know my stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rawn misses out","review":"I have to admit, Rawn is one of my all time favorite authors but like so many other fans, I'm sick of waiting for the end of the trilogy. She has written other stories since book two of Exiles but I haven't bought any of them. She's a great writer,no doubt but Exiles has been left hanging far too long. Robert Jordan has put out numerous additional titles in his series while we have all been waiting for the last of the Exiles trilogy. To be honest, I've lost interest in Rawn as a writer. I have all of the Dragon Prince books in hardcover and will enjoy reading them over and over again but I'm sorely tempted to just toss the Exiles books as there seems to be no conclusion to the storyline. I'm giving the \\"duology\\" a rating of one star due to the lack of interest from the author in completing the story. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this \\"trilogy\\" until after the third book, if ever, is published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is the next one?","review":"I read this years ago and revisit it from time to time, aching for the next in the series. The twists in the book (like many of her others) kept the excitement up and I loved the matriarchal society and yes- the killing off of key characters kept the book realistic. There's enough heartache here for any good soap opera. Thank you Melanie Rawn, but where is the conclusion?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mageborn, Rawn? Indeed","review":"One of the best works published by Melaine Rawn yet, she combines confusion, intrigue, mystery and chaos suberbly well into one book. The plot will lead readers onto false convictions, assumptions, backed by a feeling of mystery. One of the best books of the century, a must buy for all people of all interests!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Rawn follows through again","review":"Mageborn Traitor picks up where Ruins leaves off. The main characters are more mature, and thier children are growing up. Life seems to have settled down a bit on Lenfell after the Rising. Glenin continues in her plot as the evil eldest sister in her passion for weaving for Chevasto. Cailet has grown into her position, and but her insecurities are played on by Glenin. Sarra has become so entwined in politics that she neglects her family. The climax of the story left me sobbing, and the ending made me wish it were October already. I can't wait to read The Captal's Tower, there is so much more left to this saga.Both books in this trilogy are awesome, almost overpowering in thier imagery. The world that is Lenfell is masterfully worked, and portrayed. A great read for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think that Melanie Rawn writes the best fantasy books.","review":"I think that Melanie Rawn should write a lot more books. I loved her first Exiles book and am hoping to get the next one very soon. Her books, to the reader, are not really fantasy once you start reading. They become real in your mind. I actually felt like I was in the book watching the characters. Also, her books are funny. Melanie Rawn's books are so good that I think everyone should be required to read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, I liked it","review":"While I agree that these books may not appeal to all audiences....I for one quite enjoyed them, so much so that I have read them both (Ruins of Ambrai and Mageborn Traitor) 3 times while awaiting the next one. I can't wait for The Captal's Tower (hint hint Miss Rawn :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"ARGH!!!!","review":"What can I say?

WITH A FANTASTIC STORYLINE CONTINUED ON FROM THE FIRST VOLUME, \\"EXILES\\", THIS SEQUEL TIES NEW PLOTS WITH OLD. AS A BOOK REVEIWER FOR SAN BERNARDINO SCHOOL DISTRICTS, I WOULD APPROVE THIS BOOK TO ANY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT INTERESTED IN FANTASY/FICTION. EXCELLENT AND RIVITING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant Book","review":"I loved this book a lot. It took me into a world so unlike our own but is very believable. The ongoing war between the Mage Guardians and the Malerissi is terrible but it shows the usual battle of good against evil. I found myself almost becomming one with the charactors and part of their world. I felt terrible when collan died in the end but I am just bursting to know who he really is the clues aren't enough. I can't wait to read the next book. I think that it is cruel and unusual punishment to write another book in between. I noticed that some of the reviews say hard back edition, is there something different about it or not. If you know please e-mail me or if you put the clues about Collan together. (stbailey@gateway.net)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mageborn Traitor (Exiles, Vol 2)","review":"I enjoyed reading the book up until I realized that the most colorful person, and my favorite person in both books was killed off. It was like watching the young female doctor on ER killed off, and I stopped watching that too. The only reason I can see for killing this person off was because he was a very strong male person, and Ms. Rawn doesn't like strong males lasting too long. Because of this, I don't care when the next book comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"SCRATCHES your CDs","review":"This player has excellent bass and sound quality, won't skip and will run on batteries reasonably long; which is a shame because it just might scratch your CDs. After owning it for 6 months, the player started abruptly stopping (and shutting down) in the middle of tracks. The lens also began to make circular scratches on the CDs it played - very irritating indeed (this is usually the sign of a very cheaply make CD player). I never rocked it around or dropped it, or did anything that would cause this - it just started happening on its own. Now I have to replace it AND one of the music CDs that got quite a bit of playtime, and you can bet I'll not go with Philips again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Philips Blue CD Portable","review":"I bought this player to replace my Sony portable that stopped working only a while after I bought it. ESP has come a long way since then. This player sports the 3rd generation of skip protection which is a whole lot more effective then in the past. It's not quite to the point where you can run with it(it can handle walking) but it will definitely take all the bumps in your car w/o skipping. It has nice features like resume,cdrw, and has a nice sleek blue design. The headphones are decent and seem to fit better when worn upside-down. It also plays all CD-R's perfectly. Sound is also real good, nothing to complain about(volume may not be enough for noisy situations). For this price this was the coolest and most functional player I could find. I only wish it had a lit up display for evening car trips but those usually come in the top of the line players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear sound, looks awesome, and the skip protection is great","review":"This is a great CD player. The sound is so clear and sounds awesome. It is almost IMPOSSIBLE to make this baby skip! You look good carrying this thing too! The bass boost is nice also. Comfortable headphones with nice sound too. I definately recommend you buy this player. Its a great price to top it all off! GET IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good buy.","review":"I bought this CD player and I have been pleased with it. It is nearly impossible to make the thing skip. The only problem was with the quality of the headphones included. They produce a less than quality sound and are bulky. I found it in my best interest to purchase a set of Sony headphones. The battery life is more than standard. I think I read about some feature that will charge rechargeable batteries if the ac adapter is in use a bonus. Overall I recommend the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"black rat","review":"I liked this movie, it was something different. the rat mask was a good story line and made the movie interesting, i thought it would have been more violent. worth watching if you like japanese movies,but still not for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Easily Consumed This Book!","review":"This book is an emotional true story about a junior rabbi who is torn between the love for his mentor, the senior rabbi in his synagogue, and the horror that his mentor inflicts, not just on his own family, but on an entire congregation. This junior rabbi is thrust into the flames that the horror ignites. And The Flames Did Not Consume Us is the story of the journey that a rabbi takes his congregation and himself on in order to regain spiritual peace in the sanctuary of their synagogue. It is a journey undertaken in the face of insensitive lawyers and the media. It is a journey that will usurp the young rabbi's life. This story is rivetting. It is a book that you just can't put down as you, too, are taken through the horrors. You, too, are taken through a journey to a most powerful message. At the end of this book you just can't help from saying, \\"WOW!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses its mark","review":"This could be a valuable book, but its worth is diminished by a fairly large number of mistakes. Buildings are mis-identified. Some photos of Wright's decorative features are printed upside down. Other photos are backwards. Several of the aerial views are dramatic, but others seem to be space fillers. One in particular of Forest Avenue in Oak Park shows no details of the homes except for the roofs. With a bit more care in the choice of prints, the photos could have a far greater impact on the reader's understanding of Wright's design genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thats the stuff","review":"Dance Dance Dance.

Wow, what a huge disappointment when my 1 year old computer couldn't play it due to graphics card issues - it doesn't run on GeForce 4 cards. Not to be beaten, I tried to upgrade my graphics card for another $100. Did you know that you can't upgrade Dell graphics cards? Well, I couldn't. So I waited six months and finally broke down and bought a brand new computer with an ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 graphics card. Well, it's still no good. Now the graphics card is too fast!

The product delivers as promised--looks great on a desk or chest of drawers and works quietly.A note about the settings: if you normalize the settings for a 24-hour period, you'll find that the 33 sec./10 min./30 min./1 hr. settings translate into 60, 160, 240 and 480(!) minutes of rotation in a day, respectively, which seems counter-intuitive to me because I would've thought that more time between rotations would mean fewer overall rotations in a day.

Very good size, goods looks especially the blue color. In all the time I've had it it has never skipped. Very good sound. The car kit worked but I never needed it with a CD player already in the car. So the car kit isn't an essential component for me. The only thing I don't like is that the ear phones sometimes pull my hair but they have very good sound. I replaced them with some other ones that go on my ears. Overall it is the bomb!

It has tons of charts and is full of useful hints. The layout is logical. There are several quizzes, which I love, that help you discover which type of wedding might suit you. I would suggest this book to another bride-to-be! I only wish that it had more money-saving tips and storage pockets. There are two pockets for clippings, etc., but more would be a big help. Other than those two small things, this book is EXCELLENT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money","review":"I was disappointed with this planner.

I can't say enough good things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same as any Bride's magazine","review":"I was disappointed with Beverly Clark's wedding planner almost as soon as I started looking at it. Sure the advice is sound, but it is the same as you'll find in any copy of Modern Bride, etc. In addition, lots of the advice is uninspired, common sense, and seems kind of dated and old-fashioned. The checklists aren't great either. I was hoping for more examples and creative wedding ideas.If you're looking for ideas, I would highly recommend three sources - Weddings, by Colin Cowie, which is a creative book with a great attitude and philosophy, and a visual feast with tons of amazing photos. Also check out Bridal Bargains, by Denise and Alan Fields, which is my favorite wedding book, and 100x more useful than this planner!!

I used to be a bit of a completist myself, but I now subscribe to the quality rather than quantity theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I have really taken to the blues over the last few months and have been expanding my library. Seems from what I've heard that I'd better get a Michael Bloomfield cd. I chose this one due to it being remastered. I need the best sound qaulity as I have a expensive stereo system. I guess I picked the wrong one. The sound is not the best and I found many of the songs annoying. I only liked 3 tunes on the whole cd, one of which was instrumental. Not near as good as most of the blues cd's i have purchased. I think I'll return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the right situations","review":"Bought this light and have used it in conjunction with a Cool-Lux battery package. Very heavy.

So, my 10 year old took one look at it, declared it a 'baby's book' (because the cover and art and first pages look like it's designed for a very young child), and I couldn't get her further in it, because she prides herself on now being able to read 'big kid' (chapter type) books.

Sadly, there are no film titles. Although the film does compare the slapstick of the early century to clips from films of the late 30's, I was hoping for more car, plane, and train chases and even the Keystone Cops. The final five minutes is worth watching because of the funny quick montage set to \\"can can\\" music. Being a Laurel and Hardy fan, I was glad to see their moments, but this 1998 version lacks some of the funny sight gags set to turn-of-the century LA.I know that I've seen another VHS from before the 90's that did highlight the Keystone Cops and that they are probably fading on VHS, too expensive to buy on DVD, or in a vault somewhere. A great for young ones and the family to rent, but probably worth less to buy than the retail price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Noisy For Silent Films","review":"I was looking forward to this movie. The problem is, the sound man was deaf, so he mixed everything \\"up front\\" throughout the film. Great idea for a documentary. But at the beginning, the silent clips had a background piano which was not bad. However it also had a narrator who was mixed so far back that the music was louder than the announcer. And so it continued throughout the film...the narrator was mixed so far under the music that he was useless.I was really looking forward to this, but i had to skip through it. About fifteen minutes of that loud music mix was all I could take. Useless unless you like attempting to hear the announcer over the loud piano music.BAD, bad sound mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Dance Album","review":"Move is Yuri (vocal), Motsu (rap) and t-kimura (produce / mix).

If there is a knock on this CD its that there is not enough variety, but if you like high energy dance this will satisfy your craving! About 1/3 to 1/2 the lyrics are in English the rest are in Japanese. Not that you listen for the lyrics.

The collaboration of two of music's best story tellers and musicial artists is simply brilliant. It goes down like fine wine...smooth, earthy and very complex. Mark is an unparalleled song writer and Emmylou sounds like an angel.There is a bit of everything on this CD. Rock, Blues, Country and Folk.

Firstly it took ages to arrive and when I played it I could not believe how ordinary and depressing the sound was. As a child on wet Sundays we would struggle to find a radio station that wasn't just Songs of Praise. Inevitably it was whining Country & Weston at it's most melancholy. This album could have featured on one of those shows with Emmylou Harris doubling the whine and depression. Sorry C&W fans, there's lots of it I like, but if this album had arrive within the stipulated return period it would have been straight back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album...","review":"If you like Knopfler, you'll enjoy the trademark sounds that he creates therefore, you must buy this album. Whether or not you are familiar with Emmylou, you will want to hear the way they compliment each other. Emmylou has played with countless people along all sorts of musical genres through the years and she is very sought after as an accompanist. Personally, I am a big fan of the stuff she did with Leo Kottke in the 70's, this compares to some of the best that came out of those sessions in terms of sound and overall feeling. Knopfler is fantastic on his own, but she is a bonus feature that makes this album one that you shouldn't pass up..."},{"rating":"2","title":"All The Road Running","review":"This is a good CD!

The sound speakers were positioned along the ceiling, so where I walked the music came with me. Instead of looking for a cd to buy, I was listening to one. Emmylou and Mark are magical togeher. I like the balance of the songs selected, nothing too hard, nothing too soft. They really sound so great together and the production is spot on. I've never really listened to either of them before. If this cd was just on the racks, I would have passed it by. So glad it was playing in the store that day. This cd will grab you, that's the only way I can describe it to you. The harmonies are just beautiful. You just wait in antipiation for the harmonies to kick in on every song. Highly recommended from Down Under x Kangaroos and Koalas x"},{"rating":"1","title":"GOD how I wanted to love this record...","review":"But the truth is they both sound like they're asleep. Knopfler's now-standard Nashville sound is great...for about two cuts. Then it's just a drone. Same with EHarris, same with Knopfler, who seems barely able to finish singing the words, like he's going to faceplant at any minute. Even he's not interested, and he wrote most of the material.These two should be able to generate some serious heat, but if this is them, I don't want to know them.Interestingly, there was a PBS Soundstage presentation of a concert of this, and while I found it interesting to watch (because I like seeing how Knopfler plays) I just found it so damn mechanical, just like this record.

It has no central anything. And without going into vast detail, this hopefully one off is not worthy of, If you are a collector of all things Knopfler or Emmylou, by all means acquire it. If you like either of these artists, buy their solo albums. This one is a drowse, and I simply do not care for the songs or the playing.

I have been a Dire Straits/Mark Knopfler fan since the beginning. I always see him live whenever he passes through town, but I have to say this CD was very disappointing. The songs are slow and unmemorable and although the two voices are a nice mix, the material doesn't do them justice. The CD is lacking any of the great guitar leads that make Mark Knopfler unique.

One critic mentioned that the CD had no particularly outstanding tracks. Well, no one song jumped out in my face. If I want \\"in my face\\" music, I've got everything Metallica for that. Actually, I'm sure that was a simple referral to having no single song standing out as better than all the others. That's okay with me. This is a very good, sweet and consistent set of music featuring two excellent singers. I noticed that \\"Rollin' On\\" reminded me of Emmylou's \\"All My Tears\\" on her Wrecking Ball album. Of course, Mark's unique guitar work bore strong resemblance to his Dire Straits days (I have all that, too).

Admittedly I'm a huge Knopfler fan, but this pairing with Emmylou Harris is perfect--the songs speak to us while they sing to each other.I'd fly anywhere to hear them live (& I tried to but weather delays canceled our flight to NYC from Cleveland--just one night in NYC would have been worth it)--the musical styles are all American--country, pop, rock, and more...This music is for those listeners who want to hear significant meaning in some lyrics, while really enjoying the humor in others.

I own 1000s of CDs including a couple with Emmylou and many with Mark.I really enjoyed the continuity between the artists, each lending their own sound to enhance the final product. Is there some country? Uh huh. Does it rock? Uh, uh. Am I glad to own it? YOU BET!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blended Beautifully","review":"Two seasoned voices that blend superbly. This live production is very clean acoustically. The videography is straight forward and leaves the purity of Knopfler and Harris' songs to stand on their own. The age in their voices is sometimes noticable but only adds to the poignancy of several songs such as \\"If This Is Goodbye\\". The opening song \\"Right Now\\" grabs you into the artistry and uniqueness of Knopfler's sound and the talent of the band he assembled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic CD","review":"I bought this CD for my husband who is an avid Emmy Lou fan.

It's a far cry from the same author's Revelation, which is one of the few New Adventures I've found worthwhile.Like Kate Orman's book, this does nothing to make me reconsider my decision to stop reading the New Adventures."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERRY GOOD","review":"this purchases is verry good , verry good customers, sorry for my english , mais très bon vendeur merci a tous , thank's to us"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grade B+","review":"Asia's 2nd cd with Payne on lead vocals is as good as his first, AQUA, if not better. On most days this is my favorite Payne Asia cd. It the most classic sounding Asia cd, of the new line-up. ANYTIME, ARE YOU BIG ENOUGH, DESIRE, SUMMER, FEELS LIKE LOVE, are all great songs, and Payne is showing he is a great vocalist, although, his stlye is not along the line of former Asia singer, Wetton. Payne's voice is a little rougher around the edges, but he holds his own, rather well. Were AQUA was less classic Asia sounding, it had a better rounding of songs, with nothing really weak on it. ARIA has a couple of lame song on it, SAD SITUATION, BROTHER DON'T CUT THE WIRE & REMEBRANCE DAY. Overall a great cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asia goes hair metal","review":"I wanted to like this album, but I just can't get into it. While it is a more consistent album than its predecessor Aqua, it is the least Asia-like album in their catalog. Unlike Aqua, which had a nice balance of keyboards and guitars, Aria has the guitars up front and the keys in the background. The combined effect is to sound like the 80s version of Deep Purple at best, or yet another hair metal band at worst. That's a shame, because Asia is not a hair metal band. To be fair, three of the Payne-era band's best songs are on this disc: Anytime, Feels Like Love, and Military Man. Things improved dramatically with the group's next release, Arena, so hopefully this is the low point for Asia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aria: More like Poison than Asia!","review":"After th 1992 release of Aqua, I thought that it couldn't get much worse...I was wrong! Aria is an overproduced pop metal extravaganza of super overdubbed vocals and distorted guitar riffs. Aria would be better suited to bands like White Lion or Poison. Not Asia! Geoff Downes continues to take the band even further away from its roots. Aria features the worst song writting of any Asia album. With songs like \\"Are you big enough\\" or \\"Don't cut the line Brother\\", no one is going to win any literary awards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed.","review":"I have to agree with another reviewer, this is Asia's weak attempt at being a hair metal band. The song writing is weak and they sound like their trying be Whitesnake. From the opening track \\"Anytime\\" to \\"Are You Big Enough?\\" to the slocky \\"Feels like Love\\" is by far their weakest effort in their twenty year career. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"No!","review":"There's only one person left from the original line-up, and since then, Asia wants to sound like a hardrock band. Which it is not. Especially the lead singer John Payne would be better off singing in a real hardrock band (or not singing at all) - his voice and lack of talent make a deep contrast to John Wetton's emotional singing. It is a shame that this pathetic leftover still uses the name Asia.You'll be much better off buying one of Asia's first three albums, especially Astra. And whatever you do, do not buy anything newer than Then & Now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely tremendous","review":"i have been a fan of asia for quite some time now and have all their studio albums.this their fifth is easily the best one,it has melody goes at a good pace,and not like the earlier john wetton albums where the music was too blocky and disjointed.i have given this five stars because this is what the old asia should have sounded like.in my opinion steve howe though a fine guitarist ruined the first two albums.my favourite tracks are anytime,sad situation both you sing along to very loudly and feels like love with lyrics i can relate too.well done lads on a fine effort.i do prefer john wettons vocals,having seen him live but john payne though less vocally talented,rocks more and has more energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it couldn't get worse? Guess again","review":"This album reminds me of the maxim \\"Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.\\" Having seen the radical departure the band took with its 1992 release, Aqua (featuring a new lead singer, drummer and guitarist), I wasn't quite sure what to expect from Aria. Hugely disappointed in Aqua, I guess I hoped Geoff would return more to the sound that made the original Asia so popular - soaring guitar and keyboards, precision percussion, thundering bass, and powerful vocals. Well, the soaring keyboards are still there, but that's about it. The songwriting is still lacking, and vocalist John Payne still plays the poseur more than the performer. Were it not for the band's name, most people wouldn't give Aria a second thought. Unfortunately for the band, those who do give it a listen probably won't give it a second thought, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bratz","review":"My daughter begged for this toy every time it came on t.v. or we saw it in the store.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Context","review":"This book provides the historical and social context for the Catholic Church in the U.S. The author presents an accurate view of the Catholic Church because he recognizes the authority of the official teaching of the Church about herself. Yet, he does not gloss over the serious problems that face the Church in America from so many who are either openly or covertly trying to undermine the traditional self-understanding of the Church. The book is a basic introduction to the Church for non-Catholics and for Catholics in the common situation of having little knowledge of their own Church's structure and history. The book is also of interest to knowledgeable and more advanced readers, especially the chapter on post-Vatican II issues. In many ways, context is everything; and this book provides the context for the evolving and fascinating situation of the Catholic Church in the U.S. (For a more detailed review, see my blog above for Sept. 20, 2006.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Banter","review":"I think the first reviewer got this right. its a budget cd that doesnt fill the disc at all, put out by the record company. these songs are the singles, which happen to be more ballad like than rock ones that most of their songs are. if you are a toto fan seriously look elsewhere (isolation, hydra, seventh one). if you are a new toto fan, also look elsewhere, unless you are like a top 40 party dj or something wanting the 'singles' theres seriously more to toto."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Several hits' would be a better title","review":"Good songs, super even, as usual from Toto, but there are only a few hits, accompanied by quite a lot of relatively insignificant tracks.

Obviously Toto had nothing to do with this release. 10 songs from a band that at the time was around for 20 years and over 10 albums is very sad. There are better greatest hits discs in the Toto arsenal than this. Your best bet is to pick up Toto IV, Tambu, Fahrenheit, The Seventh One, XX, and Mindfields for a good cross section of Toto. This amazing band cannot be shoved into a 60 minute CD. It doesn't do them justice. While Rosanna, Africa and Hold the Line are obvious masterpieces, the lesser know hidden material (Tambu in particular) really reflect the talent and mastery of Toto."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOTAL TOTO","review":"Toto was one of the most under-rated and over-criticized bands of the 80's. Never mind the fact that they won a ton of grammys for \\"Africa\\" and the Toto IV album. Critics loved to say they were just a studio band, and that they were sterile and banal. Ha! Just listen to their hits---\\"Africa,\\" \\"Hold the Line,\\" \\"I Won't Hold You Back,\\" \\"Make Believe,\\" \\"Rosanna,\\" \\"99\\", etc., etc. They are an extremely creative and tight, and gave us songs that will last much longer than the current fluff saturating the market.

This cd is recommended for all those into rock/punk/alternative whether it be J-music or otherwise. Hey, it even has an English track, if any of you are wondering.

This is a weak CD and only two tracks caught my ears. \\"Ain't it funky now\\" is a standard jazz-funk number driven by Idris Muhammed's peerless drumming, however his version of Lennon/McCartneys \\"A day in the life\\" is something altogether better.After an unpromising start in which Green states the theme a couple of times, the band soars off into the most uplifting improvisation, starting with Green and ending with an excellent saxophone solo, buoyed up by some rare rythym playing.Is it worth the money? Well, there are better Grant Green CDs in Amazon's catalogue, but for die-hard Grant Green fans and guitarists hunting novel licks, this might be worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"lab rat reporting for duty--after the sugar high","review":"they can hide the candy in the yogurt pretendo health food, but this is WAY TOO SWEET.

Our heroine starts off the book with only the child and the memory of our hero. Our hero starts off the book being blind-sided by our heroine's pregnancy and determination to keep him out of her life.Then they have to work at it. They have to make a conscious decision that they're going to live beyond their pasts and find the courage to be together. That's what I liked about this book, both the hero and the heroine had to work at the relationship. It didn't just work itself out because they fell in lust. It's not the best book ever - the dialogue with the secondary characters felt stilted and unrealistic, the plot was too convenient. But I liked and could understand the main couple. I wanted them to be together and by the end I believed that they had what it takes to stay together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mind-bending stuff","review":"Personally, I think fantasy science fiction is just lazy. Anyone can create a twisted sci-fi universe if they have no rules.This book (and from what I understand, the rest of Egan's works) present plausible realistic scenarios that make the stories much more disturbing. The read not only entertaining but eye opening. There are not many books like this that lend themselves to giving you a new perspective.Unless, of course, you think a world of jedi knights and the dark side raises serious questions about our humanity.

The Housing is built in two large pieces that are screwed together. The seam of the housing runs through the mounting holes that supports ALL the weight of the housing and the hose. Bad idea! The slip mounting bracket goes into the holes of the housing. Over a very short period of time the soft plastic bends and the seam separates. This happens because the stress of pulling the hose from the housing and rewinding is all concentrated on the seam that has no screws to strengthen it.. I am an engineer by trade and this was not designed properly. If you bought one, it can be fixed with a couple of screws and a small piece of metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea, wrong construction","review":"1. its hard to connect the feeder hose inside the unit.2. watch your psi: i am sure mine is around 60psi but the otherend of the hose popped off because of the pressure. theinstructions say rated to 75psi.3. also when finished, the instructions say you could leaveit in the \\"rest\\" position, i say after that go down to rewindto let the pressure come out the exit hose.4. make sure you turn off the water altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is Customer Service?","review":"I purchased the Reel Smart hose winder, model 06051 and it didn't come with the swivel mount.

The part cannot be replaced, and I was told I've had it too long to return.Other than that, the hose reel did work (a few times) automatically, but it wasted 2-3 gallons of water each time the hose SLOWLY reeled in. (To create pressure for reeling in, fresh water jets out of a hose near the bottom and leaves a trench in the yard if you don't move the unit around periodically).I will definitely go back to the manual hose reel made by any company OTHER THAN Hydro Industries.

This one will change your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost as good as the bad movies on the SyFy channel","review":"the walkind dead is the new gold standard for post apocalyptic sci-fi. I am afraid this show just does not cut it. There's just too much mindless chatter, chessy dialogues and just too slow to hold my attention. I'll admit that I've just seen a few episodes and I hope its gets better but I am not holding my breath"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"The plot is pretty bad and the acting as well. There are a few good characters sprinkled about the show and that kept my interest up until the sixth episode, but then I had to give up. There are some really big holes in the plot and the military guys in the show are pretty silly. Nothing adds up and its pretty boring so I'm finished with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling Skies","review":"This series was just OK until I realized it was a remake of Red Dawn. Yuck. I'm not a fan of guns or the NRA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Season 1 sets up excellent Season 2","review":"Other reviewers have covered a wish for more action, though most agree the writing and special effects are good, and the subdued presentation is in keeping with the premise that unspectacular \\"average folk\\" are forced to resist alien invasion or simply accept extermination. But Season 2 really takes off with plot points I should not spoil here, and has enough of a solid audience that TNT has ordered Season 3 to be made.So yes, buy Season 1 now, add Season 2 to it when it is finally released on DVD (broadcast tv showed the season 2 finale just a week ago)and collect a very worthwhile sci-fi series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, fast download","review":"I've downloaded a few videos on Amazon and have been happy with the speed and quality.

It kept me coming back to see the next episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Falling Skies is Phenomenal","review":"How I missed this series for two years is beyond me, and I really have to thank Amazon Prime because I would have never known about it without them. Earth has been invaded by aliens and they are attempting to destroy our race and enslave our children. Hands down the best Sci-Fi series I've seen since Lost. The characters are amazing enough that even those that don't like the action in a series, will fall in love with it because of the underlying human drama element. I watched the entire two years in less than two weeks if that tells you how blown away I was by this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have titled it \\"Falling Eyelids\\"","review":"The first episode was just way too tedious. I thought I was watching one of those bad, made-for-SyFy movies, except a lot of them don't seem to take themselves as seriously as this did--the petty, high school drama and wooden acting made me think the Earth deserved to be taken over by aliens--I was thinking, all they need to do to defeat the skitters is to make them watch this show--they'd they'd either die of boredom or pack everything up and zoom back off into space to find some other another planet where they haven't invented TV yet. So why did I give 2 stars instead of one--my hand slipped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the series","review":"Any series I like, I try to buy the DVD of a full season of that series.

Season 2 is strong as well! The acting and the story are both impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE!","review":"Labored script. Stock characters. Implausible events. Too much hugging. Far too many messages. Too easily predictable outcomes. I am not buying the Second Season,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This is supposed to be about an alien invasion and this whole episode is about a team of 6 survivors that stumble like a bunch of retards into an ambush and get captured by a gang, and about how they FINALLY fumble around and get out of the fix.Such stupid people would no way survive 24 hours in an alien invasion.Hope they improve on this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling Skies episode first half...","review":"Sorry to give only 2 stars. I sat thru the first hour and was struck by how homogenized and typical the screenplay and acting was. Everything was typical: crab monster aliens, walking alien 'armored' robots, things on the backs of the controlled humans. And lots and lots and lots of 'typical' banter! The alien 'city' over the city looked like a huge oil rig... real creative (sarcasm there.) I couldn't justify spending another $1.99 for the 2nd half of the two hour pilot. I'm not sure I can trust Spielberg as executive producer anymore with his sci-fi influencing (especially after the disappointing War of the Worlds). Not much else to say. I might add I am an avid sci-fi movie lover (since 1957!) and would have expected better for a 'major' series. But for those who enjoy: don't listen to me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging","review":"Once I gave a try I became fasinated with the outcome. It started slow but got better. I look forward to next season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a good le sci-fi","review":"Maybe I'm getting old, but I just want to see sci-fi without blood and gore and sex and political aganda's and this fits the bill perfectly.

It;s not awesome by any means but the story is good and its easy to get into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too over the top","review":"Falling Skies is entertaining, but only at a juvenile level. It's mostly a mixed bag of too many things we've seen too many times before. Here is the recipe: take a healthy dose of smaltz, throw in some corn, pepper it with lots of hammy acting, sprinkle in a rather silly and unbelievable storyline, add an overly, melodramatic musical score for dressing, and then toss it all together in a relatively well done apocalyptic setting, and you've got a good idea of the flavor (and smell) of Falling Skies. The first couple of episodes weren't too hard to watch, but as with most of these series it kind of degenerates as it goes. Too bad! Seemed like it was an idea with a lot of potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH!!!

Falling Skies is full of bad science and a terribly crafted narrative. The technology, tactics, and motives that the aliens use is laughable.

I was vastly dissapointed. Falling skies is an amalgam af the most clished ideas in science fiction tv (since we saw them many times before). Good heroic humans fight evil aliens. Add to this the unavoidable (these days) family drama between a father and a son, the stereotypical character of a \\"heroic\\" commander and a totally clished aproach to human emotions and you have one of the most boring science fiction tv series of the last 20 years (at least). But ofcourse there is also Terra Nova which is even worst!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling Skies season one DVD set","review":"There was no indication that the DVDs were American zone only and to send them back would be very expensive from Australia.

His obsessive addiction for AK47 is another issue..- 16 - 17 year old teenagers armed and fighting like trained mercenaries?- many different weapons but no shortage of ammunition for each of them??- unlimited supplies of food, equipment, water, ammo and fuel???- alien robots with \\"impact weapons\\" firing Earth technology bullets??come on. is that the best you can do? even my eight year old son can create a plot better than that.to me, this series is a mixture of Lost and V but much worse than each of these.by the way, 2 stars is for very good acting of Will Patton and not for the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to be a believer","review":"I totally lost interest in the first, PILOT, of the series.

But with some surprises and good character development. Reminds me a little of walking with the dead but still different enough to justify a separate show. i really like that Harley riding chef guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster","review":"I was hoping for something more like the new War of the Worlds or Skyline and less like the waiting room at the doctor's office. It was as though they expected us to care about characters we haven't gotten to know and thought we would really like to learn about the logistics of being a survivor when aliens attack, rather than experiencing some intense action and seeing what happened. As far as openings go, this one was poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I cannot believe how good of a show this is. First season was great but the second season was even better which I didn't think could happen. Produced by Steven Spielberg, what do you expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great character development","review":"Really like the character development. Not a lot of action, but when things happen they are unexpected and due to the development, I genuinely cared about the people. Unlike other sci-if attempts that rely on effects and neglect the details."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didnt like it","review":"I just didnt like it, thought it was dumb. I thought it was awfully familiar, perhaps like The Walking Dead but with aliens and I think The Walking Dead is stupid too. I used to be a big fan but after spending sometime in the Army I have grown and learned and find it hard to be entertained by shows such as this. I chuckle to myself when I see the \\"experts\\" in the movie talking lkke they know something but clearly they are clueless. I would not have rated this but Amazon kept sending me emails to rate this. I know I am too critical which is why I would not be watching this again. Oh it drives me insane when characters refer to rifles as \\"guns\\" and call magazines \\"clips\\" its clear they are clueless. Anyone that spends any time around weapons know a gun is something that is towed behind a truck and placed on a hill and a clip is what the ammo is packaged inside an ammo box, A clip is used to load a magazine with a speed loader"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and poor production","review":"The series is no where a match for other programs on cable or network TV. The production of this series is horrible and cheap. The special effects looks like out of the 80's and the acting is sub-par. Too bad, the actors are well known and mostly good...I would blame this on the director, budget and the production."},{"rating":"1","title":"So get this . . .","review":"The group of people who were giving humans to the skitters are captured by the survivors and let off with a warning . . . NEVER TO DO IT AGAIN.Is this total BS or what. This is more stupid than anything I've seen in the last several years of stupid TV series.Can you imagine in WWII, a group of American GI's running across a group of Germans that had been giving American prisoners to the SS who were killing them and the American GI's letting them go with a STERN WARNING. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. This is even worse than stupid. It's pathetic and an insult to the viewers intelligence.The only thing that would have made sense, especially under the circumstances that it is war, that they be executed summarily.This series goes from being passably good to pathetically stupid and insulting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Engaging Production","review":"How could any sci-fi/horror fan not like this? A spielberg produced, compelling story with well developed characters facing an horrible plight! Without giving away too much, most of these characters have already endured more tragedy then most leading men and ladies ever have to face in 10 years on normal TV. Regardlesss of the fact that the villians are essentially mindless to this point, the story already has me on my seat wondering what makes them tick. I am sure you will like this series if you get caught up before season two. My only criticism is that they left us hanging too long. After only 10 episodes, we have had to wait nearly a year to see more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad button placement","review":"I am using my thirty day free trail of Amazon Prime. I was attempting to press the resume button and hit the buy whole season button . The shows are O.K. but not anything I would spend 15.99 on. By the way this only happens while using my 8 inch screen tablet. Why does Amazon has 1 touch buying turned on with their streaming and mp3 pages. It would be much better with a \\"are you sure\\" button before you actually buy it to cut down on mistakes. Edit add on. just set parental controls on myself so accidental 1 click should not be a problem while on my tablet any more. Maybe a notice that's a little more noticeable on this quirk.

The background buildings and the leaves on the trees are so sharp, it really enhances the program immeasurably! Of course, the story line and the acting is top-notch. Kudos to all who are involved with this show. If I could, I would award it an EMMY or an OSCAR for everything it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Those are not some boring series","review":"I thought the series would be disappointing, judging from the trailer. But the CGI, plot, acting was all done very well. One thing I hate about season 1, is that it on 10th episode it left me hanging with questions. I finished watching the whole season 1 without ever switching for another movie. I guess that must speak for the quality and level of interest of these series. Waiting for season 2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a Disney version of Walking Dead...","review":"...which isn't a bad thing. It's still a really great show! I'm totally addicted.

The characters are well done and actually seem real in the sense that they react the way I think most people would. Even the bad guy of the group is likeable.

I can't wait for season 3!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot and Acting Subpar","review":"The description of the series is inviting, but when we actually watched the first couple of episodes, we were disappointed in both the acting and the storyline. We made it almost half way through the second episode before we gave up on any chance that the series would improve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries to be Walking Dead, bombs completely","review":"Just very poorly written. The premise has a lot of potential, and if AMC had made it it would be off the hook. The dialogue is cheap, and with so many teenage actors it doesn't seem like anyone has prior experience with acting. It's like watching a high school play. About aliens. The plot usually isn't believable, and it's never interesting. Just get new writers and the show might amount to something."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's lost, it's prison break, it's everything you've already seen.","review":"Well, It's lost, it's prison break, it's everything you've already seen. It's just another dumb soap who's plot is completely unrealistic and who's acting is mediocre. When I say unrealistic, I'm not talking about the aliens, I'm talking about the events surrounding them, the way people react and the way people treat each other and the aliens. Nearly every character is an antagonist and acts in an unrealistic way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"I'm usually not into Sci-Fi TV because the quality of the story writing isn't there.

We particularly appreciated the emphasis in each of the episodes on the dedication of Wyle's character to his family. In fact, a major theme of the series is the growing understanding of how important human relationships are to survival. This is much more than a simple science fiction disaster story.Wyle also carries the series with his innate good nature.

Except for classics like Farscape and Babylon 5, this is the best series I watched. Definitely the best of the recent series (last few years). I can't wait for Season 3, if there will be one. I am also a proud subscriber of Netflix and Amazon Prime and won't be buying many more TV series on DVD anymore.As far as details of the series, excellent acting and decent special effects. There is a purpose for everyone in the aftermath of the alien invasion, even lawyers. (Figure this out when they end up in Charleston). Whew, I thought I would have no purpose after a global catastrophe. The acting is of course what does it.

This wasn't the best of Jimmy Smith's lineups (he had Stanley Turrentine, Grady Tate, and others), but there are two terrific songs on this CD.The first is Messin' Around, a shuffle blues thing with a nice bluesy feel.

My teeth look like I had professional whiting done. I just have to touch up for a couple nights every once in a while. As long as I replace the cap as soon as I get my teeth covered it doesn't dry out to the point it's not usable (although I did like the packets better than the canister because they didn't dry out and the amount was about right). I dry my top then bottom teeth, then paint the bottom and then the top. Once you get practice it's quick and easy. I keep a big grin on my face for a couple minutes for it to dry.

Last night I woke up at 2 AM and just took it off, it dries to a white, thick chunky paste that you can feel whenever you're awake. If you never wake up during the night you'd probably be fine with this. But if you do, the first thing you'll think is \\"what is this thick paint on my teeth\\"?The biggest problem, however, is with the bottom teeth. No matter how well I dry them the gel clumps, then dislodges sometime during the night. I don't see how it can whiten my teeth if it's no longer on my teeth. Also, I don't think my teeth look any whiter. Not noticeably so at least.They should give you a prize if you can keep this up for 2 weeks.White strips are better. They're not perfect either, but at least you only have to wear them for a half hour or so a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product","review":"I really noticed a difference in the apperance of my teeth after using this. I have used the strips and found them to be awkward not to mention painful as they made my gums sore.

I would definately use it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Hassle","review":"It may be a hassle to spend time each night applying this whitening paste on your teeth every night. It may not taste good or feel comfortable when you wake up. However I would much rather take the time to apply this and go to sleep than sitting around for say 20 minutes with trays in my mouth with a gel that burns your gums. It DOES whiten your teeth. After a few days, I was already getting compliments.To make application a little easier: I took a small amount of tissue and packed my gums. This separated the lip from the teeth so that you didn't have to keep wiping the teeth. It looks silly, but who's going to see you? You've bought the kit to use at night for a reason. As soon as you apply the gel and you feel like it's dried, take the stuffing out. It's a lot easier than qiping each tooth as you go along and doing them all at once makes it easier to apply even coats to the teeth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look at the length of this book.","review":"My heart leapt when a search returned this.

He has an amazing voice that drops a song into your lap as if he was singing it for you or about you. If his album Every Picture Tells A Story blew your mind, then you should buy this 3 disc set which is a bargain compared to buying each album individually. There is a lot of great performances here.

The problems were over-exposure and multiple images using the built-in flash, almost non-existent contrast range (at best only a couple of f-stops), horribly long 2 to 3 seconds shutter lag.

But call me a purist... I prefer listening to the original recordings in the movie (unfortunately not available on CD). Most film music cannot live outside the film. Sunset Blvd. is NOT one of those.

My daughter and i would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a captivating story. The Ozarks backdrop is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where the Red Fern Grows","review":"The book Where the Red Fern Grows is very good, but it is also very sad. The book is about a boy named Billy. He is trying to raise money to buy two hound dogs. After two long years of saving, he finally has enough money. He buys the dogs and they follow him everywhere. I recommend this book to anyone who can read. It was wonderful! I really enjoyed reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where The Red Fern Grows","review":"The book that I am reading Where The Red Fern Grows is about a boy and his two dogs, and the adventures the have together. This book takes place in the Ozark Mountains and its river bottoms, which happens to be the best coon hunting territory in the country. There is a problem, the main character Billy's mother will not allow him to have a gun, and he dose not have a dog. Billy doesn't want just one dog, he wants two dogs, his family cannot afford this. Billy saves up for two years and byes two dogs, he names them Old Dan and Little Ann. They go through many adventures and some tragedies. I think that an animal lover would like this book very much.

Watch Out!!! there are some sad parts"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Could Not Be Published Now","review":"I re-read this one about a month ago. I had read it about 12 years ago and was pretty much turned off by the blatant animal cruelty. I know people hunt and eat raccoons and harvest their fur, but the very graphic descriptions of treeing a coon and having the dogs tear it up, plus raccoons left in leg traps for days was awful. Then there is the gory wounding (disembowelment!) of the protaganist's dog by a mountain lion at the end and both dogs die. Watching the Animal Cops shows on Animal Planet now and seeing the extent of animal cruelty perpetrated by humans, why read about more of it?These days with animal protection movements I don't think this story would have had a prayer in the publishing houses, much less become a classic. If you love dogs and animals in general, steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"where the red fern grows","review":"I did not get the actual book, I evidently was confused and got some educational packet or some such thing. Very disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dogs Rule Once Again","review":"Where the Red Fern Grows is an awesome book becuase the suspence is so great and you never want to put it down. In this story a boy wants two hunting hounds so bad that he will try and earn enough money by himself. After the puppies arrive he takes full respondsibility and even goes hunting with the hounds when the hunting season begins and also how they survive some terrible incidents. But it always turns out alright except for a few times. As there adventure continues the suspence gets greater and greater. I again recomend this novel to anyone who likes to read great and suspenceful books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sixth Grade Class in Deerfield, IL has mixed reviews . . .","review":"Those in our class who loved the book say that the ending of this story is emotional and well written. Wilson Rawls' use of foreshadowing, figurative language, and personification of the protagonist's dogs and his many antagonists made the characters in this book come to life. Those who did not like the story found most of it to be boring and unrealistic. Students had trouble relating to the protagonist and his life. Overall, most of the class recommends that others read the book. Their teacher STRONGLY recommends that kids around sixth grade read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible book for animal murderers","review":"i am thirteen years old and i barely ever cry. at the end of this book i seriously bawled!!!!!! i would definately not recomend this book to people who love animals as much as i do. these people who say this is a \\"heartwarming adventure\\",no offense, are horribly WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!! this book made me loose alot of my faith in God because i refuse to find something good in him killing these two loyal dogs who saved their master from a mountain lion. i HATED this book more than i hate al gore. which says ALOT!!!!!!!!!!! this was my least favorite book ever and ive read some really stupid books"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexist and Religious oriented, but still entertaining.","review":"This book was overall a good read. It was very entertaining. What I did not enjoy was the religious propaganda contained in it as well as the sexist comments and thoughts of the main character.

He has a muscular body and has a deep vioce.little Ann is the smartest most inteligant hound. She also has a wat of finding the coon where ever he is. She also knows every trick that the coon can pull. One night Old Dan and Lil Ann get in a fight with a Mountian Lion. Old Dan fought the Mountain Lion on a tree and killed it by throwing it off the tree and it landing on a tree branch that killed it. Old Dan was beet up and lived. both little Ann and Old Dan died of old age."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply hunting","review":"\\"Where the red fern grows\\" is a good book but as titled it is simply hunting. watching the characters do the same thing over and over again becomes boring.

The day it came, I got off the bus, curled up in a chair, and started to read. I never put it down... not until the very last page and the last tear had dried upon my cheek. This book is, and probably always will be, my favorite book. I have never been as emotionally attached to any book as I am to this one. I've read it seven times, at least, and react the same way each time... Now, as a student teacher in a fifth grade classroom, I was able to share it with a new generation of readers. They laughed at Old Dan's fumbles and marveled at Little Ann's cunning intelligence... and cried at their selfless devotion to Billy, their young but loving master. This book will always have a special place on my bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"A kids review","review":"Where the red fern growsBy Wilson RawlsWhere the red fern grows is a story about a boy who honestly wants a dog, gets two honestly, and honestly deserves every prize he receives.He earned the money for his dogs working for two years straight, piercing his feet on thorns to get berries, doing every chore he can do, and finally, he earns the 50 dollars and buys his dogs.His dogs are Little Ann and Old Dan, the two inseparable forever. Where one goes, the other follows, they would fight together, play together, hunt together, sleep together and die together, If they have to.I was required to read this book, and I was very uneasy about the coon hunting, but after a while, you understand what it means to Billy.

Like when Ruben was hunting for the ghost coon with Billy, and Ruben fell and hurt himself very badly. Eventually that day he passed away, and that was the saddest moment alive.

Something external that happened was when Billy had to expect that his dogs were dead.I really HATED this book very much. It had barely any action or adventure in the book.

I had just lost my dog two weeks before we started the book. I wouldn't say I wasn't coping with the loss very well because I wasn't coping with it at all. I am one of those people that was taught that it is okay to cry but I just don't. So I hadn't really let any of my feelings out about the loss of Grateful, that was my dogs name, Grateful Marley. I read the book and by the end I was a totally different person. It has helped me on so many different levels that I can honestly say this was the best book I have ever read.

He hunts every night and very dramatic events occur in Billy's life. I cried a lot and enjoyed this book the entire time. I think that this book is a good choice for anybody who enjoys a great heartwarming story. He is attacks and his dogs stand up for him and protect him. They have two loves, him and each other.

They make a bond that is very strong and close together. This book is definitely one of my favorites. I liked the way Little Ann and Old Dan cared for each other. When one was hurt, the other would lick its wound.I thought this was a very touching book. It definitely puts a lump in your throat at the end. I like the way the author drew me into the adventure.

This story is about a boy who wants so badly to have two coon-hunting hounds. He gets his hounds, two beautiful red-bone hounds, the intelligant Little Ann, and the muscular and speedy Old Dan. Now, by saying that Billy (the little boy in this story) gets his hounds, I'm not giving anything away 'cause it's pretty dang obvious that he gets 'em, otherwise, what would be the whole point of this story? And also, Where the Red Fern Grows does not deserve a sequel, because this story is a one-book saga! Mr. Rawls also described the background and the dogs very well, as well as when Billy was chopping the \\"big tree\\". Anyway, this book was astoundingly written, and the emotional and saddening end seriously got to me. Get this book, get this gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great book to read again and again","review":"In my personal opinion, This book teaches many lessons for everybody. One such example is that hard work will get you many good things out of life. This Book is also very emotional (meaning that you will probably want to cry when you finish the book). One thing you should probably know is that in the book Wilson Rawls uses the word 'coon'. Don't worry - this is an abreviation for racoon. Another very interesting fact is that this book is based on a true story (probably Wilson's)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where the Red Fern Grows reveiw","review":"I think the book was pretty good, but I didn't like the parts about the dogs dieing.

I have read this book several times and have given many many copies to friends, their children, and their childrens children. The only regret I have about Mr. Rawls is that the only other work he published was \\"Summer of the Monkeys\\" which was also a great book. I can not imagine anyone thinking this book boring as did our friend from Asia, but that will have to be indexed with culture. I was raised on a farm and did hunt Raccoons as a young man. I did have my own dogs and often imagined myself running through the night with Dan and Little Ann.

Since Little Anne was so usd to laying by him she went up there and laid right beside him even though he was dead. I cried more in the book than in the movie.

It is a story about a 12 year old boy and his two coon hounds. Their names are Old Dan and Little Ann. Little Ann is small and playful, but whatever she lacks in power she has in brains. Old Dan was built strong, and was more solemn than his acquintance, but was a loyal hunter by nature, and he showed it. Billy and his dogs go on many hunting adventures, including a tournament which Billy eventually enters. Where the Red Fern Grows is one of the best books I've ever read.

It's amazing how much a person can bable on about a single topic. Sometimes talking about one thing and only one thing is a good thing but in this case it's a bad thing! The author keeps rambbling on about how wonderful the dogs are and how Billy grows up so quickly, but the main point is that WE DONT CARE!!! The dogs can die (which they did)for all we care! Sure it has a touchy sweet side to it about a boy and his dogs but other than that I find it pointless to waste time reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely boring","review":"I'm ten-years old and had to read this book for my gifted language class. I couldn't even get halfway through the book! The problem with books like these are that when these books were made, they were actually relevant to that generation, so, of course, our teachers grew up loving these books. There really aren't many kids that I know that like to hunt, or even now what a coonskin cap is. I also think the part where a boy is killed by accidentally being split in half by an ax is disturbing. Honestly that part was depressing for me, but this really wasn't a problem, I mean, a majority of good books out there have an emotional touch. I actually only disliked the part about the dogs and hunting and such, which is pretty much the whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where the Red Ferns doesn't grow: by ROCKER CHIC","review":"I really hated this story.

He wants them so bad that he decided to raise the money to buy them himself. He wants them enough that he walks by foot to reach them in the city. Then the training began. Soon, Old Dan and Little Ann are two of the best hunting dogs in the Ozarks. Old Dan and Little Ann go through a lot together and are always there for each other throughout the book. From the Championship coon hunt to fighting a Mountian Lion they were always there to heal each other.From this book I have learned to be thankful for what I have and to perservere in whatever I do. In this book Billy and his dogs never give up even when it may have come down to death. They were always ready to win.

In some ways,it is a sad book because of its ending, but it is also sad because the experiences the boy has and the difficulties he encounters have a weight that is usually borne by people who are much older than him.In a sense, he is forced to grow up very quickly and leave behind more than just his home-he also leaves his childhood behind"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book","review":"The novel Where the red fern grows is the best novel.

It's not quite five stars because of the middle area in which little old 14 year old Bill and his dogs unrealistically tackle the impossible, and what was thought to be impossible tackles them.

This is about a boy, Billy, who has a dream to hunt the Ozark Mtns with his own coon hounds. Soon he develops a special bond with his dogs. A bond shared by his Grandfather and family. It is a classic adventure of how a boy and his dogs make memories that will last forever...memories of joy, frienship, and trust. Hunting with his dogs were the happiest days of Billy's life. The dogs' devotion to Billy was so strong they gave their lives to protect him. Their loss though painful allowed Billy to understand the true meaning of love. For where his dogs lay there grew the red fern and he knew his dogs would be safe. All of these memories and experiences are put together to create the touching story of Where the Red Fern Grows."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a good book,but in some parts it was a little slow.","review":"This book was a well written book.

It has a very sad ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting ending, boring beginning","review":"I found the beginning of this book to be quite boring. It felt like the same thing happened in practically every chapter up to about page one hundred. He would hunt, get in danger, and get out of it. Same thing every time. After that, however, it got better. More things happened like him getting in the competition, and the tragic ending. Overall it was a decent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific book","review":"I read this book back in fourth grade when I was out of things to read.

It is a sad story......and it's a five star action packed book! This fits for a kid who likes adventure, because the main character, Billy, goes on journeys with two coon hounds. Billy is a kind of person who likes going outside and hunt. His two coon hounds, Old Dan and Little Ann, are amazing! I think this book genre is survival fiction and realistic fiction. I think people will like this book because you can really imagine the scene of Billy and his dogs hunting, or some events. It makes me want to read further. When I read this book, I simply can not stop reading! One day, Billy was entering a coon hunting contest! Do you think his dogs will die during a hunt? Or will they come home with a big trophy? And what kind of miracle will they face in the end?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where the Red Fern Grows by Justin","review":"Where the Red Fern GrowsThis book is a five star action packed book written by Wilson Rawls.

It is about a boy named Billy who really wants two dogs. He saves money for two years to buy one! He lives on the mountain side and goes hunting with his dogs every night.

I read this story when I was young, but I couldn't remember much of the storyline. I downloaded it from iTunes to read/listen on a road trip with my 12 year old daughter. There is nothing more wholesome than a boy and his dogs. There were so many lessons of love, perserverance, faith, and humanity mixed throughout. My daughter and I had wonderful discussions related to these themes. My daughter said, \\"If you read this book and don't cry, then you don't have a heart!\\" Although, the ending was sad, there was hope and inspiration. I left the story feeling cleansed and satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books","review":"Almost any avid reader can reach back through time and pick out books that interested him in the continued pursuit of great books.

It starts off with one of the main characters, Billy, as an old man. In the middle, he is then a little boy who loves to hunt with his two dogs. Then again at the end, he is a grown man. This book has emotions like, happiness, suspense, sadness and many more. I recommend this story for grades six and up. You get introduced to many characters throughout the chapters. I am a six grader who doesn't like reading a whole lot, but I have to say, this is the best book I have ever read. I hope you take my advice and read this book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most heartbreaking ending ever.","review":"This book was great until the end.

He cries when he sees his dogs playing together. And whats the deal with this \\"coon skin\\". What kid wants a coon skin so bad that they will like cut down a fifty foot tree.

The boy must wait for two years before he finally has all the money raised. When he gets his dogs he wants to make them the best that they can be.

As I was nearing the end of this wonderful book, still a ways from home, I had to grudgingly put it away, for fear that I would cry aloud on the bus! When I got home, I found a quiet abandoned room and finished the book, crying through the entire ending. I remember everything about my surroundings that day as I finished this heart-wrenching story, just as one remembers other events that evoke strong emotions.

I can honestly say that all of the children were touched by this amazingly beautiful story of friendship and love. It's a great book to use as comparison with the movie. It showed my students that there is more to good entertainment than sitting and watching the television all day. They realized that using the imagination and getting lost in a good book can be just as entertaining if not more so.

Those were great muffs. Unfortunately, they have either switched vendors or are having them made for them in China and they are junk.

Instead of selling replacement parts at local dealers, the company claims they will send you replacements for free ($5 shipping). I sent them a check 6 months ago, have called and emailed multiple times, and still no part. If they sold these parts locally, I would still be able to use the reel. Instead, they are forcing customers to buy new reels when the small plastic parts break.

But the most surprising thing about the soundtrack is how unmemorable it is. The biggest elements missing from this music are energy and excitement. They all just seem to hang in the air like heavy blobs. Only \\"Welcome\\" stands out as a memorable tune - something that you might find yourself singing around the house. I was excited about the use on Inuit on a few of the tracks. It's surprising how flat these tracks sound considering what an interesting sounding language it is.

When my sister and I saw the film, we were blown away by the touching story and the amazing animation. But when the Tina Turner song started, we were literally ready to cover our ears!! The music was childish and sing-songy, and it didn't flow with the movie. I own soundtracks to most of the Disney films - THIS soundtrack can't hold a candle to The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Mulan or Tarzan.

Note, it is available for purchase on amazon.co.uk, BUT only if you live in Europe!

The hypothesis is plausible, that we will understand more and more of the biology of ageing and find ways to prevent it, with varying degrees of success. The concept of a society controlled by a gerontocracy that rewards those who take care of themselves with an opportunity to try the latest and most promising therapy for prolonging life is believable.

What is this? Some post 20 century angst-soap opera-see Europe travel romp with a slap of the old cyberpunk paint brush?The innovations in this novel are far and few (enhanced talking dogs - nice touch) - the rejuvenation technique(s) almost a trival pretext for what seems to be a post-20th century remake of a Nathanel Hawthorne story: old person becomes young person and goes on European rutting expedition.I almost have the feeling Sterling is pandering to a certain politically correct crowd. Save your money and buy this novel in paperback at the 1/2 price book store."},{"rating":"2","title":"A convincing future","review":"With this book, Bruce Sterling has created one of the most believable futures I have read. Most of his predictions are well-reasoned, and he doesn't overlook the social consequences of his technologies. The characters are believabler as well, although Mia/Maya is the only one fleshed out at length. Sterling's writing style is good; although he isn't exactly a poet, his sentences and paragraphs are clear and the book is quite readable. The only real problem is the plot, which is a little hard to follow. Personally, I can enjoy a good setting as well as a good plot, but if you demand plenty of action then you might not like this book.Unfortunately, I haven't found Sterling's other novels to be as good as this one--I wasn't that impressed with 'Distraction' and didn't even finish 'Heavy Weather.' His short stories are well worth a look, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept lacking follow-through.","review":"Just finished this one and was left with the feeling that half the text could have been omitted without hurting the story-line. I really did like the concept of the book, but was disappointed that it got lost. A book about Holy Fire shouldn't lose it. This one does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Holy fire is the second book I had read by Sterling and now my opinion of Sterling is in question. Heavy Weather by the same author was definitely in the area of 4 stars, while this book paled into insignificance by comparison.This book seemed to meander and stop and meander some more as though the author was just trying to fill the pages. The central character even had no vision or goal set and I think this was where the book failed in my opinion. There was no goal. There was little challenge and there was no ambition to the character.I kept hoping that there was going to be some massive revelation around the corner and instead it just fizzled out at the end.I was disappointed, but went into this book expecting to love or hate it based upon other reviews that I read before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get young and bum around Europe","review":"Overall the idea of turning into a young person again when nearly at the twilight of your life is perhaps the dream of everyone, yet when Maya gets this chance it seems she doesnt do anything with it.The book started out strong with her escaping to find her own way but quickly the book lost its way and just like the main character just kept wandering back and forth.This to me is too bad as I normally consider this author very strong in his writing but I get the feeling he just want sure what to do with this so he kept writing and writing till the book was filed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Fire: Too Much Smoke, Not Enough Light","review":"I wonder why I continue to purchase Bruce Sterling's books. This is a good example of a second-rate work of science fiction that has achieved its prominence by riding on the coat-tails of the author's earlier work. Holy Fire is in dire need of new, novel ideas; Sterling merely rehashes old themes and concepts that have achived prominence through other writers' efforts. The concept of talking cyborg dogs has, for instance, been much better done in short stories such as Ron Goulart's classic \\"Prez.\\"This book fails largely in two areas. First, characters were only given the most shallow descriptions. Second, the Mia's introspective processes were poorly explained and barely explored, a significant weakness in view of the book's focus on the tumoil of inner life in the age of synthetic utopia.In summary, this boring and disappointing book ultimately goes nowhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sterling's best; one of the all-time great sf novels","review":"Holy Fire is Sterling's best book and occupies a place on my small shelf of sf classics. The compelling hook is Mia's psychological journey in search of satisfying life, in both the physical and creative sense. The choices she makes lead to an explosively unstable mix of anguish and pleasure, horror and contentment. The book's structure is episodic, with little or no plotting (a quality Sterling himself has commented on). The descriptions of future technology are unfailingly inventive and convincing; I particularly enjoyed the \\"obsolete\\" computers which would be wondrous to the present age. A heroine with zest and adaptability, Mia is a sublimely bittersweet and engaging central character."},{"rating":"2","title":"herokee 140","review":"Nice kit. All parts included and clearly marked.

Sony has so nicely offered to repair it for $291.00 plus shipping. I might as well buy a new one! There have been hundreds of people with this same problem, but Sony is doing and saying nothing about the defect. The sad thing is that this was a great camara.

For this purpose it is ideal: low cost; colour view sceen with sound; plays 8mm and Hi8 tapes; rugged and high quality feel, so it may last a long time; apparently the only name-brand 8mm camera available at this time.If you are looking for a general purpsose camcorder do not buy this one for the following reasons1. 8mm and Hi8 is obsolete. When your camcorder finally breaks (as all three of mine did after an average of 5 years use) you will have a hard time finding a device to playback your precious tapes on.2. This camcorder has no \\"steady shot\\" which in my experience is the most important feature for easy recording of good quality videos.3.

Very ambient with a beautiful soaring vocal! However this is not any kind of set standard on this soundtrack. We have everything from arias to buddhist chants, asian and euro pop, instrumental, folk music and more!Whether or not this cd is worth the high prices that it often seems to sell for (no longer made and hard to find) is up to you. If you're a music afficionado with eclectic tastes or a true Greenaway fan it may be worth it.The only complaint that I have is that there seems to be some music featured in the film that doesn't appear on this cd.

Bloch, an associate of the Duchess' lawyer, has cobbled together numerous photographs which depict the Windsors at balls, on holiday (from what?) on the Cote d'Azur, in the Bahamas, in Germany, in nightclubs, etc., etc. It is difficult to read this book and not come away with the impression that, great love story though it may have been, the lives of this woman and her husband were an utter waste of everyone's time. How bored (and boring) they must have been!

He speaks of their good and bad points equally. It does seem like the British royalty was unfair to the Duke.So to kind of sum it up, the last sentences of the book say it best, \\"...she faced up to all bravely, and proceeded to devote the rest of her life to the man who loved her, who for his part, despite the heartache of ostracism and exile, never ceased to feel that the realization of his happiness had been worth a throne.\\" Certainly these two lived a life unique to any others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read...","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

For example, I tried reading a biography on the Duke,a nd was so bored and lost by the first two chapters because I was given SO much information!I also got a different view of the Duchess. While I had not read any non-foction about her, she does pop up in fiction by Danielle Steele (\\"Jewels\\") and Dominick Dunne (\\"The Two. Mrs. Grenvilles\\") and she is portrayed in a totally unlikeable light.

Robert Conquest's book The Great Terror and Anne Applebaum's book The Gulag fill things in...to say nothing of Solzhenitsyn. There must be another bio of Stalin out by now that takes into account how much more we know about Stalin's totalitarian regime now. And Hannah Arendt's Origins of Totalitarianism came out before the Deutscher book, so it's not as if no one knew even then what he was about.

Boy am I sorry I'm stuck trudging through the God this and God that sections to get to anything worth reading. This might be a great book for someone who leans on God for inspiration. It's not the book for me, and I probably won't have the stomach to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"No-Crank Classsic Hose Reel","review":"No -Crank performed as advertised, reeling a 50 foot hose without a hitch. The unit will not be an eye sore on any patio because it's nicely designed. Note, as No -Crank starts to reel in the hose, the patio will be over run with water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply doesn't work","review":"I thought this water-powered hose reel would save a lot of bending and give my back a break. Right from the start, though, I could not get a tight seal. More water leaked from the various connection points than came out of the end of my hose. Although the water-powered rewind worked - in a dinky, achingly slow fashion - the reel wasted so much water and required so much fiddling I returned it within a few days."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have two different models. Both JUNK","review":"I bought one of the 150ft models and it seemed to work well. About a week later I bought a hundred footer for the other side of the house. About a week after that a tooth broke off one of the gears on the first one (150ft)now it makes a clunking sound when I reel it in. I noticed I seemed to have low pressure on the side of the house I installed the 2nd reel(100ft model). I just thought It was low pressure for some reason a certain times of the day. Today it was so bad It wouldn't even powder my sprinkler. So I by-passed the reel and guess what, it's the hose reel. I checked the in and out hose for kinks but found nothing wrong. These things are junk! The reason I payed over a hundred bucks for these is because I have such a bad back. I'd be better of reeling my hoses in manually then continually bending over to mess with this junk. I will be telling my everyone I can about how bad these are. I'm tired of wasting money on things that don't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immediately malfunctioned!","review":"Based on excellent reviews of Hydro Industries' 200 model, I ordered this Reel Smart model. Hooked up a 90 ft flexogen hose and tried it out...cool! But wait, only 60 ft was retracted. Hmmm...tried it again and it did not retract the hose at all. It just made a clanking sound but the reel did not turn.Called Hydro and was advised to return it.The Flexogen hose (and other heavy-duty hoses) have greater outside diameters than other 5/8-inch hoses; the capacity of the reel may thus be considerably less."},{"rating":"1","title":"love the concept","review":"I bought this product from an ad i saw on tv,and loved it as soon as i installed it. the problem is that it quit working after about a month of use. I think the concept is great ,but the plastic gears dont stand up to the task. I would love to see it made from metal gears instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reel Smart Not So Smart","review":"The manufacturing is defective in that the plastic coupling to which the hose is connected inside the device shreds and makes it impossible to have a leak-free fit. Another person returning the equipment at the same time I did had the exact same problem. While the manufacturer cautions with illustrations inside the cover near the coupling that the hose must be secured in the proper fashion, the awkwardness of the hose once in the device makes it extremely difficult to place it perfectly lined up with the inside plastic coupling. Simply starting to screw the hose coupling onto the plactic threads causes instant cross-threading if there is even the most slight divergence from absolutely perfect alignment. Had this coupling been made of brass or other metal it would have been acceptable. While the water-powered concept is excellent, this device is not properly manufactured for use as it is now sold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well for about a season for an expensive gadget","review":"Worked great for the first year.

The book starts very complex but ends without delivering a coherent theses. This is the main critique after my lecture of the book. The chapters do not develop one into another but Tamen's observations and interpretations remain without a holistic concept. In comparison with other studies with a more historical and genealogical perspective (for example written by D. Maleuvre or J. Siegel) Tamen's book lacks - at least for me - of a coherent theoretical insight. Nevertheless: if someone is interested in \\"thing theory\\" I can recommend at least the first chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lex, legis?","review":"Within this tiny volume of lecture-length chapters bravely stares a provocation to reconsider both why and how (also a little on what) we pursue interpretation. A couple of the chapters serve mealy reading (e.g., Byzantine law and Iconostasis), but the overall argument pleasingly confounds the mellow and perhaps mindless reception of analyses of objects whose interpretations may be completely unnecessary beyond their value as ways of thinking that create like-minded societies. The perspectives of legal scholars, tree-lovers, art historians, and others, who make sense of parts of the world and its culture for the many of us who grow weary of the incessant, silly sallies required to be comprehensively aware, receive attention. Despite a recondite divagation here and there, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this sharp and playful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An audio sample is worth a thousand reviews...","review":"Length:: 2:10 MinsBelieve it or not, there are over thirty KJV audio Bibles.

I decided to go with another Milwaukee assuming they would be made in the USA. Unfortunately another manufacturer has fallen to the dark side and gone to the chinese. I've never owned a chinese made tool that actually lasted more than a couple years of light use let alone the stuff I put tools through. It's sad that a great company like Milwaukee has decided to lower themselves to the level of others. If anyone knows of a USA made 1/2 drill let me know. Quality and reliability far out weigh the higher price."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real story","review":"Melody Webb's stunningly candid account of life in the National Park Service is by far the best memoir in the recent history of the agency. She tells it like it is, with candor and frankness, showing both the ideals that make the Park Service wonderful and the political murkiness that makes management nigh on impossible. Webb's picture makes sense; she is a close observer who is fair in her depictions of how the agency operates and of how those in power use their cachet. Shed tells a cogent and understandable story, free from the biases of casual observers and the axe-grinding of other participants. Well-written and well told, this is best memoir about the National Park Service that I have ever read - and I've read them all! This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to know how the national parks are run.Hal RothmanHenderson NV"},{"rating":"2","title":"Role Model for Young Women","review":"Melody Webb's book offers two messages: one, we are loving our national parks to death, and two, women have a role in managing them. She tells about her experiences as a public historian and as supervisor in several national parks with the purpose of elevating awareness of how management practices and use by visitors threaten these national treasures. While involved in work previously assigned to men, she never wavers from a feminine introspection and awareness of the impact of her personality and temperament on her professional life. She proves that a woman can succeed in roles traditionally assigned to men. This book is a must-read for young women who dream of entering professions once thought of as being open only to men."},{"rating":"2","title":"The National Parks as You've Never Seen Them Before","review":"Melody Webb was a pioneering female in the National Park Service during the latter decades of the 20th century; woman superintendents and upper-level managers are now commonplace in that agency, but they definitely were not then. Her memoir deserves a wide readership on that account alone. But this is not a women's lib story. It is an insider's frank, critical, and also interesting account of office politics in an organization we seldom associate with offices or politics. Better yet, Webb is an engaging writer, who does not take herself too seriously, and whose native sense of humor comes through on every page. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the parks or the Park Service, in the changing places of women in recent decades, and above all for anybody who simply loves a good read about interesting people doing interesting jobs in the most interesting places in the world. Five stars, and six if they had 'em."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as portrayed","review":"When I purchased this book I was hoping for a look at what it takes to be a real leader in the National Park Service. This came across as one womans \\"Poor Me \\". As a woman who spent some time in one of the parks she writes about, I am appalled at how she portrayed herself and describes the people she worked with. Seems more like venting, and building herself up to much more of a leader than she was. VERY Much a misrepresentation of Ms. Webbs version of the facts and her caring for her employees. Alot of un-flattering mud slinging.I would not recommend this unless you want a \\"National Enquirer\\"look at a very good agency and the good people who serve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bra","review":"This is the best fitting and most comfortable bra for me.

And yes, the clip is ridiculous to attach/take off). The back of my iPod has since gotten scratched up from sediment getting into the aforementioned opening, so I'm bummed. The plastic is pretty easy to scuff and scrape, too, so it just looks crappy overall.

That is just the more complicated features though, for normal use the handycam is very user friendly.

When I first got this song, I had never heard it. But knowing who Sasha was, I figuring that if he put out a single it must be pretty good, I bought it anyways. When i listened to it, my first reaction was \\"what is this tripe?\\" Believe me, this is not the same Sasha of Global Underground fame, or from the famous Northern Exposure cds with John Digweed. At least, it doesn't sound like Sasha. The once hero of trance and house has apparently turned pop. Or maybe not. I'm just a little confused.

It would be better titled, \\"A Victorian House Buyer's Guide\\". It includes great illustrations showing both elevation and dimensional views, floor plans with dimensions that are larger than most, specification lists for the carpenters, masons, and plumbers, and some sectional views for some details. What it lacks is more of those sectional views to educate you as to how these things were built. Overall this book is better than some, but not as good as it could be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was looking for a dictionary that listed new words, such as relate to the Internet and modern business (eg \\"outsourcing\\"). This dictionary is not it! It is very simplistic and is probably useful as a quick guide, although if your level of French is not advanced you won't be able to use it very well, as there are no examples of usage. The blurb is misleading, as this is not a dictionary that is specifically devised for \\"a global economy and fast-changing world\\". Nor does it specifically relate to the 21st century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, and you get what you pay for.","review":"This handy book contains a 1-page introduction and 3-page pronunciation guide, each in english and in french. What follows are a 200 page french to english portion, and a 260 page english to french dictionary. I was attracted by the price but was quickly convinced that I had erred in not purchasing one of the larger, more expensive offerings. I am attempting a rough translation of a french novel and was disappointed so many words were nowhere to be found in this book. Further, only the infinitive and some gerundic forms of french verbs are listed; when I try to find, for example, a third person singular form, I come up empty, even though the infinitive is listed. I have, since, ordered a larger, more comprehensive dictionary and will report on it after I have a chance to use it. Carl F.

But there is nothing wrong to blend a personal story into a travel account, is there? To me, the most compelling part of the book, is exactly the fusion, or the divergion, of the monk's and the author's journeys. There are other books devoted to historical or geographical facts, if that is what you are after. What Bernstein describes in the book, the pulls between going-home and leaving-home, pertinent to himself, is also touchingly universal. Leave home we must,like Huan Tsang and Bernstein, in order to come home to find meaning and wisdom in our seemingly mundane lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"misses the mark","review":"I'm a Buddhist, an international 3rd world traveler and I love travel writing.

If you came to look for thought provoking lryics or sick rhyme schemes, you're looking in the wrong place. The Cash Money rhymes are very elementary, but that isn't the stregth of this group. Mannie Fresh's production, combined with the funky hotboys sounds do create a enjoyable listen dispite the limited rhyming abilities of these boys. In fact, this record contains just about all of their good songs. Juve's back that azz up, ha, B.G.'s bling bling, etc. can be found here. It saves you the trouble of buying their other CDs.

On each individual pack had one of the problems:1) One or more coaster arrived chipped.2) The hard plastic packaging was torn, cracked, or broken.3) The metallic corner pieces to hold the coasters in place were detached from the glass bottom.Needless to say, I had to glue and tape a bunch of things back together before I could wrap them.

The quality has decreased over past years badly and customer service and technical support is very bad too. Not to mention the warranty plans and costs to fix things. I just owned a nice handycam DCR-TRV19 that died after one year of seldom use. Something that is obvious factory defect (since many people experience exactly the same problem) costs more than half of the camcorders price to fix at sony service. I advise you to have a look at http://reviews.cnet.com/5208-6142-0.html?forumID=59&threadID;=53316&messageID;=1064984 and see for yourself how Sony treats their customers.Once again, don't be blurred by pretty design.

While it was working (more on that below!) it was only average in picture quality. Its supposed to have a decent CCD but the outdoor quality was good, yet indoors it is dreadful! If you intend to use this for outdoors, like sports its OK (just OK not superior), but forget about using it indoors - bad in indoor light, awful in low light.Now for the best part......the touch screen stopped working in just a few weeks after purchase. I am careful and gentle with my electronics. Its in the shop for repair and Sony service appears to be bad also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected More - But found a fix for a problem on the Internet","review":"I have not owned a video camera for a while, so in getting the Sony DCR-HC21 I thought that everything would be an improvement over what I had previously. Unfortunately the picture quality is not as good as my old VHS monster. A disappointment. The size is excellent, however. Just so you know there is a tradeoff.I was disappointed that the software which comes with the camera is woefully inadequate for transferring digital movies from the camera to your computer where you can edit them. [Don't even contemplate using the USB transfer as this will give very poor results.] This seems like such a basic thing that people would want to do with digital media, I find it amazing that the software just doesn't do it. [Easy Media Creator does not do it either.] However there is very simple freeware program which you can download at: http://windv.mourek.cz/ which makes digital transfer easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great camera...but missing software","review":"The camera is very nice. It is small, clean, and easy to use. It has clear, steady images and works great in virtually any light.But like a significant number of people have already reported on the web, my camera was missing the driver/program CD. Unfortunately I didn't notice that in the first 30 days, so Sony expects me to shell out over $70 to cover their mistake.I spent over 3 1/2 hours trying to get this problem resolved to no avail. Their support site is virtually useless -- even more so when compared with other support sites on the web. The phone support wasn't much better. I was routed to invalid extensions twice and dropped into an auto-attendant loop another time. The final time they escalated my call to a hangup.You pay a lot of extra money to get the Sony name. Frankly, I expected MUCH better customer support."},{"rating":"1","title":"perhaps better for very lit up rooms","review":"We bought the Canon ZR100 on Consumer Reports \\"best buy\\" list but chose to return it after reading many reviews about the loud motor/fan noise during recordings. We next went with the Sony HC21,also a recomended model. It was used in a room with two lamps and a window. The picture appeared dull with the colors and the greys were grainy. Maybe it would have been fine outside, but our house faces North and we can only do so much with lighting. This was not the camera for us even though Consumer Reports, and Best Buy workers recomended it. We returned it and exchanged it for the Panasonic pv-gs150 (about $300 more) but avoided paying the restocking fee and are very happy with the indoor picture on that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"ahh sony :(","review":"my parents bought this when I was little and filmed everything with it.

Well, it's not that good of a camera in my opinion. The first day I got the camera home I shot basic footage indoors in what I thought was a well lit room and the video turned out very flushed and grainy. Outside it looked a little better, but it was far from what I would even call a good picture.

However, before buying this camera, I was told that this would happen when the camera knew it needed to be cleaned! Ya, it may seem odd, but the camera is doing the only thing it can to protect itself. By turning itself off like this, it lets you know it must be cleaned, and saves you money in the long run by not hurting the camera. Unfortunately, it seems if you don't know, you think the camera is just busted. Anywho, just a heads up for y'all so you can fix the problem before it happens to you.PS - the longest I've heard of one of these cameras going before cleaning is about 2 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Camcorder","review":"I used this camera a handful of times, I noticed that the lcd and viewfinder was black.

It is virtually impossible to transfer what has been taped to a computer or CDR, and you must own a Sony computer to burn a DVD. So, now I have many tapes but cannot play them anywhere but on the camcorder, where they cannot be heard, because...unless you are standing within two feet of what you are filming, you cannot hear what you have taped when playing it from the camcorder, and there is no jack for earphones/headphones.Not only is the software user-unfriendly, it runs on my computer even when it is not in use. At times,the computer cannot recognize the camcorder, though it did the day before. If the software is recognized, it takes almost three times the length of the recording to transfer it, and a half-hour tape is split into four or five separate \\"films.\\"Don't buy this camcorder unless you can afford a resentment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this camcorder!!!!","review":"I had a similar experience with my Sony HC21.

The deflector would not stay over the vent.
