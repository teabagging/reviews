They arrived in about 4 days with free shipping in perfect condition, double-boxed with plenty of bubble wrap and packing material. I find these glasses to be an exceptional value. I won't quibble with reviewers who believe their Riedel glasses deliver wine with better taste. I'm a wine enthusiast, but admittedly not an expert. My palate cannot discern a difference drinking the same wine out of these glasses versus a Riedel product.

I used them without thinking much about it until recently, when at a friend's home I experienced the Riedel Bordeaux glasses. The difference in quality and design was notable, and especially the shape of the Riedel glasses makes the wine taste better. I immediately gave away these Spiegelau glasses and bought several sets of Riedel. The Spiegelau glasses are comparatively thick and not the optimum shape. Spiegelau is better than what you'd find in Wal-Mart, but if you're going to spend money on fine wine glasses because you appreciate the wines you'll be drinking from them, I recommend you spend a bit more and spring for the Riedel."},{"rating":"2","title":"In wine terms, great QPR.","review":"Needless to say, these glasses are not on par with the Reidel somellier series. However, at half the price of Reidel's machine blown glasses, Spiegelau offers the best value for the price. I have yet to find any other set of glasses that offers this kind of quality, aimed at serious wine drinkers, for anything close to these prices. These may not be the premier cru of the glass world, but they are definately the village level that surpasses expectation for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"not pleased","review":"I orginally had this item, but lost it.

Jamie Jensen's Road Trip USA gave us more than we could have hoped for. Road Trip USA is filled with credible and detailed information regarding sites, hotels and restaurants. The book provides vivid history and current information, so you can get a real sense of the places you go. We ate crabs with the local beachhounds on the Outer Banks, had BBQ with the 9-to-5'ers in Montgomery, ate pizza with LSU fans in Baton Rouge, and drank the best beer we'd ever tasted in a tiny town off the California coast. The detailed, quirky tidbits the book includes are invaluable. What other book tells you about the B'Hai radio station that you can listen to as you drive through Myrtle Beach, SC? If you want to see the USA- not just check out the tourist sites, but see where and how other folks in the USA really live - this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Road Trip Must","review":"I used this book on a trip following the Mississippi, from New Orleans to Chicago, and it made my road trip epic. Without it, I would have missed spectacular yet obscure sights like the restaurant shaped like a mammy in Mississippi and the world's largest ketchup bottle in southern Illinois. You will miss so much if you just drive on the eight-lane interstates, yet seeing the cool stuff on the two-lane roads can be hit or miss without someone to show you the way.

After listening to it for several months I attribute a part of the success in finding a great husband to listening to this CD. I have been happily married for two years and I always recommend this CD to single friends. In conjunction with utilizing this CD, I recommend creating a vision board (picking out pictures that inspire and speak to you of couples, families, etc) as well as writing a list of the top traits that you would like in a partner and carrying it around with you. It is extremely important that you feel good about finding a partner, so when you see other people in love, feel happy for them and look at them with excitement and anticipation for what it will be like when you too are in a great relationship.

It's a must-read for anyone entering the ministry and who seeks to live in true holiness. Holiness doesn't present itself as holy. It just is holy. It doesn't draw attention to itself. This work shows us the shame of trying to live an image of holiness instead of being holy. How to deal with our superficial faith. It's a work about God saying 'no' instead of being a short order cook always supplying us with what we consider to be the best of everything. Obviously, it's sobering. It's also enjoyable and hardly as critical or mean as this review sounds.

He seems to believe that it is important to capture what they actually said since they are real characters and not imaginary, but how realistic is that? Obviously, he couldn't write while hunting so undoubtedly he paraphrased their conversations when he was able to write - possibly days or weeks later. So if he's going to paraphrase then he should polish up the dialogue. And, perhaps exclude much of the pointless dribble. Some of which might not have been pointless if he had done a better job of developing the characters.I do not recommend this book. Instead, I would rather point a potential reader of African safari stories to the works of Peter Capstick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly dated but hunters will love it","review":"Hemingway is, of course, a great writer; therefore, in choosing to read this non-fiction account of his sojourns in Africa, I was expecting real insights into the country. I found myself sickened by his delight in killing the wild animals. Anyone who has been there and prefers 'shooting' from behind the camera will be as repulsed as I was. I realize that I am guilty of \\"presentism\\", viewing something from the lens of the present rather than of those from the time period in which it was written. Even so, I was expecting insights such as a great journalist such as Ryszard Kapusckinski provides. I found it very difficult to finish. Rather than Hemingway, I suggest The Shadow of the Sun by Kapusckinski."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Ruark Instead","review":"Like trying to pull teeth with tweezers.

It's a true story, an account of a real safari, and Hemingway manages to make his readers feel his exitement, share his disappointment, and feel the same burning envy he must have felt seeing the trophy of his friend dwarfing the one of his own. A great story, maybe not quite so pretentious than some of his better known works, but still a hugely fun read.For ten bucks, you can't get any closer to Africa than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for anyone going on an African safari!","review":"One of only 2 nonfiction books Hemingway wrote, I previously ignored this book. However, in anticipation of a 10 day safari in Tanzania, I bought and read it. I must confess that at home, its impact was lost on me.

You get to do all sorts of wild things like pee on targets or chase/bite enemies. This game is great for kids 10+ because Jake tends to say some odd and slightly inapropriate things.

Besides the awful graphics, the pooping and peeing? Really, is that necessary? In the game, the whole point is to find all of the scents(BORING!)and collect all the bones(YAWN)it really has no point to it at all. For the 20.00 I spent my birthday money on this for, it is definitely not worth it. Oh, and about the teen rating, it is for crude humor, and it was a very good reason to put that rating on. Some of the things on here are VERY inappropriate! Don't buy this for your kids!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Let the Teen Rating Scare You....Good for Kids!","review":"This game is classic! I just bought it, and it cracks me up. The humor is a little off color, hence the Teen rating, but it isn't anything worse than cartoons kids would see on Saturday mornings.The graphics and sounds are good, and somewhat realistic. The game centers around Jake the dog, whom you direct to complete various tasks to collect bones. The jokes will crack adults up, and kids will like the running around as different kids of dogs.The key to the game is smell-o-vision, where the view switches to first person and now smells are visible as colored clouds. You need to collect different colored clouds to compete in challenges, like tug of war and peeing competitions! Once you win a competition, you can then play as that breed of dog (e.g. chihuahua, mini-doberman, husky).At $20, this is s a great game for kids and adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game, Great Graphics, Fun!","review":"This game is fun for everyone. Dogs life is fun and exciting. You get to explore around like a dog in three huge levels Clarksville, The Alps, and Boomcity. Your objective is to find and save Daisy, because she has been dognapped by two guys working for miss Peaches for some mysterious reason. You also have to collect bones to get respect from other dogs. To earn bones you can do various tasks for people. Smellovision is fun too. Smellovision lets you collect sents and smells. Some smells offers you to race againt the neighborhood dog or to get a free bone.In conclusion Dogs Life is really fun with geat graphics, exciting story line, and loads of suprises! I would recomend this game for people who really like dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to have a Dog's Life","review":"This game is so much fun!!

It's addictive and playable, though perhaps a little short.It is important however that parents TAKE NOTICE OF THE RATING. While there are a great many reviews advising otherwise, there is a fair bit of very adult humour - one person in particular you encounter early in the game makes very crude and twisted sexual jokes. Probably very offensive for a lot of adults. BE AWARE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!!","review":"This game is the best game I have ever had! Don't worry about the Teen rating. Its very fun. The only problem is, you can't pick what dog you can be. When the game starts, you just end up controling that Jake dog.

Don't think I'm a conartist, because I'm not. I hope I saved you $20 dollars.

What else is he supposed to do if he researches a specialist field, recognises the tremendous value of a product, develops it and tells people about it in his book? After reading this book in order to review it for Positive Health Magazine (UK), I would rank it in the top ten most educational books on nutritional therapy and medicine. Barry Sears may be making a good income from his metabolic discoveries, but I believe that is because they are important breakthrough discoveries, not because of marketing hype.

However, I am very upset that the product image shows a silver border pattern on the cover and the actual album I received has a plain black cover. The ONLY reason I chose black over the Midnight Blue and Burgundy colors is the silver decorative border shown here on the black version. I am considering returning them (I ordered two) in exchange for other colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite John Wayne film!","review":"\\"North To Alaska\\" caught my attention when I first heard the title song by Johnny Horton. I decided to watch this film, considering I like John Wayne and his movies. There's a lot of what anyone who enjoys a western comedy; John Wayne, of course, a humorous good-natured storyline, funny antics, and fisticuffs. There aren't many gunfights, just fistfights, with sucker punches here and there. Wayne is Sam McCord and is sent by his partner George Pratt (Stewart Granger) to Seattle to bring back his love, Jenny. However, she has married someone else. Sticking around Seattle, he finds a dance hall girl named \\"Angel\\", played by French model-actress Capucine. Can George accept her in place of Jenny? Find out for yourself. If you're a John Wayne fan, it's a must!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought the DVD based on all the positive reviews, and I think prospective buyers should be warned that not everyone finds this a 5-star movie. My husband and I, who love old movies, hated it. My teenagers just found it completely uninteresting. It was apparently made about the time Alaska became a state, although it deals with an earlier time period, and the movie has not aged well. The story was uninteresting, the direction was uneven, the comedy (mostly bar fights) felt forced and awkward. Stewart Granger did not seem to know what he was doing or why his character was there. Fabian's acting was unmemorable and we felt Capucine was miscast. We got bored and spent half the movie pointing out to each other how little the sandy beaches and desert terrain looked anything like Alaska (it was obviously shot in southern California). I gave it two stars because I was able to sit through the entire thing, but I spent most of it asking myself \\"why? Why am I wasting my time like this?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"north to aslaska","review":"john wayne find somebody today that are even worth putting his boots on. action and comedy at the same time, pure greatness"},{"rating":"2","title":"A rollicking fun filled John Wayne movie--one of my all time favorites.","review":"A great movie for just relaxing. John Wayne and his co-stars Stewart Granger and Cappucine have great on screen chemistry. Fabian, although not a great actor, pulls his role off as a clumsy hormone-raging teenager. Set during the gold rush days when Alaska was booming, the movie captures your adventurous side and lets you imagine what it would have been like to dream about having all the gold a man or woman could want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polar bear king","review":"This was an awesome movie. Totally a classic! It was so romantic. But not just a regular romance the princess was the hero!!!! This is the type of princess we should be teaching our daughters to be!

She does make a mistake that lands her prince in the prison of a witch, but she fixes her own mistake with her strength and intelligence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality.","review":"This movie is of really good quality.

Great fun to watch with a bag of buttery popcorn or fresh-baked cookies."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Polar Bear King","review":"I remember when I was a kid, my mother would always take me to the video store on Fridays. And this was the movie I checked out all the time. My mother told me that I should start finding other movies to watch. But I couldn't help it, this movie was so wounderfully put together that I couldn't abandon it and find another, it was so great to watch! But then we moved, and I haven't seen it since, so I was looking for it on the internet, and I finally found it. So I have go to buy it and let my kids watch it. It really is a great movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly awful","review":"I was interested in seeing this movie when I saw the credit given to Jim Henson's Creature Shop. I've long been a big fan of Henson and everything he has done. But this movie is truly awful. The script is unoriginal, effects are cheap, the acting is uninspired, and the cinematography is dull. And the movie is twice as long as it ought to be; some merciless (or merciful) editing would have improved the pace greatly. I suspect Henson's folks had little to do with this film. The bear is okay, but Henson's shop has done better, and the bear features in only a fraction of the film anyway.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Good","review":"I have to say that despite the movie cover this is quite a low budget movie. As a result it is filled with cheesy acting and horrible scenery and costumes. It is based on Norweigen folklore and the basic story is similar to that of the Beauty and the Beast tales we all know. I love the storyline but cannot stand to watch the movie. This is the type of film where you can fast forward though it and still understand what it is about. I would not recommend this movie to anyone over the age of six. I apologize if this review offends anyone who loved the movie as a child but I see this film as a complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little gem","review":"This movie is captivating from its frosty beginnings to its very happy ending. It is Beauty and the Beast movie. The Beauty is the youngest daughter of the snowy Winterland. She is down to earth one, as all female heros are. Against the wishes of her father and the community she falls in love with a Polar Bear who is a charmed Summerland Prince and goes with him to his homeland, becomes his bride and bears three children. But, lurking in the background is the wicked witch who wants the prince for herself. The Prince's mother is also in the background keeping an eye on the grandchildren and the young couple. The cinematography and costuming are beautiful, really rounding out the storyline. The one negative is the wolves . They are actually Huskies. But children won't know the difference and they won't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly the best","review":"It was kinda boring ,but there were a FEW scenes that were actually interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great opera not so great production","review":"The opera as itself is okay. The story and plot are slightly confusing but enjoyable. The production though does not give justice to Mozart and DiPonti. Although this is one of the less known and least famous of the three operas they worked on (Marriage of Figaro and Don Giovanni included) the story lacks the warmth of the other operas. To set this opera in a really poor diner and to have the costume in bad 80's clothing is a mistake for Sellars. It makes the opera absurd to ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Car Go Cards: Fabulously Foolproof On-the-Road Activities for Kids","review":"I purchased these cards for a family trip over spring break, and while I like the packaging and format, I found the cards a disapointment. The games were not detailed enough- too vauge."},{"rating":"1","title":"my rating refers to the DVD, not the actual film","review":"The first film ever made in cinemascope deserves much much more than the shoddy treament it's been given here. Regardless of what you think of the movie, and it has dated in places, the technical achievement needs to be admired, and that simply cannot happen with this release. Though there is an attempt to enhance the brightness, contrast and vivid color, the image is not crisp, and is nowhere near clean. In places there are snow storms of dust and scratches. The film is clearly warped in places and no attempt has been made to rectify the pitch changes in the soundtrack. Together with few extras and a cheap looking cover this is the sort of miserly release I'd expect from Paramount, not Fox.This films deserves the full restoration treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Strongly Disagree","review":"I strongly disagree with the editor's review that said the script and acting leave much to be desired. I think this is actually one of the better biblical movies (the best being Ben-Hur). And I don't see how anyone can accuse Richard Burton of being any less than an excellent actor. This is defininely worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sequel to The Robe","review":"Did you all know that there was a sequel filmed to the Robe? It is called \\"Demetrius and the Gladiators\\". It leaves off where The Robe ended and continues with the life of Victor Mature's character. Jay Robinson returns in his excellent performance of Caligula. It was filmed in the same style and epic method as The Robe and I found it was just as inspiring as the first movie. Both of these movies would make a nice gift to a Church going friend.I would just like to add that I wish 20th Century Fox would release a Collectors Edition of this film. Considering the importance and history of this film you would think they could at least clean up the Master Copy a bit. I think that they have not done it before now because the film's content has to do with Christianity and that is currently out of fashion. I am sure the Religious overtones of the movie would turn off most Americans now days. Sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robe Rocks","review":"I watched the movie The Robe on Thursday. It is a Christian fictitious tale of what happened to a Roman tribune who helped crucify Jesus. Perhaps you might be interested in seeing it. I'm a big fan, have been for a long time, since I was a child. If you have already seen it, it's worth seeing again. Feel good type of movie, full of MESSAGE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD, Safe Ordering, Fast Delivery","review":"Ordered THE ROBE DVD for Easter viewing, it was delivered quickly, to my complete satisfaction.

Its more a propaganda piece than a historical drama. All the allusions to the greatness of Christ gets to be chore and a bore. This large scale production lacks much artistic and historic sensibilities (still see it in today's movies) as well. Outcome: cheese.If you wish to watch something Roman oriented avoid this. And if it Christian/biblical theme you want there are plenty of other movies that are better out there.The highlights of the film are the direction, the acting is adequate and the writing is well, insulting if you know anything about ancient Rome. In 40 years this movie wont be remembered like \\"Quo Vadis\\" will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book instead!","review":"Don't watch the film! Read the book instead. The book is wonderful.I was really disappointed with the film - even if the wonderful experience of reading the book was 6 months prior. I am reading the book again for Easter next year - but I wouldn't waste time on watching the film. Maybe one could hope for a remake - a miniseries - would be fitting. I normally like Richard Burton and old films etc. but this one was too \\"thin\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"if you've read the book, don't buy the movie","review":"My son and I finished reading the book, The Robe, and thought the movie would be interesting to watch. It was a tremendous disappointment - the story vastly diverges from the book, with some very strange additions and deletions. The book is such a good story, but the movie's plot is poorly constructed, the characters poorly developed and often not in keeping with the original character. It really makes me wonder why the movie makers chose to make something so poor, when the book was so good. And certainly DON'T buy the second movie, Demetrius, the Gladiator. The fine slave, Demetrius, is not recognizable at all in this arrogant, pleasure-loving, fighting machine and the ending is really weird. Together, the 2 movies were definitely a waste of our money."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Need to Search Farther","review":"Actually, the cast listed for this Blu-Ray release is correct. It's just that they're all minor characters. Dawn Addams playes Junia, who I believe was Marcellus' sister, Leon Askin plays Abador, and I can't remember who that is, and Ben A. Asker plays a character whose name I forgot to write down. Check out IMDB for the full cast list of this wonderful film. I don't for the life of me understand why Amazon listed the cast like this, but they seemed to have done the same thing for the upcoming release of the Blu-Ray \\"South Pacific.\\" I didn't do research but remember Archie Savage as playing the lead dancer in the Boar's Tooth ceremony.

This movie strays so far from the novel that I would barely be able to guess it was based upon it if it weren't for using some of the same character names. THIS IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY!!!From the very first scene, the movie had strayed from the story. I watched 45 minutes of the 135 minutes and couldn't bear to see anymore. THE WHOLE STORY HAS BEEN ALTERED OR REMOVED!!!The movie might be okay for someone who hasn't read the book, but the acting isn't that great either.I would really like to see a modern filming of The Robe that at least attempts to follow the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Robe","review":"This product arrived faulty and I have not been able to contact Amazon to make a complaint.

The concept - the effect of Jesus on the least expected! - is quite intriguing. However, the script is uneven, the acting below par, and the connections between one event and another very contrived. The annoying 1950s-60s staple of a \\"faceless\\" Jesus is more trying every year! For believing Christians, there is little here in the way of \\"inspiration\\" - despite one moving segment involving the apostle Peter (admitting to his weakness and denials) and a young woman who was cured by Jesus, not of her enduring physical illness, but of an attitude that crippled her the more. Though the Robe's odd attributes seem more the Roman's subconscious outcry (or something!), it smacks of making Jesus rather a spiteful magician. Still, it is an enjoyable afternoon of viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pretentious dud.","review":"Good actors were wasted in an extraordinarily unconvincing story. The sight of Richard Burton dueling like Errol Flynn in \\"Robin Hood\\" was absurd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does not get much better than this!","review":"I had the pleasure of watching this again last night. What a wonderful film.Richard Burton stars as Marcellous, a Roman centurian who oversaw the crucifixion of Jesus of Nazereth. He becomes deeply affected by this and basically looses his mind saying \\"were you out there,\\" to anyone who mentions the event in the stangest tone. Meanwhile he has fallen in love with Diana,(Jean Simmons), and partakes on a journey to destroy the robe in order to lift the curse he thinks he is under.Don't want to spoil the story for anyone here, but this is one entertaining and inspiring movie. Look out especially for Jay Robinson's performance as the evil Caligula, it's a riot.Also check out the sequal \\"demetrius and the gladiators\\", with Victor Mature reprising his role as Demetrius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"If you are into classic movies like I am then this one is a must. You just don't see movies like this anymore.

My teenager and I both read the Robe...and we both were totally engrossed in the book. Rented the movie and we were so disgusted! The only people who could really watch it were my daughters who did not read the book. So I guess if you want to be entertained and you can get past the biblical inaccuracy of the way they portray Peter. (I mean who doesnt know the recordings in the Gospels of his denial??) then you may like it. Id say though if you really want a good story get the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disapointed","review":"first of all if i had watched this when i first purchased i would have returned it due to the terrible quality of the Blu-ray both in picture and sound.

Supported by an all star cast and a spectacular score, this first Cinemascope film truly paves the way for this medium and in turn, remains one of the screens greatest biblical epics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard one to call","review":"This film is so embarassingly bad that it can almost be a camp classic, which is why it is difficult to decide whether to give it one or five stars. The painted sets are dreadful, the acting laughably pathetic, but biggest golden turkey has to go to one of the most nonsensical screenplays I have ever experienced. I absolutely howled with laughter at some of the scenes, the unintentional homo-eroticism at times reminding one of the cheapest of cheap gay porn. The reason why the one star instead of the five won through, was that the amusement eventually became irritation, as the film far outstays its camp potential. I know a lot of people will argue that the film dates from the fifties and can therefore not be judged by today's standards, but please: there are some truly great films from that age. This one is merely a badly timed joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Robe \\" is remarkable","review":"This classic religious film inspires me, particularly in the tribune's final testimony to Caligula!

The book provides an account of how civil liberties continue to be rolled back beneath the feet of many citizens without much attention paid to the fact that America is quickly losing sight of its founding principles and most important values. The essays found in \\"The War on Our Freedoms\\" carefully yield a perspective on the war against terrorism that many Americans have begun to overlook.

The white button you push to make the bear pop up is not easy for tiny hands or fingers. The lid requires strong hands to push it closed. Two days ago, while the music was playing and the bear was spinning around, she tried to push the bear down, without using the lid. I heard her cry out and saw she had pushed with her index finger at the base of the bear and her finger had become stuck between the round base and the area where the bear slides down into. Since the lid was open, the mechanics of the toy was forcing the bear to stay up and try to spin, and since her finger was caught, she could not and did not know to push the bear down again to remove her finger. Her fingertip was pretty red for a couple of hours, even though it was only caught for a second.

Lopez did well.","review":"This is a cute movie, and I thought Jennifer Lopez was especially likeable. She was the most interesting character. The group of Dads was hilarious.

Some interesting and humorous pays but mostly trying to stay awake throughou t it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I would give it five stars, but my husband thought the cast was too big, so some of the interesting story lines weren't given enough time to develop. I agree, but I could have just watched it for longer! I appreciate that the movie showed several different sides of pregnancy/\\"expecting.\\" It is such a crazy journey, and varies so much from person to person. But many things are hilariously relatable, and this movie captured that well. Such a fun movie! Probably more fun when you've already been through the experience :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"My time would have been better spent......","review":"It had a few slow spots and some over the top bad acting .

Still, often movies like this can be fun and something to do when don't want to be watching a serious movie.

I guess with such a strong cast I expected the movie to be outstanding, and it was like too many other movies that have been made on same topic. I think also I love Jennifer Lopez, but I think this is her third movie about her having a baby, I don't think she should have done it, I totally enjoy her, but she just shouldn't have done another movie like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I woyld like to get that time back","review":"Sadly with such a stellar line up the movie bombed pretty badly.

Never an actor's stretch.","review":"Why do we produce non fulfilling film work here in the states? No real romance or real action or drama to come away with after spending two hours bored out of your mind. Cameron Diaz and Jennifer need to grow up now. Same stuff just a different movie.

Would definitely watch this movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Awful Movie","review":"This movie was terrible. Granted, I am not the target audience, but as a married 27 year old male, I have to sit through a number of chick flicks and there usually is some redeeming quality, even if I don't enjoy the whole thing. How they conned the male actors in this movie into participating is SHOCKING! Yikes. Guys, if your g/f, wife, significant other suggests watching this, quickly suggest nearly any other chick flick, Lifetime movie, Oxygen, it's all acceptable. Amazon says I have to give at least a star, but really I would put this as a zero star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time...","review":"This might be the single worst movie I've ever seen.

Rent/buy another movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"They never even bothered to write or create a plot","review":"I didn't expect much but I think this is the new low for Hollywood. There was one reason I can't call the movie boring: I was on the edge of my seat to find out if this complete drifting between different scenes and characters without any point or entertaining value was real and when it would turn into an actual movie. It never did. They didn't even bother to connect the \\"stories\\" together, and when they did, it was just stunningly stupid, two characters happened to be related and in the same building.I have nothing against pregancy, with children of my own, and finding birth a miracle and all that but showing various women growing throughout their pregancy and then delivering the baby is not a story. You actually have to add something to it to make it one. I seriously hope this is the bottom of the hole for Hollywood and they can't go any lower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as expected","review":"I expected this movie to be funny.

I saw other reviews of this movie (positive) and decided that I'd give this one a shot. It was silly and sometimes corny. But the acting was phenomenal.

I've heard better jokes from people that I don't even like while I eavesdrop on their conversations in the kitchen break room at work. If you just feel like staring at Cameron Diaz being fit, Jennifer Lopez pretending to be but a humble photographer, Elizabeth Banks be beautiful and radiant as usual and Rebel Wilson not given a chance to be the witty, scene-stealing girl we know her to be -- then by all means rent this piece of cinematic failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should have adopted","review":"Poor dialogue predictable jokes.

I only watched it because nothing else was on."},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok...","review":"This movie is just ok. I rented this movie after reading the book \\"What to expect when you are expecting\\", which is well written. This movie is a comedy & about 4 couples having a baby or adopting a baby.

A nostalgic nod to action adventure films before slick technology with a star-studded cast. Slightly reminiscent of the Titanic story as a group of survivors navigate out of their cruise ship that has been turned upside down from a squall."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Poseidon Adventure","review":"We were very pleased with the DVD. It had been a long time since we had seen it. We remembered some parts of it, but not all of it. It was good to see it again. It is a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taut, Compelling, Gripping -- NOT","review":"One of the most colossal wastes of top name acting talent ever witnessed on film. Even the actors' making the most of various scenes cannot keep boredom from setting in and not releasing its grip until the end. Amazon and Irwin Allen have some other highly worthwhile suspense/action films that will keep your eyes on the screen quite nicely. Pursue them, rather than settling for this fiasco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sinking and Stinking","review":"This was among the first of the \`All-Star' disaster movies of the 70's, and which were so well-spoofed in \`Airplane!'. The plot involves a tidal wave that manages to flip over a large cruise ship, and the all-star cast (at least in 1972), which includes Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Pamela Sue Martin, Stella Stevens, and Red Buttons. With the exception of Hackman (is this how you follow The French Connection ?), the rest of the cast was better suited to the Love Boat, and not this boat. The dialogue is inanely silly, and Hackman, playing a cussing, derriere-grabbing reverend, just screams through most of this. It may have some larger cultural significance, but The Poseidon Adventure simply sinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Acting, Bad Dialogue and Too Much Yelling","review":"I really wanted to like this movie and after seeing the positive reviews, thought I would. However, I was sadly disappointed. Besides the bad acting, questionable dialogue and irritating amount of scenes which consist of people yelling at each other, there were so few likable characters that by the end I hardly cared whether they made it or not. The upside-down ship was the most intriguing character in the whole film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Love this movie. arrived on time and in great condition. I would recommend this to anyone. Will be purchasing more just like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrifying suspence","review":"Before the Titanic movie there was this.

Actually well done for the time and still continues to be entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"May Day, May Day, This is the S.S. Poseidon calling!","review":"It is New Years Eve. You are in the dining room of a huge luxury liner. The captain leaves to the bridge on a emergency call. Then the liner capsizes. You would never guess that a minister would lead you to safety.This is the best movie ever! It is action packed with classic actors and actress. This is a movie you can never get tired of. It passed Titanic by far. It is a classic quality movie that will hopefully for centuries be viewed by viewers of all ages and interests."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heck upside down","review":"This movie rocked. There's no way you can go through it without trying to guess who's going to live and who's going to die (unless you've seen it before, and then you've got an unfair advantage :). My only complaing and the reason this got 4 stars instead of 5 is that Roddy McDowall's character died to soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD","review":"I enjoyed this movie so much, I had to buy it. I will watch it more than once. Excellent story, realistic through out the entire movie. I think the actors were great. Will buy from this seller any time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect 70s Disaster Thriller","review":"Poseidon is truely the best of the early disaster genre. Obviously good enough to spawn the genre! There are thrills, good FX, funny dialogue, heroes and villains and gals in hot pants all tromping through this upside down tub. Hackman is the conflicted man here and he works hard at it. Winters is the sacrificial lamb in a part that could Esther Williams blush. Borgnine and Stevens are my faves however as their quips and quirks come fast and furious. Anyway, it all adds up to one hell of a lot of upside down fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE - DVD","review":"PLEASE YOU CHECK UP MAKE SURE TWO THINGS IMPORTANT ONE MAKE SURE CLOSED CAPTION TWO MAKE SURE SUBTITLE FOR ENGLISH PLEASE LET ME KNOW YES OR NO ?

The DVD version, however, does not do this classic justice. The mono sound is lame, and the pretentious letterbox format shrinks the visuals and ruins the \\"floating\\" effect completely. The extras are also quite boring {if not pointless}. Fox needs to re-release this in full-screen format with stereo sound and a \\"making of\\" documentary tacked on. Audio commentary by the surviving cast members is also mandatory. Fox really blew it with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget Titanic!...","review":"This is a movie about a cruise ship that's hit with a giant wave and capsizes during a New Years Eve party. Gene Hackman plays a preacher who takes it upon himself to save the survivors, even though they sometimes doubt he'll be able to do it. This movie is much better than the highly overrated Titanic, and I would recommend it if you're a fan of adventure and suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"next to independance day and inferno, the best disater movie!","review":"including gene hackmans best performance (i haven't seen french connection yet) nelson and mcdowall were among the best charecters in my opinon though the others were great, next to jesus of nazareth,and die hard one of the best movies ever made!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Original & Likable","review":"Great acting with likable characters. Especially Hackman, who gives a great performance. You can't beat it for originality, it spawned many wanna-be's.Some good action scenes, poignant moments, humor, and the upside-down sets are great.I love the underlying theme, laid out in the sermon: \\"You can't always depend on others. If you want something, go get it yourself.\\"The premise that you would climb up to an ENCLOSED steel hull is ridiculous, but other than that, this film is good entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My All Time Fav's","review":"Hackman, Borgnine, McDowall, Winters, Buttons, need I say more? Quite a few of the worlds great actors are in this movie and it shows.If you've read as far as this review, you know the plot by now.Sure the dialogue is cheezy and the special effects are a bit dated, but hey this film is over 30 years old! It's still one of the two best disaster films (Towering Inferno being the other) ever made.I've loved it since I first saw it as a 10 year old kid at the drive-in w/my family. I agree with others who wish there was more to the DVD pack (maybe a documentary on making it?) and even some stereo sound but it's still a fun film to watch and a great trip down memory lane for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest Disaster Movies","review":"The first of the disaster movie cycle (\\"Airport\\" came first, but \\"Poseidon\\" set the mold), this one keeps you at the edge of your seat. Based on Paul Gallico's bestseller, \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" pits regular people against the forces of nature when a tidal wave capsizes a luxury liner on New Year's Eve. The all-star cast is great from Gene Hackman's fiery minister to Stalla Stevens bitchy beauty. The real stand-out in Shelley Winters(nominated Best Suppporting Actress)as a loving grandmother who is forced to test her strength and her courage to escape the watery tomb. The plot does occasionally drag and the characters are far-fetched, but for pure Hollywood escapism this Oscar-winner is one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for the price","review":"Bought it, liked it, ok for the price but i wouldn't recommend buying from sam ash the guitar was ok but the packaging was horrid and poorly put together. On a different note the guitar doesn't stay in tune too long and i was expecting more because it was a washburn but the price tag says it all the WI15 is a lot better for $40 more so just put two more twenties in the bank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong enough","review":"I make small wreaths that hang on the refrigerator and needed a magnet to hold them and these magnets work great.

I was looking for a product like this to hang kitchen oven mitts on my metal baker's rack. These hooks will not even hold up a calendar on the front of my refrigerator. They definitely would not hold anything as heavy as a coffee cup, either. I'm disappointed that the seller's discription pointedly omits any info about how much weight the items could hold. Makes me wonder why. I hope potential customers get to read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"as advertised","review":"Don't know why it's so hard to find these magnetic hooks in stores.

Would not hold up a small key chain with only 2 keys.Can't imagine what they would be useful for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"These were strong enough to barely hold up a bathroom hand towel but when they fell, they'd break. Bummed about the magnet strength and how shoddily it was constructed."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak magnets","review":"These are not what I hoped they would be. I wanted to stick them on the side of my safe to hang soft gun cases....not a chance. They are pretty cheesy. Magnets do not even protrude past the chrome case so the magnet itself does not even touch the surface you try to stick it to. Lame. I trimmed the case down on one to see if actual magnet contact would increase the holding power.....nope. These might be OK for a small keychain or a potholder but that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Enough","review":"What I really wanted was one of those magnet racks to hang my pot holders on the side of my refrigerator but could not find any to suite my purpose (refrigerators had to be smooth). So I bought a set of these individual magnet hooks and they have worked out fine for my needs. My refrigerator does not have a smooth surface so I was looking for magnets that did not require a refrigerator to have a smooth surface and these magnets work perfectly. They stay put where ever I place them--I have not had any of them to fall down even when I threaded 2 pot holders onto one hook. If I needed more magnet hooks, I would definitely order more of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that","review":"Cheap and great reviews, was hoping this would be my big break into hanging kinda heavy stuff on kinda strong magnets with hooks attached. First up, put the magnet hook on a flat iron surface and tried to hang a pair of headphones off (heavy duty studio headphones)... it worked... but just barely! If I apply too much pressure when hanging the headphones -- forget it! Lay them down like I'm putting a kitten to sleep and they stay on the hook. So that's just barely OK to start. The connection between the hook and magnet is shoddy: check this -- the magnet falls on the floor once and snaps like the hook was just kind of jammed into the hole. It ain't going back in. One hook magnet down.This is not the magnet hook you're looking for. There have to be way better options out there for stronger, more durable magnet hooks at comparable or slightly higher prices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, good price","review":"Simple product... magnet holds tight to the side of a file cabinet,Would be stronger with a supermagnet, holds everything I wanted it to..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great magnets!","review":"These magnet hooks are strong enough to hold multiple oven mitts on the side of my refrigerator. They feel very secure and don't slide at all when I hang the mitts from them. I also use one to hold a wall calendar with no problem. Would definitely buy them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Magnets!","review":"I don't know how others said these weren't strong enough. I have to really give them a yank to get them off the fridge! They are very sturdy, strong, and I plan on purchasing more! I have a very tiny kitchen, so I was trying to find a solution for my lack of drawer space. Hanging on these I have measuring cups (all 4 Kitchenaid measuring cups hang on 1 hook no problem) and various other kitchen tools. The neck of the hook is definitely bigger than the drawing suggests. These are practical and I'm glad I purchased them!The only reason these did not get 5 stars is that the magnets are so strong, they are hard to reposition. Sliding them on a white fridge scratched off the outer layer. (My fridge is ~10 years old though, so I don't know if new fridges have a better exterior) The magnets would grab to the fridge before I had a chance to get it where I wanted it, thus scratching up my fridge. Other than that, totally love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't hold","review":"I bought these based on other reviews that they are pretty strong and functional. I find this to be false. My keys (only 4 keys and no heavy keyring) stay on but the magnet is so weak that every time I lift my keys off, the whole hook comes off as well. Several times now I found the hook in my pocket or picked it up off the floor. This is a very weak magnet and I don't recommend it for the annoyance factor of having it come off every time I take thinks off the hook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I bought these to hold up a standard/full size calendar for the side of my fridge.

Can't put anything but the lightest item on them.

Only 2 of the 5 that came in the pack would hold them up. Not worth the money, spend a little extra and buy stronger magnets. The two stars are for the two that actually worked like they should."},{"rating":"2","title":"for the right job, perfect","review":"these are nice little magnets for the right job- i got them to hold oven mitts to my range hood. for this job they are more than sturdy enough and feel strong enough to hold something much heavier. they are solid, well-made, and a good addition for holding things- priced right, too!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bobby Susser Is Something Special","review":"We bought this CD for our two and five year old children based on recommendations from friends. We were told that this is a great CD, and that our children will enjoy it, and also learn alot from it. We have discovered all that to be true. We also discovered that our car trips are more enjoyable when this CD is being played. The kids sing along to every song. The music, singers, and the songs are sensational. Not one song on this CD loses the kids.We have never experienced this before. Needless to say, we are happy we have it for our children, and we will be purchasing other CDs by Bobby Susser.

The installation booklet said to call Tech support for a return authorization. After the tech rep. admitted there was an \\"85% chance\\" the monitor was defective, he told me to bring it back to Amazon. To make matters worse CompUSA, who shipped the monitor, didn't bother to include a packing slip or invoice with the package, making a return difficult to say the least. If you're in the market for a monitor try another brand or, at least save yourself some trouble, and buy it in person at a real store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great doll!","review":"This is a lovely doll. I got her because I love to make the Star Wars costumes for dolls and needed a Queen Amidala doll to sew for! This doll comes with a silky orange/yellow dress with an attached red belt (which could come off if you cut he strings), yellow shoes, a hooded mask,a maroon cloak, and rubber hair bands. She also comes with a cardboard cutout of Padme and a little Star Wars toy booklet.The doll itself is really nice. Her hair is about waist-length and it's really thin. Her feet won't fit Barbie shoes, because they're flat.I love the dress-a bit of a pain to take on and off, but pretty and well made. The under-sleeves, skirt, and cloak are not hemmed though.The one thing I do not like is the masked hood. It's weird looking on the doll and looks just like what it is-a mask.Overall this doll is fun to play with, sew costumes for, or just display on your desk! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Middle East","review":"A very scholarly book. Contains much history that we Americans do not know. So many people, places and dates makes this a difficult read. I'm still struggling with Sunni/Shia tenets."},{"rating":"2","title":"I found the book a good overview","review":"Touching briefly in the antiquity of middle eastern culture, the book focuses much of its text on the period after the advent of Islam. As an overview, I thought the book provided alot of good information to those like myself whose knowledge of middle eastern history and culture was not very deep.For those who are curious about middle eastern culture and history but don't have a good foundational knowledge, I highly recommend this book. For those who already have that knowledge, they probably should look elsewhere. However for those this book was written for, it has alot to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Brief Review of a Boring Book","review":"Like many of you, I had heard good things about this book, but it turned out to be a disappointing slog. How this or that caliph raised taxes and other equally scintillating topics get hundreds of pages of stuffy prose. The Crusades, the fall of Constantinople, Timur and anything else exciting are lucky to get a few paragraphs. The author's feelings about Islam are also a bit over the top: he describes various aspects of this religion as \\"pristine\\" at least four times that I counted. The history of Islam in the middle east (especially the tedious bureaucratic details) is the real topic of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the agenda??","review":"Prof. Lewis is obviously a smart man, but for someone who is recognized as an \\"expert\\" in the Middle East I find his books very biased. To me he comes across as being a bit condescending to the people who live in the Middle East and an apologist for many of the policies from the west that are somewhat responsible for creating this ongoing discord. Not enough emphasis is given to the 20th century history. If you want an excellent book on this area I recommend, \\"A History of the Modern Middle East\\", by William Cleveland. I have lived in the Middle East for many years and Cleveland's book is by far the the best written and most objective I have ever read. It's good to read different viewpoints so there is a lot to be learned from Prof. Lewis's books, but you won't get the whole picture if he is your primary source of information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"The first two thirds of the book are unreadable. After every few pages, I would ask myself: \\"what have I been reading? Did, I get anything out of this? The book lacks any focus, connection, and sequence for my mind to hang on to. Granted, the last third of the book reads much better. But, it is not worth the pain of the first two thirds.If you are eager to understand Islam in a world context, and understand current events worldwide, I strongly recommend Samuel Hungtington's \\"Clashed Civilizations.\\" ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated Thesis","review":"Bernard Lewis' arguments are somewhat overtaken by history now, despite his contributions to the field."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Introduction to a Complex History","review":"I cannot agree with the statements of some that this is \\"dull\\" or \\"booring\\". I am not aware that a serious reader expects non-fiction, history books to be exciting! I think that says more about the reader than the author and this book.Professor Lewis has done and excellent job of providing an introduction to the history of this area and setting out a foundational explanation of the genesis of problems that exist today. I found the organization difficult to stay with at times but I am more accustomed to a linear historical format.One does not have to be a serious student of history to appreciate what this book offers. I would recommend this book highly, especially for an understanding on a very basic level, of why the U.S. has no business invading the area."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good brief review","review":"This truly is a brief history of the last 2,000 years in the middle east. I kept wishing for more information but then would have been facing a gigantic book.So this is what is promised, something that gives you the basics of what happend over the last 2,000 years. And that is a very good book to read first so that as you read of various periods in more detail, you can hang that onto this understanding of the entire time.As to the writing itself, it is good to very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great introduction to a fascinating part of the world","review":"Lewis has a succint, clear writing style that everyone will appreciate.Be warned, there are flaws. For one, if you are new to Middle Eastern history, prepare to be a bit confused since Lewis (necessarily) does not flesh out the details.Also, his focus is on social history and frankly I would have liked to see more on military and intellectual history.Overall, a must-read for any student of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring even for a history buff","review":"Even for someone who enjoys \\"real\\" and substantial history books, as opposed to more trendy light reading, this was too boring to finish.

Debra Winger is at her most gorgeous, and the chemistry between her character and Theresa Russell's 'black widow' is palpable. I loved the colourful locations and the sense of glowing health of the cast. People who haven't seen it before will notice the 80s-style male chauvinism, but it doesn't detract from the movie. Great to see the portrayal of several murders without one violent scene or one spurt of blood. A genuinely adult movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Widow on DVD","review":"Debra Winger plays a Federal Agent in pursuit of a mysterious woman who marries wealthy men who then die a few months after the marriages. Theresa Russell plays the beautiful \\"Black Widow\\" who stays a few steps ahead of the agent until after the third such murder. The two meet in Hawaii and become friends, then adversaries and then square off against each other as the plot moves to it's unlikely but interesting climax. Michael Small's sparingly effective film score accentuates suspense and there are a variety of entertaining performances from supporting cast members Dennis Hopper, Diane Ladd, Nicol Williamson and Leo Rossi, among others.Well worth viewing, especially for those who enjoy the Femme Fatale genre, as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful glasses at a good price","review":"Ordered these glasses as I had received a gift coupon from work and I probably wouldn't have ordered them on my own as I didn't know much about wine glasses.

The battle has lasted for years. If you leave the Champagne saucer out of the equation, it's more a matter of personal taste than fuction. Both flute and glass will work well, and both are offered by Amazon in the Authentis collection. I prefer the classic lines of the flute and these are great. The bowl tapers in to the top to intensify the aroma, and to cloax the bubbles to hang around \\"just a little bit longer\\".

I had my doubts that I would use it - thinking it would most likely sit on the shelf with other sound-good items that rarely find their way to the cabinet. Wrong! I use this thing to slice just about everything from meats and vegies to cheeses. It makes for some extraordinary, and very quick, salads. Cleanup is a breeze. It IS SHARP so always use the included and most effective safety guide. After years of constant use it shows no sign of dulling."},{"rating":"2","title":"I simply love this thing!","review":"Speedy, simple, incredibly convenient. It all fits together into a nice little package (including the three inserts and the food guide) that stands on your counter. You're SUPPOSED to put it back in the holder to let it dry--no more sharp utensil in your drying rack. It's child-proofed. It gets nearly every bit of what you're trying to slice, very little is wasted, removing that temptation to use your fingers instead of the guide. I will be giving these as gifts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product!!","review":"After contemplating other much more expensive mandolines I decided to go with this one. Reading the reviews and seeing the price I felt like I could't go wrong. I definitely made the right decision. Chopping and slicing is much quicker and easier.

It works much better than the expensive and rock-solid Williams-Sonoma stainless steel model we received as a wedding present.For my friends at Amazon, I ask you to please use the safety holder that comes with the V-Slicer. I ran my thumb onto the blade while slicing a potato by hand. I am experienced and careful in the kitchen, but the potato slipped just a tiny bit. The blade traveled 1/2 an inch into my thumb before I pulled back (that is very deep, when you're talking about a thumb). It created a thick \\"flap\\" - 'nuff said.

Mostly I julliene cucumbers, daikon radish and carrots for sushi rolls. It slices a large volume quickly and easily with a minimum of waste. It's also great for cutting up a cabbage in short order.

It washes up very easily, has great safeguards and stores compactly so you don't have to worry about keeping track of all the slicers.

When it arrived I was dismayed at what you get for this money. Upon using I became more dismayed as the unit is almost impossible to use. The food drags on the slide. Using the holder helps move the food but it only cuts about half way down and then you are left with the other half to cut by hand with a knife and cutting board. Kind of defeats the purpose. Plastic is flimsy and distorts when food is pushed through causing irregular cuts. For this much money much improvement is expected. I don't recommend. In fact I returned this and got a Bron which is the original mandoline maker. Will see how that works when it arrives. A cutting board and knife would be faster and easier to clean than this plastic thing. I wonder if some of the other favorable reviews were placed on Amazon by the manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks","review":"I purchased it as a gift.

I have since gone back to hand-cutting larger pieces, then throwing the bits into the food processor. (I love the taste of onions, but not the texture. I cook them down very, very soft.)Using it to slice carrots and parsnips was a little easier, and less of a mess, but still more work than I think my food processor would have been.Having been used very little, it is now resting in its box with all manuals, waiting to be gifted to a friend or family member. Maybe s/he will get more out of it than I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love it!","review":"It's a simple design but it works very well and saves a great deal of time.

I did manage to cut myself and not the vegetables. Waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work very well.","review":"I bought this based on reviews I read but was disappointed. It does not slice an onion very well. The thickness of the slices was uneven and it snagged when slicing. It definitely does not work for tomatoes. I spent more time trying to use this than if I had sliced the vegetables by hand. It was also a pain to clean. I would not recommend this slicer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent !","review":"The product was what i spected, it was on great condition, shipped fast and it was excellent what i was really especting ! jsut like the videos !"},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice product","review":"Worth for money, useful tool for decorating & provides promising result , loving it but maintenance of the product is quite difficult since it has very sharp blades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effortless uniform slicing","review":"Absolutely everything said about this slicer is true. It is sharp (be careful, I nicked my finger while washing), fast, an essential tool for the dehydrator and serious cook. Keep absolutely out of the reach of children. I would never hang it on the wall for this reason. Be careful not to press down when slicing, just let the machine do the work. I thought at first it wasn't working until I looked underneath at all the perfect, thin apple slices!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Had Me At Thin Slices","review":"I purchased this mandoline, somewhat on a whim, through mainly positive reviews and because I wanted to be able to make my own sweet potato chips. My only caveat with this is the handle to hold the veggies. I wish they designed so you are able to thinly slice larger items lengthwise easier, like an eggplant, or say you wanted to slice celery, a bit of a hassle. Other than that, I have used this at least 4 times since purchasing. Pretty happy with it otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use it everyday! For real!","review":"This is an excellent product. Unlike most junk you can get for kitchens that usually ends up in a closet somewhere, this little thing stays right next to my stove and I use it every day.I can dice an onion in 10 seconds and not even tear up. I love this thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't live without it!","review":"I use this tool more than any other single tool in my kitchen. Diced onions are a breeze, french fries are fast and easy (and pretty!) and clean up is a snap. It seems like I use it at least once every time I cook anything. And storage is easy too. Seems like the only thing it doesn't do is load itself in the dishwasher!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slice and julienne wth ease; save $$$ on your grocery bill","review":"I purchased this mandolin slicer after seeing it on the Food Network. For the price, this is an excellent slicer. I know there are mandolins on the market for $200 or more but I don't have any need to spend more money. This slicer does everything I need.Slice vegetables and fruits thick or thin. The holder protects your fingers from the sharp blade. The one tip to remember is that you don't want to overload the slicer. Keep the vegetable and fruit pieces manageable and you won't have any trouble keeping the slicer steady on the counter.We have two young sons, so mixing up the presentation is important to keep them from getting bored. They like the large, thin vegetable slices for lunch as finger foods. We don't buy bagged salad kits anymore. Salad kits cost about $3-$4 per pound (most bags come in 9oz or 12oz sizes).With this tool and theOXO salad spinnerwe have a wonderful salad in minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"I've had this mandoline for the last 20 years and am just getting ready to replace it (and only because I've lost a couple of the pieces). The blade has stayed sharp. Even with constant use, it's just beginning to dull. Time for a new one! Thought I'd check out other options but I keep coming back to this one. You can pay more but I don't think you will necessarily get a better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"I had this mandolin for over 20 years and it somehow got left behind in a move. I ordered a new one and realized that the 20 year old one I lost was as sharp as the new one after all that time! I love this mandolin, I use it every day. It's very easy to store and doesn't take a week to clean like those awful huge metal ones that take up the whole counter. Get it, you will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes light work out of difficult tasks","review":"Great little tool for simplifying/speeding up time-consuming chopping and slicing. Works best with foods that are not too dense or hard (works great with apples and jicama for example). I found it didn't work very well with carrots as they kept falling off the prongs before they were completely sliced, or I had to push so hard that the base bowed away from the blade and/or the carrots got stuck/lodged in the blades constantly. I would assume however that if the carrots were lightly steamed that it would work very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Mom","review":"I bought this for my mother for her birthday, because she'd been looking for one for a while, dropping hints, etc. Reading the reviews, I figured the value/quality on this is high.I'm now returning it to get the OXO version. Her complaints were exactly the same as others here: Mushy cuts, lots of waste (you can't slice all the way down). I think the design is AWFUL; setting it up is much harder than it should be. She's very motivated and really wanted this, but when I asked her about it, she frankly said she wouldn't be using it.I have no idea how so many people could be so overwhelmingly positive about this item, but I am not. I'm writing because maybe someone else won't make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swissmar slicer","review":"I've wanted a slicer like this for years and finally got around to buying one. Many other reviews have listed all of the pros and cons of this product and there really isn't anything new I can add. It certainly slices quickly and easily. I can't give it 5 stars, however, for a couple of reasons. First, I have cut myself a couple of times. Yes, many people warned about how easy this is to do and yes, I was trying to be careful. But with so many blades it just takes a brief instant of not being careful enough. Second, it doesn't store easily in our cabinets and the vegetable holder part doesn't attach to the main base so it keeps getting lost. Other than that I'm very happy with the slicer."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a time saver","review":"First mandolin we've ever owned. Actually I bought it for my husband, who loves to cook. He's had it about 4 days and used it to cook 3 meals already. He loves everything about it, except the safety holder. It's not big enough, he tried to slice a vidalia onion in it and had to cut it in quarters to fit. Of course, it's very sharp and you need to be careful. But he did let our 10 year old, shred lettuce for tacos. This is a must have for you if you like(love) to cook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked like a charm without cutting off any fingers!","review":"I am accident prone, so I researched carefully before buying this product. The reviews deemed it safe, and I must say that I agree. I used it to shred cabbage for saurkraut. Once I learned which way to turn the cabbage, it worked well. It shredded before that, but the pieces were just too small. I did have problems getting the safety handle to hold the cabbage without the cabbage falling apart, but I still have all of my fingers, so I am satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best mandoline ever","review":"I purchased this Mandoline as the previous one was not very good. I've had this for 2 months and love it. It cuts like a dream. Watch out as it is very sharp!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"I was replacing old Mandoline and this did not fulfill that. I returned this item. Blade was dull and hard to use with dull blade. I tried cutting a vegetable and not only was it difficult but it stained the surface of the Mandoline. This one not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"This is the only mandoline I've ever used so I have nothing to compare it to but I've done a bit of research before buying this one. It doesn't have a knob for adjustment but it's good enough for what I use it for. I've successfully cut tomatoes at different degrees of ripeness, carrots, cucumbers, radishes, etc... (basically hard and soft vegetables). The blades are very sharp so do use the holder. And especially use the holder when using the julienne blade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget using this for sweet potato fries","review":"I bought this device so I could make sweet potato fries. My husband, who is very strong, was struggling with all his might to cut the sweet potatoes up. A couple of times he lost his grip and almost created a few \\"finger fries.\\" Wouldn't recommend this for anything hard like sweet potatoes or carrots. It's just too risky! I was told by seller that nobody has ever returned this. I know why....they charge a 35% restocking fee because it's used and I would have to pay return shipping (the shipping I expected)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let me play my Mandoline","review":"I love this thing! I slice and dice so much more quickly and efficiently. The only thing that gets annoying is when the final chunk gets stuck in the blade. It's difficult to get the guard to hold on to the small piece that remains after the rest has been sliced. I've sliced lemons, cucumbers, onions, limes, radishes, carrots, and potatoes. The list of possibilities for slicing is endless. I tried slicing a red delicious apple and the device couldn't handle it, :(. The mandoline also has some problems slicing small carrots. Overall, this device is great and I use it all the time. It saves time in the kitchen and allows even cuts for vegetables and fruits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borner V-Slicer","review":"This tool will satisfy most of your culinary efforts.For the true gourmet chef though, the device doesn'tprovide the finer julienne that makes the differencebetween a nice presentation and a truly delicatepresentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good purchase","review":"I found the instructions and the mandoline itself difficult to use. My son and his wife (both scientists) found it difficult to figure out as well. It was very flimsy as well, and didn't work. I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a fan","review":"I had never used one of these before and was impressed with the reviews on Amazon, so this was the mandoline I picked. The price seemed right, and the reviews were decent. But when I actually used it, I realized it's not a very good Mandoline. I don't like that it's got no legs to elevate it like so many other models have. This is a dangerous tool, and without the legs it just feels a lot more dangerous. It also has no real option to adjust the thickness of the cuts. Other mandolin's have a dial for adjusting the width. This only gives you two thickness options, thin and thick. Also, there is no blade for crinkle/waffle cut, and you can't add one either. Some of these facts are in the description, but it's not until I got the product that I realized how important the options are. I was pretty disappointed with this, and will probably very rarely use it. I definitely recommend forking out some more money and getting something that's more versatile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for home chef","review":"The V-Slicer is a perfectly serviceable mandolin slicer for the home cook. It will give you thick and thin slices with minimal effort and also does a few other fancy cuts. For a beginner/intermediate home cook, this would be an excellent, low-cost addition to the kitchen arsenal. I tend to mostly use mine to give sous-chefs-I-mean-guests something to do if they don't have great knife skills. Otherwise, I'll use it to slice potatoes for au gratin dishes or cucumber for salad and maybe do some julienning if I am not feeling like playing with knives since it is more work to clean than a knife. It is MUCH easier to clean than a food processor though, so if you need perfect slices but are not doing 4 lbs of potatoes, this really is the perfect tool.It is very convenient to have the caddy that holds everything together so you can just keep that instead of the whole box.The little shredder is about 3\\" tall and is a regular box grater. Really not big enough to work with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Slicer","review":"This is a one terrific slicer. THe first thing sliced was a tomato, wow, what have I been doing before. Then came an onion, a little harder than a tomato but how slick. I'm not sure how I got along without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too happy","review":"I used my slicer for the first time and am very disappointed. I tried making thin sweet potato slices and the slicer just didn't do the job. If a raw potato is too much for the blades, then I don't think this was worth it. This model came so highly rated that I'm very surprised and let down. My hope is that I somehow used it wrong. If any of the happy reviewers can advise me, I welcome their comments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the job done","review":"I nearly sliced the tip of my finger off the first time we used this product and spent several hours in the emergency room. I'm an experienced Boy Scout Leader, have a garage full of dangerous power tools, and should have known better. USE THE HOLDER IT COMES WITH!We have owned ours since around 1996 (paid about $20) it has had many trips through the dishwasher, on the top rack, without any noticeable deterioration of the plastic or metal. We made potato chips for a party the other day and it worked fine, making consistent transparent slices with very little waste.Storing the unit and its inserts are a problem. The holder is clunky and the parts fall out. I bought a plastic pencil/paint brush box drilled a bunch of holes in it for ventilation and we store it in that.Gets the job done, is durable, and is a good enough value that I can't justify buying a more expensive mandoline until this one breaks or wears out."},{"rating":"1","title":"useful for someone - not me!","review":"This thing was difficult to deal with - getting the blades and cutter out of the holder is tricky every time. I found that it did not make cutting easier or more uniform - just more time consuming. I tried using it when I was doing a canning project and it just didn't help me much. I gave it to a friend who has carpal tunnel syndrome -- I think that it will help her a lot more since she can't hold a knife.If you can hold a knife, don't bother with this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This thing got a lot of great reviews, but it's highly overrated. The veggie/fruit holder is weak and doesn't effectively hold anything you try to slice. The slicer is fairly small making it difficult to cut large onions while they're still whole. Sure, you can cut them, but that doesn't work as well if you like nice round slices for a burger or for onion rings. If I had to do it over again, I'd spend the extra money and get a professional grade one that's larger and is made of stainless steel. Thankfully, Amazon makes the return process pretty easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best!","review":"The trick with this tool is to READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. I know that is hard for some men to do but trust me on this. I am a seasoned person in my 80's and as soon as this mandoline arrived I sat down, read the literature, and started using it. It is ideal for so many things and amazingly fast with slicing and dicing. Before this had a cheap one and it was flimsy and the blade dulled rapidly. This comes with its own container and sits right on my counter ready to quickly bring out and use. What a dandy little gadget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing piece of kitchen equipment!","review":"Wonderful slicer! I'm so glad I bought one, and wish I had gotten one sooner! I love having fresh veggies, and it really makes it easy to cut them up! Highly recommended! And you can't beat the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"v-slicer does the job.","review":"The swissmar borner v-slicer plus does an awesome job. The only complaint I have is that the vegetables that need to be sliced or julianned must be on the small side, the holder will not contain a large onion or potato or tomato. Everything else is as advertised. It is very sharp and will easily slice your finger or anything else in its way."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!","review":"Couldn't expect anything less from Germany. Right out of the box started using it and it cut so easily (on everything) that I was checking to see if anything was even being cut. The blades are seriously sharp and anyone who complains about that obviously does not know what they are buying (surprised knives do not come with a \\"warning sharp blade\\" warning). Did nick myself after barely touching the blade but that was my own fault and I will not blame it on a sharp blade like the trend seems to be for those who were just clumsy with their own thumb like myself. Would recommend it many times over.It really does not look like much and even using it, it does not look that great. Looks can be very deceiving though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Sharp!","review":"This IS as sharp as everyone says it is! One evening I was in a hurry slicing up cucumbers for a salad and I did not use the guard. Before I knew it, I had sliced off a chunk on the tip of my little finger. If you think it does a great job slicing vegetables you should see what it does with fingers. Just kidding, of course. But it is a very, very good slicer. I am writing mainly as a testament to the fact that you should ALWAYS use the guard with this - or any - mandoline. Please take heed and learn from my careless mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great for me","review":"I have tried to use this a few times and have never quite figured out why so many people love it. The safety handle thing is difficult to use with most vegetables and wastes at least some of each one. If the vegetable is not very solid it usually disintegrates long before I can get it sliced. The printed information with the slicer claims the holder can be hung on the wall but for the life of me I can't figure out how that works because blades go in the back and the saftey handle goes on the front. For those reasons, I cannot recommend this product to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"First slicer","review":"I took a few tries to get used to this and haven't tried anything but the slicing blade yet, but it made great thin slices for homemade potatoe chips. There are dozens of warnings about using the protective grip to avoid slicing your finger off and I didn't take any chances. So far, no complaints here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for its price","review":"It slices... it dices... Its very nice and I'm pleased. Highly recommended. I recommend hand washing it. The blades are delicate enough I don't think harsh dish soap is a good idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute waste of money.","review":"I bought this for my wife as a surprise. The surprise was that it was a piece of junk. The first one we got, and yes it was new, had bent blades, a broken ring, and the screws were crooked. I figured with all these great reviews it was a fluke.The manufacturer sent us another one. So the first was a fluke? No. We had similar issues with the second one straight from the factory. This one was however useable so we figured we would at least try it. The results are pathetic. Slicing an apple as a test dummy we tried all blades. The french fry like blade makes a sliver so thin I cannot think of a use for it. The straight cutting blade would work decently, but the screws stick up and essentially mutilate the sliced object.If you wrote a positive review for this, you have never cooked before.If you buy this, you will write a review very similar to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I bought the V-slicer after reading all the great reviews and was totally dissapointed. My $5 slicer from the discount store did a much better job. I bought it mostly to cut french fries. If you plan to use it with softer vegetables try it. But I wouldn't reccomend it for slicing potatoes or carrots!"},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy","review":"The plastic is flimsy and stains readily. It does a very poor job of slicing ripe tomatoes.Does an OK job of slicing firm veggies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for the first 9 months.","review":"First of all, respect the edges of this Mandoline when you get it. It is super sharp and very easy to cut yourself so use the device it comes with for holding your fruit or veg and you may want to consider buying protective gloves.This Mandoline did a great job for the first 9 months but now the blades seem very dull. Getting it to slice potatoes is extremely difficult and even something as soft as tomatoes is not nearly as easy to slice as it used to be. I am not sure if there is any way to sharpen them and would love to know if someone has. For this reason i would not recommend this device. The center is dull and the edges are still super sharp. This makes this thing more dangerous than it is worth and after paying nearly 40 dollars for it i am disappointed that I may end up just throwing it in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to the kitchen","review":"Overall a great addition to my kitchen arsenal. So far does just about everthing to perfection though it doesnt like to do whole onions or fennel bulbs. I chose this model as i prefer the V type blade and wanted something self contained. The holder drains well and keeps everthing together and protected so you dont accidently grab a blade when reaching up to the shelf or in a drawer. My favorite uses are to thinly slice lemons and to finely dice ginger. Havent had it quite a week yet so im still experimenting but even with the shortcoming of not doing onion rings it saves me an amazing amount of time. I consider this a vital tool for anyone with physical disabilities. Though i suggest investing in a slice proof glove as the safety guard is a bit flimsy especially on lumpy items like the ginger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it!!!","review":"The blade is so sharp that it goes thu food almost like butter. I recommend it to my co-worker because of the ease of use and clean up plus the locking case keeps the equipment together."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Most Incredible Tools in my Kitchen","review":"I'm not a cook. To be honest, I *hate* cooking. I'm expecially bad chopping and cutting things up. I have a $500 knife set that almost changes my mind, but even that isn't enough to complestate for a complete lack of culinary talent.This thing however, is a dream. Slicing cucumbers for Salads, potatos for hashbrowns, and onions for hamburgers is so easy it's a joke.If you are at a complete loss in the kitchen, this thing does wonders. I can truely see this as a required item in any bachlors house. It may not be pretty, but it sure does work good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"Was purchased to replace a Benriner(Japanese). Huge mistake. Cutter blades are so thin that they flex when slicing more dense vegetables. Edges of the plastic cover are cracked in the corners even though never used.

Have been pleased with German cutlery in the past but this is poorest product I've wasted money on in many years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"We love this thing! It is used so much, especially in the summer, it hangs on the wall near the sink. I had an OXO mandolin I gave to my daughter-in-law; it worked, but was so hard to clean as the attachments are stored inside the mandolin and they got dirty too. The storage container for this one is excellent. You only have to clean what you use. It's very sharp, the holder works better than I expected, and I keep a Kevlar glove coated with rubber to use for other items.Simpler is better and good engineering is better yet. You can tell that there was some real thought to the user in this design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still going after 15 years","review":"I bought one of these 15 years ago. My mother still has hers from 25 years ago. I home can every year, jams, salsas and veggies and this makes my canning experience so much easier. This is the most used piece in my kitchen. It is super easy to use. No dials, or trying to remember what level of slice I used last time. Just pop in the depth gauge you need for thin or medium slice or the large or small shred blades and USE the hand guide. When you are done, just a quick hand wash, dry and all the bits go back into the handy caddy it comes in. I am getting one for each of my kids so when they move out, they will have one for their kitchens. The price is excellent, they last forever (mine is still sharp after 15 years)and they are super convenient. I recommend this slicer to all of my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A slice of Heaven","review":"I finally broke down and got the Swissmar Borner V-1001 Mandoline after thinking on it for almost 6 months. Am I ever glad I finally got off the stick and made the decision to order it. It is EFFECTIVE, easy to use, safe and small to store. Now that summer's bounty is finally upon us, preparation of fruits and vegetables is a breeze. It's so fast and I love the uniformity of product I get. Based on other reviews of this product I'm not worried about long term durability because it's already been proven by others. I am for sure not putting it in storage any time soon as I've been able to improve my intake of fruits and veggies just because of the sheer ease of using my v-slicer!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It never felt safe... and now I know it's not.","review":"We used ours weekly since we bought it a few months ago to slice potatoes. I always felt it was unsafe as the hand guard does not slot into the base in any way and so slips around a lot. I refused to use the thing, preferring a knife, but my husband loved it.Until last week, when he took off the end of his finger. Completely. His hand on the hand guard slipped as it tends to do with this machine, and ended up with a trip to the ER and blood ALL over the kitchen.I think I'll be sticking with a knife in future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for Home Cooks","review":"I researched several mandoline and decided on the Swissmar. Although I'd like stainless, I didn't want to spent $$$. The plastic is very durable and easy to clean. I do notice carrots and red beets will leave a slight color on the plastic so I wash mine right away after processing these vegetables. Definitely DO USE the guard as the blades are SHARP! I've had mine for 3 or so years, use it several times a month and it is in great shape and I'm sure will last for years. If you want a great tool and don't want to spend too much, this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic design","review":"The V-shape makes it so much easier to cut because it double the contact area of the regular slanted blade mandoline.My old mandoline was poorly made, making it difficult to clean, to adjust the blade, and the vegetable frequently broke at the very end of the slice instead of coming off nicely. This one has none of those problems.My only complaint is that the storage case is rather flimsy so I always tuck it away somewhere safe right after using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"I decided against ordering another OXO mandoline because that design makes long items like zucchini get stuck. This one does not have the same plastic \\"v\\" underneath, so it's not a problem. The best part of this unit is that everything stores neatly and safely away. The blade is very sharp, so that is a good thing! Unlike the OXO however, you can't select from range of thicknesses for slicing; just thin and thicker. I think this will work fine for me however. The quality of the plastic seems a bit cheesy as compared to the OXO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great-- but be careful!","review":"I've used these in restaurants to cut onions, tomatoes and zucchinis. One very nice feature is the little notches at the end of the cutting board. This fits perfectly over standard hotel \\"half-pans\\" to have a place for the cut veg to go to.But use EXTREME care when using this. Don't use it without the guard. It cuts very fast and will easily take off a finger tip if you are not paying attention.I prefer this over more expensive metal mandolins because it's much lighter and easier to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bloody - buyer beware!","review":"Blades themselves are crazy sharp and that's good for the veggies. And this product has that over-engineered quality you expect from a German (Swiss?) product. Alas, the veggie holder is the weak link. Too often one is frustrated with it and risks holding the veggies by hand. You might say, \\"Duh, what do you think could happen if holding the veggies by hand!\\" And you're right - cut fingers! But as a designer, any design is flawed when it doesn't work as intended and the user makes adaptations. In my opinion, the poorly functioning holder is a big flaw and it puts you (your fingers) at risk. I am not alone in this assessment as other users in our home have had the same problems with the veggie holder. As such, the product is too dangerous to use and after a recent incident will by put out to pasture. One other design flaw is that it sits too close to the counter; you frequently have to clear out the cut veggies to make room for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swissmar Borner V-1001 V-Slicer Plus Mandoline 6 Piece Set","review":"I think I must have one of the original Beta test one of these because as it sits, here, it is missing the bottom container on which the little rubber-like feet attach so that the food can be caught easily. I can understand why some of the low ratings occur because I think it would be very difficult to keep the slicer from moving about when in use as it appears here. The original that I have is a wonderful slicer. I use it for everything large (potatoes, onions, etc) and find it very successful, however, I have something on which to anchor it. Perhaps the company can come up with a base. Without the base container that I have, I would give this a three rating. If it were sold with the base, I would give it the highest rating possible. Therefore, you will see that I rate it in between those two."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Kitchen's best mate","review":"I purchased this unit Germany at least seven years ago and it has been my kitchen's best friend since. I use this for slicing thin or thicker carrots, celery, cucumbers, tomatoes, and ONIONs in a breeze. I'd like to think that I'm a professional culinary artist with the ability to slice manually, but NO WAY, this BY FAR exceeds any of my attempts at that. Not to mention, the slicer slices in 1/10 the time it takes to manually do it, and perfect everytime.If you don't own a mandolin slicer, buy this one. You will NEVER regret its usefulness in the kitchen (and wonder how you ever lived without one). And maybe you'll eat more healthy with the cinch of preparing veggies."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice slicer dicer","review":"We are very happy with this mandolin, it makes slicing veggies very easy.

So, I'd guess one would need to settle on some veggie stains. They say all you need to do is rinse of water and store in it's safety box, but just a rinse doesn't get things off. If you soak it in sudsy sink.. you might cut yourself going into the bubble blind to fetch the pieces to clean.Also mine shipped with two 7mm julienne pieces. i was missing the 3.5mm piece. The sole reason I bought this was to make zucchinni noodles. It made great thick 7mm noodles but the process to obtain these noodles was risky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap construction and dangerous.","review":"I cannot recommend this because quite frankly it's dangerous and I surprised Amazon risk selling it. It feels cheap and while opening it one of the razor sharp blade sets dropped out of the weak plastic case and just missed my foot. A knife can be dangerous but at least its clear where the sharp end is. This is just a cheap plastic case with jagged blades everywhere. We returned it immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works as advertised but BE CAREFUL!!!!!!!!","review":"Yes this item slices like a hot knife through soft butter but will do the same with your finger.I was in the ER for 3 hours last night as the Doc. reattached the tip of my index finger. I admit I thought I could do a couple of test slices of a potato but, even sliced long way the slicer got my finger. DO NOT EVEN ATTEMPT A SINGLE SLICE WITHOUT THE HOLDER.... Also the directions are confusing and it will take you 10 minutes to figure out how to use the V-Slicer although I'm certain once you get the hang of it you'll be quicker.Please be careful even with the holder, as the former demo fellow said, he even lost a finger tip after years of demos because his hand was wet and he slipped.One more thing the ER Doc. said I wouldn't believe the number of patients he had with the same injury from the same device.........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most used \\"gadget\\" in our kitchen!","review":"I can't say enough about this Borner V-slicer! Yes, you have to be awake and sober to use it, but I am on my 2nd one in 30 years, and have just about worn THAT one out. I have never felt the need to sharpen the surgical steel blades on either of these units. One was given away and my current one I've had for 15 years. I have made dozens of pounds of french-fies with this unit, not to mention a mountian of sliced potatoes for dozens of scalloped potato dishes. Bias cut veggies for your stir-fry in a moment! I've tried a half-dozen diagonal \\"mandoline\\" type slicers and they don't hold a candle to the \\"V\\" configuration of the Borner. Fresh tomatoes fear its name! Buy one..you won't be sorry.

I just think people should have GOOD gadgets, since there so many poor ones out there.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"swissmar borner v-slicer","review":"Unfortunately, I was most disappointed in this product. The plastic material that it is constructed of seems extremely flimsy for the sharpness of the v-slicer knife part. I only tried to use one of the other blades that comes with this slicer and was unable to push the potato through more than once. Also, halfway through one beet the vegetable got stuck in the \\"v\\" and I had to use a knife to get it out. A bit too dangerous for me and I am a 40-year cook! Also, this is not my first mandolin. I do NOT recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only one of its kind","review":"This is the third Borner V slicer that I have owned. I went through two of them in 7 years as a prep cook in a resturant, and they performed better than any other slicer on the market, and I tried several of them before I discovered the Borner. Now, at home I have got the latest model and it is a beauty-everything I could desire in a slicer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kitchen tool","review":"We searched around for a medium price slicer to end up purchasing this one and it was a great purchase. It has handy storage of all its parts and stores itself safely. Its drawbacks are that it doesn't have taller legs or a real stand and it doesn't do really great with really hard sweet potatoes, but maybe we still need practice with it. My husband loves using it to slice onions. I would recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"Makes slicing sweet potatoes and other vegetables very easy.

I looked on Amazon to find one for myself - after reading the reviews in my price range, I ordered this one...I'm disappointed. The food to be sliced does not slide smoothly over the blades, it often gets stuck at the bottom. The cap is designed to safely hold the food while slicing, but it is difficult to push the food down while trying to glide it back and forth over the blade - bad ergonomics? Finally - heed the warning about ALWAYS using the food-holder cap! My own fault - I tried to shortcut and the cut on the top of my finger was so deep - the finger tip is still numb! Dumb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic wears easily","review":"I found that the rubbing of the vegetable holder against the plastic rims of the base as you slice is enough to wear the plastic of the holder and I ended up with crumbs of plastic in the food. This really surprised me. Of course the blades could cut the plastic if you turn the vegetable holder the wrong way and the holder comes into contact with the blades but this wasn't the blades, it was just the plastic rails that are the edges of top of the base. I don't see how you avoid having the vegetable holder rub along the edges of the base as you finish slicing a particular piece of vegetable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic gagit ever","review":"I bought the Swissmar Borner V-1001 V-slicer Plus Mandolin at a fair in Massachusetts. with buying it at the fair the only thing that I got was the main part, the hand guard, the slicer adjusting part, and the 2 sizes of juilian parts.

It works as well as I could ever hope, and I've only had one finger accident due to NOT using the safety piece.My only complaint? It's plastic, which I hate, hate, hate. The blades are stainless steel and of high quality, but the body of the mandoline is white plastic, which makes me shudder. I really need to get an all stainless steel mandoline, but the cost . . . let's just say that it's not at the top of my to-do list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swissmar Sucks","review":"I ordered two of these and haven't even used mine yet. I gave one as a gift, and to my embarrassment, it contained two 3.5 mm blades instead of one 3.5 mm and one 7 mm blade.I emailed Swissmar and asked then to send me a 7 mm insert, and their response was, \\"send it back to Amazon.\\"With that kind of customer support, I won't buy any other Swissmar product again, no matter how well it's rated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard-to-use slicer","review":"This one takes practice and I never got the hang of it. Made a few desperately poor slices. Some too thick. Some too thin. I'm a Ph.D., but putting my valuable spare time into learning a kitchen gadget was out of the question. I sent it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO DANGEROUS for beginner cooks","review":"I read many of the rave reviews, but this was one Amazon purchase I have regretted. This is a precision German kitchen tool (extremely sharp!), no doubt about that. But in my opinion, it's inappropriate for casual home use. First, there is a cumbersomeness to it when taking it in and out of its protective container - I thought I would accidentally cut myself so many times. The plastic pieces are meant to be easy to remove and put together, but they get jammed together, but leaving them out for convenience would mean danger. The pain of having to be this extra careful prohibits casual use (i.e., not worth using for slicing potatoes for only 4 people). I also did not want my four year old to be watching me use it, lest she try it on her own when I am not around (you know children). I have decided to give it away today. To be fair, it's a great product for a caterer or a small start up restaurant."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG!","review":"Hey this is great! I thought I'd end up spending $100.00 bucks for some fancy all-steel mandolin...then I found this. It does what it says. It's easy to clean. It works. Period. I don't use the food holder (gulp). I just make sure I am paying attention to what I'm doing, because this thing is SHARP."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Slicer","review":"I bought this after reading all the reviews here and they were right.

The knife insert is loose again and that makes it difficult to maintain a consistent sliding motion.I am disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this product as a result of the raving reviews.

I have several of Julian's CDs and this is by far my favorite. Lots of influences here, but very unique treatment. Sure, his Dad's influence is there (only somewhat), but he has a unique and artful style. I wonder if he has been listening to Aimee Mann for one of his slower songs \\"Walls\\"...one small hook sounds like \\"You're Stupid Now\\" on her \\"I'm With Stupid\\" CD. Let's not forget \\"Believe,\\" which has a most atmospheric sound and soulful \\"gets in your gut\\" off-chord hook...best I have heard in a while. How did Julian get to a place to write a song like that? Production is incredible on that one.I love this CD and you will too. I am a bit late with this review (see, I am still listening to it 3 years later), but FIND IT and BUY IT! Cannot wait for his next."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAY TO GO, JULIAN!","review":"It is a shame that no cuts from this CD have gotten any radio airplay whatsoever. Some of these songs are instant \\"classics\\" and deserve to be played by classic-rock oriented radio stations. \\"How Many Times\\" and \\"Its Good to Be Lonely\\" are standouts. The musicianship and songwriting are great here; lyrically, Julian has a ways to go (please keep your praying to yourself, Julian). There are a few duds (like the title track), but all-in-all, a decent offering from a talented musician. I've heard all of JL's albums (including the ones that are out of circulation), and this one and \\"Valotte\\" are best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy","review":"This is not a very good album. Julian has an amazing voice and the quality of the instrumentals is great, but the quality of songwriting on this album leaves much to be desired.If you're looking for muzak, this album is the way to go, but do not expect any sort of contemplative, reflective, or simply interesting lyrics from this effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Having been a fan of Julian Lennon for his first four albums, I expected more of the same, obscure, sound-good tunes for Photograph Smile.

My friend lets me listen to the whole thing, and I feel there's some good stuff on there a bit, but a big chunk is shallow. One song that annoyed me the most was \\"How Many Times\\" (I can't explain, you have to hear it for yourself). I don't know why the album rubbed off on me like it did. I guess it was just the little (big) things. The overproduction can be a bit nerve-wracking, and I feel his voice can come off as \\"comet-clean\\", like no emotion. I say that as a Beatles fan. But some songs are quite good, but \\"some songs\\" doesn't make an album. Plus my friend has bad taste in music (besides the Beatles, of course), so I should have known better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh lord!","review":"Come on. Let's take a breath and have a moment to reflect on talent. This album is nothing but soft-rock/easy-listening smaltz. Predictible rhymes, accompaniments we've heard thousands of times, and all the easy grace of a Disney movie theme sampler. I wouldn't worry about Julian's influences from his father. He borrows enough from everybody else who borrowed from his father that the trajectory of familial influence hardly matters. Bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"The great Lennon offspring album is finally here !","review":"Except for the stunning \\"Valotte\\" from the debut album, Julian Lennon's promise has remained largely unfulfilled...until now. \\"Photograph Smile\\" is a catchy batch of songs dealing mainly with intimate. personal subjects, rather than the broad socio-political themes that characterized his late father's work. His voice remains hauntingly reminiscent of his Dad's, especially on the first 3 songs. While the songwriting is not quite as versatile as it could be, this album marks a big step forward for Julian. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julian Lennon Back on Top with \\"Photograph Smile\\"","review":"Julian, we hardly knew ya. Just when we thought we would be deprived of Julian Lennon's sardonic brand of pop music, he returns to the world stage with the tour de force \\"Photograph Smile.\\" My wife actually picked this up in England for me when it was released in Europe last year, and only now do many of my American friends know what I have been raving about. Two obvious questions to answer: \\"Does he sound like his Dad?\\" (Yes.) \\"Is the album good?\\" (Yes.) Julian can't help his genetics, and comparisons to his Dad at the this stage of the game are boring. He is an artist in his own right. Get over it! From \\"Day After Day\\" to \\"Crucified\\" this album does not disappoint. Though perhaps not as haunting as \\"Valotte,\\" \\"Photograph\\" is the work of a less self-conscious Julian Lennon, who has matured into a fantastic artist. Welcome Back, Jules!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD! Heartfelt, accessible, melodic, beautiful","review":"I thought Julian's earlier works were fun and interesting, but this release proves that there is more to Julian than just fun. There is a masterful pop songwriter who has finally gotten in touch with his past and his future. Great melodies, great emotion. BUY THIS CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT album.","review":"I never owned a Julian Lennon album before picking this up. I was familiar with the few hits he had back in the 80's (early 90's?)and was never impressed enough to listen further.I don't remember why I picked this up. What I do remember is how blown away I was at the quality of the music. This is an exceptional album. Julian does not shy away from his heritage (and why should he ?). His voice sounds hauntingly like his father's in a lot of places. Some of the musical passages and arrangements are also quite Beatle-esque.Still, this is HIS album and is full of well written, beautifully arranged songs. The title song, Day After Day, Good to be Lonely, Cold, Faithful(and others) are all powerfully moving, honest, plain old great sounding songs. If you are a Beatle fan or are just looking for some quality melodic music, you can't go wrong here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Job Jules!","review":"I bought this CD yesterday and I haven't stopped listening to it.

The CD arrived, i popped it in the player when my wife came in and commented how it sounded more like the Beatles, she ultimately accessed it sounded like John, then was amazed when I told her it was Julian. The influence is certainly strong in his songwriting and vocals. Julian may need to find himself a new agent. This is great world class (Beatlesque)music."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's really quite good.","review":"After reading a few of the reviews on here (positive & negative), I decided to take a chance. It's a very good CD, but that's me talking. At the same time, I can see why some people didn't care for it. Yeah, it's got a bit of a Sgt. Pepper's sound to it, but it also comes through as being unique in its own way (to me anyway). There's over an hour's worth of music on this cd, and as far as I can tell JL didn't waste any time here. Sounds hauntingly like his father, but that's not a bad thing, either. This CD probably would have fared much better had it been released earlier (70s-early 80s), and the rappers certainly wouldn't care for it. By the way, if you're having trouble locating it (new that is), you might want to try Amazon Japan (a bit pricier, however). Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Julian distinguishes himself from father's legend. . .","review":"Excellent record! Compared to Lennon's previous(?) efforts, Photograph Smile is by far his best yet. Each and every track is beautifully rendered, dealing with a wide range of original subject matter. \\"Day After Day,\\" \\"Saltwater,\\" and \\"Walls\\" are among the best on this album; even still, each track is wonderful in its own rite.

If you can read music even a little, and especially if you can play a little piano, the generous musical illustrations Fellner provides take you right to the musical heart of each opera.

The answers to the questions that arise are answered fairly quickly so there's not much tension or mystery built up. There's some gore. There's a pretty good joke near the end. It's a chance to see Frances McDormand, who I think is a really good actress, in an early role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Hold Up","review":"I've heard about this movie for a very long time. I've always wanted to see it. But now that I have, I want my time back. The characters are frustrating to the point where they all needed a good smack on the back of the head. M. Emmett Walsh's acting was the one high point. Even if the script isn't clear about his motives, Walsh shows what a great actor he really is. I can't say the same for anyone else in the movie. I know the film makers were trying to be funny (burying someone in a plowed farm field is supposed to be humorous.) But the pacing is so slow, it's painful. The trailer quotes Alfred Hitchcock's line about it taking a long time to kill someone. But he was talking about the suspense, not about the stupidity of the crime. This movie is a perfect example of \\"Stupid people are more irritating than evil people.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"Every dialogue exchange is slow and tedious. Waiting for a pertinent piece of information to drop is an exercise in patience and endurance. The characters are never established, nor developed enough to even like or dislike them or have much understanding of what motivates anything they do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big waste of time","review":"The Coens went on to make some great films, but this is a real dog. Boring, slow, and it just doesn't make sense. Reading another review, I see that this is a director's cut and much of the film is missing. That might explain why the film is so disjointed. Many questions - few answers. Why does the PI decide to kill Marty instead of the intended victims - he has the money either way? Where did the fake murder photo come from? How does Abby appear in the next room when she locked herself in the bathroom? Why did I actually watch the entire movie?A complete, unedited version of the film might reveal a more satisfying experience but I doubt if it would help the pacing. I love many of the Coens later films, but this should definitely be skipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"Very dated movie, even if into this genre. However if you are into long intense stares off to the side, accompanied by serious music, knock yourself out.I found myself flicking forward to the action and wishing I hadn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blood Simple is a Terrifying Film","review":"I first saw this movie working overnight in a group home. All alone with the lights off, I was terrified. Something about burying people alive terrifies me. The movie shows two very young and inexperienced directors making a horror movie with few special effects and instead paying some great actors. It is scary and wonderful. I saw it in the theaters once and that was great too. A terrific little scary movie with the right combination of suspense, blood and eeriness to make it a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Shock After Another","review":"Blood Simple, by the Coen Bros. (Fargo, Raising Arizona, O Brother Where Art Thou?), is there best film and a must have film for thriller fans.I don't want to spoil the plot, because it really is one shock after another, but here is the basic plot. A bartender who's wife is cheating on him hires a seedy private investagator to kill her and her boyfriend. And things just go down from there. It probally as about 5 turning points to it, you never know what is going to happen next. But, there are a few parts that are kinda useless and the ending is kinda strange, but this is probally the best neo-noir ever. Frances McDormand gives a great performance in this is film. I again recommend this to everyone that enjoys Alfred Hitchcock films or thrillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"But not the Commentary","review":"Yes, this is a great film. Very off-beat, both visually and story-wise. However, I found the 'tonge in cheek' commentary to be STUPID. I guess I missed something. Maybe if you know it is tonge-in-cheek and only listen to the first few minutes of it, then it is ok. I was looking for insite into the making of the film, the dialog, how scenes were shot, who was up for the different parts, etc. You know, the usual commentary. Oh, well. Other than that, I enjoyed the film and have added it to my Coen Brother's library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply bad","review":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Stilted acting, dull characters, lots and lots of blood, really boring scene cleaning up blood for no apparent reason. I can go on: a guy buried alive who returns from the not-so-dead, a climax that is so foul, it'll make you sick (and totally implausable to boot).As you can tell, I didn't like it. My friends say I should see it again to see if I \\"see the light the second time.\\" Unlikely, plus, I'm not sure I could stomach another viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Coen brothers fan","review":"This is my generic Coen brothers film review; \\"Blood Simple\\" is their first film, so I'll stick it here.Somewhere Philip Roth--quoting his mother?--gives his rule for matching pants, shirt, tie, etc.: \\"You can have two plains and one fancy, but you can't have two fancies and one plain.\\" The Coen brothers are nothing but fancy. Or to put it another way, there's a difference between real art informed by modernist self-and-art-consciousness (Godard, Kundera, Roth) and incessant, insufferable film-school smarty-pants solipsism--that's to say, most of the collected works of the Coen brothers.This one is their first, so the ceaseless \\"Notice me! Notice me!\\" of their filmmaking still has a bit of adolescent charm; preferable to the dreary smugness of \\"The Big Lebowski.\\" But it still wears very thin by the end.There's a difference between a movie that's impressive and one that's working way too hard to impress, and if you're not sure what it is, go see a Coen brothers' movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie with Hilarious commentary","review":"The \\"director's cut\\" is pretty much identical to the regular version, but there is a deliberately pompous intro sequence, and an even funnier optional voice over commentary from a pretentious \\"film critic\\" with some real issues. The commentary was obviously written by the Coen brothers themselves as a parody of their academic critics, some of whom become obsessed with trivial details. The account of how the opening sequence was supposedly filmed had me literally rolling on the floor!As for the movie itself, it's a classic neo-noir. All the acting and characters are over-the-top caricatures of film noir \\"types,\\" but even more scary for all that. A great great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blood Simple (1985) \\"The Director's Cut\\"","review":"Unusually for such an exercise it is some three minutes shorter than the original theatrical release. The Coens shortened the film by tightening the editing, shortening some shots and removing others altogether. In addition, they resolved longstanding rights issues with the music: the original theatrical version of the film made prominent use of The Four Tops' \\"_It's the Same Old Song_\\", but this had to be replaced with Neil Diamond's \\"I'm a Believer\\" (made famous by The Monkees' cover) for the US home video edition (though not for international video versions). The \\"directors' cut\\" reinstated the Four Tops track, as the Coens had always intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blood Simple","review":"Filmed on a shoestring budget by Joel Coen and his producer brother Ethan, this heart-pounding homage to 1940s film noir was instantly hailed as a classic of American indie cinema. Featuring Barry Sonnenfeld's innovative camerawork and murky lighting, \\"Simple\\" not only tells a dark, disturbing tale of murder, passion, and back-stabbing meanness, it introduces the marvelously talented McDormand and features a brilliant performance by Walsh as a sleazy, audaciously amoral gumshoe. Inspired by the novels of James M. Cain and Jim Thompson, \\"Blood Simple\\" is a gutsy, dark-comic debut thriller by the directors of \\"Fargo\\" and \\"The Big Lebowski\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Blade","review":"Right out of the box the blade is dull and the grind is poor.

How original.Mordden has some skill as a writer--he knows his craft but his limitations condemn him to rehash his strengths as a writer rather than expand or illuminate them. His conception of the gay movement is blindingly white and his cursory and removed attempt at dealilng with race in homosexual America is laughable and downright ignorant.I am also puzzled by his need to constantly introduce his sexual fantasies and hang ups into his work--I'm not judging them--I just think he should work them out in another tome which is more erotic than it is literate. Not that he ever approaches the latter category. He tries--but obviously knows the right people--how else does someone who writes so mechanically get published so often?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Exactly what we wanted.

The couple's home town of Denton is now an alternate reality, in which, everone resides in a television studio and interacts with the tv programs. Five of the main characters from Rocky appear in this film (four in new roles).

That about sums this movie up, but it's good anyway.I'm a proud owner of a copy of the video, and I whip it out at the slightest provocation. What I especially like about the movie is the rhythm, the feel of it. It belongs to no specific time, it's long-ago and it's now, and it's the future.

Shock Treatment is NOT \\"Rocky Horror, Part II\\". It's in a different place, almost all different people, and has a different target. What Shock Treatment IS, is a fantastic send-up of Donna Reed-type values and surroundings, taken to a Wonder Bread extreme, with very catchy tunes. It is television and mass-media-power as the thought-police, \\"Brazil\\" gone a different direction. So it's less voyeuristic than Rocky Horror, but provides deeper social commentary. The soundtrack is better, but not a nipple in sight. Different movie from RHPS and from everything else, and a good one for all that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does this bird belong to you?","review":"This movie should stand on it's own. To look at it as a sequel to Rocky Horror (as has been said) is unfair (and was poor marketing).It is wonderful and strange, the more you watch it the more you pick up on the things going on.

Jessica Harper has the most beautiful, sultry voice with a vibrato to die for. ST is actually a great work in its own right, an interesting, somewhat arcane, pre-post-modern story about character actors on acid. I'm thinking R.

O'Brien, Patricia Quinn, and Nell Campbell (Little Nell in 'Rocky Horror') return, but play different, less interesting characters.

It has a lot of good artists and if you like techno you'll love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I had more old techno comps after sampling this","review":"This CD is an interesting one. It helps you to see how repetetive some of these tracks might sound, but for '92, these artists were the cutting edge of the growing sound which we all love in raves and everywhere! I loved the Drastik Measures song (one of the first to bring back old melodies that people know into techno environment), especially because they combined the melody that we knew with an original-souding rhythm section unlike today's uhn-tiss-uh-tiss background drums.The only reason why this would fall back in the ratings is for the repetetive, dated feel to the tracks. Most had some element of original thinking in their compositions for the time (and what about the haunting inclusion of the Formicula 4 track?). Interesting to say the least, if you like techno, make sure this is in the collection for posterity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suspense - NO, horror - NO, Boring - DEFINATLY!!","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen.

There are long moments without any background music, or background noise, which makes the actors seems like the are acting in a movie set, not performing real life like. During serious events in the movie, one or two of the characters will be laughing. We felt like the movie was just an avenue for the good looking women in the movie to be introduced to movie goers. Over all, this is not a very entertaining movie. It is nothing like Rio Bravo, or El Dorado. Nothing like them.

Sure, some canned acting, but an enjoyable John Wayne western."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Duke is great as always.","review":"I've been a John Wayne fan since I was a youngster. It's too bad that today's youth has no such admirable actors to look up to. They have self-centered, egotistical, spoiled brats as role-models. The Duke was a real person with standards who he stood for something. Plus, most of all, he loved his country and let everyone know it! All who enjoyed what he gave us will miss him. This movie was a fun time. The story was great. It shows how enemies can put aside their differences for a common cause. Lots of action, horses, cowboys, and a pretty leading lady. What more can a western fan ask for??!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true western classic","review":"Along with Clint Eastwood, John Wayne is the greatest on-screen cowboy of all time. This 1970 western film proves that and so does so many other great movies he's starred in. \\"Rio Lobo\\" has plenty of action and gun fights (The train robbery is especially fun to watch) and some of the dialoge was hilarious.

It also was different than Rio Bravo and El Dorado despite what had been said. It is a great addition to any John Wayne movie collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie!","review":"Howard Hawk's swansong is a good one. The train robbery at the beginning of the movie is exceptionally done, and it gets this film off to a fast start. It sags a bit in the middle, but is bolstered by the comic performance of Jack Elam, who is downright hilarious. Great gunfight at the end. Supporting actors are OK, but could have been a whole lot better. You couldn't find two more beautiful women than Jennifer O'Neill and Sherry Lansing, and they certainly add to the dynamics of the movie.Duke, as usual, delivers a fine performance. The similarities in plot line to El Dorado and Rio Bravo are obvious, but Hawks again does a very nice job. Jack Elam's character really saves this movie, though, because the middle is downright slow. Overall, not John Wayne's best, but good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rio Lobo","review":"Rio Lobo is a great John Wayne movie with a lot of action all the way through.

Throughout all of Paulie's adventures with the different characters in the movie, you're always rooting for Paulie and that he'll find his \\"Marie\\", and the ending leaves you with a \\"feel good\\" feeling.

After being booted out of the house of his owner, the young Marie, Paulie is taken in by a widow (splendid Gena Rowlands) and has other misadventures including a brief stint as a singing parrot with Cheech Marin. Bruce Davison (Willard, Longtime Companion) is the scientist who goes back on his promise to help Paulie locate his Marie; Trini Alvarado has a brief but important role in the movie's climax.

In \\"Barton\\", it's the flaming hotel hallway with John Goodman on a murderous rampage walking through it. In \\"Fargo\\", it's a pregnant policewoman walking through snow drifts; a desperate woman trying to escape from kidnappers while wrapped in a shower curtain; a man being fed into a woodchipper.This movie, while fun, and at some points quite funny, just comes up short on those kind of moments.

It's more an homage to Preston Sturges movies (this movie's title references the film idea by the bleeding-heart director in *Sullivan's Travels*). The three principals (George Clooney, John Turturro, and that other guy) are very funny. Clooney is especially a revelation, delivering lines like \\"You're about as dumb as a bag of hammers\\" with the relish of a man who's feasting on Lobster Neuberg after having not eaten for days.

Glad I finally purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filled with wonderful \\"old timey\\" music","review":"George Clooney is a fast talking con man who cons two other chain gang convicts to escape with him in Depression-era Mississippi. The three convicts go on an episodic odyssey involving blind soothsayers, one-eyed con men, and sexy women who lure the men with their siren song. To top it off, the movie is filled with wonderful \\"old timey\\" music. Watch for homages to other movies including Cool Hand Luke, Sullivan's Travels, and even The Wizard of Oz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it love it love it!","review":"We purchased this movie as a replacement for one we bought when the movie first came out. Somebody \\"borrowed\\" our copy and didn't return it. (When will my husband learn not to lend stuff?????) We love this movie, watch it at least a couple of times a year (and we very seldom watch a movie more than once!)--love the music, the humor, George Clooney in the oddest (for him) and most fun role he has ever played, and his two sidekicks are hoots! All the characters are unique and essential to the story--all played by excellent actors. Every time we watch it we see something new. Also, if you want a movie or a book, Amazon.com is the best! They have always had what I was looking for in stock, at better prices than I can buy it locally, and it gets to me very quickly, even if I don't pay extra to have it shipped extra fast. When I really want something, I go to Amazon.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good entertainment","review":"Don't expect the Odyssey, but expect a very clever movie. Lot's of fun and you'll enjoy seeing it over and over. The entire cast is incredible, and the songs linger in your mind for days afterward. I bought the CD as well as the DVD, just to be able to listen to it in my car.My wife enjoyed it as much as I did, which really surprised me. She was doubtful, at first, but barely into the film she was hooked. She enjoyed the bluegrass music too, and she has never cared for that type of sound before.Although it's not THE Odyssey, it is AN odyssey, a winding story-adventure. I was surprised that George Clooney could pull it off. Some of the lip-synching was off, with the voice not matching the character. All in all, we found it a very good movie, and still watch it from time to time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best recent films you can see...","review":"I think I really rate the best film of 2000. George Clooney hasn't been better (or funnier) before, and the rest of the cast is superb. Works as an adventure story and an eccentric comedy, with the Coen's filmmaking style and clever touches evident. The only unoriginal notion is that of the blues guitarist, which seems to have been lifted from Walter Hill's classic CROSSROADS. Rated PG-13 for language, some animal cruelty, religious humor, and brief violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"5 stars just for the soundtrack alone. This movie was an enjoyable romp through the Old'n South with Dapper Dan in hand, I mean hair. (wink!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie gets funnier everytime we watch it!","review":"After reluctantly watching this movie with my wife, I found that both of us weren't exactly sure what we just saw after it was over, but we were sure that we liked it. In fact, we have watched it 2 more times and now find ourselves laughing more each time we watch it. There is a underlying moral to the story that comes out in the end -- -This is a definite must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twisted Humor - The Perfect Coen Brother's Movie","review":"There isn't much to say about O Brother Where Art Thou. It was crazy and absolutely hilarious. Clooney was very funny and the Coen Brothers did a phenomenal job with its production. I've never laughed this hard at twisted humor like this. Its one of the funniest movies I've ever seen!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's coo","review":"I liked it really, when we rented it I was like \\" I'm not going to watch it, no way.\\" Then I watched for 5 seconds and couldn't stop watching it. It's interesting, not action-packed, it's humorous (not cracking up funny.) My type of of movie. (-:"},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST TOO, TOO FUNNY!!!","review":"This has got to be one of the funniest movies ever made. And one of the cleverest, too. Three guys escape from a chain gang, make a hit record, become \\"rock stars\\" of sorts without knowing it, escape an attack on them by the Ku Klux Klan, survive a flood, become honorary advisors to the Governor and live happily ever after. Along the way, one of them gets turned into a toad by sirens, gets squished, \\"comes back to life\\" where he, coincidentally, meets up with his fellow escapees in a movie theater which, just happens to be filled with inmates from the chain gang they escaped from. Interested? You should be. I have 2 young children and whenever we watch this movie they cannot stop laughing. Neither can I. Rent or buy this movie. Enjoy yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very good- and extremely original!","review":"FILM: O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a great comedy set in the dust bowl-era Mississippi starring George Clooney. The film really captures a unique and timeless feeling and combines that with a great plot and heaps of humor. This movie is a somewhat-unknown wonder that is steadily rising in popularity- rightfully! I liked this quality movie with great acting and direction so much that I bought it on DVD after renting it. I would give this four and a half stars if possible.SPECIAL FEATURES: The special features on this DVD are disappointing, the only one that stands out being \\"Painting with Pixels\\", a suprisingly interesting look at how Mississippi was changed from looking deep green in the summer to dry, barren dust bowl-era autumn. Everything else is very average, and the \\"behind the scenes\\" segment borders on boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"great from the start","review":"I often question the critics \\"rave\\" reviews of items, but on day I saw the video for \\"Man of Constant Sorrow\\" with clips from the movie and it got me intrigued. I didn't know that it was a \\"comedy\\". I rented it to see what it was about and I loved it. I rented it again and had my parents watch it. I don't think that they really got into it though. A co-worker absolutly hated it. Couldn't get through watching it even once. I guess it all depends on you sense of humor. It needs to be pretty off-the-wall to enjoy subtlties like in this movie.Great visual work, great audio work, FANTASTIC casting. Rent it and see what you think first."},{"rating":"2","title":"On my Top Five List!","review":"Of all the movies I have seen, which is quite a few, this one is definitely in my top five movies of all time. It is like no movie I've seen before, no matter how intersesting they may be. It is very rich in symbolism and philosophy, two aspects that make this movie very very unique. An excellent storyline that may interest you to the point where you have to see it numerous times! I'm sure once you see it, you will not be dissappointed, no matter your preferences in movies! Full Five stars!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"O Brother Where Art Thou","review":"I did not care at all for this movie. A friend had asked me to get it for him for Christmas, so we watched it together, and I just didn't like it .

George Clooney plays a wonderful \\"good ole' boy\\" with a hair fixation. Lines like \\"We thought they done luved you up and turned yall into a toad!\\" or \\"Daddy, Momma said you got hit by a train\\", when taken in context will make you roar. It a delightful comedy with a bit of \\"Cool Hand Luke\\" thrown in for good measure (chain gang, \\"man with no eyes\\" sunglass wearing guard, bungling fellow escapees). There's even a bit of the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" at a KKK meeting. Remember the evil witches guards marching and singing. Well it's here too! See this movie, you'll love it, or at the very least be entertained. Isn't that what it's all about?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pinnacle of the Coen Brothers' career","review":"I have always been a Coen Brothers fan. I was hooked when I saw \\"Blood Simple\\" in the theater. While I liked \\"No Country for Old Men,\\" I keep coming back to \\"O Brother...\\" as my favorite. The soundtrack, the imagery, and the characters are exquisite. Many people refer to the Homer's \\"The Odyssey\\" as the main filmic reference this movie. While that is true to a large extent, \\"O Brother...\\" is also an homage to Americana. And it's not only the music. From references to Busby Berkeley (the men on the chain gang as the movie opens move in syncopated rhythm like the swimmers and dancer of the early Berkely films), to the \\"Wizard of Oz,\\" Chris Thomas King's \\"Robert Johnson-like\\" character who sold his soul to the devil at the cross-roads to learn to play guitar, to the James Agee and Walker Evans Depression Era photography, \\"O Brother...\\" is a gorgeous culmination of over 100 years of American filmmaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS MOVIE","review":"I watched this movie over and over again while on deployment, never tiring of it. It is so good, I've bought it three times (the first copy was stolen, the second copy was played so much it was destroyed). It's a must have for my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soggy Bottom Brothers Triumph! (zone 2 japanese)","review":"How good is this movie? With over 300 reviews on this site, most of them 5 star, it's probably all been said, but for my own 2 cents, George Clooney re-impresses me again with his utterly hilarious playing of Ulysses Everett McGill. I start laughing just when I think of these guys! Pete and Delmar! Dapper Dan hair gel! And the rockin roots blues and bluegrass that give a whole other level of earnestness to the story. For soundtrack and cinematography alone the movie could take awards. But it's greatest acheivement is the performance of the actors and the very hilarious dialalogues and scenarios that run throughout the movie. Nothing less than 5 stars will do!My import version (Japan zone 2) has lots of interviews and behind the scenes shots as well as a video (\\"I am a man of constant sorrow\\"), trailers, etc. It doesn't have subtitles in English however. Japanese or none."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOWN HOME AND FUNNY","review":"I found this movie refreshingly funny. The type of movie you can and want to watch over and over again. A must to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE!!","review":"The first time I saw this movie I arrived late at the theatre, and not knowing about that the movie was based on Homer's \\"Odyssey\\", or that it was set in the 1930's (or so), I wasn't influenced by any expectations of this movie. The first time around, I thought it was witty and funny, but a mediocre film.I finally got around to watching it a second time all the way through. Since then, I have become a Coen affecionado, discovering more and more the subtle yet hilarious comedy that the Coen brothers seem to flavor all their movies with. I HAD to go out and buy this film, and I've watched the movie about a dozen times now, finding it more funny every time. One of my most-watched DVD's in my collection.I recommend giving it a try - and if you've seen it once and didn't like it, I recommend giving it a second chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, smart, and most of all INTERESTING","review":"My favorite thing about this movie was that it was unpredictable. The characters, the writing, and the folk music are all free of standard Hollywood cliches. I really enjoyed looking for parallels to the Odyssey while watching the movie, and it made me want to reread the Odyssey and then watch O Brother again to pick up on all of the allusions. Although this movie will make you think, it is also extremely funny, and has a creative and engaging storyline. You don't need to know anything about The Odyssey to enjoy it either--it's good entertainment on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very very entertaining movie.","review":"First, and foremost, I am a bluegrass fanatic, so that is what drew me to this movie. I also had the soundtrack to this movie since the day it became available. I find this movie very entertaining and while not totally historically accurate, who cares? It was one of those movies that left you feeling good. As for the music, I'm a Ralph Stanley fan (who wrote or recorded a lot of the songs in the movie) and I love Dan Tyminski (who is the voice you here when Clooney supposedly sings. Dan was once a member of Allison Krauss and Union Station) and I have followed him for years. How refreshing to hear Dan's voice coming from George Clooney's mouth!! At first I didn't think that George would be able to pull off this role, but he did a fantastic job as Ulysses Everett McGill. The other two \\"cons\\" were perfectly casted and John Goodman was his ever brillant self. This movie is worth watching and owning!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I am a fan of previous Coen brother films. Thought I would enjoy this one - wrong.

Instead of the mythologized characters made famous in the Odyssey the monsters are human most notably the one eyed bible salesmen played by John Goodman acting as a human Cyclopes and the unscrupulous man who tried to steal Ulysses family from him. In order to regain his family, Ulysses must battle both the human monsters of the modern world and the monsters contained in nature still exist between floods and intense rains. Throughout the journey home, the escaped group of convicts encounter obstacles that nod toward the historical roots of The Odyssey from the previously mentioned Cyclopes to the Sirens...a group of very attractive women who hypnotize one of the prisoners leaving him without clothes.

I sat and watched this long, slow drawn out movie and started getting itchy pants. Nothing happens for what seems like hours. The dialogue is sometimes fast (Clooney), but always irritating.

I will not try and explain all symbolism and references to Homer or other works.

This is a story of conversion. There were many. The most dramatic conversion is near the end when Everett, who is like our modern day pagans, sees the prophecy of the blind old man come true. The blind man could see, and unlike most secularist, like Everett, who cannot and will not.

But it is worth seeing for the acting (George Clooney is greasy and good) and the wonderful down-home America music. A member of a Missouri Bluegrass Band told me this movie is a great showcase for bluegrass. And it is. But the film lags when the music fades down, although it rises to a super high at a critical moment, a big gathering, where the music of the fugitives even gets the Governor a dancing.

I absolutely despised the Big Lebowski after the first run in my VCR. But after being stuck with it and stuck without cable on Staten Island... Gave it a couple more shots, and each time the movie got better. \\"Oh Brother...\\" is no different. I think it comes down to how willing you are to suspend disbelief-- most can't the first time they see something on the big screen (self included). The lush bluegrass as the perpetual foundation will win over even Public Enemy to DJ Rap fans (read: anyone). No real morals, no real messages (the same stuff heavyweight Mark Twain promised he would take a shot at somebody for expecting)-- just good \\"old timey\\" fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie; Bad Blu-Ray","review":"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. However, the Blu-Ray version has serious problems. It will play in an older Sony Blu-Ray player, but it won't play in my newer Sony Blu-Ray player. After over an hour on the phone with tech support at Sony, I learned that many new Blu-Ray discs are having problems and they cannot keep up with the firmware upgrades. Since Sony is one of the originators of the Blu-Ray format, I am obviously disappointed. They said that only if enough customers call in with the same problem will they commit the time to make their player work with a disc based on their technology. Before purchasing a newer release on Blu-Ray I would recommend verifying that the manufacturer of your Blu-Ray player has already verified compatibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a Pleasure to Watch","review":"Glad to see this on Blu Ray. It's hard to pick which Coen Brothers movie is the best but this is certainly one of the most enjoyable with a typical imaginative, skillful Coen screenplay and great music.

When released on DVD, I took the opportunity to rent \\"Oh Brother\\" and \\"had a ball!\\" The cast was perfect, Clooney was excellent, the plot was hilarious and the music was terrific. I never imagined the story was actually a loose (depression era) representation of Homer's \\"The Odyssey\\" and, as such, was fun to spot the similarities between the two journeys. \\"Oh Brother Where Art Thou\\" was a very enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never trust a one eyed bible sales man","review":"I have to say the \\"O Brother Where Art Thou\\" is one of the most delightful films I have ever viewed. I really enjoy George Clooney so this film was a must see for me, but there is so much more to this movie. Acting barely scratches the surface. The cinematography was lovely and the script was very very well written. But lets not forget the music. I never knew how much I loved bluegrass, American roots music until I bought the soundtrack. Then when I saw \\"O Brother\\" the music and the movie just meshed together so well. Plus the extra features on the DVD version are swell. Definatly worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a light-hearted movie should be.","review":"The soundtrack really sets the tone for this well paced journey. Not too fast, not too slow, the Coen brothers show us depression era America and some of it's famous faces.

The quirky characters and situations keep the pace up and lead you through this amusing story."},{"rating":"2","title":"O Brother Where Art Though DVD/ Through Amazon.com","review":"The DVD is exactly what I expected.

George Clooney is Ulysses, but of course one can't take him too seriously in the role. He gets some fine help from John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson, as the three convicts make their escape from a chain gang. Along the way we are introduced to a strange assortment of characters (What would you expect?) held together by a well-conceived storyline that doesn't fail to deliver a fine ending. T-Bone Burnett provides an inspiring Folk and Prison Blues soundtrack that resurrected James Carter singing Po Lazarus. While the movie has more than a passing nod to Sullivan's Travels, it moves along at its own brisk pace, as the hapless trio seek its redemption via a series of obstacles that would have made old Preston Sturges smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"This movie was very nice.

George Clooney felt like he was acting...only the always excellent John Turturro was believable for me. The music was effective and really crucial to setting the mood of each scene. ..in fact, that may have been the most entertaining part of the whole movie.

The Wizard of Oz. Notice that the three overtake three guards (aka monkeymen) and are on a quest to save a decent person (blues singer - Dorothy). The fire is a predominant factor in hurting the singer (Witch's broom on fire). My first thought was that this scene was lifted from the Wizard of Oz rather than the Busby Berkeley aspects, the later of which are apparent in the choreography of the march scene.

I guess \\"loosely\\" is a key word here; you won't find much Homeric imagery in this movie.But one thing that does seem to be adapted from Homer is the style of the story, which is not so much a single plot as a succession of adventures loosely strung together. Here the Cohen brothers did a good job of constructing a series of adventures that are worth the telling, and are up to their usual standards of presentation.I found the prominent use of bluegrass music throughout the movie a little hit-and-miss. It helped set the tone of the movie, but was somewhat distracting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a surprise!","review":"I rented this movie because I had heard very little about it and was curious about a George Clooney movie that wasn't all over the media.

For me, being quite familiar with the story, \\"O Brother\\" came alive. Those scenes that \\"dont help the plot along\\" are actually cleverly inserted parallels to stories contained in the Odyssey. For example, the Sirens, the Cyclops, Ulysses' decent into hell, and fighting against his wife's suitors. Nearly every scene had a clever parallel, which made this movie more enjoyable ten-fold. Add the ingenuity with a genuinely funny screen-play and a stand-out performance by George Clooney, and you got yourself a winner.

But this is not the reason why I dislike it.I dislike this film because there are so many excellent Clive Cussler books that deserve being turned into big movies, and because of the sheer awfulness of this film, Cussler has turned down all offers for deals on the other books in his Dirk Pitt series. So there will be no more Dirk Pitt films, all thanks to this pile of rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word, don't.","review":"Any resemblance between this film and Clive Cussler's novel is purely accidental. If you want a prime example of how \\"Hollywood\\" can butcher a film adaptation of a book, here it is. The sequence of events doesn't come anywhere close to the book, and the ending is so different you will wonder if the screenwriter bothered to read it first.There is one plus; John Barry's score is powerful and majestic.

If they had any sense at all, the TITANIC will never be raised from the ocean floor. It would be prohibitively expensive.Also, they applied explosives to try and raise it. If one was crazy enough to try that, the TITANIC would be blown apart.The acting may have been good but the whole basic idea of the film was a catastrophic mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Titanic Stinker","review":"Somehow they took one of the best adventure novels ever written and wrote one of the worst screenplays ever produced.

It is so well written that he takes you down to the two and a half mile depths to raise the mighty ship in order to recover a rare ore. Then he takes you into the eye of a hurricane with a group of Navy Seals who must battle Russian Commandoes on board the raised ship as it sways every which way in the storm. Heady Stuff. 1980-Paramount studios decided to turn the book into a movie. They went down the list of unemployed TV actors and totally miscast them in this movie. They even ignored one of the three principle charactors-not even bothering to cast him. In this story, the story is the story and no amount of special effects will rescue this overacted, poorly directed, horribly casted excuse for a motion picture. The author was so disgusted with Paramount's effort that it was another twenty two years until he trusted another studio to talk to them. DON'T BUY THIS VIDEO. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"It cost a lot, it was a flop!","review":"This film cost a hell of a lot to make (deja vu!) however it did not receive the 11 oscars the other more recent film received.

Producer Lew Grade was responsible for a string of terrible, 'all-star' films in the 1970s - 'The Cassandra Crossing' being another one - and of this he said that it would have been cheaper to lower the Atlantic. A fortune was spent on it, something like $40 million dollars at a time when that was huge, and the end result is a film which, although not as bad as legend has it, is nonetheless terribly dated and stilted.In its favour, the effects are quite good, there's a superb score by John Barry, and the image of the Titanic sailing into New York harbour half a century late is poignant. But against it... there isn't any memorable dialogue, the acting is completely blank (a film which wastes Jason Robards is a bad film indeed), and it just goes on and on and on. And on.

I absolutely love the real kids reader series! The topics and photos are perfect for the average beginning reader to relate to. The level 1 text is in a large font, has many high frequency words and has a phonetic theme (aka many short i words) without sacrificing the story. So many level 1 readers are either way too hard for a beginning reader or are so preoccupied with phonics that the story is sacrificed. I found that the real kids readers are a perfect balance. They allow children to use a variety of reading strategies while providing them a story they can relate to and enjoy. I have purchased a number of both level 1 and level 2 books to use with my son... And we have enjoyed all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IF YOU LIKE G.HACKMAN YOU MUST TARGET THIS MOVIE","review":"Gene Hackman is one of my favorite actors, and he doesn't let me down on this one. Actually, I think this is one of his best films. He sounds pretty natural speaking several European languages as if he's always spoke them.

To start, the 2 CD's in this collection are labeled white on gold with microscopic characters so you cannot read under normal circumstances. But actually there is nothing to read because other than the pianist name and copy rights, the discs are not labeled (you can label them after listening). But these are the minor problems. I guess I have a problem with Schnabel: he makes everything extreme; piano is too quiet, forte is too loud, fast is to fast, slow is too slow. It is so \\"Hot or Cold\\" I could get the flu. You would think that sonata No 21 is fool proof, but when Schnabel plays it, the first movement goes so fast, it turns into a blur of sounds. The second movement so slow, you get bored. Then the 33 variations... I could not master the discipline to finish them more than once. If you were after sonatas No. 30 and 32, I would opt for Brendel's recording anyhow.

Peter, the middle child, has a very hard time adjusting and fights with his dad every time they speak. But when Peter finds a strange object that transports him back in time to see some of Wales' amazing history, he gradually softens and the family grows closer together once again.

Even after several listenings, I am ready to listen again. This recent paperback purchase was a gift to the child of a friend. The magical flows together and mixes delightfully with everyday reality in this utterly charming book. Celtic mythology, a taste of the mystery of Wales, an experience of the timelessness of time--all blend seamlessly in this story of adjustment to loss and change as each of the main characters comes of age! I highly reccommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it","review":"Although many people I know enjoyed this book, I simply could not get in to it. It's somewhat hard to follow because the author hops from character to character.

The heroic and yet lyrical, passionate and yet aloof qualities of this work in the total equilibrium demonstrated in this performance evokes as comparison only the earlier recording of this by Pollini himself - with the VPO. Here, Pollini is even more biting and incisive in the heroic passages, utterly devastating in terms of emotion and expression.The game does appear to be Pollini vs. Pollini, with only Pollini being capable of defeating himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brahms and Pollini Mix like Oil and Water...","review":"Don't get me wrong, Pollini is and always will be one of my favorite pianists; it's just that his temperament is diametrically opposed to that of Brahms. Brahms is warm, lush, and emotional while Pollini is dry, precise, and clinical. This style never suits Brahms well, and this CD quickly pales in comparison to such mature interpretations as Arrau's or Rubinstein's. For example, the entrance of the piano in the first movement is characterized by a passionate and willful longing; Pollini simply gives us a boring, metronomical account devoid of depth or substance. In my opinion, he should stick to Beethoven and composers of the 20th century (listen to his recordings of Beethoven's late Sonatas and Stravinsky's Petrouchka) because it is disappointing to hear such a masterful pianist miss the point so completely. If you purchase this CD, I can assure you that you will be musically unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Let Down","review":"Couldn't play the DVD once I received it.

The story of a man captured by Indians and then over time gains their respect and becomes one of them is both engrossing and thought provoking. The film is laced with equal amounts of heartache and laughter.Considering that most of this film is spoken in the native's tongue with no sub titles, it's amazing that you do not get bored or confused. Of course some of the dialogue is spoken in English by another prisoner of the tribe, so there is some sort of narrative to keep you up to speed.The film also has a pretty shocking scene(for the times)when \\"Horse\\" is initiated into the tribe, but it is not over emphasized. This was the first film I ever saw Harris in and remains one of my favorites of his film career."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars ONLY for entertainment","review":"I give this move 4 stars only for it's entertainment value/action/adventure, NOT for any degree of alleged historical accuracy, nor was it a \\"true depiction\\" of the Sioux Indians.

If you look at the fact that Sioux Indians were in the North West, then why did his companion, who spoke French, was the way of Indians in the lower East of America.Besides that, why did Harris's character, who after living with the Indians for so long, never bothered to even learn their language. At one point, he is teaching his new wife english...how sad. But, that's Hollywood, and this is an exploitation Hollywood-style, of the true and authentic Indian Cultures.Terrible acting, sound and editing, stay away from this one. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MAN CALLED BLOAT","review":"This is a silly tale to come out of the so called 'enlightened 70's' when the white man was viewed with evil suspicion. It deals with a man from England who goes on to become a savior to a band of poor and starving Sioux Indians in the 1840's when they accept him as part of the tribe. Poignantly sadistic and offensive to the actual Sioux ritual of the Sun dance, it merely accommodates the new role of Harris as a Christ-like benefactor while objectifying the Indians as a tribe of incoherent savages. Once again, the view point is told by an outsider who functions solely to play the role of 'savior'. One scene is especially tedious and tritely when a tribe of Shawnee attack the Sioux encampment and Harris gathers all the Sioux and leads them like an 1800's era gun ensemble to fight off the attacking horsemen! \\"First row fire, second row hold!\\"... It's no wonder why white people never fully understood Native American culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Man Called Horse","review":"A one dimensional portrayal of the Sioux. The movie is told as seen by an outsider or \\"captive\\" point of view. The Sioux in this movie are shown to be ignorant, dirty savages - indicative of the norm of public thought leading up to the time the movie was made. The \\"indians\\" in this movie do a lot of yelling and whooping, pointing at objects with spears, and jumping around in front of bon fires. The \\"indians\\" much resembled the neanderthals in \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\". This film would make a great study for college courses. It shows much of the ignorant one-sided misconceptions about Native Americans held by early America up to the late 1970's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"This comforter set is a great deal for the price.

Andrew Bird is not a singer-guitarist, but a singer-violinist, and he uses violin, played both classically and plucked like a guitar, through this quirky album of beautiful songs. Opener 'First Song' is more traditional alt-country balladeering, but tracks like 'I' display a quirky charm and a flair for offbeat rhythm and instrumental sounds. Meanwhile the title track is the album's centrepiece, a gorgeous epic awash in classical string playing, almost a sonata in its own right. At this stage its tempting to call him a composer, but there's a pop sensibility to these songs and a sort of back-country, American twang to them that places it firmly in an area of its own. With beautiful, swaying vocals, this could beat more conventional singer-songwriters any day, and is really worth investigation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alert","review":"This book seris is not like other books created by Nancy Rue.

The Combi is all these things. HOWEVER, the flimsy back of the stroller cannot be locked into position and the padding is attached with velcro. Even when strapped in snuggly using the 5-point harness (and several frustrating adjustment straps), my 22lb 6 month old can pull himself forward by the snack tray, pulling the cushion and the seat back forward.

Like most of his works, Our Lady of the Flowers has a fragmented plot. It's centered around a murderer, a pimp, and a queen, in a netherworld in which murder is highly erotic and alluring and evil is regarded as sensuous and good. This novels pummels the readers with beautiful and vile imagery, a story within a story that breaks the fourth wall as we follow Jean Genet (who tells us himself the story is only written for masturbatory purposes) in prison, dreaming of luxury and secret worlds.

I kept losing track of who was who, which one is supposed to be Genet (because I had the distinct impression that this novel might be autobiographical), sorting out the names and sequences of events, and trying to find a storyline that would last long enough to hold my interest. Genet would start on a good story and then all of a sudden jump in another reflection from that, never satisfactorily returning or finishing the original story.It's very sexual and delves into the world of transvestism, but ultimately left me more confused than ever about what Genet was trying to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty chocolate that's perfectly permissable for low-carb followers","review":"I don't know, maybe it's because dark chocolate isn't as sweet as regular chocolate anyway, but I found these sugar-free dark chocolate bars absolutely satisfying and delicious.

Shelleyian Orphan make a kind of song oriented, rustic folk.This reminds me a small amount of Fairport Convention, but Orphan is a modern band with shiny digital production.

The group seems to emerge from the A&M; Phil Ochs, Fairport and Nick Drake school of 1960s orchestral folk.Nothing on Helleborine will make you draw a direct line to any of this music, but the impulses are firmly there, and Shelleyan Orphan use these underpinnings to make their music work"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Alive 1, 2, 4","review":"The 'Love Alive' Series of albums (CDs) set the standard for gospel music.

Isabeau (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Navarre (Rutger Hauer) are doomed to be \\"eternally together, forever apart.\\" By day, she is a hawk. By night, he is a wolf. Who can save them? A young thief named Mouse (Matthew Broderick) The fairy tale has inventive twists on the standard fantasy genre. The noble Navarre is a Dark Knight, his opponents are clad in white, including the evil bishop (John Wood) The Mouse is the good thief. Isabeau has cropped hair,as if she were a nun,or of the more androgynous type. Leo McKern (of the Prisoner series) is a repentant priest. To top it all off,there's music from the Alan Parsons Project.\\"Ladyhawke\\" has plenty of romance and suspense. There's a bittersweet quality to Isabeau and Navarre's romance. One wonders if they'll be reunited in the end and their curse broken. For a romance,it's amazing.

The conceit of the lady being a hawk by day and her sweetiepie a wolf by night is clever. And it's decently executed here by director Donner, and stars Broderick, Hauer, Pfeiffer and McKern. But the music score? Who, even in the 80s, thought that something like this was a good idea for a medieval story? This awful score would barely do justice to a Starsky & Hutch or Magnum PI--where it actually might kind of properly belong. My wife and I watched the film recently and were practically rolling on the floor with laughter as this 80s musical kitsch filled our living room coincidentally with scenes from a medieval fantasy. It absolutely ruins the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool movie","review":"I don't expect anything more of a movie than to enjoy it and be entertained. I don't seek to psychoanalyze or offer up in-depth critique, it's only a movie. I either enjoy it or I don't.I love watching this one on a dreary rainy day.

I'm no techie, but I am very visual, and practically purred over the improvement. It was like discovering the movie all over again. If you are hesitating, I can say that my purchase through David Ho (boyoyo) went smoothly. It took a bit of time to get here from Hong Kong, but nothing unreasonable. And the disk was unopened and in perfect condition. In fact, I used to have to fix the language setting on my dvd, but no such issues here. Wonderful!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Clean Fun","review":"Michelle Pfeiffer has truly got to be the most beautiful woman ever. And before he was Ferris, Matthew was a cute little sidekick.

The only problem was I thought I ordered in on CD, but it came in VHS. Good thing I still have my VCR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uniquely Beautiful","review":"This is a family favorite and I never get tired of the soundtrack. In fact, I bought the CD so I could listen to the main theme whenever. After seeing scores of generic Robin Hood, Seahawk and other medieval-type movies (with their generic, classical-music type soundtracks), Ladyhawke is something wonderfully different. It's a quiet, rather thoughtful movie, yet sports several well-done action scenes. If you're into horses at all, you will love the cathedrel fight.See it at least once. You'll never forget the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Story With Some Awsome Music","review":"Ladyhawk is my all time favorite movie (along with my favorite music). Ever since I saw it as a little girl I have been intrigued by this film. It has all the elements of a great film. There is love, tragedy, action, and comic relief. In my opinion the music in this film is esquisite. To say it doesn't fit suggest that those people have a weak imagination. This music is what drew me to the film. It has a heroic yet tradgic love all in one. If you can't hear that you must be deaf. There are several clips that I love because of the music itsef. The score at the beginning, the first fight with Nauva, when he is looking at sunset, when Isabeau first apears, when Isabeau is hurt, when the hawk flies over the water, when they almost touch, and the end when they do touch. So there you have it. Those are just a few parts that give me butterflies in my stomach because of the MUSIC! So like I said before if those of you can't see that poo on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flaming Falcon","review":"I really liked this movie. At first I only wanted to watch it because it starred Matthew Broderick. But, after watching it, I found it to be a wonderful movie, containing a fabulous love story.

The only viewing choices are \\"fullscreen\\" which means (at least on my flatscreen TV) the sides of the picture are cut off and the image stretched to fit the TV from top to bottom; or, on the flip side of the disc, the so-called \\"letterbox\\" version, where the film is presented in its original ratio, but in an absurdly small rectangle in the middle of the screen.You'd think if the studio was going to go to the expense of transferring a film to disc, they'd take at least a little more care with it. As it is, this version's not even worth paying Amazon's discounted price for; buy it used. Or, better, just rent it."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Love","review":"This is one of those movies that never go out of 'fashion'. I saw this when it first came out and bought it on VHS. The stars were so very young and relatively unknown at the time. Who would have ever dreamed that a young Matthew Broderick would be acting with Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfieffer?The storyline,simply put: star crossed lovers doomed to never meet again because of the jealousy of a wicked Bishop.Well, they do meet, albeit ever so momentarily at dawn, before the sun rises and touches their eyes and Rutger is once again human but Michelle becomes a Hawk. Their desire is to break the curse and continue their lives. Thus the story continues.Of course Rutger and Michelle are the lovers and poor Matthew is the child caught in the middle. Well, he's more of a soul that gets caught up in the power of love.I would say that anyone who likes a good love story, or a good fighting with swords and such love story would like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Average","review":"While the idea behind this movie has great potential its actual execution was rather blase. The soundtrack takes away from the story instead of enhancing it, the acting is not that great, and the script is kind of silly. Its entertaining in its own way but definitely not something I'd watch more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, great cast, the music needed work.","review":"I said it all in the summary, really. I liked the plot"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is **NOT** formatted for Widescreen","review":"First off, Ladyhawke is a great movie that stands the test of ages. The movie gets a 5/5 or higher if I could rate it higher.But the DVD is unwatchable. It comes with two sides: one side is for the standard screen, and the other side is reported to be the \\"widescreen\\" version. Fair enough. Except that it isn't. The \\"widescreen\\" version is standard screen but squished down so that the wide version can fit in the standard screen. So on a flatscreen TV the image occupies at most only half of your screen area.I guess it is fine if you do have a regular TV, but since flat screen is now pretty much the norm, just don't buy this DVD. It is better not to watch Ladyhawke than to watch this. At least it was only $5 I flushed down the toilet but I was looking foward to seeing it again. Hopefully it will come out on Blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent film!!","review":"I have always loved this movie. My one complaint is the musical score - what were they thinking?!? The music is so inappropriate to the genre as to be almost laughable ... if it did not distract so much from the overall quality of the picture. I would give it five stars if it weren't for the score. However, the story and the cinematography are quality enough to offset the aural assault (though the special effects are very 1985). Mathhew Broderick is endearing, Rutger Hauer moody and Michelle Pfieffer is ... well ... Michelle Pfeiffer. A great film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, Alan Parsons? Whyyy?","review":"This movie has excellent acting and a great plot. It also has the absolute worst score I've ever heard, by far. I tried to ignore it, but it would not be ignored. The Alan Parsons soundtrack completely ruined the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, horrible DVD!","review":"The movie itself is pretty good. More of a \\"chick-flick\\" than I'd like, but it still has a compelling storyline, and will be loved by romantics. Good acting too. The soundtrack, however, leaves a lot to be desired. Very dated and tired.However, the biggest problem by far is the DVD menu, which is terrible to the point of being almost unusable. When playing this on a brand new Samsung upscaling DVD player it defaulted to English subtitles, and wouldn't yield the disc menu. Turning those subtitles off proved extremely difficult, as the DVD constantly got locked up. At one point I had to unplug the player just to get it to respond. After 10 minutes of messing about and three more freezes the subtitles finally went away.I know it's not my DVD player, as I've watched other discs with no problems. So be warned, this DVD is not well structured, and might freak out newer players, regardless of their quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality DVD","review":"Fine movie, but I was very disappointed in the quality of the DVD. I already owned the VHS version of this movie and it was one of my kids' favorites. I bought the DVD to take advantage of the better sound and to get the widescreen format. Unfortunately, the quality of the print or the equipment used for the DVD transfer was awful. During the climactic scene where the lovers confront the bishop, there is visible dirt that shows up as a dark mark on the bishop's vestments. When I tried to clean my TV screen, I discovered the \\"dirt\\" was part of the DVD.

So it was with much anticipation that I recently sat down to watch it. Well, it stunk. What a disappointment. The only really good thing in there is Leo McKern, who shines forth like a beacon in a fog of wooden acting and stilted dialogue. Show 'em how it's done, Leo.Michelle Pfeiffer is beautiful to look at, but her role is limited. Matthew Broderick is clearly inexperienced this early in his career, and delivers his lines without any panache whatsoever, which hampers the film, since his character is supposed to be a quick-witted thief. Fortunately, he has come a long way as an actor since then. Rutger Hauer is just plain bad.In defense of the director and crew, the film is prettily shot (with the exception of the poorly choreographed climactic fight scene) in well lit, scenic locations.Otherwise, I would not recommend this film to anyone with expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I remembered watching this movie as a child, and had high hopes that it would be an enjoyable medieval adventure. I was severely disappointed.The soundtrack was truly terrible. At the most inappropriate moments throughout the movie one would be beset by a cacophony of pounding 80s electronica. So distracting and overwhelming was it that it was easy to lose tract of the movie.The movie itself was appalling. The characters were flat and unbelievable, and good actors did not manage to carry poor dialogue. Oh dear."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best romantic fantasy ever","review":"I first saw this film back in 1987 over at a high school friend's house and have loved Isabeau and Navarre ever since.

I think the 80s was one of the greatest movie decades ever. Ladyhawke had a captivating, but easy to follow plot. The soundtrack is a little unusual (rock and roll setting in medieval story), but Ladyhawke pulls it off. Really it just adds to the charm, cause they don't do movies like this anymore in the new century. So it's kind of an escape back to childhood for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!","review":"LadyHawke is a movie that will always be in my collection!Its a wonderful tale of a boy who escapes from an unescapable prison only to end up helping out two lovers who are cursed.The man turns into a wolf during the night and the woman,a hawk during the day.Its a beautifully done story of how faith keeps us going so that we may face the ones who would try to stop us from getting what it is that we deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Romance/Action Adventure","review":"Ladyhawke is an 80s treat.

I thought it had a really good story, something which is often lacking in movies these days. The fantasy and romance aspects were, I thought, well done. In the end, the curse is undone, the bad guy gets his dues, and the lovers are reunited!I thought the acting of the male lead (Rutger Hauer) was a little understated. But then, it was SO refreshing to see a movie like this that wasn't full of arguing, yelling, and stupid, overdone special effects.The only irritating aspect is the character of Phillipe. Early in the movie, he talks too much, far more than a man on the run would.

Matthew Broderick does a wonderful job as \\"the Mouse\\", and it is a joy to watch him as a much younger actor. The struggle of Isabeau and Navaar is also fascinating to see. This unique stroyline of lovers that are cursed to only see each other in their true form for less than a second as they transform is touching, and at times heartbreaking. Give it a shot. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far Over-Priced!!!","review":"Fifty bucks for a no-frills, plain old DVD of Ladyhawke? I've always liked this movie, but GET REAL!!!

Gray with red mane??? It's just another part of the adventure which is never dull, often rich and striking to the eye, and definately satisfying in the conclusion. Highly recommend this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"For immature audiences only","review":"Somehow in my mind I got this movie mixed up with Willow and purchased it on DVD. If you like (bad)early 80's synth music this is for you, otherwise the only apeal here is breathtaking cinematography that unfortunately gets swamped by both the music and the really really lame execution of what should have been a great plot.

Not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"great movie, poor presentation","review":"The film was not delivered in HD, it was letter boxed in low resolution, streaming performance was poor.. very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movie of the 1980s","review":"Wide Screen review gave both 3 stars for audio and video. I would disagree. The Dolby surround 5.1 on this mid 1980s movie is simply wonderful. You can hear horse galloping, draw bridge, and jungle sound from your surround channel. The only drawback is not enough bass. But the Dolby Digital sound is wonderful. No problem with the picture as well. Bright and clear. This movie is certainly the best movie for Richard Donner (as director), Michelle Pfeiffer (as the leading actress) and Rutger Hauer and Matthew Broderick(as the leading actors). You should know the storyline by now, about a couple who were cursed. One to be hawk at day the other as wolf as night so they can never meet as human being. Wonderful movie and excellent DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies of all time.","review":"A beautiful story, with just the right touch of comedy. This movie was a milestone in fantasy movies. Very few good fantasy and sci fi movies had been made up to this point, and few have been made since. Most are hack and slash barbarians, or really hokey magickal effects, but this movie has the beautiful plot, scenery and perfect characters for their parts. I recommend this one highly. It's one of my all time favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Medieval action reaches a new summit.","review":"A trully enjoyable movie. The selection of stars is unique and it works. Aided by an excellent supporting cast Pfeiffer, Hauer and Broderick really put the magic on the screen. I don't understand people griping about Brodericks monologues. If anything, they don't belong with Woody Allen so much as with Shakespeare. It is a classical case of comic relieve. The action is fast-paced and the fights, coordinated by the same man who worked for Lester in the Three Musketeers are particularly thrilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful fantasy love story","review":"Ladyhawke is a wonderful love story about two cursed lovers and a young petty theif that helps them in their quest to make things right. I loved this video because there was just something magical about the entire story and I thought the acting was really good for the young cast. It is one of those movies you want to watch over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful! But what a horrible soundtrack...","review":"I love this movie very much. I liked the film's storybook feel, and the theme of starcrossed lovers. The story is very charming. Isabeau is lovely- apprently vulnerable, but actually strong. Navarre is truly your knight in shining armor...and the thief and the monk are quite funny and enjoyable to watch. What makes viewing this movie painful is the terrible, unfortunate soundtrack. What were they thinking?? It sounds like it's straight out of one of those little Casio machines they used to sell at airports in the 80s. Even the music on some of those cheesy local furniture store ads that are broadcast on cable sound better! They should re-release this movie with a new soundtrack- as another reviewer said- something Celtic maybe- anything, but this! The four stars are for the movie- it would have been five, but for the soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"A medieval masterpiece","review":"Ladyhawke is one of the greatest films ever made, in my opinion. It is not campy nor predictable, as many historical pieces have been. The storyline is imaginative, the players phenomenal (especially Matthew Broderick in his finest role and one of the truly great roles of film in general; he should have won an Oscar, imo), the cinematography rich and stunning, and the directing right on target. My only nit is the music. Though I have enjoyed Alan Parsons's work in the past, his style doesn't mesh with the mystical mood of this film, particularly the opening piece. The music becomes less noticeable the further you get into the movie, maybe because the story is so compelling. If medieval mysticism draws you, this is a must-see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Why is this guy claiming to be Dominican when his only good songs are of Colombian origin.

Not sure why it is not more well know, if you like action this is you ticket. From the opening scene (dog fight) to the closing scene (shootout) it is nonstop action. Lee Marvin, Angie Dickinson and Carl Weathers (Apollo Creed guy) are in the cast in addition to Bronson. Ms. Dickinson has a couple of makeout scenes but she takes a backseat to the amourous \\"Buffalo Woman\\" in the shack. The setting is the Canadian Rockies and is \\"based on a true story\\" from the 1920's or so. The mountain scenery is breathtaking. The movie is filled with sleazy tough guy/mountain men...a real testosterone fest. Vintage weapons, clothing and vehicles add alot to this film. Bronson gets to deliver a few one liners (and .44 caliber lobotomies) that will crack you up. You will like this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent print and classic stars.","review":"Nice to see this film on DVD at last. Lee Marvin reunited with Angie Dickinson once again, having previously appeared together in The Killers (1964) and Point Blank (1967). Bronson's role is similar to the one he played in Chato's Land."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rugged, if not a very believable tale.","review":"Old stone-face doesn't get any stonier than this. He plays a trapper named Johnson (Canadian Rockies?, circa 1920s) who happens across a dog, half dead after a vicious dog fight, and takes it home and nurses it. The sleeze-ball owner, who sold the dog to Johnson, now has second thoughts and leads a posse to kill the trapper and retrieve his dog. After this goes awry, they enlist the aid of the local constable (Lee Marvin as a Mountie?) and the chase is on. Although the basic plot is too hard to swallow, the film has much to like, including some beautiful, rugged scenery and an outstanding performance from Lee Marvin. Between 1 and 10, \\"Death Hunt\\" gets a marginal 7."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective. Had to return it :(","review":"The disc was defective, but not the seller's fault.

Of course this wastaken from a short story and made to fit the scenario they wanted so thereare only a few facts thrown in. Who cares, eh? We all want to be entertainedand to get away from some to the supposedly great movies Hollywood is dishing out today. If you don't want to see it that is easily done.

This time his role is similar to the one he had in Chato's Land; A guy pursued by an angry mob wanting him dead, dead, Dead! Naturally, because he's Bronson, they don't have the easiest time trying to get him. These guys should have never shot his newfound dog friend, coz after that, all hell breaks loose. The plot is nothing new, it's been done many times before(usually with more style), but this one is exceptional because of the cast. Aside from Chuck, you have tough guy Lee Marvin, Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers who's always a joy), would-be Luke Skywalker-Andrew Davis, the \\"dude\\" talking cop from Death Wish 3, and the scary \\"Buffalo Woman.\\" And to answer some of your questions, Peter Hunt(the director) was the editor of practically every James Bond film, and the director of On Her Majesty's Secret Service.

All the songs/ background tracks sound like Kelly's originals with the exception of 'A Moment Like This,' which is accompanied only by an acoustic guitar. It doesn't sound AWFUL, but definitely not in keeping with the original. The rest of the tracks are great with the expected lyrics showing up right in synch with the music and the vocal background enhancement not too overpowering.

When I opened it, it was all stuck together in one big lump. I tried using a spoon to loosen some of the powder, and mixed it with some peanut butter. The dog wouldn't go near it. Then I tried to scrape more from the lump, but was unsuccessful. By the time I got around to showing it to my husband, who noticed that the moisture packet had burst (hence the lump), it was too late to get my money back (my fault, I know). The point is, I almost poisoned my dog (who was smart enough not to go near it). I was not happy with this product at all. Unfortunately, this experience made me not want to try another bottle. Hopefully the company will switch to a hard moisture packet so that this will never happen to anyone else.

There are a couple songs that were previously unreleased by anyone, such as NWO, Goldberg, Al Snow, Lex Luger, and the WWF Ric Flair theme. This version of Al's song sucks, Flair's is OK, and Lex's and NWO are pretty good actually. Goldberg's is perfect...I have a sneaking suspicion that they snagged the Goldberg theme off some public domain source--it's practically indentical to the one you hear on WCW broadcasts.

The pacing was perfect and the story line was interesting, but at times a bit unnerving. There was a lot violence in this story and a part of me had trouble embracing the hero, Karn. The book opens to Karn and his Viking friends attacking a village. Some of the things that he not only participated in, but turned a blind eye to, put a bad taste in my mouth. However, there is a definite change in him as the story progresses and you can see him looking back on his past behavior with regret. In the end, I wanted him to have his beloved Britta. I was happy when they overcame their numerous obstacles to be together.All in all, this could have been a 5 star read, but I knocked off a star for some of my personal feelings towards Karn and the sometimes lengthly separtions of the central characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new voice in historical drama","review":"With so many of the writers in the romance field today opting for the lighter touch, a person that loves sweeping, gritty historical drama is finding it harder to discover such, strong realism.

Guess I would have been in high school at the time and I remember liking it a lot more then than I did this time around. Not surprising, either. The humor is mostly pretty juvenile and predictable. There are, indeed, some funny bits in it (e.g., the horse whinnying every time they say the name of Cloris Leachman's character, Marty Feldman as Igor), but the sex jokes are pretty lame and trite, and the rest of the humor rarely made me laugh, just the occasional smile.

For new fans, this is a black/white film, despite colorized dvd packaging and colorized 'stills' (above). Revisited this film just today (toying with blu upgrade) and found dvd to be just fine, IMHO. Audio/visuals still effective (and just musing, but is it right to expect the film to look better than in '74?). So, instead of double-dipping, will now look for original Frankenstein, and do the inevitable comparisons! (Features of dvd: 41 min. 'making of', several deleted scenes, and interesting set of short Mexican interviews, of Feldman, Wilder/Leachman. Subtitles in eng, spa, fr).

Sometimes I wonder if British people secretly made this film because it has a very Brit-humor feel to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully acted, hilariously clever","review":"I don't remember how old I was when I first saw Young Frankenstein, but I can't remember a time when it wasn't one of my favorites. Gene Wilder is an absolute genius in this movie -- his comic timing is perfect. The cinematography is wonderful, and really shines through on the DVD version. Mel Brooks's commentary is fun to listen to as well -- he's so clearly fond and proud of his creation, much like Wilder's Frankenstein has a parent's instinct to love and protect the monster he creates. This is the rare spoof that hits its mark, gets the laugh, but also has enormous heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must Have\\" Classic","review":"I've loved this movie since the first time that I saw it.

This was a movie that I had to get for my collection of classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gene Wilder's Funny Days","review":"This is the funniest old movie that has ever been made, as far as I'm concerned. They're just aren't hardly any funny old timers, with exception to Young Frankenstein, Murder by Death and Jerry Lewis' The Nutty Professor. Seeing the media's reaction to his invention and seeing the Dr. interact with Frankenstein is as funny as anything you'll see.The only more funny thing is when Frankenstein goes out into our environment and meets everyone. For example. A young girls parents suspect that their girl is in trouble, and she is playing with Frankenstein. She tells him to hop on the seesaw and when he does, she flies all the way to her room just as her parents open the door to check on her. The idea of this movie is nothing shy of brilliant as well as everything else about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Mel Brooks Classic Comedy","review":"I have seen the original YF in the theater, on VHS Video, on PPV TV, and now on DVD from Warner Bros. This DVD edition, complete with background interviews, outtakes,and commentary is outstanding in every aspect. Sadly they have not remastered the sound as the original was recorded in mono/hifi, but enjoyable nonetheless. The background information gleaned thru interviews with Gene Wilder and other cast members provided fascinating insights into how the movie version came into being.

I wasn't even born when it was made and it felt like all the jokes were so cliched when I watched it. Now there could be 2 reasons for that - Number 1 is that this film was so influential that every other movie copied it so I had already heard the jokes a million times before or Number 2 - The jokes actually were cliched.

Mel Brooks hilarious spoof of Frankenstein is undoubtedly one of the funniest films ever made. The casting is incredible (especially Marty Feldman as Igor) and the gags will have you rolling in the grave, um, on the floor. With everything from sight gags to overt sexual innuendo (both Brooks trademarks) this comedy will have you gasping for breath. The monster on stage doing a dance routine with Dr. F., the lonely blind man (Gene Hackman) who was going to make espresso, the luscious Terri Garr \\"assisting\\" whenever she can. I know this is one of my favorite comedies, as well as one of my favorite movies. It's made even better if you watch the 1931 Universal Frankenstein (with Boris Karloff as the monster) before it. For fans of Horror, of Comedy, or just plain old good movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie to add to your collection","review":"Of course, for the price.... not bad at all.

He joined with Gene Wilder on this project after they'd collaborated on 'Blazing Saddles' and it was released in the same year. Plenty of laughs abound and winks to the older horror films of yesteryear and comical breaking of the fourth wall (when the characters glance at us during the story).

Without acceleration, I have to move the mouse a lot more to get the cursor across the screen... which is not the biggest problem in the world but is on the other hand a problem that could have been avoided by adding the acceleration feature to the software."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I have been using this product for over 4 years. It's the only mouse I will use and I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked out great","review":"This mouse was perfect for me. The installation went pretty smoothly, once I figured out I needed to unplug the PS/2 mouse after install for the IBM drivers to hook in properly (before, I had both mice running at the same time, both driving the cursor...). The software allows you to assign all sorts of funtions to any of the buttons, so you can remap it however you want. The ergonomics of the design is pretty comfortable, if nothing else its a whole lot nicer than the little blob I used before. Its an impressive degree more comfortable and effortless to use than my ballmouse -- even though I knew there would be an improvement, it surprised me."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Drawback","review":"This mouse feels good in a way that others don't - there is support at the base of the thumb and less \\"pinching\\" pressure is required to move the mouse. Also, the shape itself helps to keep the elbow closer to the body reducing pressure on arm and shoulder. For the first few hours of use I thought the solution to pain in my hand and thumb had been found.Then the palm of my hand began to tingle and it continued to intensify. The feeling is a hightened version of how your hand feels if you put it in the microwave oven too soon after opening the door, except the tingling doesn't stop. This may not bother most users; but for the small percentage of people who can \\"feel\\" the microwave or fluorescent lights or even a cell phone at your ear after prolonged use, this mouse may carry a significant drawback.Such a pity I had to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the opticals","review":"I have now owned this mouse for 6 months and am very happy with it. The Microsoft mouse feels like a cheap toy next to this finely crafted and contoured mouse. The ergonomics are perfect, it fits perfectly in my hand! It is very precise AND I use it for first person shooter games as well as graphic design. No complaints, get one now. Plus the blue glowing scroll wheel is about as cool as a mouse can get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect...","review":"I agree with the comment that this is a comfortable mouse for people with larger hands...it's a saving grace, in fact. It is also a nice-looking device, matching style with function. I like the blue scroll wheel light and the feel of all the controls.My only complaint is that something periodically goes haywire, and the cursor moves stubbornly and erratically on screen. It requires a reboot to get it back to normal. This could be a software driver issue. Then again, every mouse seems to have software problems. Maybe it's best not even to install it.ps- I wonder if this thing would work on a Mac. I am making \\"The Switch\\". One thing for sure, I will buy a mouse with the same terrific ergonomic shape if I can find one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than perfect clicking","review":"Nice shape, but in the first week I've experienced bad clicks.

I smashed mine yesterday because I was so sick of having to plug it into my USB card 50 times before the computer would recognize the damn thing EVERY TIME I TURNED ON MY COMPUTER. At first, I thought maybe there was something wrong with my computer (Compaq Presario 2100z), but my friend bought a fricking IBM USB mouse for his Dell laptop and had the exact same problem.

The best performance is Rajasree Mukherjee performing Aye Mere Pyare Watan (Track 7) originally sung by Manna Dey and written by Prem Dhawan in Kabuliwala.Roop Nilayam (Track 1) sung by both Rajasree & Shromona Mukherjee is also a very powerful song. Sung in the ancient language - Sanskrit - the song gives the listener goose bumps. Rajasree and Shromona's duet is so beautifully in synch, that it feels as if it was the same singer on two tracks.Shromona's performance in Kar Chaley Hum Fidah (Track 6) is also very pleasing and you would never guess this singer was brought up outside of India her whole life. Her pronunciation and diction is flawless.This is a great album for Indian Embassies, High Commissions and Consulates all over the world.

I would encourage all fans of the film to stay away from this Lions Gate release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the film you saw in the theatre","review":"This blu ray does not include subtitles which existed in the theatrical release.

That said, all bets are off from that point on.I don't understand how Holly Hunter's character could adore such a man who is using a piano (the only thing she initially loves and adores) to bribe her for sex. What exactly is the attraction? I guess in that time and environment that is the ONLY man that treats her better than her husband. It's nice to know that times have progressed.The story is very sadistic and not the least bit romantic as was attested to by some of my female friends. AND, the setting in the New Zealand rainforest is dreary, gray, sticky and just unpleasant.Not likely to view this movie a third time, ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully made, but feminist drivel","review":"I enjoyed Campion's effective imagery, which was often striking, and the performances, but the central theme of this film - A Woman Finding Her Voice In The Male Dominated Society - is nothing but Oprah-style feminist psychobabble.Enjoy the imagery, but take the message with a grain of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Overrated At Best.","review":"This movie made me nauseous. It was career death for Holly Hunter. Has anyone seen her lately? She seemed truly embarrassed after this movie came out. She can be a terrific actress as she was in 'Raising Arizona', but why she starred in this piece of trash, I will never know. Don't bother seeing this one. It is on my list of the ten worst movies ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2 hours of wondering \\"What's the point?\\"","review":"Beautiful, pretentious movie featuring characters you can't relate to in any way.

Hunter's character begins as a fiercely independent and unconventional woman; throughout the movie she is degraded and brutalized in attempts to make her 'normal', and exploited shamelessly by her aspiring lover Keitel. Also, be warned, there are scenes of graphic violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star because of the music","review":"The Piano bombed. The only positive part about this movie is the music.

There is nothing like this film; I would have to invent new words to express what it means to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow characters, bizarre story","review":"That's basically my two cents. Shallow characters, bizarre story. I am not the kind of person who usually watches romance films, but I do like a good story and heard this was one. It was not. All of the characters were inverted - Ada and her daughter were utterly irritating, George was disgusting from start to finish, and Sam Neill's character (supposedly the heartless jerk) was actually the easiest to sympathize with. How frustrating!On a positive note, Michael Nyman's score is unbelievable. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppily done...","review":"The stars and the title of this review refers to the technical side of the DVD, and NOT of the movie itself (you can read about it in other reviews here). If you want to buy this DVD, note that the DVD is very poorly organized: There is no subtitle whatsoever, and the close-caption is extremely crudely made; there's only one audio track (English); there's no in-movie control, and if you go back to the root menu for some reasons, when resumed, the movie will switch to the other viewing angle (from widescreen to fullscreen, or via versa) by itself! Best to rent it, and buy the soundtrack instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music the only good thing here!","review":"The movie was unbearably pretensious and put me to sleep after half an hour. Why any woman could choose sleazy Harvey Keitel over Sam Neill makes this movie wholly unbelievable, as well as Keitel's portrayal of a Maori! Very silly movie and would probably be featured on a new future edition of MST2K in 50 years. This movie's only saving grace is the wonderful soundtrack which is a good buy, but this video is a total waste of time, unless you need a bedtime lullaby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozefest!","review":"I heard all these great things about this movie so I rented it.

I found no enjoyment in watching it at all. I felt there must have been a lot of anger in the person who wrote & directed it. Maybe I am wrong. Reviewers have given this movie equal status with the movie The Pianist, but I find that ludicrous. This movie in my estimation in no way is the equal of The Pianist, which is a superlatively exceptional movie. The Piano plumbs the depths of ugliness IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artsy softcore","review":"Having a contrived scripted, some lovely footage of coastal New Zealand, and impressive performance or two, does not negate the fact that this movie is little more than glorified \\"artsy\\" softcore.

Even at the height of the movie's plot, there was a certain mood that was lacking. There was the absence of any real depth. The sad thing is that you could feel them trying. The idea itself is beautiful. Heartbreakingly so. Yet somehow, through actions and words, the movie loses the grip on the strings that are secured to the heart. It was disappointing altogether, with an ending that matched the rest of the movie perfectly, it was lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real stinker","review":"Could easily be the most overrated video of all time. A hateful, cynical mess. The only redeeming quality was the outstanding cinematography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful film, terrible Blu-Ray","review":"I adore this movie and picked up this Blu-Ray the week it came out. It is a huge disappointment, though, seeing as somebody really screwed up and left off the subtitles. So in the scenes where Ada signs, or when the Maori people speak, there is no way to tell what they are saying unless, like me, you pretty much have the dialogue memorized. Even so, I returned this Blu-Ray and am holding on to my DVD version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary","review":"One of the rare masterpieces of American Cinema, The Piano stands among the most memorable movies I've ever seen. A fortunate cast with Paquin-Hunter-Keitel, an intriguing original screenplay combined with brilliant director's work are bringing this movie towards the peak of artistic cinematography. The image of human greatness it suggested will stay in my mind as long as I live."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Piano","review":"Set in the 19th century, Jane Campion's brilliant period tale \\"The Piano\\" was rightly lauded in 1993 for its eccentric storyline and otherworldly, dreamlike atmosphere. Despite never uttering a word, Oscar winner Hunter exudes intelligence and determination as the rebellious Ada, along with a repressed yet combustible sensuality. Anna Paquin is a marvel in her debut, exemplifying the mix of spunk and knowingness that made her a sought-after young star. Visually ravishing and exquisite, \\"The Piano\\" is Campion's visually poetic ode to our unspoken emotions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, poor DVD transfer","review":"This is an excellent, haunting film, but unfortunately the DVD transfer is poor; there is a lot of black in the movie, and just about all of it exhibits MPEG artifacts to a distracting extent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally overrated","review":"When this film was released, all the guys I knew kept mentioning how wonderful it was. So I went to see it, but was unimpressed. When I mentioned this, most of them admitted they hadn't really enjoyed it either, but that they always told women they thought it was great, because \\"women love that movie.\\" Well, this one didn't.I should mention that I did love Jane Campion's \\"An Angel at My Table\\". And it's clear that a lot of effort went into making \\"The Piano\\". It's too bad, since the results aren't enlightening or uplifting. In fact, there doesn't seem to be much of a point; it's just sort of gratuitously sordid. (The \\"Keitel-without-pants\\" scenes don't help. That's a little more of him than I needed to see.)Check it out if you're curious, but don't feel bad if you don't like it. Despite the hype, you're not the only one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A depressing movie","review":"The beginning of the movie is touching and poetic--piano is the way for Ada to express her feelings. But the poetic feeling is ruined in the end for Ada's passion for piano seems lessoned or replaced by the earthly love. As a musician, I wouldn't know how to survive if I couldn't play the instrument as I wish any more. The writer for the movie intentionally made the story horrifying and brutal to the point of irritation. But Ada's daughtor, who possesses a special personality and living in her own mystical world, leaves me an unforgetable impression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't add up","review":"A very impressive performance by Holly Hunter, some gorgeous cinematography, and lots of excellent costumes, can't make up for the fact that the script is unbearably pretentious, and extremely implausible.

It is not for everyone though, you either like it or you hate it. The Piano is thought provoking and everybody interpretsit differently. All of the acting is superb, but Holly Hunter is exquisite; her performance is probably the best female performance I have ever seen. Jane Campion has created a strong and complex heroine. Don't miss this film, watch it with an open mind and watch it more than once in order to catch all the complexities."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enchanting film","review":"As a pianist, I was completely seduced by this movie. Jane Campion has managed to capture all the passion and emotion of playing the piano, and its role as a voice. The raw beauty and brilliance of the actors made me weep.

What a miss I had. I just finished watching it today, and what I could say is incredible. Then, I was wondering why it didn't get Best Picture... it was Schindler's List which got it.The actors and actress performance were very good. The story is about how the relationship between the main characters developed all around a piano. Still, there were weak spots. For example, I can't tell how / why would Ada fall in love with the neighbor... but love has... no reasoning in it? or it's just because Ada 'hate' her husband giving away her piano?4 stars only, because there was a vertical yellowish 'line' appears on the left hand side during playback that's TOO VISIBLE.

I read where Ada was suppose to be so complex-not speaking and playing the piano well makes a person complex? I didn't think she even gave her new husband a chance (plus, what husband (even nowadays) is going to haul a piano up a jungle mountainside...they're a pain to move from one room to another!). All in all, I found this movie to be annoying. I liked Anna Paquin-she was very good, but one little girl doesn't a great movie make!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OUT OF TUNE","review":"You try.

She plays a piano and disses this guy she is arranged to marry. That guy is Sam Neill!!! So, anyways, she falls in love with Harvey Keitel who has tattoos all over his face and he sets up this deal where he will get sex from her if she wants her piano back from him. And Anna Paquin plays the daughter of Holly Hunter. Anna Paquin totally jacks up the plan to cheat on Sam Neill and Sam Neill chops off her finger. But this is after a way-too-brief scene where Holly Hunter is naked. Man. That should happen more. So, Sam Neill and Holly Hunter leave and throw the piano in the ocean. End of story. Oh, wait. This is a review, not a story summary. The movie is good. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"'The Piano' - it's overrated and sado-masochistic","review":"Forgive me for saying so, but 'The Piano' is nothing but a disgusting movie.

I saw it once many years ago and I will never do it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring -","review":"There's little in the plot to maintain interest, and no understanding of the background provided. For example, What were these people doing in New Zealand? Why did the woman come to New Zealand in first place - I know it was for marriage, but weren't there some better alternatives? What was the background of some of the characters? (Overall, they seemed like boors and louts.) Anyway, it was difficult to understand much of the dialogue (too soft, mumbled and accented) - I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. Holly Hunter (Ada, the mute love interest) is a good actress but most of the scenes were eyes darting back and forth. You get dizzy watching.Also,the ending of her favorite piano is odd and did not make sense - she gets a new one later. Why is a body tied to the old piano? Is it a symbol of Ada's former personality?The best part of the movie was the New Zealand scenery, greens, dark blues and purple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chop!

A few other reviews posted here are calling the blu-ray release inferior due to picture quality issues which I don't understand one bit. Sure, there are some low-lit scenes which appear grainy but that is simply the nature of celluloid. Even the master print will show that.Point is, I wish I could return this copy in exchange for a corrected version. Is someone at Lion's Gate Studio listening...or do they even care to fix the problem? I'm going to try returning my copy for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Debut On Blu-ray","review":"So far, this Australian Blu-ray is the only way to get Jane Campion's lovely film in high definition.The upside is that it looks better than the non-anamorphic region 1 dvd from Artisan.The downside is that it's a 1080i transfer AND sourced from a PAL master so it suffers from 4% speed-up which is very noticeable in Holly Hunter's voice and ruins the gorgeous Michael Nyman score that I know by heart.It is also worth nothing that even though the disc is coded for Region A, B, and C that it does not play in my US-based Playstation 3. I could only get it to play in my multi-region Sherwood Blu-ray player.So, if you're looking for a US-friendly solution to see \\"The Piano\\" in HD, this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"lion's gate blu ray","review":"Like the previous blu ray from AU a few years ago, this one too omits the essential subtitles from Ada's sign language to her daughter about her relationship and the Maori's dialogue. It makes no sense that they missed these important parts of the film.Unlike other criticisms, though, I think the print is actually very good. Some of it is grainy, but this was filmed with many dark scenes and in the jungle, and I don't recall it being much different in the movie theater. The color is great and the sound is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"I don't know what hold this movie had over me. It came out when I was younger; it might have been the revulsion my parents exhibited toward it that so enticed me. Now that I've seen it, I don't agree with their revulsion, but I do agree that it's slow, boring, and somewhat pointless. At least, to me - if there is some sort of point or lesson to this movie, I missed it. And there was a lot of naked Harvey Keitel and a little less of naked Holly Hunter - none of which seemed entirely necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"great DVD, but missing subtitles","review":"love this movie and this version looks excellent on my television. however, the subtitle s explaining ada' s sign language is missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artistic no","review":"I rented this movie thinking it would be very good and interesting to a point but I found the nudity and explict sex sceens disguisting.

However, if you are like me, someone who falls asleep at the sound of a piano key and who hates slow pace movies, then stick this movie in the garbage right away. I have never been so bored watching a movie in my life. The fact that this movie is up for a grammy just makes my laugh. I had to watch this movie for 5 days in my lit class this fall, and fell asleep every time. I'm the type of kid who loves action, comedy, sports and of course, gorey movies. This movie was as far away from any of those characteristics as possible. I would definately not reccommend this movie to anyone who doesn't have a sleeping disorder. However, if Insomnia plagues you, then definately rent this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dumb film about a dumb woman","review":"The heroine of this film has to be high on the list of most irritating characters I have ever encountered. She doesn't speak, though it is never explained why, my own guess is that she just likes driving everyone crazy. She allows herself to be married off to a man in New Zealand who she evidnetly doesn't like, again we are never told why. Her husband won't let her take her beloved piano into their home, why on earth not? Playing the piano was an essential female accomplishment in those days, every middle-class household had a piano. What kind of a woman uses her own daughter as a go-between between herself and her lover? Apart from being a thoroughly immoral thing to do, it is also extremely stupid. Everyone knows no child can keep a secret.

There is way too much naked Harvey Keitel and Anna Paquin is just as mind numbing to watch as a child as she is today, if not more so. Do not watch this piece of garbage, its a waste of time.

Used the sprinklers about 5 times and 3 of them have stopped oscillating. It's a shame, because they work great with my well water system.

There is no conceivable way to fix it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fabulous - when they work","review":"This is an excellent concept and when they work they are easy to use and have a very flexible spray pattern and easy sweep adjustment. BUT, I have bought five over the last two years or so, and only 2 are still oscillating. The others just sit there and spray the same spot. No movement. Judging from the other reviewers who state the same problem, there is a manufacturing problem with these things. You can occasionally get them for under $10 with a coupon at ACE or Sears - if you can get that kind of price they are worth taking a chance. Otherwise, don't bother. It is a real shame because they seem well designed - apart from a bad motor mechanism apparently !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh","review":"Bought 5 of these, daisy chained them together, and ran them in my front yard. After an hour of use, shutting off the water, and starting it up again, it no longer respects the set limits for oscillation. It will spin 360 degrees now, reversing direction at only one of the two tabs. This happens on 3/5 of the sprinklers.Last night I forgot to turn them off. Left them on all night, and when my wife came out, she said the tops were off of 2 of them, and they were just flooding the yard with water. Pieces of junk, avoid them at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped oscillating","review":"I bought this from Home Depot. It took a little while to figure out the best setting as there was no manual included. It worked okay for about two or three weeks and then it stopped oscillating. No matter what I did I could not get it to work properly. I figured out how to take it apart thinking there was something stuck inside and I could clean it out. Everything looked okay but it would still not oscillate. I would pass this off as a lemon but after reading that many others have had the same problem, I suspect it is a design flaw. I will not bother returning it for another as I do not have any faith that a new one will work any better and do not wish to waste any more of my time on this flawed product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money.","review":"If I had written a review right away after buying this I would have given it 5 stars. Worked great- at first. But, after less than two months only 1 out of the 6 I bought continued to work correctly. The others simply stopped rotating.I took one apart, thinking that maybe earwigs or slugs or something had gotten inside the mechanism, but no luck. Now, I'm a pretty handy guy, but there was nothing inside that I could fix to get the thing working again.I will not buy this product again. I have also lost faith in this manufacturer, who continues to market an obviously defective product at consumer expense."},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for","review":"I bought one thinking what a terrific bargain.... only worked for about two weeks before the head unscrewed itself from doing what it was supposed to do (rotating back and forth) and I found a flooded fountain in the yard.

I would be willing to pay twice the money for this sprinkler if it would work more than 12 months. Now I have two expensive tripods and I am searching for replacement heads with \\"mist\\" option. I have low water pressure, therefore impact sprinklers not a good option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long overdue appreciation","review":"This book is a great complement to du Maurier's fiction. Auerbach has written a very personal account of du Maurier's life and its relation to her writing. I liked the intimate tone of the book, as if you were talking to Auerbach over coffee; there is nothing over-blown or haughty. Auerbach's analysis of how du Maurier's stories were (mis-)adapted for film is brilliant, as well as Auerbach's discussion about du Maurier's sexuality and prejudices. Quite enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is Not A Biography","review":"If you are looking for a biography on Daphne Du Maurier, I would not recommend Haunted Heiress. This is a rambling, free form work of literary criticism. You would do better to check this book out from the library rather than paying the steep price.You can learn more about the story of Du Maurier's life by doing a web search.Also, if you are interested in visuals, there are none in Haunted Heiress, save for the cover. The text did conjure up some mental images of Ms. Auerbach, though... (narcissistic, cranky, and snobbish) but none of Daphne Du Maurier.I did very much appreciate Ms. Auerbach's observations on Du Maurier's affinity for the way men can live their lives, with more freedom and flexibility.I wish Ms. Auerbach would have done more research on Du Maurier's life and interwoven it with her pop-up thoughts on this book or that."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAUNTED HEIRESS - a pretentious work","review":"Although the HAUNTED HEIRESS attempts to instill in the reader the notion that Daphne du Maurier's works do not fall into the \\"romance\\" genre, she fails to convenience the reader of this. Even drawing comparisons to du Maurier's grandfather and contrasts to the great Bronts, all is lost in her attempt to move Daphne du Maurier out of this shallow genre and into one of a more academically acceptable category. Her supportive arguments are grotesquely silly and oftentimes clouded by an awkward, pompous writing style."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on 20th Century American Foreign Policy","review":"This is a classic! Simply the best single volume account of American Foreign Policy I have ever read. Ambrose writes in a clear and concise way, leaving nothing out yet avoiding dry, dull text. His analysis is suburb, his conclusions lucid and thought provoking. This is the book to read if you want a comprehensive overview of America's foreign policy of the past 60 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"The birth of a super power","review":"I read the first edition of this book in 1989 as part of required reading in college. I've never been interested in history before I read this book. This book taught history in such a way that you will realize that past is important to move forward. I read it with the same enthusiasm I always have for good fiction. A must read for anyone who wonder how the USA become a major power broker in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This was the FIRST real (Yup. REAL.) history book that I read, as a college freshman, and it led me to major in history. Ambrose is one of the very few history writers who does so in such a great way that one can't put his books/articles/stories down; so compelling is his work. I'd reccommend his history writings, especially \\"Rise To Globalism\\" to everyone. Tons that you'll learn--that no one ever taught."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be good, but now . . .","review":"Since the death of Stephen Ambrose, Penguin has hired Douglas G. Brinkley to 'update' the book. It now contains such nonsense as the \\"1980 October Surprise,\\" the much investigated and thoroughly discredited claim that Reagan and Khomenei conspired to keep the hostages seized in 1979 captive till after the election.With nonsense like this in it, one can no longer trust anything in the book. Therefore, the 8th edition should not be purchased or used for anything but birdcage liner.With luck, there will be a ninth edition revised by someone sane, but till then, buy and use only editions 1-7."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect book","review":"So I only discovered that I got the wrong book more than 30days after my assignment which required that i read chapter 16, thats when I discovered, I didn't have a chapter 12 and that I didn't get the ninth edition book as ordered. Even the cover is different so I guess Im at a loss because I didn't double check upon receipt. Goes to show you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good foreign policy overview","review":"This is a good survey of American foreign policy since 1938. It can be dry at times since it is dealing with policy but I highly recommend it. Stephen E. Ambrose co-wrote it so you know it must be pretty good. I recommend this because many Americans now adays don't really know much about America's foreign policy and how we became a hegemonic power. If you are interested in American foreign policy since 1938, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good first, but not last, primer on US foreign policy","review":"This is a compact primer for the novice (including myself) to US foreign policy during the last 65 years. It serves as a useful starting point for identifying points of interest and it provides a reasonably good list of additional resources. Because the authors' biases are pretty blatant--whether you agree with them or not--this book should be incorporated into a repertoire of foreign policy reading material, and not as your one-and-only foray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I've been fortunate to have recently read several very good books about 20th-Century history. This isn't one of them. There's nothing particularly good about the entire book, but it takes a decided turn for the worse in the chapters that discuss the Clinton and GW Bush years. Before that point it appears to have been written on about a 12th-grade reading level. In the Clinton and Bush chapters at the end, however, it reads as if it's actually been written by a 12th-grader, and not one that deserves a high grade in a language-arts class.More specifically, toward the end of the book the author regularly repeats his thoughts, and sometimes even contradicts his own points within a couple sentences. I'm not quite finished with the book, and right now the only thing keeping me reading is to marvel at the poorly constructed sentences and paragraphs. I'm actually morbidly fascinated with the idea that a well-known professor of history signed his name to this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAMINATE THE BOOKS!","review":"I think the idea for Littlefingers LeapPad was great...but those ingeneous engineers made one flaw...they need to laminate the books. Or at least put the pages on cardstock! When I bought my daughter the system for Christmas, it came with a book and it was just paper, but I assumed that it was like that because it was the book that came with it. Then, I bought this Songbird book and it was the same way. The pages are easy for my daughter to crinkle and chew through. She's just learning about books and teething...not a good combo. So I really think they need to put some people on their design team that have infants and toddlers.

As you peak the dish position, the sensitivity adjustment becomes VERY touchy, going from no indication to full-scale with the slightest tweak of the knob. For those who cannot adjust the dish while staring at a meter, this unit also has an auditory signal (tone) that varies in intensity to indicate progress. The meter dial is lighted, so at a glance you can see relative amplitude of the signal, especially nice if you are outside after dark trying to recover your system from a nasty wind storm!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must For Any Parent","review":"If you've admired Tiger as a golfer, wait til you read his father's account of how he got that way.

Also, terrific advice on how to teach your kid to golf at an early age, and wonderful pictures of Tiger and his family"},{"rating":"1","title":"Toothless Tiger","review":"Although the book contains a few memorable passages, (mostly gleaned by reading between the lines), I had hoped it would be a more personal and revealing look into the personalities and special relationship of these two intriguing people. Instead, it really proved to be a how-to book of golf lessons, of which there is no shortage. Quite a few photographs for diehard fans of the fallen king, but overall it's little more than a venue for Earl to beat his chest and tout his remarkable parenting and teaching skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Tiger on TV - don't buy the book","review":"This appears to be a book rushed into print by Earl Woods and a ghostwriter, written just around the time of Earl's bypass surgery.

The Allegro Molto Moderato is both nerve-wrackingly agitated and swimmingly melifluous. What a beauty! I must say I prefer the Quatuor Mosaiques performace of the 'Rosamude' quartet, but the Emerson's still do a noble enough job (I just miss Christophe Coin's surging cello).This is a fabulous package, and a bargain at $30 for 3 discs.

It says that the pan is oven-safe up to 450 degrees and I used it at temps of 350-400. The handles will never look the same again and I removed them after the first couple of uses. They weren't very functional anyway because they don't provide as much coverage on the bottom of them so you can't really get the grip where it is most important for pulling a hot pan out of the oven. The pan was stained within the first couple of uses and the nonstick surface isn't so great.

Mining afresh the way lives intertwine and the effects of one person's choices on others, the author draws us into this family as they grapple with the unexplained withdrawal of their daughter. We all must deal with the reality of reasonable expectations bumping up against unexpected and unwelcome outcomes. Shields is masterful at conveying Rita's agonized bewilderment--the questioning, the grief, the distracted, automatic functioning in her \\"normal\\" life, while on another level her whole world is in pieces. I have to confess to being a little let down by the ending as I found the wrap up disappointingly neat and abrupt. I was looking forward to Shields grappling with the concept that sometimes there are no answers...I thought that's where she might be going. Still, a powerfully absorbing book...we've lost a great writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I picked up this book after finishing her Pulitzer Prize winning novel, The Stone Diaries, which I thouroughly enjoyed. I, too found it a bit boring, but mostly I just found the character a bit pathetic. She writes numerous letters (all unmailed) castigating various authors for not including any women in their articles on great authors, thinkers etc. I consider myself a feminist, not a radical, mind you, just an average middle-aged woman who owns her own business and has taken charge of her life. The attitude was so defeatest, that her daughter is so defeated by this male dominated society that she checks out of it. It seemed a bit ridiculous and almost insulting to women. Although I felt for her, I could not relate to the main character's turmoil at all. She just seemed so weak and resigned to her daughter's fate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midlife crises averted","review":"Reta with 3 teenage daughters, one who checked out and is sitting on a street corner in Toronto, a husband by agreement and father of the children has reached a point in life where there are more questions than answers.

This introspection is triggered when her oldest and brightest child Norah drops out of the University, leaves her long-term boyfriend and daily sits on a street corner in Toronto with a sign hung around her neck stating \\"Goodness.\\"This introspection and magnifying glass look into her own past and her present life is a moving description of a woman looking for meaning in her life where there may be none.

Sometimes there are no answers.jacque stiles"},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrives nowhere","review":"Unless is a book that goes everywhere and arrives nowhere. It is severely fragmented and it lacks depth and development of character. As a reader, you want to feel for Norah and understand her motives but so little and inconclusive information is given along the way that by the time the burning incident is presented, it is easy to lose interest. All the characters and events are loosely held together which impedes the free-flow of the story. The story line had such gut-wrenching and thought-provoking potential-- it was a great dissappointment too see it so poorly developed."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay","review":"This books is about a depressed middle aged woman, i can sympathize with the character but it does not make for a good read, who wants to read a book about the boring thoughts and mundane life of a unhappy middle aged woman?

I just could not get into the story or the characters. I've enjoyed other novels with less-than-appealing characters (The Good House, The Corrections, Crow Lake all come to mind).

Unfortunately, the story line is the book is missing until about five pages from the end. Not worth the read unless you are a middle aged Canadian writer, worried about your teen daughters, caught up in the fact that you are passive and basically unhappy with the way feminism of the 70's and 80s turned out. If that's the case, you will love this book. This book bored me to tears. I only finished it for a book reading group and the fact that I had actually paid money for all of this pontificating and nonsense which took 320 pages to write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"I heard Carol Shields on a radio interview, and I heard a woman who was exceptionally intelligent, sensitive and had clearly thought a great deal about many things. I couldn't get enough. I'm sad to say though, that \\"Unless\\" is about as interesting as a cold pancake at a bad diner. Passages about \\"charm\\" or \\"sincerity\\" seem like so much self indulgent blather.

I had to finish it because someone else was waiting for my opinion. I found the little bits of French translation and the awful Danielle Westerman connection very show-offy. In fact the latter's name and opinions appearing on nearly every page drove me to wild laughter before I was halfway through. I thought the whole book was like very bad Anne Tyler, if there can be such a thing, and I didn't believe a word of the plot, or care much what happened to any of them. The only good thing I can say is that someone else paid for the book, so only my time was wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"What a disappoinment this book was! I understand that it was an out of the ordinary novel. I am an avid reader. It doesn't always bother me when there is no plot. But all of the introspective thinking on the main characters life got very boring. Extremely. I thought about not finishing it several times. However, I heard such good reviews, I wanted to finish it & since it was so short...but the ending didn't bring much reward. It did do some explaining about her family, I'd say it was about the most interesting part of the book. The rest was just jumbled thoughts. The story didn't go anywhere.

I admire Carol Sheilds as a writer, but really don't like her writing, if that's possible. Margaret Atwood blows her away as far as I'm concerned.Unless was not as rich or as deep as I had expected. It seemed almost simple, but perhaps I'm missing the point. I did not feel satisfied or happy after reading the book. In fact, I gave my 8 copy to the local library as a donation after reading it.

First of all the plausibility--Who would not have their 19 year old daughter forcibly committed in these circumstances?

Fourth--It's almost always a bad idea to write a novel about a writer writing a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I am surprisd how many people gave this novel good reviews.Somebody picked it for our book club and then no one finished it.There certainly was no plot and where there was some expectation of understanding the family dynamics and the seriousness of a lost duaghter per se.......all the reader gets from this book is diversion.One minute the book leads to the (lost daughter)\\"Norah\\" story and the next minute we're reading about the marital status of some librarian friends.

She's so lost trying to find herself that she had to drop out and live the life of a derelict. This is what happens when children continue searching in vain for what their parents can not give them. . . possibly what they were not given by their parents. It results in mush: mushy story about mushy decisions and mushy results. Oh, they get in the claims for feminism so to satisfy the liberal readers but otherwise, it's just many, many, many words, very little emotion and no rationale whatsoever except that maturity doesn't result from living in the vacuous world provided by theseextreme secularists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picturesque","review":"The novel was very lenghty, and seemed like it covered too much information for one book. It was however, highly descriptive, one of the books that if it was ever made into a movie would be nothing like you'd expect it to be because of all the details that Moody incorporated. I expected to get a light plot with twists to keep your attention; I ended up with a book that was very deep into the relationships that one woman has with the world, and especially her best friend, though in the middle, it seemed to have been forgotten that the title of the book was \\"Best Friends\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless is Useless","review":"I bought this book for my mother, who thoroughly enjoyed reading it on her THIRD attempt to read the entire book. My mother passed it back on to me, after she finished, and raved about how wonderful the book was. She continues to encourage me to read on, but I just can't. The beginning of the book is just plain boring. I've only picked it up twice, in an attempt to read two chapters and I just can drudge through it! Nothing happens. After reading various other reviews, I'm sure Shield's novel is a wonderful story with a beginning, middle & end, but I just can't help but fall asleep trying to finish the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious Drivel","review":"After hearing a favorable review of the book on talk radio, I added it to my summer reading list and picked it up at the library. While the author can write well, her attempts at being philosophical are just that - attempts. The main character spends too much time talking about herself as a writer which comes across as conceit on the author's part. The reasoning behind the daughter's living on the street is sort of just shoved into the plot and doesn't invoke emotion. Actually, none of the characters make the reader feel for them. It was a painful read, not recommended unless you are easily fooled by the foolish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless","review":"I read this book because of recommendations and hype.

One of the things that I really like about this book is reading all of the stories about Mr. George. Since reading the book, I view him as an almost epic hero like Gilgamesh or Odysseus.

I'll just stick to (some of) Bjork's music and avoid ALL of this director's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A senseless waste of 141 minutes!","review":"It starts like a boring and uneventful home movie. Then it breaks into a musical for no apparent reason. And just when you think it can't seem any more amateurish, her neighbor steals her savings to buy his spoiled wife a new couch? This is a great example of how \\"different\\" has inadvertantly become equated with \\"good\\". Kevin Smith is different and good. Films like Memento are different and good. This is different and a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purely Putrid","review":"If I could have given this movie negative stars, I would have. The music is horendous. The howling of my dog is a more soothing sound that listening to Bjork's squaking. Bjork reminds me of a bug-eyed stark raving mad drunken fairy on crack. I liken this movie to watching paint dry. Actually, I think paint drying has more of punch than this movie does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money back, please.","review":"This film should never be shown in public, ever. I can't believe that there are actually people in this world that liked this film. Not only is Bjork not believeable as a human being, but she is quite possibly the most annoying actress that I have ever seen. I think that it is a reflection on contemporary society that this film was actually considered good by some. It shows me that the overall intelligence of out world hovers near that of a band of rats. Bjork could give a better performance in this film if she were a deaf mute with no arms. She'd probably be more believeable, too. I feel sorry for you people."},{"rating":"2","title":"After watching it a couple of times....I like it!!","review":"This was a movie that honestly had to grow on me. I actually bought the movie out of sheer curiosity and when I finally saw it, after being traumatized by the end, I seriously wanted to take it back to the store. Fortunately, they didn't allow that. I'm so glad I watched it again. This movie is brilliant and Bjork's performance is wonderful. Although some parts were flat out creepy, I found the movie to be very good. The director did a brilliant job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bjork is so cute!","review":"This movie is absolutely astounding. Its very sad but it is amazing. Bjork has to be the cutest person ever. he plays her part honestly. The use of cinematography for her day dreams gives the film a really neat effect. Anyone who appreciates quality films should see this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A grate movie","review":"This movie did have a lot of corky points. But Bjork is corkey and I like her CDs and her in general mainly because of her corkeyness. And since she was in this movie I wanted to get it and I was plesintly suprised i suggest that you rent this movie. This is a must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ow!","review":"If you like being emotionally clobbered over the head with a digital camcorder, this one's for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Russian Novel * American Musical * Dead Film Editor","review":"This is the kind of movie that you'll feel you should like but you wont. Why? Because the story and the acting are excellent. They both have a very \\"authentic\\" feel, but the pacing of the movie is slow and jerky. The movie plot itself moves at a decent pace but the individual scenes felt like they needed an editor. But what's worse is that you can't get into that flow of the movie because the \\"musical\\" scenes come in at such a different pace it's jarring. Then there's the touching main character. Selma is your \\"die on the cross to help her child\\" kind of mother, but one who makes choices in the movie that are so stupid it give the movie a fake feeling. Anyway, my wife and I cried at the end, because it really is a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Failed Experiment","review":"I very much wanted to like this film. The premise of a single-working mom who is going blind finding relief from her harsh reality through musical-number fantasies looks to be an intriguing extension of the cinematic musical form; alas, it is rendered trite and annoying to me by mediocre and uninspired song-and-dance numbers and one of the most self-indulgent and shrill performance I've yet seen: Bjork seems incapable of emoting with restraint, either grinning idiotically or blubbering hysterically. There's acting, and there's overacting. Sorry folks, but I'm personally glad she's sworn off doing any more films."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back!","review":"If it wasn't for the fact that the Beatiful and exceptionally talented Bjork was in this movie I probably would have turned it off after the first 20 minutes. As it was, I could only stand to watch about 45minutes before i had to leave the room. What I want to know is why Bjork? She is so cute and makes her own paper clothing, and makes really dope music.This movie is tortuous and dark (as the title alludes to) and painfully drawn out. I think that if I ever find the guy that wrote and directed it I would have to kick him in the shins and ask for my rental fee back.I love Bjork, but could not recommend this movie to anyone that I wanted to keep as a friend. Don't see this movie. Don't pander to this type of childish, trying to be too cool drudgery. It's not just that the story was painfull and sad, but I felt that it was formulaicly designed to be irritating and I have no time in my life for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciating....","review":"This is without a doubt the most unpleasant movie I have ever seen. The jerky filming style made me physically ill and Bjork is a horrendous actress. It feels endless and the songs are so poorly written that it you won't recognize them if you hear them again. Please spare yourself this wretched experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Pearl Harbor Look Like a Masterpiece","review":"Playing a hunch, I decided to view this movie as I've heard the musical numbers were pieces of art. I was greatly disappointed with this movie. The little respect for Bjork I had going into this movie was quickly lost as I could not get into her role. I couldn't believe her performance. Furthermore, the movie is just brutal to watch. Its a sad attempt at an emotional tour de force and it ends up being contrived and predictable. The movie actually made me dizzy at several points due to the low budget shaky camera work. In short, I've tried to find a redeeming factor in the movie, but I just can't. I felt bad giving up on it, but it was just flat out horrid."},{"rating":"2","title":"How come his name is always misspelled on the topic?","review":"\\"Lars Von Tiers\\" Is his actual name, and there's no reason for condemning his work if you don't try a clean googling of it!Remember, only your eyes r not enough for a passionate review if making such mistakes, to begin with!Never mind, we know well how bad schools have been for the last couple decades...Sorry for the danish people, they must be horrified reading some of these opinions, I bet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ruined by the cinematography","review":"I'm a bjork fan too but come on..this is like watching old home videos filmed by someone who just figured out how to use the zoom button.There is nothing artistic about the cinematography... its simple amateur, annoying and made the film unwatchable to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"strangely disappointing","review":"I went into this with very high hopes. I'd heard so many great things about it, and hey, it won the big prize in Cannes, right? But it was just SO depressing. Now, I like a good two-hanky weepy as much as the next gal, but I felt Von Trier was not just mean to his characters, but also to his audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lars von Trier: somebody stop him, please...","review":"How can you make a bad movie with talent like this? Answer: film it with low quality videocameras and have so many bad things happen to the lead character that it becomes more and more unbelievable as time goes on. The premise is fantastic - a person who daydreams about musicals to make their crappy life more bearable. The execution, however, is skin-crawlingly bad. I was actually laughing by the end because it had gone so far past the point of believeability that it was getting like a Monty Python sketch. I was expecting them to sentence Bjork to double or even triple death by the end. The soundtrack is stunning though... maybe watch it with the brightness and contrast down (Dancer 'in the Dark', all makes sense now!). Lars von Trier sucks. Everything he's done lacks subtlety and joy and it always feels like he's forcing you at gunpoint to subscribe to his twisted point of view. And he kills donkeys (but that's another story...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bjork's Gives Good Game","review":"Bjork gives a very solid performance in her film debut despite her odd British Cockney Norwegian accent portraying a Czech immigrant. You will have to suspend belief in other ways since there are numerous fantasy sequences where the participants break out in song and dance and the plot does stray from a conventional storyline which you could call challenging but is also confusing and unbelievable. If your a Bjork Fan you will probably like the movie better."},{"rating":"1","title":"making people cry is easy","review":"What starts out as an innovative, fascinating variety of \\"musical\\" loses all earned credit as the movie tries every trick in the book to wring as much sadness out of the viewer as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"bjork is very good","review":"however, i didn't find the story very good. i thought most aspects of the film were quite good, but i felt the story was rather slow and degenerates into a melodramatic mess towards the end. i am not a bjork fan, but she was remarkably good in her part."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most brilliant films I've ever seen","review":"I was absolutely astounded by this movie. I saw it more than two weeks ago, and it still haunts me. It is a truly remarkable film. The camera editing works on so many levels, the musical numbers fit perfectly into the story, and Bjork's performance is magnificent. I was drawn into this film, and when it was over, I could not believe the miracle I had just viewed. It's almost impossible to explain, so all I can say is: at least rent it. Give this outstanding film a chance, and see if you're not as amazed as I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie Great Music","review":"This is one of those movies that has such a powerful ending that it leaves you breathless. Bjork plays a single mother going blind working at a factory. she is trying to raise enough money to get her son an operation(he is going blind as well). When a friend betrasy her she does something that will chaneg her life forever. i am not going to give anymore away. you will either love or hate this movie. The soundtrack is great too. recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bjork - Dancer in the Dark","review":"This film is absolutely original. The film appears to be shot rather poorly, which at first appears colorless and amateuresque. However, it really does fit with the extreme and raw emotion of the characters (Bjork: as Selma) and hersituation. There is a true sense of violence in the film, which I found more disturbing than what I've seen in most movies because of how gritty, flawed, and gut-wrenching it is. The music is beautiful, and absolutely haunting with its camera perspectives. This is one of the few movies that really disturbed me, and continues to haunt me. Bjork, unlike most female musical artists who make good music and can't act, is awesome here. Those who are fans of Bjork must see this, and those who aren't should get aquainted with this film. This film is like a downward spiral, and the momentum of this tragedy made me want to claw a way out for her. Watch this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too negative movie!","review":"This movie stinks...

Do they still have the hangman's noose???Well, I loved Breaking the Waves..I love films that have some meat on their bones..but this one is bare..BARREN of dialogue, content..well I guess that would just about blow any movie.A flop of a film.

Truly the worst movie I have ever seen. Von Trier is a sadist who forces his audience to sit through the last hour of the movie and share the unending agony of the main character, only to be followed by a horrible execution. After it was over, I was truly ill. Watching this movie reduced the quality of my life. I will never see a Von Trier movie again. He hates women and it shows.

ON ANY LEVEL","review":"I loved Breaking the Waves..I love Bjork;Catherine Deneuve...sorry if my spelling is incorrect!..However, this film is stiffly acted, BADLY acted actually.Because the dialogue is so simplistic/limited there is no REAL character development. I found the whole film to be ludicrous.A real shame as it had such potential to be both innovative and moving; just as Breaking the Waves was.Incidentially, Catherine Deneuve looks absolutely leaden and foolish in the \\"dancing\\" scenes when the film moves into a musical...reminding me of a music video...number.I am thoroughly disappointed. I am shocked at so many positive reviews.The music incidentally was also ridiculous. The lyrics are innane, the music barely tolerable.Less talent exhibited here than in a student film at a third rate art school."},{"rating":"1","title":"unwatchable","review":"but somehow i managed to wake up for the dancing numbers, which were different and interesting ... and Bjork does a lovely job ... but the movie is tedious, empty, devoid of reality at so many levels, a void that is replaced by nothing, an emptiness that is shattered by trite, repetitive dialog and repetitive points.

The final scenemade me feel ill... At the end I was torn between snapping the movie disc in half and storming out of the house or just sitting on my brown couch in a state of shock. The couch won, dammit."},{"rating":"2","title":"An art house melodrama that will leave you crying ...","review":"Im not a von Trier fan - usually his films are too cerebral for their own good. However, here he surrendered himself to the melodramatic story, and made one of the most heartbreaking (and disturbing...) films I've ever seen.The story is quite a cliche - An almost blind women, tries to save money for a surgery for her son, and of course she finds trouble on the way..What make this almost silly story so affective is the fact that all characters are extremly human. I dare you to watch the last scene without crying!Bjork's acting is a bit amateurish, and can become annoying, but she has a certain naive charm that makes you love the character inspite all. Catherine Deneuve is great and her cool style balances Bjork hysteric acting style (almost...).However, this film continues Von Trier sadistic tendency of taking a bright-eyed, lovable heroine and abusing her so much that you feel like a sadist watching the film...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardest Movie You Will Ever Love","review":"Bjorks stunning and real feeling performance as a mother slowly going blind while working day and night to save enough money to save her son from the same fate is heartrending and remarkable. The movie is shot from a number of stationary cameras rather than cameras following the action. This creates an affect that allows the viewer to feel more like they are eves dropping on someone else.

I'm attracted and repulsed by this film at the same time in that it is such a good film but also actually emotionally painful to watch. I've seen this film 3 times and each time I sob uncontrollably at the end. I recommend this film to people but also caution them because it is so powerful that it transcends the surface entertainment that most films are made for. I know it is just a movie but there is something deeper in this film that transforms in into a very believable temporary reality that lingers on after you've seen the film. Perhaps it is also due to Bjork's acting which in some cases, she wasn't acting, but actually being Selma. She did say that it was emotionally draining making the film. I don't usually waste my time writing reviews for movies, but after seeing this film, you have to get it out of you.

Von Trier pushes her straight past method acting and headlong into what can only be called \\"snuff\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird, weirder, weirdest","review":"This movie is another example of what I think of as a farce: a filmmaker, desperate to make something &#65533;different&#65533;, laughing up his sleeve at those who rave about it. The plot was a real stretch....many of the issues presented would never have happened, even in 1964, when the movie took place.This was one of the most depressing and ludicrous exercises in filmmaking that I have ever seen. Frankly, I cannot believe that I watched it until the end! I could not believe that the cast broke into song and dance when they did.....even on Death Row!!!! Even if these were fantasies to allow Selma to cope, they were so out of place!The other annoying aspect was the shakiness of the hand-held (I assume) cameras which cut off the top of actors&#65533; heads and were sometimes out of focus,among other things.Bjork was the one shining light in this film.

Pennies from Heaven was a masterpiece; Dancers in the Dark is not. The choreography of the dance sequences of this film is primitive, and the songs instantly forgetable. The main character Selma's emotions appear contrived and superficial, as she tries to hide the facts about her son's operation and her landlord's bankruptcy. If the landlord hasn't stolen Selma's money, there would not be much drama at all.The great injustice here is that this film received the Cannes Festival Award while Pennies from Heaven is mostly forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product","review":"very disappointed in these topiaries.

Later when I looked to track my package, I found I was being being charged $26.95. When I called Amazon to complain, I was told that it was because I used one-click feature. That is quite an expensive convenience.I am fairly satisfied with the merchandise, but consider this a rip off, and my opinion of Amazon has dropped considerably."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real thing","review":"This remote cable works. A hands free shutter release is necessary for good results even from a 10.2 megapixle camera. I use it in low light and tripod/unipod shots and telephoto shots when camera shake can ruin any picture. You can buy a cheaper version from 3 or 4 outfits in China but I went with the original equipment supplier. Using this item with a digital camera guarantees no distortion from camera movement during the shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twayne's Guides","review":"Margaret McDowell writes with a keen eye for literature. You won't find yourself agreeing with everything she says, but she's clearly done her homewwork on McCullers, one of this centuries finest writers of Southern Gothic. Every essay in this book draws you deeper and more perilously into McCullers' lonely world, one fraught with misfits and outcasts... and the prospect that you may never emerge from it yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turn of the Century Parlor Book","review":"This book was written in the era prior to mass media forms such as TV, Radio, etc.were widely available. The parlor book, or porch book was used by the family as entertainment and the reader best able to read out loud would be the evening or afternoon's source of entertainment. The style of writing was captivating, and the stories gripping and often sensational with unexpected outcomes that really suprpised their audiences. This book having several stories in it was a real deal. The Mother in the house that could afford books and could read them was the \\" TV\\" of that era and read to her children at bedtime, thus the origin of the child's bedtime story which continues even now."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing to do with Honduras","review":"I looked it up on Wiki, and O. Henry spent at the most 6 months in Honduras, probably less. There is no evidence he spoke Spanish. So unless he were a prodigy of some sort, he would not be expected to learn or experience much of the real country during his short stay. And this book bears this out. There is nothing of Honduras in this book. It is unfortunate that the reader might conclude that the book arises out of some actual knowledge or experience of the country, or sympathy with its people, because that is decidedly not the case. And the author butchers what spanish he attempts. For that matter, the author's english is often absurd. Didn't Graham Greene's travels to Mexico result in works of enduring value? It's a pity the same can't be said of O'Henry in Honduras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pocket knife. Good value","review":"I have several pocket knives; this by far is my favorite.

I would recommend this as a general use pocket knife. Would but it again, but looks like if I don't loose it, it would last a long time"},{"rating":"1","title":"$10.00 wasted","review":"I bought this knife from the home depot for around $10.00 after I lost my Winchester folding knife. At first glance it seemed like a steal now, less than a full month of minor usage, it looks like I was the one taken to the bank.The most minor problem is the rubber inserts came off after just about a week. Now I'm noticing that the blade is rubbing against the inside liner and getting dull quickly because of that. Also,the blade has come loose several times and had to be tightened.The good points are that it was cheap enough to just keep on the side as a back-up if need be. It did come sharp right out of the box, did keep an edge fairly well and is easy to sharpen.The Winchester I lost was just a couple dollars more but it did last alot longer, I had it for about 5 years and would still be using it if I hadn't lost it. I would recommend looking around, there are knives with better overall quality priced competitively with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timothy Dalton at best.","review":"What a joy seeing Timothy Dalton in this movie! The BOND movies (which he is famous for) certainly do not do him any justice, as this film shows. For in this gem of a movie, he gets the opportunity to talk and talk and talk (unlike Bond movies) and here he shows his human side. He is excellent and at his best. His talents are shown off quite brilliantly. Besides the melting sound of his voice and beautiful overall essence (so handsome that it should be a crime in some parts of the world!), he is first and foremost, simply an excellent and charming actor. And he is funny too!! And as for the movie itself... Very good indeed. Sad and funny at the same time--- very bittersweet. Totally un-hollywoodish, which is a nice change of pace. All in all, this movie really is a hidden treasure. Worth seeing, especially if you are a Timothy Dalton fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very moving story","review":"I bought this VHS because it had such good reviews and I was not disappointed. I think all actors perform greatly and the movie is well worth viewing a second time. Dalton gives a fine portrayal of an ill man full of hostility and bitterness towards the world and his illness, this keeping him going in life. Edwards is his counterpart. Well acted, good story, but I can see why this movie would not be appealing to the bigger audiences. It is too close to life, too intimate a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughs & Tears","review":"I just discovered this gem and I am really glad I did. The show has plenty of laughs and also some tears. I especially enjoyed the performance of Timothy Dalton, as a terminally ill patient, who as a member of the \\"Hawks\\" finds the strength needed to help his friend, played by Anthony Edwards, who has the same condition realize his wish to visit the brothels in Amsterdam.The story comes from the ideas of Barry Gibb and David English and is wonderfully written. And Barry Gibb has again proven his musical ability with the selection of material for the movie score, as well as his vocal ability as he does the vocals for the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fine film","review":"I found the film moving and true to life, maybe because four of my relatives, including my wife, died from cancer, and never gave up; and because I worked for many years in Holland.

The first six months was nothing but a struggle as the poorly designed PalmOS crashed repeatedly and \\"hard.\\" As a person who has owned a Palm III and Palm V and loved both, it looks to me that the PalmOS is on its last legs, and is showing its age. Multitasking isn't available, and little things like receiving a text message while on the phone confuse the thing.It tries to be a PDA, it tries to be a phone. It excels at neither.This will be my last PalmOS device.

I have a 3rd party program on here to try and fix the issue and it is no help. 3 different bluetooth headsets, no help either.2) Stability, this thing does a reset for literally no reason other than it wants to.If/when the 700p or the rumored Hollywood makes it's debut on GSM, then I might consider it, otherwise I might switch to a blackberry 8700c, but paying 44.99 for the blackberry data plan is highway robbery vs the 19.99 I play for the unlimited media plan, and it is the same thing...I will say this, if you are thinking about getting a Treo, it is a crap shoot on whether you are getting a stable phone. It is a great device that allows you to have everything in one place: phone, contacts, data, email, etc...however the platform stability is horrible...Good luck if you buy one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEAD Phone","review":"I tried Treo with Cingular but it kept on dying on me.

I guess I should have read the specs before buying.I am a software engineer, I am not exactly technology-challenged. I was able to synchronize with the computer after 2 painful hours by NOT following the instructions of the manual.As far as internet access is concerned, it never worked. I talked to 5 different technicians, 10 customer representatives, and after 5 times being told: \\"OK, I just changed the right parameter on our server, wait 2 hours and this should work now\\", I gave up and returned the unit to the store.I don't care if it's Sprint's fault, Palm's fault, or my fault, I wasted my week-end and I am back with my old phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good phone","review":"I have owned this phone for about four months now.

What did you say??\\" I had a T-Mobile Blackberry 7100t phone and that phone is a ROCKSTAR compare to this Treo. Even my bluetooth headset doesn't work well on it. I had to stop using the earpiece and put the phone to my ear, which I think is VERY, VERY uncomfortable. The QWERTY keyboard is too small for my fingers and I'm always mispelling words because my finger will the next key. Unfortunately, T-Mobile doesn't work well at my new apartment so that's why I had to disconnect.I give it a 2-star for the sleek look and design though. It also syncs up my Address Book and iCal to my Mac.

The only problem is that it is not a phone.A phone will ring when someone calls you, not reboot.A phone will not go into voice mail immediately and not notify the user.You don't have to place a phone on speakerphone in order to hear what the other person is saying.When making a call, a cellphone will not crash 50% of the time.For some reason the reciever on this phone will decide when it does or doesn't actually want to work.Who cares whether or not your phone can play movies, if it can't even make a proper call. Palm promised a patch to fix all these issues, which took them 6 monthes, and still there is no change. This will be the last Palm product I buy. The cost alone is the only reason I haven't taken a hammer to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money for a better one","review":"The Treo 650 is useful as a PDA, but as a phone the sound is terrible.

When I visit any of the 3 local dealers, i feel as though i am interupting a snobby click of high school kids. Customers seems to be barely tollerated but rarely appreciiated by mangementand staff alike.The PHONE:Phone is great, it does everything from serve as a moble outlook, mp3 player, phone, speakerphone, camera, etc. The interface reflects the years of development and perfectionist views of the palm development team.

I'm hoping that I can still salvage some of the CD's and still get my money's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon's lack of customer service","review":"Sony 100 pack of CDRs is an excellent product but Amazon's customer service is abysmal. The product was poorly packed next to a very heavy item inside the same box. The CDR case was cracked open with probable damage to a couple of CDRs.

I have used Sony DVD-Rs for a long time, always with satisfactory results. Unfortunately, the same is not true for these CD-Rs. Of the 100 I bought, the first four were automatic coasters. Just to make sure it wasn't my source disc that was the problem, I popped in a TDK blank CD-R and it burned flawlessly.

Kurt Russell is perfect for the part of the fight now, talk later Jack Burton. The movie is filled with action and the unique story keeps you curosity and interest at a peak. I love this movie and recommend it to anyone looking for a funny action flick"},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous and fun viewing","review":"This whimsical action-comedy was directed by John Carpenter. Unlike some of Carpenter's earlier films(like Halloween and The Thing) Big Trouble in Little China takes on a more upbeat, and humorous, atmosphere. Surprised as I was by this change of mood, I was still able to find that the movie provided a humorous and fun viewing experience. Russell's performance, as a restless trucker who just wants his truck back, is so laughably bad that the viewer cannot help but chuckle at some of his ridiculous lines. My personal favorites are the whole, \\"Yes sir, your check is in the mail,\\" conversation, and his statement, \\"It's all in the reflexes.\\" The plot itself is as laughable as Russell; it revolves around his character getting swept into the mystical surroundings of Chinatown so he can rescue his friend's girl. It may sound hokey as all get out, but it never lets up on the action or humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon Unbox is an awful venue.","review":"Movie is fine.

It was billed as that, and doesn't try to be anything large scale. At points the energy and dialogue seemed rushed and of course was cheesy beyond doubt, but all in all it's a very fun movie to watch, and Kurt Russell gives the performance of a lifetime, as he turns on his cocky side. 5 star worthy?

Lot's of action but at the same time lot's of laugh's as well. John Carpenter has thrown in some key, funny moments that really keep the film going smoothly. And Kurt Russel is at his best as the non-typical hero who keeps dropping his weapons and getting his butt kicked, but his fast \\"reflexes\\" are what keeps him alive it seems. Some good creepy scenes from fright-master Carptenter, but not too much gore to keep the younger viewers from watching! The sound and video transfer are both great, didn't see anything distracting at all! Great Flick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As fantasy comedy, this has never been beaten","review":"A John Carpenter classic, this movie is so close to perfect it's unbelievable. Not as classic cinema, not as biting satire or high drama, but as fantasy comedy or a parody of fantasy adventure movies, it's the best I've ever seen. Everybody has fun in this movie. Russell shines as an Indiana Jones/Snake Plissken parody (a parody of Snake? Yes, indeed...). Carpenter's script is, as always, a combination of light action, horror and fantasy, with his usual meticulous research into his subject matter. Yes, all of the core fantasy elements are taken from Chinese fairy tales and mythology. Great cheesy lines, wonderful Day-Glo set design, some very wierd hells, sloppy but enthusiastic wirework and a furry monster that just won't go away make this a classic. There are many better serious movies, but very few that are so much fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this movie for years","review":"This was a gift for my daughter.

If you've never seen any of the Carpenter/Rusell team ups, this is a good one to start with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, Great DVD","review":"What a classic 80's movie. Kurt Russell stars as Jack Burton, a truck driver who falls into a plot by a Lo Pan, a mystical figure. Lo Pan is actually the owner of a wealthy export company, who wants to gain power as a sorcerer - to do so, he has to marry a rare Chinese woman with green eyes. Russell and his Chinese friends battle Lo Pan, his henchmen, and other demons. Fabulous movie.The DVD itself is great, with commentary, trailers, ads, deleted scenes, and more. My only beef is that you have no option for a fullscreen.However, if you're any kind of fan of Carpenter or Kurt Russell... buy this movie. Fun, fun, fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Trouble is Big FUN","review":"Check your reality at the door. This movie is about a \\"regular guy\\" trucker named Jack Burton (Russell) who gets caught up in this fantastic Asian subculture menace in Little China. Make no mistake -- it's a comedy with martial arts -- but not in a Jackie Chan \\"in your face\\" way. Some of the stunts are just plain funny and the story actually fits the mood and tempo very well. It's over-the-top acting that doesn't take itself seriously -- one of Kurt Russell's better character performances. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is just fun!","review":"The quality of this movie and Blu-ray is excellent. The movie itself is timeless. Lots of fun, action and adventure.

Its a great movie and the unedited version is much better"},{"rating":"2","title":"This wasn't meant to be taken seriously, people!","review":"This was a great movie on a day when you're hungry for a little comic adventure deep in the bowels of San Francisco Chinatown. It was a funny comic adventure when you need to escape from reality, that's all it has ever been and that's all it ever will be. I hate it when critics talk about a movie such as this like they walked in expecting Casablanca or something. I often wondered after this why Dennis Dun, who plays Wang Chi, a friend of Kurt Russell's character whose finacee is kidnapped by a sorceror who needs to marry her to be able to rule the Universe from beyond the grave, didn't do more in Hollywood, or even more with just John Carpenter. He played a good counterpart to Kurt Russell's Jack Burton, a guy who seemed like he'd seen one John Wayne movie too many, while his friend Wang was the calmer voice of reason. I haven't seen the DVD yet but I plan to and I'm sure it rules!"},{"rating":"1","title":"love hate","review":"DVD seams to be a copy from VHS tape. As such the audio varies as you play the movie.

Lo Pan must marry a girl with green eyes so he can regain his physical form. Now, Jack must save Wang's fiancee from Lo Pan and his henchmen, and win back his stolen truck. But how can he defeat an enemy who has no body. Big Trouble in Little China is a movie that survived thanks to the home video market and for that we can only be grateful.

It isn't like any other film the director did, but is one of the most far out fantasy/action/comedies that is the pinnacle of what an \\"80's\\" movie should be. This is probably the most influential film to the Mortal Kombat games, and is downright hilarious. The special features did leave me wanting. I purchased the Blu-Ray after my DVD copy was severely scratched, because I couldn't find the DVD edition anymore and the upgrade was cheap. I have to say that the special features are identical and the film's image quality is not really upgraded. If you own the DVD copy don't bother with the upgrade, it still has the same commentary from the laserdisc version, but if you don't own it, this is a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product was defective","review":"Product audio was terrible.

Well, considering it's one of my favorite films to watch, the answer is \\"yes\\". The picture and audio were good (bearing in mind the 80's weren't good at preserving film like today), and the commentary with Carpenter and Russell was fun (a good third of it isn't even about the movie!).

Kurt Russell does a much better job in the lead as Jack Burton. They might have called the film, Falstaff in Chinatown. There's a fine sense of humor which perfectly suits the story line. It also produces a good deal of sympathy for Jack Burton. Well, what would you do in this exciting encounter with this mysterious, magical Orient? It depends upon the support actors and actresses for the development of an incredible story along with good direction. It might be a few minutes too long but the pace of the film saves it. There ws also some fine film editing. It's wise enough to move from one scene to the other before it drags. It's a genuinely good film that I have watched on numerous occasions but I wouldn't call it an excellent or great action film. I save five stars for something outstanding in any category of film."},{"rating":"2","title":"very interesting movie","review":"i had watched this movie called big trouble in little china. i had first seen this movie on ifc on channel 209 on cable tvit was a very interesting movie because of the characters in it. with the special effects and action i had enjoyed itvery much. i would give it three and a half stars. thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in Time...","review":"I remember going to see this movie at the theater when I was about 12 years old, we didn't think it would be any good but since there was nothing else playing we went and seen it anyway.

Only problem is what Jack Burton always says: \\"You know what Jack burton also says: 'What the ...\\". I think he says the F word 3 times, so bear this in mind.Famous last words: LoPan to Jack and his reply: \\"Good Knife!.. Its all in the reflexes!\\"I used to have this rated as 5 stars WOW! but because of the language, I changed it to 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and action packed","review":"This is one of the funniest and best action movie ever made, It is incredibly original and colorfull"},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate popcorn film!","review":"This film has just about everything, action, comedy, drama, LOTS OF SCI FI, crazy Chinese wizards, ancient curses, virgin brides, Chinese women with green eyes, gang fights, ancient Chinese army fights, oriental guys flying through the air while swordfighting and spewing curses, wierd monsters and romance(thin but it's there). And that the first 20 mintutes!The dialogue is priceless, the action well done, the fight scenes HORRIBLY EXADURATED, and the pace of the film is just right.

It includes Lopez's best songs in a new version with cool remix beats and famous rappers like Ja Rule and Fat Joe help her make this fantastic CD complete. The only things that was missing, were the remix song lyrics inside the cover. I have been a great fan of Jennifer Lopez for a long time, and this is a CD that I am positive that many people will enjoy. If you liked J.Lo's pop songs they can find pop on this album, if you like her R&B and Hip Hop songs better you will find tracks in that category, too. If you like soft ballads, listen to her beautiful track, Alive, from the motion picture, Enough. If you are the sort of person who enjoys rap, there are rappers who work with Jennifer on this album, as well. Over all, It's a great album that you should definetly buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing a supposed track!!!","review":"Ok...I love remixes and this is a great CD to buy if you're a J.Lo fan or just love great remixes...but it's missing the supposed duet with international superstar Anastacia!!! That's the track I was looking forward to the most and when I bought it...it wasn't there!!! So that was a disappointment. Also, the remix of \\"Let's Get Loud\\" is not really by Pablo Flores..it's by Kung Pow. Also...the \\"Dark Child Master Mix\\" is the same as the \\"Dark Child Radio Edit\\". My favorite mix is the \\"Sack International Mix\\" of \\"Play\\"...that's a great one. Also...\\"Alive\\" is a ballad from her new movie coming out called \\"Enough\\" and it's really pretty.

Although it has songs from 2 albums, it just explodes with energy! I just heard it again on a road trip this past July in MS. There's a street feel in the first few songs, especially with Fat Joe and the few songs she did with Ja Rule. I think she's much better on the Irv Gotti/ Murder Inc. based songs than the others. Ain't It Funny and I'm Real are both hot! I still love the Rodney Jerkins remix of If You Had My Love (I thought that Puffy did it at first), the Mark Taylor/Brian Rawling rumbling remix of Walking on Sunshine, and some others. And Play's telephone sounds ringing in the song match well with the song's funky beats. The final song is nice, a very quiet ballad that Jennifer sounds classy on. This is a very unique album, far different from other remix albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter pleaser par excellence","review":"...From what little I've heard of this album, it sounds to be energetic enough and with the requisite catchy hooks.

It tasted like a bunch of powdered old HOT spices not a true fresh pepper cure.

Most people think that the button to turn it on is on the the big switch on the middle of the handle, but it's not, OKAY! There is a small black button on the bottom of the handle, making it easy to turn off and on, but when you are fighting with it, you don't accidentally turn it off when you don't want to. I would advise getting this toy if you are just going to swing it around, but I wouldn't suggest buying it if you want to duel with the EpisodeI lightsabers. Those are somewhat more durable than these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why this kind of a rating?","review":"I bought this lightsaber right after the movie came out. I was so disappointed with this lightsaber. I hate the fact that the blade doesn't retract all the way, which makes it looks weird when you aren't using it. The blade was bent after my first \\"battle\\". The light up blade didn't light up after my first try with the lightsaber. It looks kinda cool when the blade is out, but how you can't swing properly with the huge switch there on the handle. It looks real and it is Anakin's lightsaber until the end, where his lightsaber is taken away, but come on, make the lightsaber a bit more durable?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Saber","review":"This is one of the best lightsabers you can buy. It is great for detail and looks just like the saber in the film \\"Attack of the Clones\\". Anakin is the best character I belive in EP II. The clear blue blade is a great improvement from the EP I sabers. I was hoping that i could somehow remove the blade, like you can with the EP I Darth Maul Saber. The sounds could of been different as they are the same as the EP I sounds which were not great. I like the feel of the saber as you swing it. Overall this is a hard to find product so buy it if you see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The legendary Anakin blue lightsaber","review":"This is the most important of all the lightsabers in Star Wars. It is the weapon wielded by the Chosen One (Anakin), but it is also the weapon that represents to Luke his following of his father's path.That being said, the toy could have been better. It is predictably similar in design to Darth Vader's red lightsaber, save for one major difference. On Vader's saber, the activation switch was a rectangular button in the middle of the hilt, which worked just fine. On Anakin's saber, why Hasbro chose to turn the activation switch into a useless block is beyond me. Instead, they placed the \\"On\\" button at the bottom of the hilt. Very strange. When swinging it, one must contend with a useless block in the middle of the handle that does nothing but annoy.Buy Anakin's to own the most important lightsaber of them all. Go on [local store] to buy Vader's electronic lightsaber for a similar but better designed toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointing","review":"These latest lightsabers are just rehashes of the EP1 types. They don't retract all the way into the handle (very disappointing) but apart from that it's an ok toy. At least it's better than the other type of lightsaber on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely an Improvement!","review":"When \\"The Phantom Menace\\" came out, with it came flimsy, boring lightsabers. Now, the Attack of the Clones sabers are made from durable plastic! When \\"ignited\\", the sabers hum and when hit against something, they clash, like a real lightsaber! It is so cool, I will be waiting in line for \\"Attack of the Clones,\\" lightsaber in hand! Another added bonus would be that the plastic is see-through, making the lightsaber look sleek and shiny. A very nice lightsaber!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"These new episode 2 lightsabers are a complete failure.Here's why:1)The lightsaber plastic is transparent. As a result the lightsaber doesn't glow good at all.....like Qui-gon Jinn's did.2)The on button to turn on the saber is placed right where you cant miss hitting it when your wielding the lightsaber-very frustrating!3)It's hard to even hold the lightsaber, because theres all these things protruding out. Look at the handdle in the picture, and observe the plastic.It's not worth it at all, I strongly do not recommend this as a fun toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Type","review":"This lightsaber looks nice but isn't.

To make things worse, there's a huge block in the middle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The true lightsaber","review":"When I bought this lightsaber I couldn't wait to try it out. The sound FX is cool,and the light is awsome. There are only a few things wrong with it.1.The blade doesn't go all the way in. 2.When the light is on the blade looks sort of clearish.3.the last thing is that when you hold it by it's handle,you always seem to hit the on and off button. I have found a way to hold the handle without touching the button. The square thing on the side of the handle is where you put you're hand. Put one hand above it but on the side though,and the other hand right below it. that should solve the handle prob."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Popular Toy: Anakin Lightsaber","review":"If your child is a Star Wars Fan, You need to have this Toy Lightsaber in his or her STAR WARS COLLECTION.

Last year's darth maul double-saber was a joke as far as functionality and durability. This thing is much more durable, i.e., kids can really have duels with it, and has great interactive sounds. When the saber touches something, you hear a clashing sound. The fact that it lights up is also nice. This is a great toy that should be a part of every Star Wars collection. My 5 year old son loves it and I'm tempted to buy one for myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anakin Lightsaber","review":"This is an excellent lightsaber i waited for at least a month just to get this lightsaber, let me just say it was worth the wait!

The beginning of the book was okay, and I reallie liked the main character Rennie. But as I continued to read I found that the story was dragging, and wasn't seeming to get any better along the way. I kept expecting something interesting to happen, or for the story to take a twist for the better but it never did. I didn't even want to finish the book, but I had to for my English class. This was the first book my Margaret Atwood I had ever read, and it almost turned me off her all together. (and believe me, I love to read, and had never been this turned off by a book before) Luckily I decided to try reading the Handmaid's Tale, and really enjoyed it, but I would never recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange but Compelling","review":"Though I wouldn't consider this my favorite Atwood novel, it is a good one, nonetheless.

After all, it's Dick Morris - need I say more. Didn't think so. Dick Morris has proven himself amongst preeminent political gurus of the last quarter century through his skillful handling of Clinton's ongoing improprieties in The White House. Although he was let go by Clinton, Dick Morris shows little or no ill will towards his former boss. He tends to lampoon Al Gore moreso and his total fiasco of a campaign in 2000. From his unique insights into Watergate to his visceral reaction to Hillary's lewd advances toward him, this shocking tour de force is any political pundit's book du jour, if you will. I was contemplating giving it 4 stars due to his lack of dirt on Clinton, but then I remembered one thing: It's Dick Morris. 5 Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a word of warning !!!","review":"If you want to win at all costs, this book might serve you well.

Don't be too impressed by his use of political anecdotes because there are many sides to each one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating insight","review":"Morris' book is a fascinating look about what history has taught him -- and us -- about the pursuit of power, and how leaders have used their power to succeed or fail. From Lincoln to Reagan, FDR to JFK, the author explains what works and what doesn't. Cynics should note that what works is, much more often than not, what most Americans would call \\"the right thing\\": standing on one's principles. Perhaps the most interesting part of the book is the analysis of Bush's response to our unexpected national crisis, and how his leadership compares to leaders in previous crises.History buffs should appreciate Morris' unique perspectives, and readers who are more concerned with current events should be intrigued by what the past can tell us about George W. Bush's presidential performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"A limited analysis of political leaders","review":"Morris is an intelligent and astute political advisor, but this book is dull, repeats itself and really has nothing to say. The new prince was an exciting piece of political writing, this is dull and dreary.

I do agree with the author's premise that ADD is just a way of being that is \\"different\\", and even advantageous in certain situations, instead of \\"wrong\\", \\"defective\\", or \\"sick\\". However this book is not the self-help manual I was expecting. Instead it is full of tedious and repetitive analysis of the supposed evolutionary roots of ADD and technical discussions of the specific genes that supposedly contribute to a tendency towards ADD. This may be of interest to some but is not the best choice for an ADDer looking for practical strategies to improve their life. I resolutely plowed through the first couple of chapters, but after seeing that it was going nowhere just skimmed the rest of the book.

I would like to point out that most of Janis' best songs are not featured here. I would really recommend buying \\"The Essential Janis Joplin\\". However, this album is an excellent place to start.What I love most about Janis on this album is her signature raspy vocals, unleashed raw energy and the real true gem of this record, is the live version of \\"Ball And Chain\\".(Which is one of my VERY favorite songs of hers).One cannot deny the power and substance of such stellar tracks here such as \\"Piece Of My Heart\\", \\"Me And Bobby McGee\\" and \\"Move Over\\". Another exciting highlight on this greatest hits compilation would be Janis' cover of the Gershwin classic \\"Summertime\\".Overall an excellent snapshot of Janis and the music of the late 60's."},{"rating":"1","title":"JOPLINS SMELL SO POTENT IT DROVE ME FROM THE MUSIC","review":"Janis joplin is the most overated thing since Jesus.so she was the first big thing in terms of being a woman.

Only in the 60s could an unstable drug addict and alcoholic calling herself \\"Pearl\\" screech her way to the status of superstar. Janis Joplin was a TERRIBLE singer! She couldn't sing at all, all she could do was squawk the lyrics in that raspy voice of hers. And although Ms. Joplin's singing voice was frightening to listen to, I still actually enjoy her music for the sheer comedic value. Hearing Janis wheeze and croak her way through the dreadful \\"Me and Bobby McGee\\" like some dimented frog is actually FUNNY because its just so amusingly bad. Janis Joplin sounded more like a drug addicted frog with no talent whatsoever.

I GOT 'DEM OL' KOZMIC BLUES AGAIN MAMA! has only one song, \\"Try\\", while the whole album is great. PEARL has the majority of cuts, plus a few from CHEAP THRILLS, IN CONCERT and one from BIG BROTHER AND THE HOLDING COMPANY (yet to be released on CD!).

I've never been one to do weight lifting or serious cardio. Ellen's workouts keep me feeling great. I alternate between the three videos during the week (Mon, Wed, Fri)and do my treadmill in between for more cardio. Over the years, I've joined various exercise programs only to quit because of the inconvenience. With Ellen, I can do the routines right in my own home, first thing in the morning, then get on with my day. I have two other of her tapes, but prefer the three I mentioned. I believe these exercise programs will keep me feeling good and hopefully prevent some of the stiffness and lack of mobility that plagues many of us as we get older.

Ellen Barrett's style is upbeat and encouraging without being cheesy and her workout partners actually look like real women! Another good one from The Studio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This book did little for me. At times, it read like nothing more than a recount of 1970's brand names and music trivia.

I would not recommend this work to the casual reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent Pulp Fiction instead","review":"Maybe it's just me but this whole violence being cool thing has wore very thin for me. This is not the 70's that I remember though I'm sure at some level it existed.

I mean \\"Superfly\\" was one thing but this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book!","review":"This was my first book by this author, and I don't think I want to read another. I like the genre of \\"hard-boiled\\" detective novels, but Pelecanos obviously thinks \\"scummy\\" means the same. There's not one likable character in the book, nor is there a believable one. A small potatoes dope dealer and a record store owner who pride themselves on knowing the bass player for Funkadelic do not compelling protagonists make. A real bummer and a chore to read. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT MY CUP OF TEA!!!","review":"I am sorry. Have read several books by Pelecanos ant this is the only one I have not liked. I quit reading after 108 pages. To much reference to songs and movies. Nearly every page talkes abou different songs and who likes what. Also, way to much sex for me. Sex with man and woman, sex with man and man. I like good crime books but not sex books. I am sure I am in the minority and the book will go great guns but it is not for me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"getting tiresome","review":"So I decide to give Pelecanos a second chance after the narcoleptic Down By The River... and what do I get? A sawbuck poorer and a couple hours off my life that I'll never see again. And the music cues just keep on coming long after we're dead tired of hearing them (hot tip: just mix a greatest hits cd and release that instead). Slightly more hardboiled than a Phyllis Richman culinary mystery, only with people getting shot in the head. But hey, it must be good because he uses actual street names, right? Gimme a break! Never again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulp Fiction episode one","review":"First book I read while searching for an Elmore Lenard book picked it up couldn't stop reading it the characters and the situations make it worthy for video or even T.V.

The sheath is made of hard plastic and has a nice \\"click\\" to it when you put the sword in. It locks into the sheath. The straps are removable and customizable. Without messing with the straps the entire things tilts more towards the horizontal plane. Putting the actual handle postion somewhere below your shoulder. I came up with a strap layout to create a back mounted sheath where the blade handle sticks up farther, roughly 2-3 inches from 90 degrees. Not very sharp but you can sharpen it. I cut a bunch of trees with it and it worked well. Handle did not unravel either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhhhh, no...","review":"FOR SHOW ONLY. Blade is cheap. Threw it lightly downward into a log and the whole tip bent. Not a heavy duty sword at allll. Chips out of blade also just from casual brush clearing. Wrap around handle is wack and wrap comes lose and travels up and down blade, underneath the wrap is some black plastic. Maybe causing the wrap to travel idk?... lol...

Sorry about the language, but i don't see the point of this over the top camp musical and also whats Walter Matthau doing in it. It's a musical man and you can't sing.

Now i don't meen to offend any of her fans in this review so from now on i suggest you look away.The woman sounds like shes got a cold and when she \\"attempts\\" the high notes she sounds like a male horse been run over. Her acting is not mutch better as she performs as though she should be doing an ameteur production in the Skegness resort for tourists.Micheal Crawford is [weak] ...

Picking Barbra instead of Channing or any of the others who played the Dolly role was the first mistake. Too young and too Fanny Brice-ish. Second mistake, leaving out original numbers for ballads created and styled just for Streisand and Louie Armstrong. Only reason to buy this album is for Michael Crawford and the dance numbers.

Although a bit silly at times, this movie will have you ready to get up and dance! The characters are sometimes ridiculous, but quite lovable, and Barbara Streisand plays a wonderful, bubbly Dolly Levi who wants you to \\"just leave everything to me!\\" The energy and enthusiasm put into this movie is contagious, and will leave you feeling happy.

I highly recommend this for a few laughs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best... Where's the DVD?","review":"As a musical theatre fan, the film version of Hello Dolly! is one of my favorites. This grand movie musical is incredible both because of the massive scope of the production and the performances of its stars. So much attention is given to the fact that Barbara S. was \\"too young\\" to play the role of Dolly Levi. Let me say this: I've seen Carol Channing do the part on stage...and the movie would have been ENTIRELY different with her on the screen. Barbara adds some incredible energy and fun that I don't believe Channing would have carried on-screen. I'm just waiting for the DVD version to become available to purchase this CLASSIC must-have film. Did you know Hello Dolly! beat out WEST SIDE STORY for the Best Musical Tony?

I can't possibly imagine it having been done any other way, with all due respect to those fine actresses who have belted out the same song.

And keep in mind that I am a huge fan of Gene Kelly and musicals. This one is not any good though. I just fast-forwarded through most of the songs. They start completely irrelevant to the main plot and seems to be there for the sake of being there. Almost like the director said: \\"Every 10 minutes we start new musical number, doesn't matter which one\\". There is no chemistry between two main characters. Acting seems forced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Striesand & Cast of Thousands Sink to the Bottom","review":"Over-long, over-blown, and remarkably slow, the film version is perhaps most remarkable for its incredibly bad casting. The music is a delight, and the incredibly miscast Striesand gives full vocal reign to her songs, but this alone is not enough to make the film-- which has some of the stagiest cinematography since the 1930s-- a success. One star for Striesand's attempts to pull it off and a one star for dazzling costumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great musical, Streisand again overcontrols","review":"Though the songs are wonderful, and the rest of the cast is exactly what I like in a Broadway musical, once again Streisand ruins it for me. Her constant need to upstage and control counteracts the Ensemble mood this piece needs to achieve. While Dolly is truly a memorable character and needs someone strong, the rest of the cast deserves their moment because they are all truly wonderful. I adore Horace: Walter Mathau is superb. Louis Armstrong is a perfect adition, and Barnabas and his buddy are comically appealing. I just would've loved to have seen this with someone willing to share the spotlight. Technically, BS is fine, but I never got the impression she felt any of the music. She never \\"became\\" Dolly, to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, bad seller","review":"The stupid guy who sold me this video only sold me half of the movie.

It is a movie with the title Hello, Dolly! and mostly the same score by Jerry Herman, but it is not the musical it is supposed to be based on. I love Barbra, but everyone should know their own limitations, and she is just not right at all for Dolly Levi. Why didn't someone call Carol Channing? The movie is a bad rendition of a wonderful musical, with a lot of soul and feeling. It is lost in this movie version. If you want to see or hear a good version of Hello, Dolly, buy the cd of the original 1964 Broadway cast or 1994 Broadway revival, because this is just not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only watched it to see Michael Crawford.

The laser disk is superb. The image is very crisp and the sound is dazzling. The DVD images are blurry, especially at the beginning of \\"Parade\\". The sound is compressed and the crispness is gone. I ran them side by side and the differences are not subtle, but huge. If this DVD is all there is right now, we are stuck with it. The experience can be so much more thrilling. Let's get this gem re-remastered, or better yet, put on Blu-Ray!

As scheming Dolly Levi, (correct spelling) Streisand has quick lines and a myriad of songs to perform, and she does a great job. For instance: \\"You wanna marry Horace Vandergelder, Ms. Levi?\\" \\"Why, I don't know what put such a foolish idea into my head ... your head ... heh heh.\\" Her heavenly singing voice helps her sing such cute songs as+AH4-+AH4- \\"Put On Your Sunday Clothes,\\" \\"So, Long Dearie!\\" and of course: \\"Hello, Dolly!\\" She's a gem in a wonderful musical!

After finally seeing it for the first time my first thoughts were \\"That was wildly miscast, and the plot made NO sense whatsoever\\". Subsequent investigation proved I am not alone in these opinions, the substance of which can be found in many other reviews of this film.In toto, if you're a fan of Barbra and immense egos then this is the film for you. Otherwise, rent or buyThe Music Man (Special Edition). You'll have a much better time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Carol? Bring back Carol!","review":"I adore Barbra Streisand, but I must say that she is not Dolly. Someone else reviewed it that she was not middle-aged, and therefore did not play it middle-aged, but the fact of the Matter is that Dolly is middle-aged, and Barbra was not. She is also just not right for the role.The other thing in the cutting and hacking of the score. Jerry Herman himself complained about how and where his songs were placed in this movie. He even wrote a new song (\\"Just Leave Everything to Me\\") in for Barbra in replacement of \\"I Put My Hand In,\\" and says in his autobiography that it was moved from where he originally intended it, to a spot that did not work as well. Get the cd with Carol Channing (original cast or revival, both are just fine), and then get Funny Girl if you like Barbra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbra is more believable than Carol Channing as Dolly","review":"If you like musicals, be sure to watch this one! Barbra Streisand is pretty gushy as Dolly Levy, but SO likeable!! Some of Dolly's one-liners have stayed with me for years. Until recently, I didn't know that the taller of the two boys who worked for Horrace VanDerGelder is THE Michael Crawford--of Phantom of the Opera fame!!!! Great cast and great fun in this movie.

Stravinsky's music for this opera-oratorio is compelling and beautiful. Julie Taymor succeeded in transforming what the composer saw as a static staging into a great experience with the right amount of movement without contradicting the composer's vision.This was a staged production with some minimal additions to create a film. It was performed in 1992 (and filmed on super film) so, compared to today's films and technologies, it looks old. But, with a little imagination you can be transported into the theater. Being in that theater should have been an incredible experience!The singers are exceptional including the young Bryan Terfel. The reconstructed sound is very good.I strongly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in Stravinsky's work, and who longs for creative and daring production of operas that maintain the composer's vision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous content pitiful edition","review":"The magnificence of the poetry is basely served by the crassness of this print edition.

There is much valid and exciting music in the series \\"Entartete Musik\\" from London. The symphony here might not be musically what the Krenek from the same series is, but one cannot deny that this was a composer of some talent in the genre. Its orchestra is very large and well used. After only one listen, I am convinced that Rathaus was able to bring melody into his neo-romantic symphony, which is full of dissonances (at least for 1922) but never approaches atonality. To me, the symphony outshines the ballet, but that could also be a statement borne from a personal bias towards a sometimes too \\"Hanslick\\" view of music(I apologize if that offends). Both are admirably played and the sound is good as well. While this disc is going to appeal chiefly to the connosieur, it should undoubtedly do so at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This has been a real revelation and with no doubt a great hit from Decca\`s wonderful Entartete Musik's series. This unknown composer really catches thebest of Krenek\`s or Zemlinky's style in his music and the results are highly compelling. I really admire the innovative orchestral resources in the 1stsymphony as in the ballet, keeping in tonality all time. Der Letzte Pierrotis even more enjoyable. Here Rathaus evokes and shares Stravinsky\`s Petrouchka language and background, but in a very original way, keeping a real and veryconvincent personality through this music.

For application, the regular propane torch melts it fine and allows for you to work the melted solution to the bottom with a screwdriver. Melt in a small area of about 8 inches after placing it in the cracks. I used a disposable trauma shears to cut it in half for smaller cracks.This is a job that does not need to completed all at once. With the cost of driveway repairs, this is the best thing to prevent cracks from growing."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, So good","review":"I am really glad that I purhased this product. It is time consuming to apply, not in the least bit strenuos, and extremely easy to work with. It stretches to fill smaller cracks, and double or triples up nicely for larger cracks. It also acts as a leveler does when fully melted. I didn't even need to wash my hands when I was done, but I did. I added some very small pebbles to the melted product before it cooled off completly, which I am glad I did. It also seems to go a long ways for the amount of crack I filled. I bet it will really make the driveway look nice again once I add on the final sealer.

Made in 1976, the film stars Brooks, Dom DeLuise and Marty Feldman as a trio of movie makers trying to make a silent film that will save the studio run by Sid Caesar.The jokes are stale and the attempts at slapstick are poor. The guest stars (James Caan, Burt Reynolds, Liza Minelli) are completely wasted in their small cameo roles, and the only effective use Brooks gets is from his gorgeous wife Anne Bancroft who does a dance number that is the only highlight in what is otherwise a flat film.If you like silent films, the real treats in this genre are Dick Van Dyke's homage to Buster Keaton - \\"The Comic\\" (1969) - and the recent Oscar winning \\"The Artist\\" (2011)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie","review":"My husband's dream was to watch this movie.

It grabs the readers attention and then keeps it. I would recommend this novel to anyone from age 15 up and to anyone that has ever been in any type of the military. Jones makes this novel flow with the amazing life of Robert E. Lee Prewitt. This is a great main character because like a hero Prewitt is extremely tough and determined. The novel becomes even more interesting with the secret affair of character Warden and Karen, and many other page turning events. This is a very down to earth novel and it reads quickly and easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"So real despite author's disclaimer, no PC in this book","review":"As a military veteran and an officer, I found this book so real. You knew the only way James Jones could write it was to have personally experienced it in the Army. I read it took him 7 years to write it--meaning he had to do lot of soul-searching to get his own experiences into a novel form. One thing that strikes me now is how there is no Political Correctness (PC) in the book regarding Jews, Blacks, Pacific Islanders, Italians, etc. Jones does such a good job of being realistic of that time that I did not take it as specific racism[ as you might find in subtle forms in today's literature because of PC]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too long!","review":"I was in the U.S. Army for four years, '67-71. During those years, I did not read Jones, Mailer, or any other military-related novels. I was able to do so a couple of years later. From Here To Eternity struck me as no other novel had. Jones absolutely captured the depravity, decency, tenderness, and brutality of what it is to be a soldier. No one has ever done it better. I read the last page on a bus, and still feel the loss of it ending. I wish it had continued. As good as the other two books in the trilogy, Thin Red Line and Whistle, they do not approach the depth and truth of From Here to Eternity. One of the few great american novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very long but very good","review":"This book was long but I am pretty glad I read it. Although it was long it was well done. There are long stretches of conversatation or internal monolugue that put me to sleep then there were scenes that were so heart wrenchingly beautifully written I almost couldn't breathe. Also, the ending is great, it really tied up nicely. The characters were real and believable, sad and complicated. I feel as if I have an understanding of Army life after living with this book for so long, not that it interests me much, but Jones did a great job of drawing the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Novels About Army Life Before World War II.","review":"FROM HERE TO ETERNITY is an American classic and one of the very best novels about army life before World War II.

The story is also greatly enhanced by some of the most believable and interesting characters you will ever meet in fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Here to Eternity","review":"This book was amazing. I have to state, for the record, that I read James Jonse's \\"trilogy\\" out of order and completly inside out, reading The Thin Red Line, after seeing the amazing movie adaptation which is really a compalation of the first two Jones books, then Whistle, and last From Here to Eternity. i was imediatly caught up in the character of Prewitt/Witt and really enjoyed the depth into which Jones selves into his characters, so deep it borders on raw. I read this book at a time when I was questioning many of the same things that the characters were questioning. Another point that I found interesting is the way that he narrates death. this is lost in Whistle because Jones himself died before finishing the book, making for an uneven ending, but in from Here to Eternity he has a strong command of how to reach itno his readers and pull their heart-strings. Sitck with it through its monsterous length. it's more than worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A minority report","review":"I just finished listening to 30 hours of From Here to Eternity and was deeply disappointed. From my experience listening vs. reading makes little difference in the quality of the experience and I found the book an ambitious wordy pot-boiler. Jones goes off on lengthy discursions (for example Mulloy's lectures on the Wobblies, unions, etc.) and I just wished he would get on with it. I acknowledge Jones's frankness of language and openness of GIs exploiting gay men in Hawaii just before the was (I heard/read the new uncensored version that had many many four letter words and the full gay Magio episode). Nevertheless, I grew increasingly impatient during this lengthy and ultimately very disappointing novel.

Give me one of these cheapo machines over one of the fancy ones any day!The problem with this particular model is that it's badly engineered. It can not hold the pressure to do a good job of steaming the milk. Worse, it often sprays coffee and grounds for several feet across my kitchen counter. Sometimes, it literally explodes under pressure and I have to run for cover and then spend ten minutes cleaning up the kitchen.

In this deck it shows a woman going through various stages of emotion from happiness to depression instead of the tradition image of a wheel showing the waxing and waning of fate - a more powerful image. The Magician is also weak in the Robin Wood deck, a laughing man with antlers on his head - give me a break!

I don't believe that is the case for most of us; in fact it is the watered-down quality that irritates so much. You feel that the wiccan beliefs, or the tarot, are not being portrayed with mature power and passion. The images are a cross between the Sunday comics section (Prince Valiant-type heroes and busty beauties) and a Jehovah's Witness leaflet, with joy and wholesome love glistening in every eye. The people are relentlessly white and blonde. It is a very unsophisticated palette, but apparantly it appeals to many. For me, there are vast, uncharted existential realms that are not even touched upon by these images, and I find the art shallow and annoyingly hard to take.

Although I have outpaced its illustrations, I can still recommend it. In particular, I like the black and white candles behind the Magician, and the non-traditional presentation of the Devil and Judgement cards. This set is also far more detailed than the Rider-Waite deck, which I have seen in books and which left me rather cold. On the flip side, the Hierophant is portrayed as an archbishop or pope -- blatantly Christian in an otherwise Pagan deck. I also found the accompanying booklet unhelpful to a beginner. However, the Robin Wood deck, when properly paired with an explanitory book of your choosing, is an excellent introduction to the Tarot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely beautiful deck!","review":"I'm fairly new to Tarot, and this is only my second deck.

I also like that the Devil card is more signified with a temptation sequence, which is a more accurate keyword for this card.

I even called to be sure nothing was wrong with the seat and Evenflo told me they have to make it difficult to loosen so that not just anyone (a kid) could loosen it but in my opinion I don't feel that is safe.

Knobs tighened the harness OK for awhile but I always struggled with the levers to loosen it. Now after a year and only two major adjustments, the harness cannot be loosened or tightened.Also, the straps are always twisting (but I've always had that problem with Evenflo)-minor issue compared to the harness adjustment problem. For that reason I would not recommend this carseat or any other with similar knob and lever mechanisms on the sides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable Seat for Baby","review":"I am using the seat rear facing with my 9 month old. The seat was OK to install, and once everything was adjusted, my child is cofortable and easy to move in and out. I bought the seat before a 3.5 hour car ride and she did not fuss a bit. Although I only buckle and unbuckle the straps to get her in and out, the belt release would be a bit hard to use while rear facing. In my Town & Country it is jammed against the seat. But like I said, there is no need to loosen the belts once it is adjusted properly. I only have to buckle and unbukle her and the straps always stay in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great features","review":"The first thing that attracted me to this seat is that I could easily adjust the straps to fit at shoulder level. I have had NO problems with the dials. Extending rear facing as long as possible is a huge priority for me, so the 35 pound RF limit was very attractive over the usual 30 pound RF limits. My child will be able to be in a 5 point harness a lot longer... up to 50 pounds, which is at least a year more than standard 40 lb harness. This seat is comfortable, and easy for me to use, which makes using car seats THE RIGHT WAY EVERY TIME much easier. As an added bonus, it is pretty nice looking, and VERY easy to install.

I didn't know what to expect of this book (let's just say I didn't know what I was missing). This was a fabulous book, and an enthralling story. I should have known that I would have loved anything by Dolores, but it took me a long time to get to this book.The book is about a girl who fell in love with a spirit. There is a lot more to the story than this, but I don't want to spoil it for you - you must read it for yourselves. It is a magickal story, which is absolutely wonderful! I couldn't put it down once I started it. I recommend it to anyone who likes romance, magick, and history. This is a book which will have you enthralled from beginning to end. Finally, when you finish it and put it down, it will leave you with a wonderful feeling, which to me is what great books are all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lost play that was found and brought to life","review":"\\"Splendid's,\\" the play by Jean Genet, has been translated into English by Neil Bartlett and published in book form with an introduction by Edmund White. The introductory materials in this book note that Genet finished the play in 1948 and that it was considered lost; the text was published in France in 1993. As a stage production, it received its British premiere in 1995.As the play opens, a group of gangsters known as the \\"Blaze of Glory\\" boys are trapped in a hotel which is surrounded by the police. As the tense drama plays out, the boys (and the audience) hear radio reports of the situation.\\"Splendid's\\" is an intriguing drama: violent, and with elements of the ridiculous. The play deals with a number of themes: leadership, group dynamics, male homosexual desire, cross-dressing, the media portrayal of criminals, and the relationship between lawbreakers and law enforcers. Definitely a text worth reading; I'm glad it was rescued and revived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overview of historical positions; weak pneumatology","review":"Grenz helped me tremendously by tracking the history of several theological positions such as trinitarian doctrine, atonement, etc. Given Grenz's education, the trek through history should come as no surprise, and a few of the ideas of his mentor, Wolfhart Pannenberg, leaked fittingly into the work. Grenz was devout in relating every aspect of his theology to the concept of community. Unfortunately, his presentation of the Holy Spirit was a bit impersonal (love bond between the Father and Son). This book is certainly worthwhile for seminary students or laypeople wanting to delve into systematic theology. The book serves as a great beginning to further study or a sufficient summary of popular theological positions in the past and present. However, if you are a teacher, please do not follow in the footsteps of my professor by giving a test with 50 True/False questions over the entire book (859 pages)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst CDs I own","review":"I've never seen this show staged, and I've never read the script, but the movie it's based upon, ALL ABOUT EVE, is one of my all-time favorite movies. I notice that most of the other reviewers have given this CD five stars, but it looks as if a lot of those stars go to the script and to the acting, not to the music.I had great hopes for this CD, but I have been severely disappointed. The fault lies mostly with composer Charles Strouse: not a single song, not even with some of Hollywood's most memorable lines for inspiration (such as \\"Fasten Your Seat Belts\\" or the title number), rises to the level of the witty movie dialogue. (The title number starts out with promise, but doesn't reach a satisfying climax.) Also contributing to my disappointment is Strouse's entrenchment of the score in the 1970's idiom, which today makes the show sound hopelessly dated. Not even the acting talents of Lauren Bacall and Len Cariou can mask the failure of these tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Show. Actually rare soundtrack","review":"I don't know how Amazon does it, but I have looked for this soundrack for several years, and I've ordered two from Amazon.

No, it's not perfect, but it has so many successful and emotionally charged moments that it climbs on up there. Of course not to be missed is Bonnie Franklin singing the title number (I'd buy the recording for that alone), and Lauren Bacall's voice stakes out its own ground as unique and character-ful, especially once one accepts it on its own terms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not great quality... but at least we have it!!!","review":"Lauren Bacall! Len Cariou! Penny Fuller! Who could ask for anymore??!! This is a wonderful musical with an outstanding cast and amazing music and lyrics.

Jodie Foster was fantastic in it, best supporting actress worthy in my opinion, but I thought Mark Harmon could have done better as Billy. Great soundtrack too. It really made me think about my past and how short life is. It went straight to video here ten years ago unfortunately and can only be rented, not bought. It's quite rare to see it in video stores. I think it's mainly Jodie Foster fans that have made the effort to find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgic drama","review":"I've always been a big fan of Jodie Foster. It is only now that I'm able to see most of her works before her \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" film and I must say that she is charming even in her early movie performances.Stealing Home is one of her movies where one gets to enjoy her child-like performance and fall in love with the nostalgic feel of the whole movie theme. After watching this movie, I started thinking about my childhood, teenage and post-university life and start to wonder where could all the people who made my past very meaningful and interesting be now. It's not a tear-jerking movie but it makes you feel human. It creeps into your heart because you know you've been there before -- falling in love when you were young."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie to watch on the weekend","review":"I really enjoy this movie and like to watch it on the weekends when nothing else is planned. This is a movie that has great actors in it such as Jodie Foster, Mark Harmon, Jonathan Silvermann and others and the scenery of the New Jersey shoreline is absolutley beautiful. I enjoy the way the movie unfolds itself, it dosen't rush things, but takes its time as Harmon who is the main character does flashbacks to his teenage years and remembers his adolesence with the girls he loved. Silvermann is great portraying his teenage friend, and I really thought the scene where he finally gets his fantasy with the older woman is hilarious.I really like this movie and highly recommended it to all who enjoy a charming plot and good acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never forget who you are","review":"Mark Harmon plays a man who looses track of his purpose in life. He is forced to confont his mistakes when he is willed the ashes of his childhood babysitter who was also his first adult romatic experience. William McNamara prtrays the younger Mr. Harmon.This is one of my all time favorite movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep","review":"I don't know why, but this movie is one of my personal favorites. I saw it way back in 1988 when it came out and liked it enough to buy the video. I did not find the film sappy at all. (Fair to say, I expected to before seeing it).This movie could easily be classified as a \\"chick flick\\" so to speak, but that's not really a fair label. Yes, it was profoundly deep and emotional, but it certainly didn't leave me feeling emasculated. There's quite a bit of comedy as well as drama throughout. Definitely worth a rent.Warning: Baseball is referenced heavily in this film, but it's more of a vehicle for the story than the story itself. Males need not cringe at the word \\"relationships\\", but that's about where this movie stays centered."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Hell with Roger Ebert.......... this film rules!","review":"I was right. I knew I was right. Stealing Home is a wonderful film. I am a big fan of Roger Eberts, I read his reviews all the time and when he ground this fine film under his heal, I thought perhaps I was wrong, but I'm not.

It has a bittersweet charm that brings me back to the summers of my youth spent at the beach... of young love... and a time of self exploration and discovery.

One week, both shows reviewed this film. Gene and Roger gave it two thumbs down - WAY down - but Rex Reed and Bill Harris liked it! Now, I had to see the flick for myself to see which pair was right!As it turned out, S&E were. The film was, and is, a flaky, sappy, screwy, half-baked, muddled MESS. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is for the bits of wild unintentional humor, and for the excellent performances of Harmon (in a thankless role), Foster (simply luminous) and McLaughlin (best actor in the film)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Overlooked Classic","review":"It seems that many reviews before me have all presented sentiments similar to my own about this movie.

How many other movies on Amazon have an *average* rating of 5 stars?Buy it, watch it, love it. The soundtrack is also wonderful. It calms me and makes it seem like there are no worries in the world..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reflection","review":"The first time I watched this movie was in the early 90s and I was deeply touched. Enoughed that I realized after watching it recently that inadvertently a year ago I wrote a short story using the basic plot. I purchased the DVD after a long-time friend committed suicide and I was searching for answers regarding her death. I didn't get them, but the movie offered some comfort and made me continue to respect the beauty of life.

After a few minutes, I realized the poor design of the bubble machine.PROS:- Popular Dora and Boots characters- Kids love bubbles- Fairly inexpensiveCONS:- Works for only a few minutes at a timeA few minutes in, it stopped blowing bubbles. The problem I found is that the bubble reservoir is too deep for the bubble wand (Boots' tail) to reach all the way down. After a few minutes of bubbles, you have to top off the reservoir. A waste of bubbles and time. After a few repetitions, my child got bored, as did I. We have tried to use it a couple of more times since, to try and get some use out of it but it was the same story each time. It also happens to be very loud. It is in the dumpster now.

Hopefully, the website will be updated to reflect this information. I know it's important to me, and with so many things coming out in multiple editions at once, I think it needs to be stated clearly.

A series of misunderstandings leads him to think that three of his employees are really trying to kill him. When he tries to use this to his advantage, they turn the tables on him and threaten to expose him for the sexist, egotisitical, lying, hypocritical bigot that he really is. He gets all tied up (literally) while trying to prove them wrong and the race is on: Can he cover his tracks while they turn the workplace into an ideal working atmosphere much to their boss's disgust? This movie is Dolly Parton's first movie and you will recognize her voice as she sings the title song. She holds her own in the laugh department.

While I realize there are many styles for playing, I think this is a really good way to get started. The lessons are presented in both standard notation and tablature, and they graduate in complexity as you get farther along.My only complaint is that this doesn't come with a CD. But this is a slam more towards myself than towards the author. I am ashamed to say that, with the exception of a few songs, I am woefully unfamiliar with most of these beloved folk and bluegrass standards; and the majority of my learning procedure in the past has been by ear. But I am looking at this as a challenge and a way to exercise my ability to read and play along with sheet music. Still, hearing the actual song would help me play more fluid-ish. A check of the copyright page tells me that it first went to press in the late 70s, so CDs were far into the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for all levels","review":"This book has a lot of classic bluegrass songs and breaks them down from simple to more complicated.

It may be a fine companion book for intermediate to advanced players for learning fiddle tunes and picking standards. Its introduction to chords starts with the advanced bluegrass chop chords. Even as a life long guitar player I found these chords are extremely difficult. They should start with 2-3 finger open position chords. This book is an example of how not to teach beginning mando. It would be like a math book that spends one page on addition and subtraction, the next page on multiplication and division and then goes straight to algebra and calculus.

In her adventure she meets various other spys, who either try to kill her or try to help her. The best part for me, is watching the original versus the TV version. Whoopi cusses like a \\"truck driver\\" in the original and while on TV they change her words and take away most of the \\"offensive\\" language. BUT that is the part I like - Whoopi is so real and down to earth, you can't help but love her and therefore this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHOOPI AS ONLY WHOOPI CAN DO!","review":"This movie has an all around appeal.

One of the funniest scenes is when he tells his father that he doesn't want to practice martial arts anymore, that he hates fighting. He doesn't lose any of his speed or his ability. Akane loses patience with him a couple of times like when he or she didn't even want to touch his boxers, when he didn't want to go out as a boy to go shopping or when he or she wanted to sleep with Akane because she was scared.

Throughout the whole thing, Jennifer is shown as a highly mysterious character, and I was so hoping for some kind of big reveal, a supernatural twist, whatever, about her, and none came. There was no big climax, just a steady slope all the way through. I can say that the characterization was very good, placing small details that made you love the characters. But the details were taken too far sometimes, making for some dull reading. Once you finish, you leave the book wondering what the point of it was, only to find that there really wasn't one.Rating: 1.5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jennifer and Elizabeth","review":"This story was about Elizabeth, the new girl that just moved in town.

What saves this film from the dregs of cheesy horror films are two things: a couple excellent death scenes (two words: the fan), and good actors. If you're a fan of Jennifer Rubin or the incomparable Dean Cameron, you'll be pleased to see these two get a large share of the airtime.

He nails his character as a whiney, lovesick cowboy. The real treat in watching the picture is getting to see a very young Marylin Monroe doing splendidly as she emerges as a very fine dramatic actress. Time has shown how really great she was at her craft. There never has been nor never will be anything like her--mountains of imitators, some spending millions to advance their own careers have not come close. Some of her talent was natural and some of it learned by \\"the Method.\\" Her timing is exquisite. The movie is a great record of a period marked by method acting and it displays examples of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun movie","review":"I can understand where some people would find Beau distasteful, annoying, and corny, but I thought he was very funny and earnest; just adorable. So innocent! He did need a major lesson in courtesy, but that was all part of his character, who had come fresh off a ranch without having seen 'the world' before.Marilyn was very different in this movie; pale and fatigued, scowling, latched onto that uneducated, whining accent, but still beautiful. I had to get used to it, but I was impressed.Actaully, I never watched the beginning; put off by the whole cowboy thing, I forwarded to where Marilyn would come in.After all, I only wanted to watch it because of her.From there, it was a fun movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen.","review":"I like movies, I like Marilyn movies. I must say though, Bus Stop has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen!I consider it to be probably as bad as Disney's 'Gnomemobile' from the 70's or an episode of Barney the purple dinosaur. Yes, I really think this movie is that bad.There are no likeable characters in the whole movie, Marilyn sounds like a complete idiot. Don Murray's character has to be the most disgusting, unbearable character ever. More disagreeable than Jar Jar Binks.When I watched Mission Impossible 2, I felt like I was mugged of my time and money, but the movie was beautiful in its own right. Bus Stop has no redeeming qualities at all. It's poorly acted, poorly shot, poorly edited and atrociously written.This one goes on the bottom of my pile of cruddy movies, right next to Videodrome."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point of this movie?","review":"I have to agree with \\"Keialove\\". I can't figure out why everybody loves this thing. It's based on a play by William Inge, but in my opinion it never should have made it to the stage, much less screen. The story is about a woman (MM) who resists the advances of an obnoxious cowboy played by Don Murray, but in the end she realizes that she really loves him. Yeah, sure. She's so lonely, she'll go off with anybody. It's boring and overrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mine's a return!","review":"Marilyn Monroe and Don Murray star in this charming 1950's romantic comedy.

A time or two, such as in How to Marry a Millionaire, Marilyn seemed to strike gold with her penchant for humor, but those moments are rare, and you won't find them in this film.Cherie spends the entire movie fretting over her lot in life with a high-pitched whine, and her cowboy lover hollars and brawls until you want to knock them both over the head.The supporting cast isn't too exciting either, and costume design is stingy. Marilyn goes back and forth between a fishnet horror and a leather skirt throughout the entire movie.The only parts of the movie I really enjoyed were the rodeo footage and the scene where Beau finally gets the tar beat out of him by a fellow traveler."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wretched adaptation of a great play","review":"Yes Monroe gives one of her greatest performances (the other being in THE MISFITS). However, after directing two different productions of the William Inge's excellent character driven play of the same title, I must say that I cannot objectively judge this wretched adaptation.Gone is all of Inge's carefull character sketches and complex study of human nature. BUS STOP as a story has never been solely star vehicle. Cherie is but a small part of an ensemble cast. Gone in this film version is Dr. Lyman and his resurrection in the hands of the neophyte Elma. Gone too is the sexual dynamics of bus driver Carl and the lonely Grace. The setting change from Kansas to Idaho loses so much of the midwestern heart that drives Inge's central narrative.Again, the film is worth watching for Monroe's fine star making performance, but if anyone has read, scene or produced the heart-breakingly beautiful original play, the movie adaptation just doesn't add up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film, but there's a lot of picture missing","review":"Anamorphic format sounds good. \\"1,85\\" does not. This was a Centfox movie and it was made in CinemaScope, which means at least 2,35 to 1, possible even 2,55 to 1, if it was a magnetic stereo release.I would love to buy the film on DVD, but not with the sides chopped off.

She did quote a job here, and of course, no-one seemed to take notice. You can't help being annoied by Don Murray's character... This movie has also some hilarious scenes, like all the scenes with the great Eileen Heckart(sadly, recently left this world).

The case studies are often presented in a mocking tone instead of offering compassion. While that approach might work for dealing with some symptoms of depression, it will not work to solve the real problem. The book is advertised as offering God's grace for women dealing with depression, but most of the book is void of any spiritual reference.

There were very tedious attempts to describe the strategy of a game I'll never play and the end of the book seemed like the author was getting as tired as I was and just quit. The redeeming aspect of this book was that Brin made the matriarchal society very belevable. As a standard phylum male, I feel that I could have run amuck on that planet.

He seems to have totally forgotten how to tell a story. The book starts with about 250 pages of tedious character development. When we finally get to a plot, it rambles all over the place pointlessly. And it has absolutely the worst, lamest ending to any book of any sort I've ever read. I can't believe I read the whole wretched thing.Brin is trying to explore how a society of clones would really function. That sociological exploration is actually quite well done, even if it is done over and over and over and over. And over. And then, just in case we missed the point, he ends the book with a patronizing afterword telling us what we should have understood from the book. In summary: a strong candidate for worst major science fiction novel of the 1990s. Yecch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The End does not justify the Means.","review":"This is a book that I adored until the final let's call it 20 pages or so. The culture of this matriarchal world was painted in an intelligent way without resorting to some form of amazonian fantasy, with checks and balances in their system. The characters were engaging and the over-reaching plot was fascinating... and then the ending comes. What impact would the ending of a Sherlock Holmes mystery have if Moriarity fiendishly clever were to blurt out the details of his plan ala a James Bond villain? What impact the ending of the initial Star Wars trilogy if the Emperor had tripped and fallen down that shaft?The journey of these characters, and what you learn about them, leads towards one resolution, and the ending comes not so much as a 'surprise' as an incredible let-down..... I was heartily disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"was there an ending to this book?","review":"I enjoyed most of this book, including speculating about how Brin was going to end it. I was wrong, not because he surprised me with some twist, but because he simply failed to follow through with any kind of satisfying ending. No closure with other characters, no completed accomplishment for the protagonist. Some stuff happened....this is not an ending. It felt more like he didn't know what to do next so he just stopped.That said, I repeat, I enjoyed most of the book. Interesting speculations about social and economic ramifications of the reproductive engineering Brin posits. Engaging society and characters. I just felt let down when the book merely petered out."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting premise turns into a tedious plot","review":"While I am a fan of Brin's other books (particularly the Startide Rising series) this book just seems an unending series of adventures without a rousing conclusion. Whoever did the editing for this book should take a hard look at it again. It's about 250-300 pages too long. Having said that, leave it to Brin to create yet another fascinating world and characters. I was especially intrigued by the mysterious history of Stratos and the way it slowly emerged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent development of a future society with a weak ending","review":"Brilliant development of a matriarchal society and some lovely reflection (as is normal in Brin) on the nature of life, society, and intelligence. Contrary to some of the other reviewers, it's not a feminist 'utopia' - there are distinctly unlikeable aspects to the society, even for the most hardcore of feminists - it's different, not better. Some of Maia's emotional development is a little forced, and the ending is weak, but otherwise the book is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"contrived fluff","review":"This book was a random pick, and I'm glad I only borrowed it from the library. Brin's Stratos is a thought-provoking extrapolation of radical feminism in all its twisted glory, but the novel's merits end there. All of the plot's credibility falls away when Maia falls so easily for Renna. Remember that this girl has been raised in a culture where men are regarded as little more than breeders, barely human if at all. But a man from another planet comes along and BAM! she's in love? Right. The book also dragged on for far too long, further diluting an already weak plot. What's more, Brin has an excreable writing style, he leaves lots of loose ends, and his editors let a lot of typos slip by. An excrutiating read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glory Season -- more like glory *months*","review":"The first 2/3rds of this novel are as good as any current sf out there -- definitely up to Brin's standard, and full of wonderful universe building. But the last third is more than a disappointment, it's a cheat. When a novel is written like a mystery (a socialogical one in this case, not a murder <g>), and then at the end, nothing what-so-effing-ever is done with all of the many hints and plot threads of the rest of the book -- it's worse than being left hanging; it makes one regret all of the collaboration one does as part of the reading process.Highly unrecommended unless you like to read unfinished work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great adventure book","review":"This is really more of an adventure book in a Sci-Fi setting. Lots of action, some parts dragged a little bit, but overall it's an enjoyable read. The ending is a little weak and inconclusive. The author seems to be saying that even after all that Maia, the main character, went through, it wasn't going to change the world of Stratos much in the short term. That's fine, but I still would have liked to read a little more about what happened to Maia herself. Three pages before the end of the book, she is in mortal danger, then at the end she is ok...sort of...but it left me feeling kind of empty. A good book if you can deal with the somewhat vague ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction to Gibbon","review":"This is an excellent abridged edition of Edward Gibbon's classic \\"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\\" and it makes both a perfect introduction for those just getting into Gibbon and a useful portable copy for people who have the entire set. This abridgement includes much of Gibbon's coverage of the decline and fall of the western empire and some interesting chapters and excerpts from the remainder of the work, ideal for the general reader. Most of Gibbon's history still stands up after 200 years (and footnotes point out where it doesn't), and it is written in an absolutely gorgeous English style. Anyone interested in Rome owes it to themselves to read Gibbon, and this is a good place to get your feet wet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take Note","review":"THIS VOLUME IS ABRIDGED.

Also look out for Jack Nicholson in an early role as the youthful hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cinematic fun...","review":"The combination of the actors and directors in this film is classic; Price, Karloff and Lorre are a lot of fun to watch and feed off each other.

I received a message that I should have looked closer at my purchase. I guess they are right. This is the only time I overlooked this. Of course, the purchaser (me) is not happy. It is unfortunate that manufacturers have all of these regions and the dvds are not adapted to this. It is hard to find and all region dvds or especially blu-rays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close, but not quite","review":"This is somewhat of a hard film to measure because it is not bad, but it is not what it could have been. Vincent Price plays a wishy-washy wizard who is mourning the loss of his wife Lenore when he runs into Peter Lorre who plays a drunken wizard who has been turned into a raven. Lorre informs Price that he has seen his wife at the castle of Dr.Scaribus (Boris Karlof). Price and Lorre, along with a young Jack Nicholson, set off to confront Karlof. This film tries hard to be a comedy with the trappings of a horror film. This film has a great cast of horror veterens that is wasted in a cornball comedy, but this cast also keeps this film from being a total waste and they do make this film watchable. Karlof and Hazel Court are ecspecially good in their roles as the heavies. This is probably the weakest of Roger Corman's Poe films even though it boasts the best cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quote the watcher-Evermore","review":"This flick is hilarious. Price and Lorre are comic geniuses and it's a shame they didn't make more. Karloff seems to be having as much fun as the others.The story has nothing to do with Poe's poem. Price and Lorre are socerors, as is Karloff. The three are engaged in magical war while Lorre's son, Jack Nicholson, falls for Price's daughter, adding the romantic interest.The laughs come fast and furious, ranging from slapstick to pithy sayings. It's about as far from horror as one can get.It also shows that the horror genre was declining, awaiting Hammer's revival of the classic horror characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the mark","review":"A raven appears at the home of magician Erasmus Craven (Vincent Price) claiming to be a man transformed by the evil Dr. Scarabus (Boris Karloff). Craven turns him back into human form and is then told that his late wife is alive and well and living at Scarabus castle.This movie is supposed to be campy-funny, but I found it dated and dull. The costumes are out of King Arthur while the dialogue is modern; the plot made no sense and wasn't even remotely funny. It was set, apparently, in the middle ages, yet Price recites the 19th century poem, \\"The Raven.\\" Price played it straight while Karloff was obviously kidding. The whole first hour was a set-up for the \\"magical duel\\" between Price and Karloff which turned out to be just lame effects and sleepwalking actors. The only thing that kept me watching was a very young Jack Nicholson as Bedlo's callow son. I'm sure the actors thought they were making a tongue-in-cheek spoof, but it's a boring, pointless waste of talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting and Emotional","review":"From the first bass notes this CD takes you on a journey and moves you in ways only the greats like Genesis and Yes could. Of note is the outstanding creative vocals of Nichols that really stick with you long after you listen. Also, Mike Holmes really does some of his best guitar work of his long stellar career. And ofcourse I must mention the maestro Orford-absolute brilliance. Even staunch Pebozo who seems to think only bands in the 70s can make sincere progressive music likes this band. These guys are awesome.

The vocal is better and the band begin to show that they can create some good music, but their is just two tracks that caught my attention. The first one it \\"The Wake\\" and the second is \\"The Magic Roundabout\\". The rest of the cd is weaker and has the same problem that their debut album, the band is still looking for a musical identity and his own sound. The best was yet to come....Some tracks aren't bad, in fact, the live version of many of them on \\"Forever Live\\" are far better in their live versions than their studio counterparts. This demonstrate that a bad production can sometimes ruins a good song."},{"rating":"1","title":"A New Wave prog recording","review":"After reading such great reviews about this recording, I was shocked when actually listened to it.It is basically an 80's new wave recording with experimentation and changing of tempos.Much better than Nomozo (excuse the spelling) and Are you Sitting Comfortably, which were bland radio airplay sellouts.It is like other prog acts of that era like Asia, Kansas, Yes that were forced to become radio friendly, or lose the recording contract.Thank goodness recording technology improved to make quality recordings and much less $$$$$, so bands could put out the music they wanted to like IQ brillant Ever cd"},{"rating":"1","title":"Starting to find their stride","review":"This album is a vast improvement over \\"Tales from the Lush Attic,\\" which I found absolutely unlistenable. Some would dismiss \\"Corners\\" as pop, but it's a catchy tune -- one I could imagine Peter Gabriel doing -- and if that makes it pop, so be it. \\"Thousand Days\\" lays down a groove reminiscent of classic U2. Peter Nichols' voice is improved on this record. The guitarist takes a few Steve Hackett turns and the fretless bass adds a nice touch to several songs. The instrumentalists and writers seemed to have gained more confidence on this album. This album might have sustained me through the prog-drought of the 1980s, but when compared to later IQ offerings and those from other prog bands, it's not that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, good price, useless item","review":"It would be great if this splitter cable really let you input to two monitors at the same time - but it doesn't.

The DVD is terrific; it has a lot of extra features that true fans of the movie will really enjoy, but couldn't it have been remastered a bit better? I understand that it was released in 1979, but the picture quality on my copy of The Stepford Wives (1975) is better. The sound quality is also very poor...I had to turn it up very loud to understand what the actors were saying. However, true fans of the film will buy the DVD whether it's good or bad.

You have wait 24 hours before you finally see the alien. I loved alien vs predator, and the aliens are my favorite. So I wanted to see the first alien movie. I stared watching it, and the letters going up on the screen kinda freaked me out. Then 15 minutes later i fell asleep. The movie would have been better if it was taken place in present time, not 500 years from now. All the high-tech stuff made it even more boring.

I keep on asking this question when I watched this film: \\"If nobody came to this alien planet, how can the Aliens survive in the first place?\\"(This aliens are not intelligence enough to make any spaceship)If you looked for a film in similar genre I highly recommand you watch \\"The thing\\" instead.

I am not one for horror films, though I do like this alien stuff. Nothing happens in the film. Nothing. We spent most of the time waiting and waiting for something to happen. This movie could have been cut to half an hour, easy. There is a saying that says that fear is being scared of the unknown, something that the X-Files has done really well.Unfortunately, this film has tried to do this too and has gone too far. Rather than waiting for something to happen, while on the edge of our seats, we wait and wait and wait and wait. We barely get to see the alien and the special effects are pretty poor. Sure it was a long time ago, so we can't expect too much, but look at Star Wars, which came out around the same time. They were much better than Alien, and Lucas had half the money.Alien is simply a boring film that deserves no credit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrifying alien horror flick","review":"Lock your doors, bolt your windows, turn off the lights, and snuggle under your favorite blankie. This is one of the ultimate horror flicks. A derelict spaceship sends out a misunderstood message, but the warning is found out too late. The crew of the Nostromo bring back to their ship an infected crewmate with an previously unknown life form attached to his face. Within hours of his return, an alien being springs out of his chest, an alien whom they soon find is elusive and deadly. Ripley is the only one who survives, and oddly enough also a cat, but her survival keeps you guessing until the last moments. It is a great horror film that will keep you looking in the dark corners of the room wondering if you saw something move there.

I personally don't, but some might. anyway, overall it's one of the best SciFi movies in existance. so, if you don't have it, I reccomend you at least rent it. it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Scary Movie, and NOT Overrated","review":"To call this movie overrated, as the editorial staff at Amazon has done, is to ignore, or simply miss a quite revolutionary element in this scary monster/haunted house genre tale: The introduction of a female last-one-standing hero. As my literary professor pointed out some 15 years ago, Alien is the first known instance in Western culture -- in stories, tales, song,etc -- wherein a female is the surviving hero. Not to say this fact in itself is enough to recommend the movie. But it is an interesting, revolutionary step, and one that helps in the argument that Ridley Scott is a 'feminist' movie director, as evidenced in Thelma and Louise and GI Jane. The instance of a female surviving hero is now a common element in literature and film, but at the time of it's release in the late 70s, one would have to turn to cartoonish Wonderwoman and Sheena to find a relative comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grrreat movie + Grrreat DVD","review":"Sharp picture quality throughout. Great commentary by Ridley Scott! He explains some of his influences in making the movie and some of the tricks they used for special effects. Did you know they used oysters for the under-belly of the face-hugger? How about cow stomachs for the insides of the alien's eggs? The DVD includes deleted scenes, but you have to play them within a menu separate from the film. I like the deleted scene of the little catfight between Ripley and Lambert. The booklet inside has mini-bios on the cast.

But I'm forgetting to mention that this was long before Beta, VHS, DVD or multi-cinema-plexes. When you actually sat in an enormous and very dark room and saw the movies on a BIG SCREEN. As I've said many times before: Big screen = big scream. And the very best of the \\"Alien\\" franchise is a screamer that SHOULD be seen on a big screen. Sigourney Weaver's star turn as Ellen Ripley created a never-dying icon. Though extended through three sequels, \\"Alien\\" has been, is and shall always be the best of them all. Ridley Scott's direction is almost perfect and the ensemble performance brilliant. Sets, mood, designs, editing, Giger, music (one of Gerry Goldsmith's best scores) and acting make this a classic screamer that doesn't date. Way to go, you alien thing, you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alien- Amazing Female Lead in SciFi/Horror Classic","review":"When I first saw this in the theatrical release, I was stunned: an amazing female lead (Weaver) and a mind-bending, artistic look.

I'm sure Sigourney Weaver was equally impressed with his plethora of feline talents.Who can forget Jones leading Harry Dean Stanton to his death and then looking expressionless into the camera as we hear Stanton screaming in mortal pain! Sly, lil devil that Jonesy is! Or how about that fabulous scene where we see Jones emote great fear as the Alien stares at him in his futuristic cat carrier!I'm no one to fantasize too much, but I like to believe Jones tipped off the Alien as to the location of Yaphet Kotto and Veronica Cartwright, thus sparing his own life in return.In Aliens we saw the return of Jones, only this time with a different cat...and we could tell! This faux-Jones let loose with a half-hearted hiss, but the fans knew he was nothing but a cheap knock-off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"here jonesy...(meow)!","review":"As we all know, Alien is an excellent film and probably about the best cast i have ever seen, but to me, Harry Dean Stanton stole the show as the befuddled and uncomprehending Brett. I just really love his character because he portrays just a normal guy trying to earn some bread. the chemistry between him and Yaphet Kotto is amusing at times but always sincere. blue collar buddies. plus harry is from the midwest i sort of understood his character more, especially coming up with the cattle prod thing.and killed by looking for a cat! i like the recognition that slowly seeps into his visage as he holds the alien's shed skin in his hand.. he obviously was familiar with snakes. i guess i just think he is the kind of guy you could go into your small town local bar and see playing the jukebox or buyin ya a beer.sorry, Harry, but Sigourney and Veronica are sexier than you ahahaha"},{"rating":"2","title":"turning point in sci-fi horror","review":"Dispite the lacklust reviews, this film became a classic overnight and prove to be worthy of three more sequels. Still most momeriable is the shockingly realistic Space alien ripping from the chest of one of the crew and dripping acidic fluids from it jaw. People still talk about Alien today.Whether or not the formula derives from the classic 50's era, this movie reinvents the genre into a modern day classic with it's use of organic styled aliens and spaceship. As for the casting that speaks for itself. the other elements of the film all pull together for one fantastic ride of tension. I give this one four of five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't touch the egg............","review":"Seen this movie years back. Excellent plot, fx. and acting.

I purchased this item, because the description promised a 137 minute version was on the disc. When I loaded up the disc on my player, it is EXACTLY the same as disc 1 of the Quadrilogy pack. One cut is 1:55 and the other is 1:56, neither is 2:17 as promised. Some gimmick about \\"deleted scenes marker\\", whatever that is, is used. A mystery to me. I wonder if the blu-ray version actually has the extended cut on it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable SciFi Thriller","review":"This is a real classic and in my opinion perhaps the best in the series, although number two came close. The characters are very real and the cinematography is superb: the gloomy weather on the cold dark planet and the interior of the doomed ship that still emits warning signals, with the frozen corpse of one its pilots still in the control seat. There are also flashes of humour in the beginning, for example the conversation between a male and female marine of the security crew. The monster is something special in film history, especially its life cycle and the way it uses the host - truly horrifying and so well done that it becomes all too believable. Sigourney Weaver puts in a magnificent performance to make it a classic of the SciFi/Horror genre. No wonder it spawned so many sequels. But this first one is still the most memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Great!","review":"I decided to revisit this movie 32 yrs after my initial experience. After watching the abominable Prometheus I thought I 'd rewatch it see if my fond memories of Alien had been misplaced given I watched it in my teens. Wrong, this movie gripped me as intensely as it did 32 yrs ago. The environment and characters are entirely plausible, the script, dialog and pace are near flawless.The only inconsistent character behavior (Ash) is clearly explained later in the movie in a shocking twist. The suspense throughout the movie is superb and reaches a crescendo at virtually the last scene. The set design and effects may appear quaint initially but after you're sucked in you no longer notice it.This is one of the greatest movies of all time, not just in the sci-fi horror genre. If you haven't already seen it, listen carefully to the dialog as quite a few questions that may arise are answered. I'll now move on to Aliens which I never bothered to watch but will rectify that now."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALIEN","review":"Alien is first & best movie of the series. Once again we see LESS is MORE in this imaginative futuristic thriller, where one alien is as bad as a hundred while trapped on board the Nostromo a commerical towing vessel. The Alien seeks out the crew one by one to use their body as hosts for new aliens. Needless to say the Alien gets bigger and the crew gets smaller until all hell breaks loose. I gave this movie 4 stars because 5 is for something I haven't seen yet! I'll let you know...zombytoof"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Sci-Fi","review":"Star Wars made way for this movie, the special effects were not available untill then but now that it was they put out a great movie. The special effects are excellant but over all the movie is too dark mostly when the alien was shots were taken. This was the first Sci-Fi Horror movie ever created and still stands as one of the best the best of course being James Camerons Aliens. Makng a women the lead star in a horror was an excellant idea which spawned other movies to do the same. The director (i forget his name) used suspence as one of his key elements and used it well. A great movie but to dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gee, Jason White...","review":"Could it be that the reason ALIENS gets more attention than ALIEN is because ALIENS is WAY better? DUH!Oh, well. Both movies are very good in my eyes. Get this one on DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to start a series!","review":"When I first saw Alien, I didn't really understand it. Then I saw Aliens and decided to watch the first one again. I understood it better then. This movie stars Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, the sole survivor of the encounter with the Alien. When the crew of seven lands on a planet on their way home on the ship Nostromo, an alien gets aboard and kills every crew member one by one until eventually only Ripley is left. Alien and Aliens are my favorite in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even the director doesn't care for this cut","review":"The movie still still great, but don't buy the The Director's cut because you think it is better than the original version. There is a message from the director Ridley Scott where he states that his orignal version released in theaters decades ago is the \\"Alien\\" he wanted all of us to see. The Director's Cut is all about marketing. If you want to see some extra footage, buy this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the two 'Must Have' SF Movies of the 70's","review":"The so called expert reviewers have got this one wrong. Alien is a bare knuckle ride executed in a sort of Docu-style approach (similar to that touched on by Kubrik in 2001 but without the profound pretentions. The reviewers need to think back to the first time they saw this movie (because it is an all-time classic - they, like me, have probably seen it in excess of 5 times). It is intelligent and efficient - and while it executes the old cliched '10 little Indians scenario with panache - It is the backdrop and the subtle reflections on corporate and individual greed that still grab attention today. It's also noted for the quality of the sequels. The only other SF film that stands the test from the seventies is Silent Running - another superb example and possibly more worthy as it doesn't need the 'slash scenario' to draw it's conclusions."},{"rating":"2","title":".","review":"Arguably the best film in what has become the Aliens series. It isn't as dynamic or action-packed as Aliens, but that's kind of what I like about it. The film conducts itself quietly, patiently, with fairly minimal dialogue and a lot of emphasis on visual atmospherics. It allows itself to develop on its own terms, and it may bore some viewers because of this, but I commend it, myself. My only complaint is that, although there are some creepy moments, some of the suspense is cliched -- and suspense cliches really great on my nerves. Other than that this is a quality movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark T U.K The best sci-fi horror ever","review":"Having seen this version on laserdisc many months ago, I have to say that seeing it released on DVD will hopefully prove to anyone that a classic piece of cinema can be seen it all it\`s glory. The extra footage that was removed for this release is fantastic and anyone who avidly enjoys sci-fi/horror can appreciate the painstaking workmanship that went into making this picture. Also Jerry Goldsmith\`s score isolated is an added bonus, also the production paintings and design artwork are all worth anybody's money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Check Out The Origins of \\"Alien\\"","review":"If you can live without the gore and costly special effects, (and you can spare 69 minutes) you must check out \\"It! The Terror from Beyond Space.\\" From a historical point of view, you will be amazed how the maker's of Alien lifted the story right out of \\"It!\\" The pacing, the isolation of being on a ship where \\"noone can hear you scream,\\" the whole idea of the uninvited \\"guest,\\" are all contained in the original.

Alien may have a slower pace than the action packed Aliens, it had more tension and suspense which is more important in a horror movie. The suspense in Alien is more unnerving than the Alien it self. In Alien, the alien was invicible, no one could kill it. The aliens in Aliens were fairly easy to kill which made for stuning action sequences, but adversely made them less frightening.Don't get me wrong Aliens is a great Action Thriller movie and it is the perfect sequel to Alien, Aliens is an Action Thriller movie while Alien is a true horror movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie I've Ever Seen","review":"This Movie is truly magical. It sends you on an adventure through space and time and an alien who looks like a muppet. But take out the muppet part and you got the best darn movie america has ever seen in the five hundred years it has existed. It starts with sigourney weaver and her crew who land on a planet and then the egg opens and the spider comes out and empregnates one of the astronauts and then chaos, everyone dies except sigourney and her cat. Or did her cat die? I don't know. Watch alien to see if the cat ripley dies. It's especially sentimental if you've been abducted by an alien. HA! HA! HA! Now back to buisiness. This movie is rated R but it has mild violence next to all the other violent stuff that the movie industry has come out with. It's very exciting. I think I've watched every movie. Wait.

I was disappointed to find at the root menu that the soundtrack was, in fact, mono and the quality was somewhat murky. Also, the Spanish version would suddenly switch to English without notice and could not be rectified. The faulty sections could not be made to follow the selected soundtrack even by going back to the root menu. This product tries to include too many features--both the original and re-edited versions of the movie, plus other material on a second disk. That is probably why there was such poor quality control and the product is not as advertised. A single, high quality version of the movie would be preferable."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT STEEL CASE EDITION...JUST NEW COVER","review":"I can not believe FOX did ALL the advertizing on these new Steel Case Edition, with BEST possible picture and sound and then released an OLD version of the same movie on the same day, WITH, the same artwork on the cover.

Alien is, to me, dull, dark, shock-horror, trying to scare you with sudden noises and camera turns. I sat there waiting for something to happen for most of the film, mostly bored to tears. To me, the only purpose for Alien is as a set up for the far superior Aliens."},{"rating":"2","title":"In space no one can hear you scream!","review":"5 stars are not enough..absolutely the best alien/horror movie ever made..Sigourney Weaver was a perfect fit..Great story and horrifically believable.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prometheus","review":"The only reason I rented this movie is because of the 2012 Prometheus.

The book's not worth it.The plot is so thinly strung across the books' 350+ pages that you keep forgetting what it's about.There are so many characters introduced that have nothing to do with the plot that I had to keep reminding myself that the book was not supposed to be about tight bodies and the incredibly boring details of how a shopping mall is run.The formula: a collection of high school dating cliches, a look at mall life through the eyes of a security guard (the big news here is that they get sore feet) and a lecture about how union laborers are lazy and how security guards are smarter than \\"real\\" cops.Oops, I forgot to mention: someone wants to blow up the mall.

Not that I have anything against this sequel, but it should just not be compared to the masterpiece the 1'st movie was. Better actors in this one? Not a chanse, but they're ok. The movie is ok, and faithful to the book -but the problem is that the book is so pshycological -and hard to put to life on screen.

The set-up of this movie was creepy, and there was some definite potential. However, the parent characters in this film aren't nearly as engaging as Peck and Remick, and Billie Whitelaw's evil nanny was one of the key elements of the original that made it so scary. I think that the film was further hurt by how it first made the viewer sympathize with Damien, and then let him indulge himself in unnecessary dispatchment of random characters. I wanted to feel sorry for him and then he starts to like taking people out! What is the deal? And of course, no one can be convinced of his true identity until they see this wall, which gets tedious.

The movements are random, disjointed, with no apparent integration or theme. I quickly got bored. Note that these are the same POB dancers and company that I adore. However this choreography is wretched. Obviously I am unable to appreciate elements of beauty in such modern ballets.

Well, I never much cared for Robert Mitchum, who reminds me of a slimey lizard anyway, and the dialog is over-the-top silly. The plot is cookie cutter typical 50s western faire, only other movies in the genre are better done. Atrocious fake Indians that are an amalgamation of every stereotype you've ever seen in those old pictures so that you don't even know what tribe they actually represent, and an absence of passionate direction on Otto Preminger's part make this oldie a bonafide dud. On the bright side, Marilyn is breathtakingly beautiful despite the troubles surrounding the shoot, and the musical numbers she performs are indeed charming. They're the only reason to sit through this poorly conceived western.

It was easy to set up, easy to use. The software interface I like better than the TiVo. For example, my son has a 'thing' about the Civil War. All I have to do to find Civil War-related shows is hit \\"menu\\", \\"find shows,\\" type in \\"Civil War,\\" and hit enter. Whatever's on that week pops up, and all I have to do to record it is select it and hit enter again. End of story.I DO recommend that you get the largest-volume model you can afford; the Replay has greatly increased our appetite for things on tape.As a mom, the greatest reward is that my kids are no longer aware that broadcast TV EXISTS. They watch what I have taped, any time I say it's OK. We don't watch when and what CBS or Nickelodeon says we should, but what I say. It's the Mercedes of parental TV control.And I must confess it's handy to always have a Blues Clues or 2 on hand for emergency situations! ;-)Go on, you will love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Replay TV ...","review":"I bought this unit in mid-December.

I have a good friend whose children are being taken away from her, because she wouldn't follow him lock step. These people may as well be in Waco at a compound. The Bible is clear that the man of the house is to be the servant leader as Jesus was the ultimate example. Jesus didn't give marching orders or hand out commands, on the contrary, he implored us, to love our neighboor as ourself, to treat others with higher regard.No, Steve and Sandra say you have to obey your husbands no matter what.

(As a christian I place all my needs in GOD's hands but I also work for a living.} What Pastor Hopkins should be happy is that people are actually reading the bible, even if only to read the about the prayer of jabez, in a time when the bible is the last book people want to read. You should be encouraging folks to read more of the bible, Pastor Hopkins. And please read the prayer of jabez."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't get it","review":"Obviously, the Prayer of Jabez is not understood by people who agree with this book. The Prayer of Jabez does have you pray for blessing, but why do people always assume that this means money and things!!? A prayer for blessing may be peace in your life, a different outlook, an ability to help others, and to give a word of encouragement to those who need it. Those who haven't read and really grasped the Prayer of Jabez may want to give it a read with these things in mind. It is a mindset that there are always opportunities to minister to others if we are open to them and willing to let God work through us. That is the essential message of the Prayer of Jabez which this book denegrates so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Faulty Reading of \\"The Prayer of Jabez\\"","review":"This isn't the first time \\"The Prayer of Jabez\\" has been attacked. I did not read \\"The Prayer of Jabez\\" and then come away expecting to get rich or to have it easy as a Christian. In fact, I was challenged to simply be open for God to use me in whatever capacity He chooses, whether it be through wealth or through poverty, through health or sickness, through goodtimes or bad. \\"The Prayer of Jabez\\" challenged me to never be satisfied with where I am in Christ. It challenged me to always be ready to move out of my comfort zone and be ready for God to use me. Pastor Hopkins is reacting to some in the church who are mistaken in their understanding of Bruce Wilkinson's book. Perhaps Pastor Hopkins misunderstands Wilkinson's book himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel sorry for this man!","review":"I have been so blessed by the Prayer of Jabez. This book has reached out to even so many non-christians. It is a shame that this man who has written this new book calls himself a minister. He forgets for the greed of money that the prayer of Jabez was a prayer that God answered in the Bible. This man's teaching is heretic. All Christians beware. Please don't buy this book. He is out to make money. Let him come out to share with us all how much he is making with this book. He knows how this book has been so popular do he has written this to get cheap publicity so that his book will sell."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more books!","review":"I haven't read this book nor have I read the Prayer of Jabez book.

I read that selenium actually inhbits the growth of tumors, so I am upset for having followed Roizen's advice. Also, I learned that one can take up to 10 GRAMS of vitamin C per day with very beneficial results. This vitamin also helps prevent and fight cancer. Finally, Roizen completely omits any mention of the need for regular detoxification. He says it's okay to drink tap water! I have lost my respect for this author and am now selling his book.

However, the printing and binding of this edition is really horrible - cheap paper, small fond of printing, very bad binding. The ink of most of the pages is very light and fuzzy, and the words are just like photo copies from a very old photo copy machine. I bought one copy of \\"Monkey, A journey to the West, retold by David Kherdian, 208 pages\\" and ten copies of this book (Monkey, Folk Novel of China, translated by Arthur Waley, 306 pages), planning to pass to my friends' kids for gifts, the former (208-page one) has much better printing and binding and is good for gifts. But this book (the 306-page one) absolutely cannot be used as gifts since it looks way too cheap like those from one-dollar store, and printing/fond is absolutely not appropriate for young readers to protect their eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not van Gulik's China","review":"I only rate Monkey 1 star because I could not get into it.

But I could not put it down and finished the whole of it in two sittings! This book is as much of a page turner as any modern novel, using everything from cunning plot turns to end-of-chapter guises (\\"And if you don't know what became of them, you must listen to what is told in the next chapter.\\") to absolutely hilarious anecdotes. (I laughed aloud at the \\"Taoist Holy Water\\" episode!) An amazingly well-crafted novel with a very very fluid translation that makes it an absolute delight to read.

The Monkey is such a beloved trickster hero that everyone knows and adores in China and many countries of Asia. Highly recommend this book for your whole family!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is magic!","review":"What a wonderful translation of this classic text. Fans of Chineses mythology and the classic Japanese cult TV show will be enthralled by this text. The book appeals to all ages and mental capacities much like an episode of the Simpsons also does. There are many moral messages portrayed and lots of classically funny moments. Read with intense focus of the adventures of the holy fool Tripitaka, the over confident Monkey, the glutful Pigsy and the philosophical Sandy as they travel to India for the scriptures to save mankind. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chinese Equivalent of Grimm's Fairy Tales","review":"The original name of this story is Journey to the West. It is the Chinese equivalent of Grimm's Fairy Tales. Like Snow White or other beloved Western fairy tales, every Chinese child knows this epic story of the Monkey King and his companions' journey to the West to seek enlightenment. Along the way, these voyagers encounter demons, fairies and other fantastic characters.I had heard this story many times when I was little and I am still enchanted by the story now that I am a parent. I highly recommend this book for both parents and children. Each chapter is a complete story so it's a great bedtime read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book to learn about the impacts of El Nino!","review":"The author explains in very clear language the complicated El Nino phenomenon and its far-reaching ecological, social, economic and political impacts during the last few centuries. The book is an excellent example of how an interdisciplinary approach can shed light on a complex oceanic-meteorological event and its ramifications throughout the world and human history. The author weaves meteorology, oceanography, history, economics, ecology, and political and social sciences in to a rich account of the history of El Nino. The book is founded on thorough scientific research, yet completely comprehensible for a lay person like me. The clear style of writing kept my attention to the last page.

They were minor (\\"to rob oneself\\" instead of \\"to rub oneself\\") but I suspect there may be more.Second, there are discrepancies between the English section and the Turkish section. For example, I hear a Turkish word and look it up. It's not in the Turkish section, but I guess the meaning, look it up in English and it's there.Having said that, what I like about the dictionary is that it includes many forms of verbs (the passive, reflexive, causative, etc) which make my time in Turkish class a lot easier.A warning: Turkish changes quite a bit. With this dictionary (or any dictionary) one probably wouldn't be able to tell if a word is old or new, or which is more acceptable to use in speech.

These knives have serrated blades and are fine for cutting steak on a plate, and I don't think I would want steak knives to be any sharper than what these are, because if so, they would damage my dinner plates. You aren't supposed to wash them in the dishwasher, but I have several times now and they came through as good as new. The rose wood box is nothing special, but it's okay.

Every website that carries these describe this item as made in Germany, which, based on my own perception means a higher quality product. I feel cheated.

I can always hone a regular knife , but the profile of this blade is weird , and not a V shape , rather this shape : \\\\|if you want serrated knives THESE ARE NOT FOR YOU , if you want partially serrated knives with a flimsy blade that you won't be able to keep sharp , go right ahead and buy this set .if you want to own a knife that has only a 3rd of the blade that's usable , go ahead and buy it ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap box from China.

In other words, this filter is the the last connection to my travel trailer. I find it upsetting that it doesn't filter out all the negative tastes from the water. I'm not sure why, but I've gotten a 'rubber hose' taste in my water. Yes, I am using hosing marked for drinking water. I'm not sure if this filter is supposed to take care of that type of taste, but it doesn't.

Installing this filter between the hose and my RV eliminated that taste. It also filters out odd odors and tastes that I encounter with some campground water. When there are high chlorine levels in the water, this filter won't get rid of all of it but it does knock it down. Be sure to rinse the filter for about one minute before connecting it to your RV for the first time or you'll get black carbon powder in your water.

Not that RVers don't experience significant water pressure reduction with the more expensive #10s. These external filters can get expensive if using on a regular basis and especially if in an area with heavy or bad tasting water. Last filter lasted about a month using on a city water source.

Photos on computer screens are beautiful. I read reviews of this camera before buying a used one at Adorama via Amazon, and the most common defect was a blank starting photo.

I have the maxxum 7 film camera that the 7d is based on so the transition was very easy. I like the controls being out in the open instead of settings being buried in menus. It may look like you have to have an engineering degree when you count the buttons and dials (around 25, depending on what you include), but the controls are easy to learn as everything is clearly and logically marked. The anti-shake has been impressive. I have gotten acceptable sharpness from shots taken with a 300mm f4 wide open at 1/30th. Any panning or dragging the shutter seems to have better results with the AS turned off. With a fast memory card (sandisk extreme III) I get around 20 shots continuous before the camera slows to write to the card with a full buffer.

This can make things like making patterns and sorting more difficult, and makes it hard to use certain color combinations to represent different things.In all, though, they were a good price and they work for the things I bought them for.

The film created the now iconic scene of Marilyn's dress being blown up by the wind from the subway below and she says with relish: \\"Isn't is delicious?\\" George Axelrod provides the witty and - for the time it was originally released - risqué script and Billy Wilder directs with his usual flair.

This is one of her funniest movies (along with Some Like It Hot). Marilyn's innocense plays off her sexuallity very well. This comedy is upbeat, and though set in the fifties, it hasn't been affected by age at all. The theme itself is thousands of years old, (when the cat's away, the mice will play). My favorite scene is not the skirt blower however. It's right at the end when Marilyn is waving good-bye to Tom Ewell from the window. For a second you see why millions have fallen in love with her.

Stove's formal version of this claim says that no matter how many objects we observe, we cannot conclude anything - period. Of course this straw man version is wrong, since we can certainly conclude something about the things we have already seen.

Certainly the book looks like it was written by someone who didn't really think he needed an argument; it contains plenty of polemic against anyone who might have worried about induction, but such arguments as Stove gives are absurdly poor. His appeal to probability theory is only successful because he makes things much too easy for himself; what he proves is much too weak to establish the rationality of induction. However, since he buries the argument in unnecessary mathematical symbols, its weaknesses may easily evade a reader prone to be intimidated by mathematics. Stove would have been much better served to simply stick to the obviousness line, and not get involved with the philosophical arguments for which he clearly has no talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, very bad.","review":"This book, while an utter failure as a novel about reincarnation does unintentionally succeed as a study of what religion can do to the human mind. Guilt, especially religious guilt of a sexual nature, rather than reincarnation is the true theme of this book. Not surprisingly, the protagonist's latest incarnation is as a priest--and his religious paranoia has caused him not only to self-mutilate by hacking off the offending organ, but also to kill the object of his lust--who, naturally, he's come to see as an evil temptress bent only on destroying him repeatedly throughout the centuries. This study in religious hysteria and the wages of \\"original sin\\" is either laughable or extremely annoying. I found it to be the latter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pseudo 60s fun","review":"Bought the DVD after remembering the photo of a space-suited Angela Lindvall in a magazine the year the movie was released.

After watching CQ I found out it couldn't have been farther from the truth. The movie within the movie was interesting and would have made the movie more enjoyable if it was done better. The \\"Secret Agent\\" part of the movie would have made a great \\"B\\" movie if it was more than just a short portion of the film. However the \\"real\\" part of the movie left a lot to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I thought CQ a great film, and I'm writing this because I'm annoyed how much attention Sofia Coppola's new film LOST IN TRANSLATION is getting. That is a terribly underwritten film, and Roman has ten times the talent of his kid sister, but CQ got 1/10 the attention. I thought CQ was one of the best film directorial debuts I've ever seen.

Jack ends up in Los Angeles where he becomes the projectionist for the Japanese-run movie theater, The Paradise. Jack meets Lily (Tamlyn Tomita), daughter of his boss, and the two run away to Seattle to marry since interracial marriage is illegal in California. When WWII comes, Lily, her and Jack's daughter Mini, and the rest of Lily's family are rounded up and sent to an internment camp. The movie's sets and costumes are steeped in a 1930s/40s aura and the movie brings home the impact the injustice of the Japanese American internment has on one family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caught between two sides in a conflict","review":"This is an excellent movie about ordinary people who are caught between cultures in a time of war.

That movie was the Blue Iguana, a movie where the women are as dangerous as they are delectable, the stone-faced hombres will kill you for your shoes, the fuzz are as obsessive as they are incompetent and life is cheaper than drugstore chocolate. Movies like the Blue Iguana are really Film Noir but set in sun-scorched (in this case tropical) frontier towns. They are loaded with gangster/cowboy kitsch in front of a filigree of Flamenco.

There is a significant amount of preparation for almost all of them, and I can't seem to find any benefit to using the crock pot rather than a regular oven, which sort of defeats the point.

Compare that to Illustrator, where transparency can be applied to anything, from text to paths to pixel images. And Gradients, and mesh. And just the stroke or the fill (and to mulitple strokes and fills on the same object). Or to groups or layers.

I would have thought Damien would have ascended to a higher station in the world (e.g., President, leader of the UN) in the 'final conflict' between the forces of good and evil. The absence of an Armageddon type of scenario also took away from the magnitude this movie could have possessed. I wonder if a limited budget affected how the sreen play was developed? The sex scene was unnecessary although it appeared that Damien's relationship with the woman was part of his undoing. If one is interested in seeing an Armageddon version of Omen III go and rent Omega Code II - Meggido. David York plays a reasonable anti-Christ role and the special effects are somewhat more modern."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neill can be forgiven for this one and \\"Jurassic Park III\\"!","review":"Neill was just getting his feet wet in America when he signed on for this, the third installment in the lucrative horror saga, so he can be allowed a lousy film or two.And this one is filled with \\"lice\\": underdeveloped characters, weird cinematography, blasphemously bad writing, and a poor score from music master Jerry Goldsmith after his two stunning ones for parts I and II.This is only for those of us that want to complete the set."},{"rating":"1","title":"666... hmmm","review":"How 'bout 911 on my forehead?

And all because they are SUPPOSEDLY the second coming of Christ. Let me ask you this: if you were Christ and you wanted to come back because Damien was the anti-you, would you come back as a creature that was too weak to fend for itself? Of course not!!! You would come back as an adult so you could have at least a 50-50 chance of winning! In other words, the filmmakers made a conscious choice to have babies as the main victims in this movie.

Although many saw it as a good completion to the trilogy (which wasn't the case with Omen 4) I grew tired of it. This film relied more on religion than horror. Sam Neill is well cast as Damien as battle of heaven of hell clash but I found it tedious, I couldn't understand the boring storyline of Judgement Day and Christ and the Devil.

Once in 1981 and a few times on video and dvd after that.At the time it came out there were lots of disappointed fans who felt that the film had taken a very obvious turn towards a lighter and more restrained direction in horror. Strangely, few people seem to remember some of the controversy surrounding this series and how several Christian groups protested the making of sequals.The film itself is hardly scary and all the elements of psychological horror are gone. Sam Neil is not bad as Damien...but scary? Hardly.I just find it odd that there are a ton of reviews about this movie giving it high ratings yet consisting of only a few lines.\\"your favorite movie\\" you write? Oh Please!

I brought it over that one time.\\" I said, \\"When?\\" He said, \\"Like maybe two years ago.\\" I still didn't remember it. Then he began to describe it more. Then I suddenly vaguely remembered the movie. I said, \\"Oh yeah...I think I remember now. That was like in February 2009 when you brought that over. Yeah, I didn't like that movie. That's why I forgot all about it. It's a forgettable movie. It didn't stick with me.\\"The above paragraph sums up my feelings about this movie.

I was so happy when Andre the Giant (a true talent) beat him and later on when the Ultimate Warrior pinned him. Really took the wind of his sails. Hogan's movie suck.

I don't care if you don't like Hogan, if you hate his wrestling style, if you believe McMahon was \\"really\\" responsable for it all (which has \\"some\\" truth to it). When Hulk Hogan came out to wrestle, especially in the late 80's, it was far more electrifying than ANYTHING since, in terms of wrestlers. If you didn't live through it, you might not comprehend it.

The major problem with this is the quality of the wood and finishing. First, the base is a thin 1/4\\" thick plywood to which the solid oak wood is attached. This is not as bad but still looks and feels cheap.Second, is the lack of finishing on the oak wood itself. The top surfaces are all finished but the grooves and cavities where the knife blades and handles go are VERY ROUGH, as if they had been milled or cut with a saw and not ever sanded. I'm not talking fine sanding, i mean not even 80-grit sandpaper used. This is very rough and the wood particles and dust rub against the knives and will contaminate the knives as they fall off and collect on the bottom of the tray.This is very surprising and a major turn off.

Of course, that's assuming you have an extra kitchen drawer to spare. After a couple of days I was used to reaching into the drawer to pull out knives, but now I like not having them on the counter.The only negatives I've found about this item is that bigger blades (like my Shun Ken Onion or my Shun Bob Kramer) don't sit far enough down into the slots. The result, in my case, is that the tips of the blades are exposed, resting above the slot, in the back of the drawer. Could be a problem if someone reached into the back of the drawer. Then again, if they're dim enough to do such a thing, they may just deserve the poke they'd receive. Another note: the small slots really only accommodate small blades. My 5\\" utility knife doesn't fit, and I don't have any big slot remaining to house it.The tray itself seems very sturdy and solid and I expect it will last for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality - Unique Design","review":"This product is very well made.

Hobsbawn astounds via his amazing alchemisation of inherently dynamic, human, and inspiring subject matters (e.g., essays entitled, \\"May 1968,\\" \\"Intellectuals and the Class Struggle,\\" etc.) into dry, tedious, bloodless \\"old school\\" academic insipidity! By the fourth or fifth essay--referencing Italian Communism--I was compelled to put my first (and last) Hobsbawm down.Ultimately, with such a wealth of well-written, informative and vibrant books, articles, etc., relative to the material \\"REVOLUTIONARIES\\" covers readily available, Hobsbawm's work is not commended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging novel of life in the nineteenth century","review":"The Heir of Redclyffe is a wonderful novel that vividly depicts life in the nineteenth century. I greatly enjoyed this novel for its superb characterization. I was truly captivated by the main character,Guy Morville. He is a character that the reader genuinely admires and likes for both his nobility and humanity. The writing is excellent and the novel flows more easily than other Victorian works of fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuentos Tales fromm the Hispanic Southwest","review":"I loved the short stories but the traslations were sometimes a little differnt. They used lots of archaic Spanish words. Sometimes you can't find a translation for them. I am glad I bought the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost completely worthless on all levels -","review":"I read the storyline prior to PPVing this \\"movie\\" and was interested. Not even 5 minutes in, I knew I had wasted $3.99. Seriously, I could not be paid to watch this again. You never get to know any of the victims, so you never really care for them. Instead of giving the serial killers any real depth, the director attmepts to fill in the \\"how did these 3 pyschos get together\\" by having each Psycho video tape another telling his life story. BORING! The acting is so bad and the characters so shallow that you aren't afraid of anything about them. In fact, you just want to b&tch slap all of them for making this waste of video. The soundtrack sucks and the constant fly buzzing when there are no flies around is nothing more than anoying. Stay away, far, far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash, not worth a nickel","review":"It shouldn't even be on video or sold anywhere. This junk must have been made by someone on crack, theres an annoying buzzing sound effect for the first half hour that returns through out the movie. There is no storyline at all...not even a little bit of a plot. Not even worth your time if its free.What is even more messed up, I also bought it in the cheapo bin at Wally World and tried to review it on their website and they wouldn't post it. I will never buy movies from them again, I find them cheaper on here anyway.Hey, I noticed someones offering it used for a penny, lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE. WORST. MOVIE. EVER!","review":"I really, really wish i had even read one review before purchasing this movie based on the cover at my local wal mart for 6 bucks. i now see why it was in the cheapo bin. i cannot BELIEVE this movie even got any kind of distribution behind it to even end up at a walmart, but through one of the worst flukes in history it did. i will never have my hour of time back that i wasted fast forwarding through this worthless.. i dont even know what to call it. certainly not anything close to a movie. the acting is HORRIBLE in every aspect, laughable at best. i am disgusted right now. the movie is in the trash can where it belongs. do not let the alluring cover fool you as it did me, I cannot stress this enough it shoudl be a public service announcement, DO NOT COME WITHIN ANY CONTACT. Horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"3 People hang out at a desert border collecting murder counts for What??????","review":"I unfortunately paid 20 bucks for this film. I wouldn't have spent a penny on it had i seen it. 20 dollars would not have been enough in payment to watch again. Boring as hell, Hardly any blood or gore in it either which is what i thought i was getting. Instead the torture kill scenes are choppy and the camera directs to the dorky looking guys face when he kills, probally to cover up for lack of having any kind of speical effects. The story line is pretty vacant as well. \\"Zero Stars\\" Awful, complete waste of time. This is coming from a trash enthusiast.I was mad at how i duped myself into buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth renting much less buying!","review":"The story does not seem to have anything to do with the killings in Juarez. The film is filled with fake boobs and bad acting. I was hoping for something having to do with those killings. This is NOT even worth renting much less buying. I am horror fanatic and this is one of the worst films ever!!!! On the back of the box, it refers to the director as a \\"master in horror\\". Maybe to himself, but if anyone else thinks so, that's just sad. It was so bad, I had to write a review for it.This film deserves zero stars!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For those who love fly sound effects","review":"This movie is an absolute waste. I only paid $1.00 for this and I regret every single red cent. The acting is just horrible the plot doesn't exist. Well it does... three people lure women to a camp and kill them... thats it. No, I'm serious thats the whole plot it's 81 minutes of that. We actually never even learn the names of the victims. The gore is just fake and very stupid. Oh, and lets not forget the greatest soundtrack ever to grace a movie. Including such hits as echo of shovel digging dirt and constant drone of flies flying. If you like to sit down with friends and bash on bad movies this is probably your kind of thing. If you just love watching movies but always say \\"This movie needs more fly noises then you will be in love with this. But, if you are a normal everyday person and have half of a brain in your head then for all that is holy avoid this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid like the plague","review":"Borderline Cult is yet another attempt to separate you from your money and give you crap. Uli Lommel is one of the two worst directors in modern horror. Hell, the film was shot with a camcorder for Christ's sake. The acting is this film is typical of the -Zgrade actors Uli has in his notorious film cult, The Cult of Uli, as the horror industry knows it as. Most notably is the lack luster performance by the female pycho killer, played by that no talent actress Elissa Dowling...In the name of your good sense and to keep you from vomitting up your popcorn, avoid this film like the plague....it is total crap!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars please","review":"My daughter told me NOT to rent this just based on the cover alone (and she's a horror movie junkie). I should've listened. I think I got 5 min. into it then started fast-forwarding it for the 1st death scene & now I'm in here on the computer seeing if everyone else thinks it is awful & lo & behold they agree!!!

I don't have it on my car to comment on the quality yet because I thought I bought two, but only one came. Will write another review after I purchase another one, wait for it to arrive and have it/them put on. They should really be required to put some warning here like they do with the tires if you buy less than 4- \\"WARNING, it is recommended to buy TWO of these because you cannot just change one at a time\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm happy with mine","review":"This is my first CD recorder. I bought it because my tape deck is worn out. I'm now busy copying some of my favorite vinyl and tapes to CD. I'm using only the audio connections; it also has digital connections. Despite what the manual implies, the playback-only deck plays (finalized) CD-RW disks as well as commercial CDs and CD-R disks. This allows me to make trial disks on a CD-RW and then duplicate the final results to a CD-R. If I want the final CD-R can be in a different track order from the CD-RW. It also provides the capability of playing Deck A, then Deck B (it's called \\"Relay Play\\"). I saw some recorders which had separate outputs for the two decks; I didn't want that.One thing I wish Sony (as well as some other manufacturers) would do is to make their owners manuals available online for download. This would enable people who were shopping online to see the manual before they buy. I'm glad to say it contained no unpleasant surprises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great backpack for air travel","review":"If you buy it for what it is has been designed for (international travel) this bag is fantastic. It is cleverly designed, very comfortable thanks to its big thick waist and shoulder strap and it is the right size for travel by plane (to keep it with you). The only drawback I have usually heard and agreed with is the location of the notebook. It would have been better to fit the notebook closer to the back so to provide a better weight distribution. If your notebook is big and heavy, you will certainly feel the difference. The quality is superior to anything I have seen on the market (including Tenba which is also very well built)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome backpack","review":"Great backpack, tons of space.

He was an educator before entering the Army in WWII. It is an honor to know that such a brave leader of men was born and raised in my home state. I have since come to know Mr. Burriss as my personal friend, and am honored to be considered a friend of his!This book, rather than trying to give cold, hard historical facts (who commanded what company, where, for how long, etc., etc., Mr Burriss takes the reader into cold, noisy airplanes, leaping to an unknown fate, in the dark, behind enemy lines, and fighting tree to trench for combat advantage, under enemy fire. A true American hero, with a chest full of medals to show it.An exciting book, which I have had the privilege to share with friends and family.

He was a recent graduate of college, a schoolteacher and not a professional solider. He and his men were true heros who returned to civilian life after the war. Some of their deeds were made fameous in the movie \\"A Bridge to Far\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a history, not a memoir","review":"T. Moffatt Burriss failed in his attempt to give HIS memoir of fighting with the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment during World War II. The book bounces from a historical narrative to a personal memoir, to a collection of others memories. All combined, this becomes a disorganized account of one of the best fighting units of World War II. Mr. Burriss is undoubtably a brave man with combat jumps and many front line combat days, but he should have either written a memoir or a history. His attempt to do both failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defectively sized","review":"Agree with the first reviewer.

DD is more like a bb --if there was such a size.","review":"I now wear a 34DD of a different brand, but lost some weight in the rib cage area, so the bra band is a little loose. I decided to buy this bra in 32DD. When I took this bra out of the box, I knew right away that it was too small. I took out one of my 34DD's and put it next to this bra, Le Mystere Women's Ybra size 32DD. The cup size of this new bra looked to be only 1/4th the size of my old bra. I could barely fit my fist into the cup of this bra. I didn't even bother to try it on. This bra looks more like a deep B cup, not a DD. I gave it one star because it looks well made.

The first thing that bothered me was that the print displayed on the monitor is tiny and the software cannot be corrected for the impediment. Second, you must simply have 20/20 eyesight or accustom yourself to using a magnifying glass while you use this program. Third, after you take out the magnifier or strain your eyes, you can read either the error messages or the software's lack of sufficient quotations.

I would not waste or through away money on this program - I'm sorry I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's No Business ike Show Business","review":"Well made musical starring Ethel Merman, Dan Dailey, Donald O'Connor, Marilyn Monroe and Mitzi Gaynor. Although Marilyn is the headliner, Mitzi steals the show. Very entertaining and the big show numbers are real show stoppers. Would highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"Where do I begin? First of all the story line was weak. The movie seemed to drag on forever. I breathed a heavy sigh of relief when it was finally over. Seriously, how many different versions of Alexander's Ragtime Band can a person listen to in a single movie and not go insane?Now for the good parts. The costumes were gorgeous. The dancers were very talented. They made complicated steps appear effortless.Overall, the movie was over the top during the musical numbers and weak during the non musical scenes. The contrast was almost too much to bear. There are many other musicals that balance the two, but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theres no Business like Show Business","review":"I thought it was a very good experience The movie is great.I liked it and my granddaughter liked it too"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the Five Donahues..............","review":"Ok Ok. I have been a lifelong Marilyn Monroe fan since childhood, I love her. But when you are a Marilyn fan you have to put up with hit and miss movies. No Business is one of them. When Marilyn is on the screen singing and dancing, the movie is all hers. Who doesn't love the Heat Wave number? The rest of the movie is a drag and unless you are a huge Ethyl Merman fan (?) this film doesn't have much to offer.This is a musical with a very light plot; the story of the Donahue Family in show business. The two sons grow up to be a couple of dorks. The one who wants to be a priest is just scary. He acts like a Peter O'Tool derelict with a murderous smile. The other one is driven over the edge by Marilyn's lack of interest and joins the Navy.Like I said, if you are a Marilyn fan, there are scenes in this film that you must have. If youare not a Marilyn fan, well you got Ethyl and Berlin music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior in all ways.","review":"They certainly don't make 'em like them used to, and this film is a fine example.

Great musical numbers that always don't make much sense to the script, but who cares. One of Monroe's best musical numbers, \\"Heat Wave\\", is just that. A true show business film about how the show must go on. Ethel Merman leading a cast of hundreds in the finale, There's No Business Like Show Business, is worth the price alone.

Reading this book gives me such a good idea of where she got many of her ideas and nuances for her very vivid characters. I can see her in all of them now and I am thankful for the glimpse into her real life and her real feelings. It is a very rare treat for anyone who admires her writing and wants to know what makes her tick. Very courageous of her!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Times change","review":"This is my first book by Anne Rivers Siddons. I must say she has a fine way with words and story-telling. However, I expect this group of stories played better in 1975 than it does today. Siddons portrays herself as awfully childish in almost every essay, crying buckets of tears and fretting over the most superficial aspects of life. If you like the modern-day southern belle genre, you might enjoy this, but if you like your women a little gutsier, steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"kd tools","review":"i recieved two of these kits, and both of them were missing the same piece. i have returned both of them and have yet to see any kind of credit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A phenomenal album","review":"This is a really unique and strong album, really breaks through to a new level on some songs, especially title cut.

But way too much of this is just not bluegrass, its radio friendly country. Very commercial. Tears Fell on Missouri for example sounds like a standard breakup/heartbreak song from Clint Black or Garth Brooks - not bluegrass. I found myself listening for the great playing and wishing the singer would just shut up. If they were singing some good bluegrass, I wouldn't have that problem. The one instrumental is good, but I wish they would have given alot more room for some hot playing instead of the smooth dull singing. Some people have rated this high and like this one, but not me - I sold mine. Listen to the samples. If you like those, it would be a fairly safe bet you would like the cd. If not, try almost any other BH release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unionized","review":"No one is a bigger fan of BH than me.I have all of their Cd's and have enjoyed all of them until now.The songs of this CD are unispiring and rather dull.For myself I hear nothing that sounds like a melody that is anywhere near the classic mix of traditional and comtempary sound that has made them a great band.The songs seem to be aimed at the Union Station crowd.I gave up on Alison Krause a few CD ago and if BH continues on this path I'll be looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive advertising","review":"I ordered this fan thinking it was white. It is not. It is mint green. After receiving the fan, I contacted Supentown customer service.

Since I am a bicycle commuter, I found the idea of bicycling across the largest country in the world very interesting. Many assumptions I had were shattered as I read this book about traversing the USSR in the late 1980's. This isn't a day by day account of the trip but rather more like a week by week account with some details on the daily struggles. Much of the book is devoted to the author's interactions with the local populace in rural russia. The reader comes away with a solid understanding of the county as well as the difficulties of traversing russia's land ocean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogant","review":"Like the other reviewer here who gave this book a one star I too give it the same.

He also attempts to wax eloquent while riding his bike with a young Russian who pulled up beside him. He describes her breathing motions and how her budding bre$ts are protruding from her shirt.

The Quintet features Tom Harrell on trumpet, Bob Berg on tenor saxophone, Steve Beskrone on bass guitar and Eddie Gladden on drums. The group performs four Horace Silver originals in this 50 minute film, the third and fourth pieces being the highlights--In Pursuit of the 27th Man and Song for My Father. On these two songs in particular, the group is in top form (Harrell especially), and the viewer is rewarded with the experience of witnessing the unique way in which Mr. Silver attacks the piano, producing his wonderful and readily identifiable style, as well as hearing his nearly unmatched accompaniment to the other players.

It arrived on time, but when I opened the box, it was a fluorescent orange mess! The jar was not sealed right, and the juice from the paste was all over the box. Good thing I was not wearing white skirt. It went straight to the trash, as it is not even worth making an effort to ship it back.I would think that commercial products like this should be sealed tight enough not only for leakage proofing, but also for sanitation/safety purposes.

The engagement handle can be rotated, and will \\"screw\\" the engagement fork in and out. This will affect the light indication when disengaged, but allows for some fine adjustment of travel when installing. The warnings about the Posi-Lok system binding up are all true. Can be somewhat difficult to operate due to the mismatch of axle position. Coasting cures that. The hardest part of the install was where to run the cable. That's it for the bad. This thing is awesome, clean looking, and reliable. It's made from good quality parts, however, the 'cap' that goes on the axle is made of cast aluminum and will be damaged if the bolts and screws are torqued too tight."},{"rating":"1","title":"A twist: the movie's so much better","review":"Yeah, usually books are better than the movies, not in this case. I'm almost finished with it and struggling to maintain interest. The dialogue often doesn't ring true, something a writer would write, not something that a person would say. The movie streamlined a complicated plot, and made Bourne's female pal way more believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bourne Identity","review":"Thank you for adding this book for the kindle.

However, the original highlights the vague sense of dislocation I felt while watching them.Movie Bourne has no context. Without this slice of Cold War paranoia and national discontent the seventies laid on the landscape the superman spy lacks a purpose other than his current motives. With Vietnam and shots being fired across Checkpoint Charlie Borne makes sense. The nation needed men like him.I'm happy I found the book and the original purpose of Bourne."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie's way better....","review":"I really enjoyed the movies and got them on DVD, after having read the Sigma Protocol by Robert Ludlum I was a little excited to read the book thinking it would be more exciting then the movie.I was wrong, it is slow going, with long periods of in-action, the story reads well and while you feel for Bourne aka Delta, aka Cain, aka Webb... The movie pulls it off much better, by giving you a story that while it is not as complicated, still tells a good story with a meaningful plot. What got me the most was the Totally Anti-Climactic End, that leaves the story Un-finished, I threw the book on the floor after I read the last few pages.Avoid the book unless you have several hours to kill, the DVD tells a much better story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"The idea and the plot of this book (along with other Lundlum books I've read) was exellent, that's why I gave two stars instead of one. Lundlum, I think, is not that great of a writer but like I said he has good ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOUR-ING!","review":"I decided to pick up this book based on the favorable reviews and the upcoming movie. Sadly, this book was nothing but an EXTREMELY boring disappointment.It has its moments, but Ludlum can't sustain the intensity. One chapter may be compelling enough to reel you in, but then it allows your mind to wander in a cascade of lackluster chapters. Not only is Ludlum a very poor writer, but he's also not a particularly good story teller. Through the mind of Jason Bourne, he routinely states the obvious and continues to restate the obvious through extremely tedious dialogue. Although I'm sure it's a great sleep aid for insomniacs, it took all of my will power just to finish The Bouring Identity to the bitter end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly boring","review":"I gave this book 3 chances. I first tried to read it 10+ years ago but gave up because I could not follow the plot. Then I watched the movie 2 months ago and thought of giving the book another chance. I have to force myself to finish the book this time because I do not want to waste my money.I lost count of how many times the phase \\"Delta is for Caine and Caine is for Delta\\" were being repeated unnecessarily. In fact, I get irritated when I see this pointless repetition.I still cannot understand the plot to write anything good about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"For once, the movie was better","review":"After seeing the movie, I was pleased to discover that it was based on a novel by a reputable author. I had already read two Ludlum novels, so I immediately purchased the Bourne Trilogy with high expectations from my other Ludlum experiences.All three books are disappointing both in their numerous plot twists and especially in the character dialogue. The main characters all sound like Mensa-Wannabees with every other line a new metaphor or witty reference. I regret purchasing the trilogy. The first movie is superior in every way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the book is better","review":"I heard the audio book. Its pretty boring. I hear that the actual book is good. hmm.

He has no memory of who is or how he got there, so he attempts to discover his past. He learns he is a trained killer and killers are now hunting for him. They'd like to see him dead. The plot spins on from there, and the plot is one of Mr. Ludlum's best. There's some romance. There's some danger. There's some action. Filled with detailed and intricate the plot is fast paced and action packed. The only down side to it, is it's near cliff hanger ending that pretty much expects you'll have the next chapter of the trilogy ready to go.Another great book, but of a different genre is The Price of Immortality by C.M. Whitlock"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great ideas=Great Book?","review":"Unfortunately, this is not the case. I saw the movie first and figured that the book must be even better. What I found is that the movie took the best parts of the book: some characters and a loss of memory. That is where the similarities end. The book has little of the excitement and intrigue of the movie. Ludlum tries to have many characters with different plots and motives, but in the end I simply wanted to watch the movie. I enjoy books and try to stay away from being so critical (I just want an enjoyable read), but for those who want CIA/multiple plots in thriller/action style book should read some of Tom Clany's earlier work.Final View: Ludlum had some great ideas and a few good characters, but that is really all it turned out to be. He should have sold this idea to a more capable writer. Watch the movie and use the book to keep tables level."},{"rating":"1","title":"200 million copies can't be wrong but...","review":"I agree that this is a page turner, but that't about it. The plot is incomprehensible. The \\"man-woman-crisis-love\\" scenario is too easy and corny. What? The protagonist just accidentally gets spotted in an obscure bar on the day he makes his comeback? Give me a break. People get killed all the time, while Jason Bourne and his girl miraculously gets away. Does Mr. Ludlum think that a high body count is essential for a thriller? Also, his story of high-level conspiracy is too wacky to be credible.All in all, this novel reads like a very complicated version of a James Bond movie. It is my second Ludlum after \\"The Chancellor Manuscript\\", a novel which the comments above applies equally well. This will be my last Ludlum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I saw the movie first","review":"Okay, I admit it, I saw the movie, then decided to read the book. I am a big fan of anything involving spies, yet had not read anything by Robert Ludlam until two weeks ago.First off, the movie and the book part ways in the scene when Bourne is pulled out of the Mediterranean. From that point on, the main character's motivation is the same, the past history seems the same, but the two stories are completely different. I loved the movie, I thought it was great, and hope they can make a franchise out of it. I am not sure how well it will work, given that a big draw is the man trying to figure out who he is.The book is very good. The story is clever, the characters are very well developed. It is a page turner, which means you might be going to sleep late if you start reading it.I finished the book last night, and will probably pick up the next one on the way home from work today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why?","review":"I just finished The Bourne Identity and was left with the question: Who originally shot Bourne and why? The book was good, but I think the movie will be easier to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST FIRST VOLUME IN A TRILOGY SINCE TOLKIEN's Fellowship","review":"Ludlum wrote an exceptional thriller that serves as a page-turner by itself and an addictive drug that can only be satisfied by reading The Bourne Ultimatum and The Bourne Supremacy, the two books that follow. Go ahead and buy all three at once, it will save you the trip to the bookstore when you finish \\"Identity.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Even If You Have Seen The Movie","review":"You should read the book (more so if you enjoyed the movie) I actually read the book quite awhile ago and had forgotten the details, but when I saw the movie the book instantly returned in my mind and the wonderful writing in the book where we first meet Jason Bourne.And from then on Ludlum brings you along in the great mystery as Jason Bourne tries to discover himself and who he is. Based on his background as someone involved in extreme operations, with an obvious ability to injure and kill, he is hunted as he is also the hunter for himself.Each page makes you want to continue reading as you want to come to a resolution as to who Jason Bourne is and what is the next step and obstacle that will come up. A great series of books and the movies were done fairly well also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then the movies","review":"I have just about finished the trilogy that this book is the first of. They are very different from the movies. In fact, it is as if the movies just had the same character names and were just inspired by the books but have a different story all together.The books are a little slower reading then some of the more current books in the genre but I like the change of pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing!","review":"Jason Bourne may be an agent with extra ordinary skills that normally only a robot can have. But you can't tell it simply to your friends. You are really stunned by the style of writing and the convincing flow of events. And you'll find a position in your heart for our hero. This is Jason Bourne. The bold and the beautiful. Because when you are reading this book, you won't get time to mind the time. It simply passes. If you want to fast for some hours, may be day, and you don't want to feel it, I'll recommend this thriller. Don't worry if you finish this book. Bourne is waiting"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice tale, quite different from film read one, watch other","review":"Yes it is a long tale, which Ludlum book is not? Fast paced in the telling of the action scenes; but, the standard Ludlum fare throughout. If you can get through 500 plus pages (some of my attorney friends can not) you will like this read and marvel at the differences to the film which is also quite good. Take this book on vacation and enjoy the ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing book to an Amazing Trilogy","review":"The Bourne Identity is a brilliant masterpiece, involving action, intrigue, and espionage. It invloves Jason Bourne, a man who does not know who he is, but he must find out fast before he dies, for people are trying to kill him. The book hooks you in at the start, and from that moment on, you will not be able to drop this book. The only problem with this book was the Ludlum is the master of everything but one thing, and that is love. His love scenes could be alot better, but who cares about that. This book is a must for anyone who has ever read Clancy, or other Ludlum books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome book! -Curtis","review":"I read this book because I really liked the movie, only to be completely blown away! This book only slightly resembles the movie in that the main charachter (Jason Bourne) had amnesia, met Marie St. Jaques and there is a top secret government project, and he is considered a lethal mistake. He must be killed.It is abot a man that looses all his memory and through the help of a slightly insaine and drunk doctor learns enough to embark into the world knowing only that he is an expert with firearms, and has had plastic surgery.This action packed book leads the reader through the adventure of finding out who Jason bourne is. It involves assasins, top secret US government plots and international conspiracies. Overall a very exciting read. Anyone that liked this movie would probably like this book better. One of the better books I have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh","review":"The movie was kind of fun, for pure fluff, also it saved you the trouble of reading the book. About ten pages in, a French sailor sees the hero floating helpless on the waves, and he says \\"he's holding onto something, a piece of debris, a plank of some sort.\\" So much for believable dialog. Believable plot drops away when we learn that, hey, the main character has amnesia. Obviously, Mr. Ludlum is a fan of As the World Turns or General Hospital. Perhaps someone should suggest to Robert that he has plenty of money and maybe it's time to retire. I placed this book in the nearest airport trash receptacle and got on with my vacation after chapter one."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok this book is ummm.","review":"i liked bourne or cain or david webb, whatever you want to call him. he was cool. but maria was so annoying, \\"oh my only love,\\" don't lie to me, i couldn't breathe i knew you were leaving. that was horrible it ruined the entire book. oh and the worst part... so who is carlos?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably Boring","review":"I decided to buy this book to kill off a weekend reading a good thriller. My weekend was ruined! First half of the book is quite engaging and action-packed, but when Ludlum started these long and horrible dialogs I just gave up and trashed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bourne Book","review":"Still one of the best books ever written, do not read it expecting what you saw in the movie, same idea different story"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of my favorite books","review":"I read The Bourne Identity back when it was first published and I reread it every few years. Ludlum's plots are tightly woven and the characters are admirable but flawed. I really enjoyed it on my Kindle. It is a favorite because of the suspense Ludlum builds. It is a good thriller. It is also a mystery and one of the few I could not figure out until the middle of the book. Since I usually throw mysteries away in the first few chapters because I solved the mystery, this is high praise, indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had to force myself to keep reading this book (although it gets a little less bad from around chapter 25), and am surprised that it's such a hit.Most of it is grating, unrealistic dialogue. Characterisation is poor (eg the heroine, despite knowing nothing about the hero, becomes his lover and best friend following a brutal rape). The writing style lacks interesting turns of phrase or ideas (the most vivid description was of smoke \\"spiralling\\", and this was repeated several times)."},{"rating":"2","title":"in a class of its own!!","review":"I first listened to this book in 1980 as a \\"Book on Tape\\" - read by Michael Pritchard - arguably one of the best at his craft. I am listening to the new cd version - and I can see why I thought this book was, and still is, one of the very best in its genre! Scott Brick - who is reading this cd version - is absolutely outstanding. The combination of Ludlum and Brick is unmatched!!! I relish every moment of listening!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"so confused!","review":"This book took me six months to read. Not because i am a slow reader, but because i had other things to do, like read books for school. (Never ever ever read Joseph Conrad's Lord Jim) Because i would put the book down and pick it up several weeks later, i would often lose touch with the plot. This does not detract from the story, however, and in this department, Ludlum deliveres an action packed thrill ride. It seemed that I could actually feel the mental and physical turmoil of Jason Bourne. This book is a good read. Not \\"Beach Reading\\", but more of an in-depth read. Ludlum is like Clancy in that respect. If you lose track of what he's saying, you'll lose the entire book. All in all though, it was worth the six months i spent to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"I guess I just expected too much. There was some really good action, but the characters and the plot development were lacking to say the least. Bourne meets up with the love interest Marie and their relationship was just too unbelievable. I couldn't figure out why they were together and it was like Ludlum was just inventing reasons on the fly for her to hang around and be useful. I was all ready to forgive as the story reached the climax, expecting a big finish and maybe a twist that I hadn't expected. But it flopped HARD! He just wrapped it up with such a wimpy ending, very dissapointed and wouldn't recommend it unless you just want a few action sequences (and there weren't even enough of those in my opinion)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Make this one the first Ludlum novel you read!","review":"This was the first book from Ludlum I ever read.

I really got into the characters. Great action and suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master storyteller's masterpiece","review":"Ludlum surpasses not only himself but all other spy thriller writers for all times to come. I started in 1977 with Scarlatti Inheritance and have ever since been hooked to Ludlum. But Bourne Identity exploded on me like no other book or experience I had. It is more than a spy story or about a person called Bourne trying to fight tremendous odds with a total memory loss with bursts of memory flashes of the violent past with layers of different personalities. It is about human mind itself discovering its way using the ultimate training of the past to protect it and achieve the objective imprinted in the psyche. The events will linger forever in the mind and you will be hungry to read another book which can match this book. Yes! Read it ,Enjoy it and be haunted by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie was better.","review":"Good action, good pacing. The dialogue is unspeakable, and dated in a pretentious way. The basic idea of the Bourne character is interesting but the book should be rewritten by someone with a better ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my [...]! Why did I read this book?","review":"I feel like I must have tripped into \\"The Twilight Zone\\" when I read favorable reviews for \\"The Bourne Identity.\\" This is the worst book I've ever actually finished. I didn't finish it because I cared what happened, I finished it because I was stupid enough to spend [...] on this [...]. I haven't done an official count yet, but every character in the book combine to say \\"Oh [...]!\\" about 300 times. The question \\"Why?\\" takes up about 1/3 of the book - and cheese and sap cover the rest. The action is as overly dramatic as the romance, but the plot is just plain dumb. Nothing frustrated me more while reading this book than discovering, with every chapter, that it was just getting worse. Because of some unfortunate rift in the universe, Robert Ludlum is wealthy, but many people with actual talent are not."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first- and last - spybook I will ever read","review":"I bought this book a few days after seening the movie, which I really liked. At first the book was OK, not great, but fine. But then Marie entered. Personaly, she annoyed the hell out of me. She acted like no human being I have ever met. For example, she gets kidnaped by Jason, held hostage by him, he theatens her with a gun, he hits her several times, another man rapes her, and a few days later she's all ready for a relationship ... Now if I were her, I think I'd be developing some serious trust isues, not jumping some injured spy. This Ludlum guy obviously doesn't know much about women. Not to mention all the \\"My love, you cannot leave me\\" ... I had to stop reading it about 200 pages in.

Jason Bourne is a man racing to find out who he is while an assassin called Carlos is right behind him at every turn. Filled with car chases, shoot-outs and disguises, this is an thrilling book. If you enjoy espionage tales and action-packed novels then you should definitely read this book. When you begin reading this novel you will not want to put it down until the very last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"By all means, READ THIS BOOK!","review":"I only dock it down to an 8 because it can be hard to follow at times. This is by no means a \\"light read\\" - this is what you read if you want to spend some free time being the James Bond From Hell, In Hell. Actually, Bourne is better than Bond - more believable. Far more. And more complex. You will get sucked in, you will have trouble putting this book down, and you will learn how to do some of the shadier things in life - like hide in plain sight.If you get stuck somewhere in the book, don't worry - just take a deep breath (you've probably been holding your breath, waiting for what happens next), and re-read the paragraph or page that lost you.Once you've finished the book, give it some time to sink in, then read it again - you'll find something new you missed last time."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay, I guess.","review":"The doctor who finds Bourne is shown as a drunk but seems quite intelligent when you pick up his comments to Bourne. It didn't add up.I just didn't find the female character all that believable. She seemed too easy to jump into a love story and deny all of her other existence.Last, Carlos flew to the US the same time are Bourne did in the end. Why didn't anyone mention looking on the plane rosters that morning.Carlos who is said to be a well known face rushes past dozens of people, though one entry and no one says a word or looks at himGunfire in a house and no one calls the police.Just plain weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good thriller","review":"\\"The Bourne Identity\\" is a good thriller that keeps you guessing what will happen next. The pace moves along nicely for the most part and keeps your interest up. The romantic subplot was a bit underdeveloped, or unnecessary, depending on how you see it.Overall, definately a very good pick if you're looking for an entertaining thriller. This was my first Ludlum book but it will not be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Good Action, Too Unrealistic","review":"I think Jason Bourne's name changes two or three times in the book before you get to the end. The action is good, but it's too unrealistic. Unless you're into books that include the die hard James Bond character who manages to survive every impossible scenario, but has time for a love affair all the while trying to learn his identity and escaping the bad guys, then this book is for you. I hope the movie is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godawful","review":"There's nothing like a good page-turner, but this isn't it. Like all Ludlum plots, there's a killer hook (amnesiac assassin seeks his past), but 600 pages of implausible and tedious mush lies behind it. Ludlum also writes like a court stenographer, which doesn't help matters. Try Household or Buchan instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertain your friends, read the dialogue aloud at parties","review":"I listened to the audio version which highlighted one of Ludlum's greatest problems: he has a tin ear for dialogue and when you have to listen to the stuff that comes out of these people's mouths, well, I kept replaying snippets for my wife, so she could laugh and roll her eyes. Gave it an extra star for a great concept, but had to give up on the thing about 70% through. Painfully funny became just... painful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thrilling Beginning To The Bourne Trilogy","review":"This is an excellent novel by the great Robert Ludlum. The author has a way that makes everything really mysterious and keeps the reader intrigued. The characters are all very interesting. This is the story of a man who knows nothing of what he is. He has lethal skills, but no idea how he got them. It is the story of his journey to find his own idenity. The Bourne Idenity is an awesome book...I give it the best rating I can (5 stars out of 5 stars).

I've read it again about 4 more times since then. Ludlum takes the reader on a wild ride as we travel the world with Jason Bourne. We are fighting along side him as we track 'Carlos' around the globe and we fall in love with Marie as he does. Matt Damon did a wonderful job but the real Bourne lives within these pages. You won't be disappointed with any of Ludlum's books - I've read them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting!","review":"My husband and I saw the movie based on this book, and he went right out and bought this book.

The film is so relentlessly downbeat and so completely devoid of humor that it's simply not believable; just a ham-handed Vietnam allegory about a US gunboat in China. As good a director as was Wise, he wasn't very adept at improvising when a script wasn't working out; he just went ahead and filmed it. It's this shortcoming that separates him from the really great directors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best anti-American propaganda has always come from Hollywood.","review":"Starts out promising but after the intermission, (cut short), makes sharp left turn into anti-American drivel. The new Rambo movie, which I also purchased in Blu-Ray, covers largely the same story line, (disillusioned American soldier rescuing missionarys caught in a war zone), but Rambo does it much better. Steve McQueen seems embarrassed throughout the second half of the movie. Good movie to show to the kids to let them see how crappy the 60s were for entertainment. Picture quality excellent, kind of sparse on the special features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Drama !!","review":"Stars Steve McQueen as a engine room sailor assigned to a river boat patrolling the rivers in China prior to WW2. Also stars Mako as a Chinese coolie assigned to assist McQueen. Both give Oscar nominated performances. Not what you would expect but ex-sailors and Marines will relate to the interplay between officers and men aboard ship. This is a complicated drama but the scenery and acting more than justify seeing this movie. I highly recommend it.

Good movie..don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"McQueen's Finest","review":"Tough to say considering just how many terrific movies he appeared in but this is his most measured and moving performance as Jake Holman. Beautifully filmed and filled with a great cast: Richard Crenna, Candice Bergen, Richard Attenborogh, Mako and Simon Oakland. Directed by Robert Wise -- an underappreciated director whose credits include THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, THE HAUNTING, THE SOUND OF MUSIC, WEST SIDE STORY, THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN & STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE -- this is a forgotten chapter of history. Compare this to the overblown 55 DAYS AT PEKING."},{"rating":"2","title":"McQueen's Best","review":"In my opinion, Steve McQueen's best performance. This movie should rank up there with Hollywood's great epics, but I find that very few people today have seen it. The cast is superb, the technical aspects of the movie appear to be dead on, and the basic human story it tells is compelling. For those who don't like war or military movies, I recommend that you give this one a chance. It's a long movie, but, if you get as caught up in the characters lives as I did, you won't even notice. This is one I'll watch one to two times a year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clasic Steve","review":"You don't have to be a Steve McQueen fan to love this classic movie, but McQueen collections are not complete without it.

Excellently staged action scenes with realistic portrayal of weapons fire and effect as well as brutality of the Chinese nationals against their own and Americans. All in all a very touching portrayal of the love between an uneducated sailor of high moral value and a woman missionary played so very well. I give it top marks for story, portrayal, scenery and let's not forget the excellent musical score. Couldn't recommend it more highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condition of discs","review":"The disc marked \\"disc 1\\" was too damaged to use. But the disc marked \\"disc 2 side A Extended Roadshow Version\\" had only minor scratches and we were able to see the entire movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Roadshow Is Unwatchable","review":"I was looking forward to seeing the roadshow edition of this film with the extra footage, but who decided to just copy over a faded and overly red copy of it? I gave up halfway through; it's just unwatchable and hard on the eyes. They should have done what Fox did with \\"South Pacific\\": insert the faded footage into the pristine shorter version. Then your eyes would get a rest. This would be a five-star package were it not for the mishandling of the roadshow edition. Buy it if you don't own the film, because it's a very good picture with good acting of an engrossing story. If you already have it, don't bother spending the extra money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sand Pebbles","review":"A classic. McQueen's engineer, Jake Holman, is forced to deal with the complications imposed on US Navy gunboat life by the martinet Captain Collins (Richard Crenna), the troubles of cross-cultural romance as experienced by his friend Frenchy (Richard Attenborough), his own cross-class romantic issues with mission teacher Shirley Eckert (Candice Bergen), and the difficulties involved with reforming the existing engine room coolie hierarchy while training Po-Han (Mako) to be the new engine room \\"boss,\\" all set against the turbulent rise of communism in mid-1920's China. Strong, likable characters with great moments of personal growth. A solid story that is as believable as it is remarkable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie...","review":"I don't care if it's a metaphor for Vietnam because it's a good movie and a good story. The acting is fantastic and the action keeps you going. This is a movie about an aspect of history that doesn't seem to get covered much, namely our presence in China before WWII. It was a very turbulent time for China with the emergence of the Communists and the Nationalists and the waning of the Emperor. Stuck in the middle were some of the ships of the US Navy.The best performance in the movie is Richard Krenna by far. He plays a straight laced ship Captain. He is trying to make the best of a bad situation. It's a shame this movie didn't get the recognition it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent movie too watch.","review":"This was a great movie too watch and again a very good performance by steve mcqueen and the rest of the cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally cool!","review":"Yeah, a little pricy, but worth it. It's neat looking and does a great job of keeping your cigars at the right humidity while traveling. TSA has no problem with it as a carry on. I've traveled with it 3-4 times now, and no problem with security. I would have given them five stars if they had included a lighter. Yes, they include a box of matches that fit neatly into the little storage grooves, but the box doesn't seem to be a standard size, so I don't know how to replace them. And the grooves don't accommodate any lighter that I have, so that's a bit of a negative. I guess that if it contained a lighter, then TSA might well have a problem with it. They don't allow torch lighters (or at least they didn't a few years back - I had one confiscated). Anyway, I like the product.

It is a song I dance to. I love the clever words and allegorical story lines. Barry Mannilow has a voice as smooth as ice cream cake. He sounds witty, unlike me. I talk in a rube's voice. I have never heard any of the other songs on the album. I just play Copacabana on repeat and made a 110 minute tape of only Copacabana over and over again. I dance as vigorously after 5 straight hours of listening as I do after a mere 45 minutes. Copacabana is where I live. Barry Manilow is my friend.I hate the musical Copacabana and I hate Barry Manilow's new band Copacabana. Why do they play those other weird songs. They only play Copacabana a time or two. Those are the only parts that I like. I hate all other music except the songs I compose myself such as: THE PIG LIVES, THERE IS A 10,050 foot Pig In The Room, Da-Da-Da-Da here Comes The Pig, How Much Food Can A Piggy Eat(10 pounds),"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of 70's album","review":"I am glad that I can find this CD from internet. I love every songs in this CD. The song Even Now is classic for Barry. Copacabanna really makes fun. This CD brings me a lot of memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect Barry Manilow album....","review":"This is arguably Barry's best album. It's certainly one of my favorites. It is pop craftmanship at its finest. I absolutely adore this album. From the great Copacabana (yes, it's a great song), to the heartwarming, uplifting Sunrise, there's not one false note in the whole thing. Many critics trash Barry for being overly sentimental and positive, but this album has its share of heartbreak and pain. The title track and the very underrated song Starting Again (one of my personal favorites on the album) cover this territory very well. I recently played Starting Again for a friend of mine, and she commented \\"wow, that was dark.\\". Barry rarely gets credit for his art. He co-wrote many of his hits (including Copacabana), and he is the consumate showman, still selling out concerts today. He is not an airheaded pretty boy like a lot of critics tend to paint him as."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not His Best, But Still Okay","review":"I do enjoy listening to it on occasion and it does bring back memories some good some bad, but its still okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different from the 1978 album","review":"This is a solid album by Manilow. I owned this one on LP before getting the CD reissue for Christmas yesterday.I should point out, however, that the version of \\"Copacabana (At The Copa)\\" featured on this CD re-issue is not the version found on the original LP. The version heard on this CD reissue is an extended version, a little over a minute-and-a-half longer than the version on the LP.Other than that and the two bonus tracks at the end, this CD is identical to the LP. My recommendation: Buy the CD, but, if you have the original LP, if for no other reason, so you can keep the shorter version of Copacabana."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME, despite the typo","review":"GLAD does an amazing job of putting a new spin on the greatest songwriters in American history, the Gershwin brothers. I will point out that, on the Gershwin medley, An AMerican in Paris is listed first, and Rhapsody in Blue listed last. In fact, the pieces should be flipflopped; Rhapsody in Blue comes first.

But, if naked women are your interest, there are better quality alternative movies today in which to choose.

The much more mainstream studio mixes falling under the Fabric series and the live sets (which ARE actually live for the most part) modelled after the club's popular friday nights. Fabriclive. Nice concept.For me, truely recorded live sets lose that special \\"live element\\" (which makes them so great) when transferred to a commercial album.

Before Gell-Mann, chromodynamics was just a mathematical idea: reading him makes you think there's really particles. And who really understood polarization until reading Dirac?Kadanoff does that for critical phenomena. Even when he covers the material in a uselessly glossy way, he sets the theory on its feet and opens up the idea for more work.

Why on earth would anyone use an annoying blinking screen that doesn't let you see what happens in the movie, irritate your eyes, brain and everything else? It would be okay, if they used it only once or twice but not each and every time they had to show that there is a warfare going on! The rest is unimportant.

The shoulder and waist straps being somewhat heavy duty and kind of bulky. However I updated from a Slingshot 200 which was quite small and upon loading up the Vertex 300 AW found it to be about perfect.My only complaint--and, really, this is being a little petty--is that it seems really heavy [I have a Canon 5D and a couple lenses] and this is without a laptop in it. Maybe my camera equipment is heavier than I realized? I also wondered if the should/waist straps could be less substantial so when zipped up might allow the bag to be lower profile.The above questions are less criticism than curiosity as I realize a good camera deserves/requires something more substantial to protect it.

Nowadays we're not nearly so honest, and that's why so many of the world's problems only continue to get worse.Nowadays we portray all the corruption, backwardness, and even subhumanity of a given culture -- whether its true or not -- while also working into that depiction a despicable pretense of respect for that culture as being somehow merely \\"quaint\\" or \\"life-affirming\\". In this fashion, we romanticize and even encourage the proliferation of cultural toxicity.Ah, this backhanded racism that is liberal racist \\"multi-culturalism\\".

An innocent widow is stoned and has her throat slit...and our heroes do nothing....A dying woman has all her possessions stolen by not just the hideous crones invading her bedroom but the whole village invading her house...and our heroes do ...nothing.And the heroes then make things better by dancing on the beach.

Conscious denial of Sin makes one a deadly enemy of Christ's Holy and missionary Church, whereas being a sinner makes a living soul a candidate for mercy and salvation.

Shocking, repulsive, and disturbing, yet a love story, a character study, and a whole lot of social commentary all rolled into one great movie. Jeff Goldblum is in top form as the mad scientist. Geena Davis is equally effective as his casual girlfriend caught in his \\"web\\" of deceit, lies, and terror. Truly scary at times, always thought provoking. The DVD is very plain, and derserves a better treatment all on its own. Now for Part 2, well it simply emphasizes the grossness of the first. Eric Stoltz tries too hard to replicate Goldblum to no avail. The plot is predictable, and basically turns into a typical monster movie from Roger Corman with a big budget. Very lame.

The Fly II finds Walas returning, this time in the director's chair, picking up where the first film left off. Goldblum's mutant offspring (Eric Stoltz) is raised by the company he once worked for, who have every kind of exploitive intention in store for him. What results is a pointless and predictable revenge yarn that lacks every bit of personality and poignancy that Cronenberg managed to lace into the first film.

Although Seth died tragically, I had higher hopes for his son, and the movie delivered. There's a good feeling of hope at the end, which surprises me for a Cronenberg Sci-Fi. My advice for all those bashing Fly II out there is to examine the character Martin/Stolz a little closer. In spite of the forces of evil working against him, he prevailed, and it started because he found friendship with a dog, the only creature at the time that cared for him.

As a result, he worried that he was \\"turning\\" as he wanted to do things with Tempest that he should not. The development of this concept could have been better, and Darius' use of endearments (\\"honey\\", \\"baby\\") seems totally out of character as it is too modern for his background. The presence of his family and their interaction with the couple is a very welcome change, since many of the other books treat characters outside of the primary couple very superficially. Overall, it is an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standout of the series","review":"Dark Fire is book #6 in the Carpathian series. Thus far it has become my favorite. The reason for this is due in large part to Tempest. In the preceding books the idea of freedom of choice has become somewhat of a myth to the Carpathian men when it relates to potential lifemates. While the thought of taking what you want seems like a novel idea, when it pertains to a person it chafes. I genuinely enjoyed the chemistry between Darius and Tempest. I believed in her struggle to overcome the mental boundaries that prohibit her from entirely embracing a new lifestyle. Darius' reasoning on his potential mortality and Tempest's ultimate choice are what make this book a standout. If you are curious to find out what these choices are, I encourage you to pick up this book.

If someone told me don't go over there because it's very dangerous why am I going to go, just stupid. I could have read a little more about Barack and Syndil.

Granted the Carpathian stories are similar,but the books do have their differences. I don't think any book will ever top Dark Prince for me, except perhaps Dark Legend which is coming out in January. However, for those who have read the Dark Series before, this is the book that let's you see a Carpathian choose to give up his immortality for his mate. This is a very new twist, considering no other Carpathian has even thought of such a thing. This is the book Feehan has been trying to write all along -- one where the herione is actually courted (at least to the best of an overbearing Carpathian male's ability) instead of just being claimed from the start. I think that if you enjoyed the last books, you will enjoy this one as well.

I forced myself to get through half of it to give it a chance, but I will not finish it. The point of view in this book is so unstable that I don't believe the author is familiar with the concept. About three pages into any book on romance writing the reader is cautioned against \\"headhopping.\\" Ms Feehan has not read any of these books. We can be in two characters heads in the same paragraph. And two more in the next. Oh, and get this: we have a \\"the eagles are coming\\" moment in this book. Sigh. And a \\"warm cave in the bowels of the earth\\" behind a waterfall. With sparkly diamonds in the walls and hundreds of candles that he left there just knowing he'd need them?

I wrote Feehan's Carpathian series off until I read Dark Fire. This installment is the freshest entry I've read in Feehan's series. Feehan basically stays with the stock Carpathian plotline, but makes the heroine more astute and candid. In other words, the heroine takes one look at the Carpathian lifestyle, sees her own place in it, and makes a few serious attempts to run away.I enjoyed the aspects of Darius' and Tempest's relationship that Feehan chose to emphasize. One of my favorite components was that Darius had to act according to his own instincts and wonder if he was doing the right thing, since he was not raised by Carpathians and did not know their ways. Self-doubt is a realistic feeling. Kudos.His attitude of \\"My wish is your command\\" is a bit over the top, but that's all part of this series.This installment is worth your money. A fresh and invigorated entry in the Carpathian series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Fire","review":"Christine Feehan is the very best author I have ever read.

This is a must read along with all of Feehans other books. The good thing about the books is that if you have not read one of her books before you still get a very good history lesson of their race. My recomendation is that you readd all the books and wait like the rest of us for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Testosterone and the Twit","review":"You know, Ms Feehan has actually written some good books. This isn't one of them. The plot is mimimal at best, the bad guys don't inspire anything other than yawns, there is no interesting conflict between the characters, and the characters themselves ... Darius is badly drawn (a mishmash of old world domineering and contemporary American slang), and Rusti/Tempest is stupid. I honestly can't think of a better word for it. She's in constant revolt against authority for pretty much no reason (some back story would help here), she's incapable of logic or self preservation (gee, I know the bad guys are out to get me, but I think I'll go wander off alone to where I've just been told the bad guys are because Darius wants me to stay with someone who can protect me), she can't even keep a simple promise.

How romantic can it be to have somebody sucking your blood? Ms. Feehan has managed to make a vampire series romantic, funny, gut clenching, and very enjoyable. Her Carpathian series has got to be one of the best series written for the dedicated romance reader. Of course, I agree with Tempest from \\"Dark Fire\\" that Darius is just too pig-headed and all controlling. All of the Carpathian men are dictatorial and really need the bonding of a human woman to bring them into the present and onto to solid ground. Read this series starting with the first one, \\"Dark Prince\\". You'll not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Totally Different Darius!","review":"I receive my copy last night and finished it all straight! I was amazed at the way CF changes Darius' character when he met his match with Tempest (Rusti to everyone else *grin*). I thought at first I don't like the way where Darius is much too considerate and gentle but when CF shows the still fierce, arrogant and stubborn side of Darius in the middle of the story, I was relieved. The story goes this way. Darius met his match with Tempest, the Dark Troubadour's new mechanic. All her life, Tempest (who has a terrible past) is alone and prefers to stay that way and doesn't want to be dictated by anyone else. Of course, Darius will not let her. On the other side, Darius, who grew up without Carpathian guidance, doesn't know how the human-Carpathian relationship works. Darius' family is also determine to save the relationship of the two.

Although no liner notes--the poster picture with Booker and Willie relaxing by the pool is neat-but the music takes center stage here. Originally on Columbia in 83--a reissue in the 00 decade lacks the artwork/poster/linernotes. Try to find the original cd release.

The children are hauled to municipal court, where they are threatened by dark and twisted officials that if they do not recant, they will be boiled alive in oil.

Maazel made a premium-priced cycle of Mahler symphonies on Sony with the matchless Vienna Phil, but even they couldn't salvage wayward performances that were savaged by the critics (except for the Fourth, which rather oddly became a critics' darling). Maazel is glib, shallow, and stiff in Mahler, three defects that are fatal. They certainly prove to be here, and Meier's rather curdled voice is no friend to Mahler's rich emotionality either. Despite many touches of artistry, I simply don't find her right in Mahler, either in these song cycles or in Das Lied von der Erde. Meier's many fans will feel free to disagree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and Melodious","review":"Bill Guest and other featured song writers in this book present a style of music which is fun to play and pleasing to the listener.

But if you are seriously interested in ancient civilizations, where they came from, and what happened to them, I HIGHLY recommend you begin with a serious book, such as one written by Brian Fagan. Von Daniken's book is pseudo-science - it is tantalizing, inspiring, even bewitching, but so is a fantasy novel. The only difference is that good fantasy writers don't claim that their work is nonfiction. Von Daniken has made a lot of money cooking up this nonsense - don't send him any more.

Astronomer Carl Sagan also ridiculed the idea that races of ETs, from a planet evolved separately from us, would match ancient drawings of human-like spacemen. Even before these men, Clifford A.

Von Däniken claims that the myths, arts, social organizations, etc., of ancient cultures were introduced by astronauts from another world. He questions not just the capacity for memory, but the capacity for culture and civilization itself, in ancient peoples.

Even if you discard half of what passes as evidence in this book, it is hard to deny that at least a portion of the information presented invites further questions, and merits further research.

The vast majority of the \\"evidence\\" he cites only vaguely--if at all--suggests rehistoric visitation by aliens. Worse, Von Daniken seems to believe that early human civilizations were incapable of putting one brick on top of another without alien assistance. On the other hand there are a few compelling exceptions, like the \\"astronaut\\" paintings in southern Algeria.All in all it's a fun read, but don't take it too seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"psychology, not archaeology","review":"This is a sneaky book. Von Daniken expends most of his energy attacking the supposed close-mindedness of the scientific establishment. This tactic predisposes the reader to want to disprove him -- to demonstrate that he or she is open-minded and willing to consider facts that don't agree with a pet theory. This makes the reader let down his or her guard, afraid to question von Daniken's evidence. His evidence? A few dozen seemingly anomalous finds linked together with a liberal helping of speculation and a heavy reliance on arguments from incredulity and a refusal to believe in any coincidence whatsoever. If you insist on reading this book, be as skeptical of his accusations of close-mindedness as you are of his theories (or any theories, for that matter)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase","review":"This book appeals to a unique population of readers.

It's theories, many of them based on evidence that was artifically created, draw the public's attention away from scholarily research to off the wall theories created by a man without any sort of formal education. He has no degree or higher training in archaeology, yet his theory is more widely read than most Harvard professors.

Erik Von Daaniken thinks it is shaped like a lazer gun because they used to see the aliens wielding them...\\" Absolutely hilarious.

I don't think they could be futher from the truth. Dniken ask questions that gives one something to ponder. And the thought that there may be life on another planet seems to make sense. The thought they explored and set up camps, or bases also sounds right to me. If we ever get back to exploring space again I am sure one of our first steps will be base on the moon. Or I hope so.

It would have been much more compelling if he hadn't felt the need to drag in Project Bluebook and Edgar Cayce. His projections for the future of Earth and NASA are really funny forty years later. I can't tell you how many times I laughed and had to read passages out loud to my husband.I can live with the fuzzy logic and faulty reasoning. What I cannot abide is Daniken's unwavering assertion that ancient peoples were all knuckle-dragging troglodytes.

Each time I saw it, I cringed. This phrase tries to cut off debate, stifles analysis, and generally hurts the credibility of the entire work.When people are so convinced of their own position that they try to suppress any information to the contrary (even rhetorically), they are degenerating to the level of the \\"Thought Police\\" - or worse.Sorry Herr von Daniken, you blew it."},{"rating":"1","title":"anull & void","review":"What a waste of a powerhouse cast!

I bought two and have used them as my primary controllers for about a month now. Both of them shut off if they lose contact with the batteries, meaning that if they get shaken real hard or you drop the controller, or if the controller is just feeling a little moody, it shuts itself off. Usually if i take the batteries out and just plug them right back in the problem goes away for the rest of the gaming session. When it does happen its usually only once every time I turn my xbox 360 on (so like once a day), not really enough to impact game play, but its there. I still recommend these controllers."},{"rating":"2","title":"works ok, but battery pack container is not staying in place...","review":"works ok, but battery pack container is not staying in place...I've had this control for about 10 months, but the battery pack is not passing current to the control.

Is it still under warranty and how do I get it fixed?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well.","review":"Like all 360 controllers, this one has a ineffective d-pad. Sometimes you will try to hit left, and it will think you pressed down. The ps3 dpad is much better. One plus I give the 360 controller is the triggers. Triggers are much more fun for shooter games in comparison to the ps3 controller.However, the major fault I give to the 360 controller is that it does not come with rechargable battery packs. Instead, Microsoft wants you to buy it separately just like their wifi and other extras, which, in combination with xbox live, makes xbox 360 more expensive than a ps3. Then if you also take into consideration the fact that your 360 will probably break, you will have to spend another couple hundred to replace it or get it fixed.The controller is good though... good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty product","review":"I wasn't expecting any problems buying a used product online since I've never had a problem before, but I was disappointed with this purchase. I received the controller just a few days ago and it is in decent condition and still has fairly responsive controls. One thing that was not mentioned on the product (at least this one) was the fact that its right hand joystick almost constantly starts panning to the right. Not the joystick itself but the game or whatever you are controlling will start moving right on its own. Simply put this seller is selling products with hardware malfunctions. Its most likely not like this with every controller being sold but it is still unacceptable. And that is why it deserves 2 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"own 4,1 works","review":"I like the controller layout itself with exception of the dpad,the buttons have to pounded pretty hard compared to other controllers,besides those small complaints the controller layout is really good.The main problem is that ive owned 4 and of those 4 only 1 actually works without being plugged in.1 of them died within a month of being owned and was hardly used in that time.Ontop of that none of my 360 controllers hold a charge for more then 3 hours(after being fully charged),and turn themselves off randomly.So until Microsoft fixes those issues its a one star"},{"rating":"1","title":"keeps turning off","review":"I just got an Xbox 360 and it is great. The controller that came with it works perfectly. I bought another controller to play with my friends and the controller turned off after 10 minutes.

But, when using it with a PC, the analog sticks never stay in the exact center when left alone. For example, when playing a racing game, the car may veer to either side when the stick is not being touched. Microsoft should include software to create a larger deadzone, because some games do not have this adjustment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brian Wayne Wells reviews \\"Washington: History of the State\\"","review":"Mary W. Avery does not hide her pride in her home state in this neat little history of the State of Wahington. \\"Washington: A History of the Evergreen State\\" suffers only from being too short. It is only 329 pages long.The book is arranged in a topical manner, especially near the end, with chapters on political life, social life and industrial development, rather than weaving these topics into a strictly chronological whole. This means that the reader jumps forward and backwards in time as he/she reads the book.

The trip is anything but smooth, but the laughs are plenty as Danny DeVito playing the much abused kidnapper keeps thing stirred.The DVD looks really good, however there's missing sub-titling...Also, this film should have been given more extras. I'm sure that there was some footage left for a gag reel, especially with Danny DeVito and a commentary would have been nice too.

I remember being creeped out by the bus in the Amazonian jungle scene and the ensuing chase through the jungle itself. I felt dirty after watching it and still think I can smell Michael Douglas's character's body odor that obviously was attractive to Turner's character. :-) It keeps you on the edge of your seat knowing some insect or reptile would jump out at any minute. I felt the same way watching it again. I remember being on edge hearing the eerrie music that sounded like a swarm of bees that increasing the tension during showdown over the stone near the ending. I laughed out loud the second time Douglas's character hurls the suitcase. LOL. Anyway it is an entertaining fun movie.

When I first reviewed it I was swayed by peer pressure. I was 18, and pretty much still a teenager, so to fit in with my peers I said this movie was good when in my heart I knew it was a piece of garbage. I found the plot to be too hard to follow even if I wanted to do so, and the non-stop fast and furious cursing I began to wonder if this was for the actors/actresses to turn each other on, or not. The movie just doesn't lay well with me, and I know it probably will never. I'm just telling you all this now because I'm almost 39, and I want to have my mind and conscious clear before the Lord. I said this was a good movie to impress people, and they haven't even stayed in touch with me, and I haven't stayed in touch with them, so now's the time to start thinking for myself, and I feel that this is a trash movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romancing the Stone","review":"Old but excellent adventure movie with hilarious situations and top notch acting by Douglas, Turner and DeVito."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun story with something for everyone","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite movies.

This must be one of the worst films I've ever seen, even considering the period in which it was made. It is suffused with the most patronizing stereotypes and condescending dialogue, including the \\"how could the poor benighted Chinese do this to themselves\\" mentality that was so prevalent in the '50s. The dialogue is badly written and even more badly delivered. The crowning moment of absurdity, among many such moments, may be the scene in which Holden and Jones reach the climax of one of their many thoroughly unconvincing love scenes by having Holden light a cigarette, stick a cigarette in Jones' mouth, and stick the lit end of his cigarette dramatically against the end of her cigarette as the overwrought theme music rises in the background. May be worth watching for a good laugh, if you're into that sort of thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply touching and tragically moving","review":"I am a Beijing-born and American educated Chinese American man. If there is a movie that deeply touches my heart \\"Love is a many splendored thing\\" is definitely the one. Jennifer Jones so beautifully portrays Suyin, an Eurasian woman of Chinese descent that I thought she herself is half Chinese. How could an American actress capture the very essence of a Chinese woman so vividly?! The more I watched the movie, the more I was convinced that she must have some Chinese blood. I never felt that I was watching a movie. It was real to me! Her beauty, her character, and her acting skills perfectly match the story. She reminds me of exwife, a beautiful Chinese woman and my exgirl friend, a beautiful Americna woman. She combines beauties and strengths of both Chinese and American women. Where can you find a woman with such beauty and qualities in real life or in movies nowadays?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love is a Many-Splendored Thing","review":"Old style, didn't expect to find things like that so differently done these days.

It follows the Bulls and Jordan during his last season, through the finals against the Jazz and Jordan's career-ending (for now, at least), game-winning shot in which he gave Bryon Russell a spank and then drained that jumper.The best video I have seen is Ultimate street brawls at streetbrawls.com at least that is real but Not much here that most fans don't already know.

I didn't really expect the IMAX feeling to translate well to a smaller screen, and to tell the truth, it doesn't. But that is not a problem here.Michael Jordan is an athlete larger than life and he does not need a big screen to relay that. His messages are powerful and his philosophy is an excellent source to anyone, but especially if you're raising children. He loves children in general, specifically his own, and a lot of what he says relates to children.You will not be let down by this DVD, the message is powerful and MJ on the court is always a delight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you have a big TV?","review":"I mean, a really REALLY big TV? If the answer is no, then you probably shouldn't get this DVD/VHS. Make no mistake: MJ to the Max is an IMAX movie, and you'll be very disappointed when you see it at home. About half of the movie has these really annoying picture-in-picture shots, which take up maybe 25% of the screen, and made me feel like I was watching streaming videos on the web. I'm sure this \\"technique\\" worked fine on a 80-foot-high screen, but it definitely doesn't on a regular TV.In terms of the content, the movie also disappoints. It's nothing more than a rehash of ESPN highlights, except that it is shot at awkward angles and further away from the action. Again, this may have worked on a huge IMAX screen, but certainly not on a regular TV. The movie also fails to provide any in-depth behind-the-scenes material.My 2 cents: Save your money unless 1) you are a die-hard MJ fan, and/or 2) you have a really really REALLY big TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"one day he'll regret it","review":"Jonathan Safran Foer is clearly smart and creative, and there are parts of his first novel that are wonderful. As a whole, however, the thing doesn't hold together. At its best, it's enjoyable; at its worst, it's pretentious and embarrassing. He tries to write with a world-wearied wisdom, but that \\"wisdom\\" is just the self-satisfied musings of a kid who doesn't realize yet how young he really is. The whole thing screams \\"college writing seminar.\\" I'm not saying there's a minimum age for great writing. I think it's possible for someone a lot younger than Foer to write something brilliant; Foer just hasn't.Everyone's always on the lookout for the next big thing. Maybe Foer is it. There's enough great material in this book that you wouldn't laugh in the face of anyone who said so.

I've never laughed so uproariously AND, pages later, cried publicly with a book before. It is a great story, too- all the many layers of it.

That made me wince. How can a book not be an experience? But as for EII, the humor is tedious, and ditto the magic realism. Of course, he's young, it's a debut, and he's good-looking. That's all critical in the world of publishing and reviewing, which is closer to PEOPLE Magazine every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing is Illuminated","review":"I read this book as part of a summer book group. I'm not exagerating when I say that everyone in the group resented the time we spent trying to understand this novel. One member of our group even read it for another book group and their entire group was equally perplexed. None of us could understand why this novel was so well reviewd. Good luck to all who attempt to understand and learn from this mess!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"I really wish I liked this book more. Having heard over and over again what a prodigy Foer is, and having been more than a little intrigued by the release of the upcoming film version (starring Elijah Wood and directed by Liev Schrieber) I had high expectations. While it kept me turning pages, I found my interest lagging about halfway through. While it isn't without its poignant moments, I was too distracted by the author's showmanship (look at me, I'm a talented writer and I'm under the age of 30 ... aren't you impressed???) to really focus on what the author was saying or the emotional journey his character's were going through.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I thought this was one of the worst books I've ever read. It seemed more like an exercise in self-indulgence and at times wondered if the author wasn't under the influence of various substances - throwing in sentences at random and ideas as they seemed to appear in his consciousness.Admitedly I finished the book after each painstaking page - I kept hoping \\"everying would be illuminated\\" by the end. But I was left a little angry at having wasted so much time with these people I didn't like or care about in the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, flawed first novel","review":"I had better refrain myself from compositing this review in the finesse of \\"Everything is Illuminated\\" or you will get very spleened or else end up making ZZZs.\\"Everything is Illuminated\\" is a wonderfully fresh and witty first novel with a central pair of characters you really root for. However I found the structure disatisfying. The chapters alternate between the translator and the US hero narrating their adventure in Eastern Europe. It's almost a bargain basement two-for-one approach to novel writing. You compose a couple of parallel stories and then splice them together.I enjoyed the way Foer handled the dynamics of the central relationship in the book, as the two men make an uneasy friendship, but sadly my interest petered out a third of the way through. There was however enough talent on display to make we look forward to his future books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything is Illuminated","review":"This is JSFs first book but after I read (and loved!) it I started seeing his name everywhere in magazines and online. He is a young writer who seems to be bursting onto the scene full force with the creative gusto and wide open sentence strokes that made Dave Eggers popular. There are points where the writing zips and zings off and leaves me wondering what exactly is happening but that is a small price to pay for the surprising plot twists and manipulation of language which JSF is gleefully twisting into a novel. I enjoy writers who use magic realism, for example Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Zora Neal Hurston, and I liked this book for the same diversion from reality that well, illuminates an issue with new light. This is a story of what is lost and found in both our individual families and our universal past and it comes alive through a youthful lens. I didn't get more than 5 pages into his second book, but I'm re-reading this one and pass it on to all my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really what is required...","review":"...200 pages of thinly veiled pornography, to lead the Millennial generation to a place of paying enough attention to the circumstances of war and the Holocaust that they are bothered by it? Far too many good books--and many of them strong non-fiction, rather than a novel that is more the author's playground than any new contribution to the subject matter--have already been dedicated to the theme (and have honored the Jewish people through and through, rather than making them a collection of oddballs and sexpots) to make this book valuable. The book's truly redemptive character? Alex's grandfather. It's just too bad that we must wade through so much drivel to get to his changed heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely overhyped","review":"I tried to read this book on several occasions but was put off by its pretentiousness and could never get past the first couple of chapters. The narrative was impossible to follow and the post-modern references to the author as part of the story simply didn't work. I thought the subject would appeal to me as my family comes from the Ukraine. But in the end what I could discern from the prose actually was quite insulting to both the modern and historic Ukrainian culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Is Not Tenebrous","review":"My legal name is Crazy Ukrainian. This is fortuitous for me and Jonathan Safran Foer since if he wrote his tome in broken Asian American, African American, or other tongue he would have been burnt in effigy by now. Apparently there are no mainstream Ukrainian book critics in America. Let me be perfectly clear: imagine the narrator of this book is a young black man who speaks grammatically incorrect English, and that the author is white."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Over-Rated","review":"I heard so many great things about this book that I couldn't wait to read it. What a disappointment. The jokes aren't funny and the language of Alex is just plain annoying. Although it seems he intended well, the chapters are choppy and all over the place. It seems to me that Mr. Foer is one who was in the right place at the right time and surrounded by the right people. One is left to wonder if the book would be so highly rated if it came from someone who didn't go to the right schools, didn't know the right people, and wasn't born into the right family. I'm all for reading new authors, but this is one author I won't read again. Ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chore to finish...","review":"Like many people, I read this book due to glowing reviews. The book was off to a very slow start, but I trudged on... all the way til the ending! There were good aspects of the book - I actually liked Alex's broken English, gave me something to chuckle at and showed Foer's creativity. But some of jokes got old (how many times do we need to hear about the dog farting?) and details of sexual exploits can certainly be left out.I was glad to finally finish the book, but I was upset that nothing was really illuminated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly bad","review":"Alright, I will admit I've only read the New Yorker short story. But that was awful - mannered, self-absorbed and completely false. I find it hard to believe that the novel can be much better. I have spent years working in Ukraine, speak Russian and Ukrainian, and I found the character of Alex simply ridiculous. Evidently Alex's butchering of English is supposed to be humorous, but unfortunately none of his dialogue sounds anything like a native-Ukrainian speaker attempting to speak English. Caricatures are not funny when they're painfully off-key. I'm shocked that this is the book of the season. If you want a good, funny, real novel about Ukraine try \\"Death and the Penguin.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"hate it at page 40","review":"I was immediately put off by Alex the narrator. Yes he has a unique voice, but the author is trying too hard to be clever with him. It might be funny for 5 pages, but not 45.And Foer, the character, writes his \\"novel within the novel\\" about a Ukranian Jewish community that is a caricature of a community. Perhaps this is intended, but I didn't care for it. Maybe if I was intimately familiar with the culture's foibles, I would find it immediately funny. But since I'm not, I had no sympathy built up to enjoy the caricature -- to laugh with it, and not at it. And again, since it tries too hard, I couldn't even do that. And possibly I missed the author's intentions entirely -- was this part to be taken seriously but lightly, with the magical realism going on?Maybe I haven't given it a chance, or didn't \\"get it\\", but I don't like suffering through things I don't care for these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stars Galore! An amazing undertaking and a triumphant return","review":"This book made me laugh, cry, wince and sit in wonderment. i reread pages, sentences, just to grasp the last juices it was willing to grant me! It was exceptional and I long to read other books that move me this much! Thank YOU"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best recent novels I've read...","review":"Brilliantly written. Extremely, extraordinarily, wonderfully clever -- broken into parts, with one narration written in butchered English by a young Russian man. Very smarly done. Lots of neuroses in this book, pent up sexual frustration, confusion, Jewish humor galore... Minimum exposure to Yiddish not required, but helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading, but not perfect","review":"This novel is worth reading for Alex's story and voice alone, but in the tale Safran Foer spins about the shtetl he sometimes seems overimpressed with his own cleverness. Then again, maybe I'm just not used to reading magical realism. But Alex is a character we can love for his humor and admire for his courage and compassion, so the novel is overall a good read. A note for audiobook fans: I've been impressed with my exposure to Recorded Books products so far, and this reading is no exception. The use of two narrators, both of them highly capable, is different but appropriate here as it keeps the listener on track with this novel's two separate plot strands."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant novel","review":"This is one of the best novels I've read in the past few years. It is both incredibly entertaining and also a significant literarly accomplishment. I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard reading a novel, or for that matter cried so hard. But also I finished the book in awe at the many serious issues Foer manages to raise through such a fun and lively story. It's all the more miraculous becuase he is so young.I waited a while to read this book, put off somewhat by I all the media hype, but I'm glad I finally got around to reading the book. Now I can't stop talking and thinking about it. Foer is a real talent to watch. The critics--in this case!--are right.I suggest you find out for yourself, read the book...."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting read","review":"I too was caught up in the publicity that this book first got when it was published - and while it wasn't the best book ever -it was very entertaining and a good page turner. The first two chapters are tough to get through, but if you make it through them you will get caught up in the story and want to see how it plays out. Sad at times, funny as hell at others, introspective and thought provoking - which to me are good signs of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting blend...","review":"I finished this book a week ago and I'm still gathering my thoughts about the experience. First let me say that I picked this book up because a friend of mine saw the movie and said she thought I would think it was highly amusing. \\"Everything is Illuminated\\" never came to my local arthouse (looking forward to renting it) so I read the book instead. She was right- I found it very amusing. But what I wasn't expecting was the emotionality of the Ukrainian narrator, along with the inhabitants of Trachimbrod. By the end, I was crying and depressed... but in a good way :). Not the best book I've ever read and rather uneven and affected, but Jonathan Safran Foer uses inventive and interesting style choices and creates an intense and truthful emotional undercurrent to what could have been just another drop in the Bildungsroman bucket."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Remarkable Debut","review":"I can highly recommend this book. First, that JSF is a mere 27 years old just flummoxes me. His characters are so rich and so real it is hard to imagine someone so young has such powers of observation. The narrative switches between the present, where the author, his Ukranian translator, the translator's grandfather/driver, and the grandfather's dog (Sammy Davis Jr., Junior) set out to find the village where the author's family originated from before the holocaust. The second narrative recounts life in the Ukranian village, complete with quirky, funny characters and elements of Marquez-worthy magical realism. There are some exquisitely well-written chapters in this book, and some laugh-out-loud exchanges between the author and his translator (and the author and Sammy Davis Junior, Jr.). Read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is like cultural cholesteral.","review":"You people who \\"loved this book!!!!\\" are slaves. This book doesn't even qualify as a shadow on the wall of the cave.Wake up William!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings me back to Ukraine every time","review":"I lived in Ukraine for two years, and every time I read this book it brings me back to a wonderful era in my life. Besides that, this is a hilarious and heart-wrenching debut. I've lost count how many times I've read it, but it doesn't matter: It's just as good every time.Great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This book was amazing. The characters of Alex, Jonathan, and Grandfather were incredibly well-drawn and the narrative (in all three tales) was subtle and delicate. There were many memorable and heartbreaking scenes, including the two major \\"betrayal\\" stories at the end. In fact, I put the book down during both scenes because it was so emotionally wrenching to read.I understand the author has experienced some trouble following up this novel, that his second novel hasn't received the accolades this one did. It's easy to see why. Everything is Illuminated is an incredible novel, one I won't soon forget and one that ANY writer would hate to have to follow up with something new. I look forward to recommending Everything is Illuminated to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Soon","review":"A meandering, melodramatic self-concious novel that attempts (far too hard) to assert its seriousness. There is talent here, uncooked, in need of seasoning and thrown onto the table far too early. The publishing machinery kicked into gear too quickly and greedily attempted to exploit the extreme youth of this writer. A shame, in another time, perhaps Mr. Foer would have waited, worked harder, and allowed his wisdom to prevail over his ambition. We all might have been given something closer to literature than this display of editorial absence and cynical business maneuvering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ur Kidding","review":"I think this is one of the WORST books I've recently read--but I imagine my response wouldn't have been quite as strong if so many writers I respect hadn't jumped on this band wagon and insisted that all of America read it. Is the publishing world THAT obsessed with churning out another Dave Eggers? God, help us all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"and the ilumination begins when?","review":"It's true: You can't judge a book by it's cover. I bought this when I was visiting Manhattan, and thought the cover was neat. I quickly skimmed the inside flaps and thought it might be an interesting read. I just finished it the other day, and it was a waste of time and money. The whole time reading, I kept waiting for the book to get to it's point. Characters were introuduced and then dismissed without explanation. If anything, more knowledge on sex was the only thing I got out of this book. It has no ending. It just ends, leaving you wondering what happened to this, this and this. A very disappointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"everything you could wish and fear life to be","review":"This is by far, my favorite book of all time. Foer has an amazing ability to cover all the ranges of human emotion, from comedy to intense pain and sadness. The characters are so beautifully developed and complex; unreal enough to make them magical, but real enough to make you wish they were alive. Granted, the book is a little slow in the beginning, it took me quite a few weeks to read the first 2/3rds of the book, but then one night to read the last 1.3rd. Foer sets up a story that spans over many generations, which all comes rushing together at the end with a terrifyingly beautiful force.To sum it up, this book is everything you could wish and fear life to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book","review":"Incredibly written. I'm so glad I stumbled upon this book. I've never read anything like it, and have recommended it to several of my friends and family. It would be really hard to describe it, so if you enjoy reading books that aren't the \\"norm,\\" then you will love this one! I'm looking forward to starting Jonathan's other book Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close: A Novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't quite work for me","review":"I was very excited to start reading this one as soon as I finished \\"Extremely Close and Incredibly Loud\\" which I just loved. This book shared a lot of similarities but was definitely more rough, less refined. His style of shifting time periods and narrators, which worked so well in his other novel, just didn't seem to work for this one. There were parts that I liked, namely the narratives from the broken-English-thesaurus-abusing Alex, but even these got somewhat old. I found reading this book to be tedious and not enjoyable. I will still watch the movie when it comes out because the story itself is interesting, but I can't recommend this book. Clearly, Foer was still working out the kinks in his writing with this debut novel. I'll hold off for future efforts. Skip on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish","review":"I too was excited to get the book and dive right in. What a disappointment. Yes, the book is funny at times, but talk about confusion...as others have stated, one reads and then questions what is really happening in the book. There are too many good books out there to have to struggle with this one, therefore I gave up and moved on to better, more enjoyable reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's get serious","review":"Much has been written about the cleverness of this book and the mangled English of one of the narrators. Let me add to the verbiage: how far can one joke stretch?There's a lot of desperation among readers of 'serious' fiction. The thought of a literate, ambitious young author willing to take chances and make fun of sacred cows (the holocaust in this case) has proved to much. Well, I may be desperate, but I'm not going to lower my standards. I found this book tedious to read, much like the experience of watching someone else's precocious child 'entertain' party guests: fun for a moment, but soon causing a feverish hope that the clever child can be sent to bed, so the adults can talk.And let's be honest: the skewering of 'sacred cows' has become so common that the term itself is without meaning now. There's nothing brave in doing so -- it's become a standard literary, and marketing, conceit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant book","review":"This is one of the best novels I've read in a long time. I hesitated buying the book for a long time, scared off by all the buzz. But a friend gave it to me for the holidays. Once I started reading, I couldn't stop. I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard reading a work of fiction. But the amazing this is that these are not cheap laughs. The book is significant, deep, a real challange: emotionally, intellectually, and artistically. This is a real work of literature that is also incredibly entertaining. All the more amazing when you think about how young the author is. I will certainly be looking forward to whatever he writes next.This is a wonderful read on so many levels. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must've missed the illumination","review":"This book is incredibly funny at times, but I just didn't get it. If you put a gun to my head and told me to tell you what actually happens in this book--how it unfolds, I would just say my last prayers. I don't know what happened because I could never tell who was talking to whom. I heard that Burroughs wrote \\"Naked Lunch\\", then cut it up and pieced it back together haphazardly. I'm wondering if JSF did the same. I'm not one of those sissies who needs the familiar to be OK either. I admire the unconventionality of the novel, but I just could not follow it. I happened to catch a local radio broadcast of this author being interviewed and he said he wrote the book for people who were willing to work at following and understanding the story. Apparently I am not one of those, allthough I tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY FAVORITE BOOK","review":"No other book has ever made me laugh out loud as much as this one did, and no other book has ever made me cry. What's amazing about Everything Is Illuminated is how new it is, and how it bursts at its seams with life, while still maintaining a great humility, and respecting both its subject matter and the reader. To say that the author is some sort of genius or prodigy is beside the point, I think. Rather, he's a human, with a unique talent for expressing his, and our, humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. I felt like I could relate to it better than any other book I've read recently. A very interesting and unique style of writing allows this book to go places to reach its readers that other books are unable to do. After the first 40 or 50 pages I really wasn't that into it yet, but I kept reading and quickly got hooked. I think I read the last 100 pages in one sitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recurring Dream","review":"Yarn is making me cheerless and at same occasion jovial. Do not be tardy to disperse currency and view book. This will benefit yourself.I was spleened to read utterings of M. Revzin who is grieving because hero says Fascists were tardy to destroy Trachimbrod. Could it be that Trachimbrod was not number first on their to-be-doing list? In addition, book is not history of Great Patriotic War. It is recurring dream. Only lives in memory. Memory is like old song playing on bad Soviet-era transistor radio far away so is not always pragmatic. It is dream that hurts to dream. Why dream it then? That is premium question, and sharp part of book.Also, many persons think book was rigid to read. I am giving s--t."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Luminous Debut","review":"As a young struggling writer, I must admit I was a little biased before I read Mr. Foer's short story in last summer's New Yorker Debut Fiction Issue. Of course I wanted to hate it! Yet, after a few pages, I had to admit he is deserving of recognition: his story was original, mature, heartfelt and laugh-out loud funny. This applies to his wonderful first novel as well, which I rushed out to buy last week. I was so impressed by certain passages, jokes, characters, I found myself reading aloud to friends, coworkers, even my mum. Bravo!I feel that the \\"disappointment\\" other readers expressed on this site has the strong scent of sour grapes. Mr. Foer has been lucky to get recognized at such a young age, by such influential writers. And who wouldn't want a blurb from Joyce Carol Oates? Yet I feel quite strongly that she gave her recommendation for good reason: Mr. Foer's impressive debut deserves her enthusiasm and ours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me - but maybe for you?","review":"There are one or two parts that are amusing in a Monty Python sort of way, but I found it hard to manufacture the interest to carry on turning the pages. Endless literary and type setting devices are used to bludgeon the reader into admiration of this pseud's genius. The plot is Byzantine to the point where it vanishes into its own cleverness. Vulgar and sexual references are inserted seemingly at random.If you're the sort of person who thinks that Damien Hirst's calf preserved in formaldehyde with 18-carat gold put on its horns is great art worth 10.3 million then you'll love this book. Personally I think the calf is a con and \\"Everything is Illuminated\\" is an odd, pretentious and non-sensical book; however, I do admire both Hirst and Foer for convincing the cognescenti that only terribly clever sophisticates truly understand their \\"art\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I recently received a barnes and noble gift card and decided to buy two books, this one being one of them. As I kept reading I couldn't help but keep wondering \\"when is this book gonna get good?\\" but almost 100 pages in I noticed that it still hadn't. Decided to return the book and get another one. I'm no writer myself but this book was immature and it lacked connection. All I was happy about was that I was able to get an exchange on it and not waste my money with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mess","review":"Astonishing how hype has taken ovre free thinking in America. The book is imaginative, but it's also a mess. You can tell the writer's young and you can tell it was rushed. You can also tell who's reading it based on these reviews: bored people who have stopped caring about challenging literature in America."},{"rating":"1","title":"the definition of overrated","review":"there are lots of things wrong with this book but the funniest thing was the New York Times Book Review that quoted the main characters mangled english, a paragraph's worth, as an example of how funny and brilliant it was. it was not funny. it was not brilliant. it was embarrassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of my favorites","review":"I chose to read this book after seeing the author interviewed on television. Pardon my ignorance, but I'm not sure if I understand the storm of praise that has been heaped upon this book. I found some passages funny and some very touching. However, I thought that overall, the book was a bit uneven and disjounted, and I spent the better part of my time reading it wondering why on earth I was forging on.The character of Alex is engaging, as is his quaint mangling of the English language. I also admired the \\"hero\\" of the book for his tenacity in seeking out family history with little more than a stained photograph and a fervent desire. As well, the author does have a unique knack for language. However, I am less sure that these elements alone make for a satisfying novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever written","review":"This is my second favorite book. The imagination and narration is simply fantastic. I have never experienced imagination as beautiful as the telling of TrachimBrod. Every chapter about this city is glowing with incredible anecdotes and interesting characters. In fact, Brod is by far the best character i have ever encountered.And Trachimbrod is just about a third of the whole story!This book is modern literature, which is what i like about it most. Beyond its plot and characters and historical look at the lasting effects of WWII, there are themes of writing itself, of communication, of stories told 3rd or 4th handedly (Foer the character writing about Trachimbrod through a book about Trachimbrod, then us reading his writing). I am willing to bet colleges will start using this book in certain curriculum, like modern American literature or something like that.Read this book, and read every detail of it and Foer's imagination will overwhelm you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait","review":"Just when you're about to give up on modern fiction, a book like this comes along. Underwhelmed by a slew of lukewarm offerings from hot young authors, I waited to get this novel until it was in paperback and discounted before succumbing to the hype. Foer practically had me at \\"Chapter 1.\\" This author not only writes beautifully--he's also very funny. Why are so many young literary lions afraid to crack a joke? Not that \\"Everything\\" doesn't also move you to tears at times and bring home the horrific reality of the Holocaust in \\"Fiddler on the Roof\\" country. The whimsy does start to pall toward the end, however, as the character of Brod takes center stage. She's a bit too perfect, and the Chagall-esque phantasmagoria that Foer has so carefully created starts verging on \\"Mulan\\" melodrama. The ending was also somewhat muddled, but I can't wait to read this book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything is Illuminated","review":"What the......????? I don't know what all the critics saw in this novel. JSF is the latest \\"hot writer\\"? What is up with that? If you read the reviews, you are led like a trusting sheep,(by some of my favorite authors & reviewers) into believing that you are reading something profound. Profound? The description of the flatulent Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. (dog) ...was that supposed to be a leg slapping hoot? It is just a tragically bad, self-indulgent, psuedo- intellectual rant. This has no beginning middle or end-nothing happens. The worst of the best-selling tripe, which the publishing industry has spoon fed to a poor unsuspecting public in a long time. I am in complete shock that anyone would endorse this book in any way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, stupid and completely made up","review":"Besides the fact that the book is dull, stupid, thin on plot and fizzles out pretty fast, it is also not true. The Russian broken English is completely made up. No Russian ever spoke English this way. It's a fake. And since the main point of interest is authentic portrayal of a Russian guy in his native environment -- the book cancels itself. It's nothing based on nothing. I am sorry that millions of Americans will read this and think this is how Russians speak and behave."},{"rating":"1","title":"GIVE ME A BREAK","review":"This is SO overrated that no amount of review could describe how much it misses the mark.

But I think the book was a little rushed. It's young: self-serving in only the most distracting ways.

There are too many flashbacks, going back to the WW II time, then even deeper, and then you are lost and unable to tie all the flashbacks and people in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Years after reading the book, it still sticks with me.

This is the best novel I've read in years. It's funny, it's sad, the writing is absolutely brilliant. It's inventive without being show-offy; it's smart without being smarty pants.I've never read anything like Everything Is Illuminated. I give it to friends just so they can feel what I've felt -- and so we can talk about all that the book stirs in one's mind. I will never forget this novel, and I can't wait until Foer writes another. READ THIS BOOK!! You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glorious, funny and heartbreaking","review":"I was just reading a passage from this novel over the phone to a friend and decided to broadcast my enthusiasm for this novel further by writing a quick review. Skimming through other readers comments I'm surprised at the venom contained in some, could it be .... god forbid, jealousy? This is a novel, some people will love it (I did), others won't, and that's fine, that's how it is with novels after all. I hope anyone coming to this page is willing to read and decide for themselves, I for one believe you will be glad you made the effort.

Hardcover. At the last minute I bought another book and borrowed this book from the library instead. Who says God never interferes? He saved me from wasting money on an utterfly forgettable book. Now if only I hadn't wasted the time to read it.This book is bad. The manner in which it's shaped makes it hard to care much about the characters, and the bits of the book the 'author' in the story is writing not only are unpleasant to read don't add anything to the overall shape/feel of the story.Honestly this book in terms of actual quality deserves one star. It's a poorly written book heralded by the literati, because it's form was unique, but they forgot the basic premise of any piece of writing: to SAY something...this book doesn't say anything. I only gave it two stars because the form was interesting even if the author's writing didn't match up to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything is Expropriated","review":"... from better, albeit less-known, sources.I liked this book better when it was called \\"See Under:Love,\\" was written by David Grossman, and was a dark, original and brilliantly subtle work.The bravura reviews that heralded this book as it splashed onto the best-seller lists speak more to the author's connections and the inbred qualities of intellectual taste-making than they did to any actual literary merit. Is it awful? No -- but in large part because Foer has had the good taste to steal from the right sources, not because he himself has done anything particularly creative or insightful.If T.S. Eliot was correct when he quipped that \\"great artists don't copy, they steal,\\" the Foer is, without question, a great artist. By any other standard, he's just greatly lucky enough to have had enough connections to garner this book some hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"good effort but way pretentious","review":"Although the kid has talent, he does not have it in spades and the novel is ludicrous, overblown, a fake Yiddish pastiche of third-tier Salman Rushdie and Zadie Smith.

Derivative of experimental novels of the 30s and 40s. Holocaust used as a device, which is the most despicable part of this warmed over hypersexualized \\"Fiddler on the Roof.\\" This writer needs a great deal of maturing, a lot more editing, and a huge dose of humility, which cannot be gotten when a first novel turns out to be so overhyped. Some parts are funny but the jokes are one long note, and some parts are almost insightful, but he never follows through. All in all, a bust. Let's see his fourth or fifth novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad. Awful writing.","review":"The premise of the book was good, centered around multiple WWII characters and their descendents whom I would have liked much more if I understood how they all related to each other sooner in the book. The writing was just bad. No paragraphs and terrible use of dialogue. Too much unnecessary descriptive sex that was a distraction. And the writing was just random and digressive. The book could have been so much better if it were more straightforward. I know some will think that's the beauty of this book, but it wasn't. Just a big book of written diarrhea."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 Words or Less","review":"This was recommended by someone who knows what she's talking about, so I was shocked at how much I disliked it. The plot is a bit stale, but good enough. The writing is effective. But the characters simply aren't true, especially the Eastern Europeans. Having lived and traveled throughout that area, the stereotypical bad English rang false with me. (Of course, for all I know, this is a fictional account of a real-life experience? Then I just seem an idiot.) But no matter, the novel simply held no lure for me. I lasted 100 pgs, but then let it go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to Abandon After Page 30","review":"Alex the Ukrainian's dialog is written with such obvious and desperate attempts at comedy, I couldn't take it any more.It wasn't even funny on page one.I'd rather not read an entire book constructed of amateurish caricatures pulled from the coddled mind of a precocious 20-something.Not my idea of a good time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"Downloaded it for book club.

I tried to read a lot of them so I could understand what people found intersting about it. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion...and I am to mine, so here it is. I rarely give up on a book. This and \\"The Corrections\\" are two books that were so awful, I could not finish. It was confusing and frustrating. It was not \\"telling\\" me a story, the author, in my opinion was writing junk on paper.Every page was a struggle.

It's all bling, bling, bling. No bam! No kablooey! No wow."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Fails Miserably","review":"This book is an industrial product, manufactured in creative writing workshops, assembled in corporate conglomerate publishing houses complete with prefabricated blurbs from grade-A hypesters.The book is merely an attempt of the corporate conglomerate literary industry to print money.There is no beginning, middle, nor end.There is no antagonist nor protagonist.Nobody falls in/out of love.Nothing happens.The book just rambles on and on and on.And now that we know Dave Eggers writes reviews for his cohort's books, all the positive reviews are suspect.Don't be duped by the dupers here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummed Out!","review":"I really wanted to like this book and Foer's writing. Really! Yet this is one of those exceptions to the book/movie rule (for me.) I sought out the book because I loved Liev Schreiber's movie which is based on the book. I tried, I really tried -- three times in fact -- to get into Foer's book. But is the worst of urban rush hour, start-stop gridlock during the hottest part of summer in a car with no air conditioning. Not where you want to be. Bummer. The movie is wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the first couple of pages before you buy this...","review":"If you can stand the way he writes... then go for it. But if I'd read even the first page, I would have been illuminated, and saved myself [$]. It's unbearable. Don't listen to book critics. There is something wrong with them. It's not hard to get four stars on Amazon, and this book couln't, yet these flipping critics loved it. I don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining-- but when all is said and done, pretty shallow","review":"I'm not exaggerating when I say that this is probably the most overrated book in many, many years. What is the point to this book? As I read it, I felt like I was reading something that I had read already because this rips off about 20 other books (the author is no doubt well read)! I enjoyed the writing style, which is often times quite clever. However, Mr. Foer needs to go out and experience life a little more before he can write a novel that has a lasting emotional impact-- an original style may work for one book (or in a college creative writing class), but style can never make up for substance in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wildly over-rated and over-hyped","review":"Reviewers go nuts over debut authors, especially if they're young and attractive. Perhaps it's peculiar to America, but at any rate it results in one over-rated and over-hyped book after another, year in and year out. I loathed the humor here, found it tired and obvious; ditto the magic realism. The advertising juggernaut had made me suspicious that there was much less here than was flaunted. Reading it, I found that to be the case. As BR Myers says so well in A Readers Manifesto, why not read a richly observed novel by Balzac instead, rather than another so-called \\"must read\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Above average attempt at humor","review":"Foer's attempt at the comical journey, is remaniscent of many TV sitcoms where one's pre-conceptions of many situations can lead to many supposedly funny misunderstandings.Thirty-mintues of this type of humor is bearable; but near 300 pages? I had no impulse to finish the book. I was hoping for a message, a statement, and all I got was the author telling me: Who really cares?As for the inventive style of Foer to place himself within the conifines of the story; that was done before and with the ironic twist that I think Foer was aiming for in Martin Amis' \\"Money\\".Foer is not qualified enough to refill Amis' inkwell, judging by this poor effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this before buying it.","review":"If ever there was a book to get from the library before laying out money it is this one. I was bowled over by all the high praise this book got. But since I tend to distrust critics I got this from the library. So I read it and it was everything I could do to finish it. It is not interesting and deals in such dark images that it should not be read late at night or nightmares will surely result. It is loaded with inacuraces as well. Of all the characters in the book the most likeable is a dog.For sure there will be many who would beg to differ. But if you like your books uplifting steer clear of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Publishing Industry Smiles","review":"Young man with thesaurus writes \\"funny\\" Holocaust novel. Gullible public, eager for \\"prodigy,\\" obediently follows publishing industry prompts. Book is not funny. Book is fatuous. Very little is illuminated.

Well, 24 year old Safran Foer is just that. Everything Is Illuminated is nothing short of brilliant: with superb writing and wonderful storytelling, the novel is vibrating with pure heart and soul. A true wonder of a book that everybody should read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anti-Semites gone straight","review":"I could not stop laughing at the cleverly creative broken English of the main hero. I was touched by the story of the Ukrainian anti-Semites gradually developing into good friends of a Jew. The book is also a masterfully written mystery tied to the German/Ukrainian atrocities against the Jews during the WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Everything IS Illuminated!","review":"This is a terrific novel for book club readers. It's amazing how different people see/read different things into it! The lead chapter is fall-over funny but you begin to suspect by the end of the next chapter that this is not going to be a funny book, in its entirety. In truth, it's mostly a sad book -- one that takes a some thinking about the characters, who they are, who they were. Don't miss this one, particularly if you like Jewish stories; it's a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"The first novel I read by Foer was Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close. I loved the writing style, and I had heard of this book before, so I decided to give it a try. I loved it. It is beautiful and sad. Foer has a way of writing that gets inside your head. I found myself thinking the way the narrator thinks. When I'm reading a good book, I never want to see it end. I always slow down when I can see the number of pages waning...this was one of those books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"The author plays with language to great effect in this interesting story.

The writing is inventive, the characters are wonderful, the story is gripping, and all of it weaves together for a truly brilliant novel.Alex has been told by his father to assist a young Jewish man (Jonathan Safran Foer) on his quest in finding the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. Alex brings his depressed grandfather along to act as a driver. Alex is still trying to get a grip on the English language and Safran Foer writes the novel from his perspective, broken English and all.But really, my description does not do the book any justice at all. Reading this book was one of the most liberating reading experiences I've ever had. Every emotion imaginable will run through you at some point while reading this book. Look out for this author, I expect him to have a wonderful career ahead of him. This book will be a classic in the years to come!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this book and go to the master","review":"This is probably one of the worst books I have ever read.Foer's attempt at magic realism is embarassing. Do yourselfa favor and read anything by Isaac Bashevis Singer to see howit is really done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything is Obfuscated","review":"The book started off well enough. I laughed at the translator's bad English. Unfortunately the plot never quite took form, and was interrupted by pointless tales from the shtetl that lacked any coherence or relevance to the \\"main\\" story. I kept reading hoping the loose ends would come together, but they didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over hyped","review":"The book was ok at best. The book - as other reviews hint on - has way too much positive hype behind it. Yes, the writer is showing promise and I really liked how the story is 3 tales combined, but, in the end, the book just comes up way short. In my case i am still wondering what Foer was even trying to say/accomplish with the book.Looking for something to change you - go read A Heartbreaking Work of Stagger Genius or You Shall Know Our Velocity (both by Dave Eggers) they are a far better use of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Wild and Crazy Guy","review":"To answer those quandried about \\"spleening\\" -- methinks Foer's character functions it to mean \\"chastize\\" or some other term of reprobation.As for the narrator Alex's use of this kind of misassembled English, Foer stole it from the Wild and Crazy Guys skits of SNL (who stole it from others poking fun at Polish/Czech \\"accents\\" by having them speak with a Thesaurian formality). The SNL skits were funny coz they lasted 5 minutes max. Foer's is decidedly NOT funny coz it last hundreds of pages.And would those one-star reviewers complaining about how Foer's just another corporate packaged, good-looking guy take another look at the guy's dust jacket photo. The guy's a frickin geek mensch or whatever that word is (and this coming from a geek mensch or whatever that word is).A confusing inpenetrable read that had me pining for whatizname's _The Corrections_."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"This is another book I just did not get. I am starting to feel like a bonehead, or an intellectual midget. This guy is supposed to be some young superstar, but I think he'd be better off waiting tables. I thought Alex was funny, but I tired of his goofy English after about 2 pages. Okay, JSF, we get how clever you are, and how ha-ha-ha funny. Nope, this one wasn't for me. I guess you can't win 'em all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something didn't click...","review":"I understand that there are many authors who have won phenomenal awards for writing books using prose that's not as common as plain old English. And though I'd like to think that I can read what critic's would hail as \\"stunning\\", \\"sophisticated\\" and \\"stylish\\"....by Chapter 3, instead of sinking my thoughts into the characters, I was ridiculously lost. Instead I found myself rereading sentences to try and decipher what on earth he was talking about, who was saying what and where the hell was everyone now. Thinking I couldn't be this illiterate, upon re-reading the 3 chapters, I still couldn't wrap my head around Foer's style of writing. I'm all for artistic expression but if I have decipher a book in order to enjoy it, I'll take a \\"simple\\" book anyday compared to this run. And may I ask, is there such a word as spleening?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused","review":"I felt this could have been an excellent novel. But, it jumped around so much that at times I had a hard time following it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good writing, predictable plot.","review":"As others have said, the book is beautifully written. Both in the magic realism sections and the faux English ones. This almost disguises the fact that the plot is predictable and telegraphed rather too early in the book. But not quite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright Neon","review":"For more than thiry years (that's right)I have studied Russian language and culture. I also happen to be Jewish. The combination of my two most compelling interests resulted in a book to be savored. When I finished the book I wanted to start reading it again...I even tried to contact Safran at the e-mail address he provided but was unable to do so. I wanted to tell him to keep writing. It was a masterpiece. Very cosmic. Hope you read this, Jonathan."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was smitten with it. You may be too.","review":"Everything is Illuminated is a charming book to read. It certainly has its flaws, but it has them with energy and grace. Unlike other of the current literary wunderkinderen, Foer is a disciplined writer. I liked the book least as a novel of the Holocaust-- he bends history too much to really buy it. I liked the book best as an exercise in creating myth. Trachimbrod comes alive through the stories, the various books (I like the Book of Recurrant Dreams best), and the characters.A sweet read, and a promising first novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a masterpiece","review":"Everything Is Illuminated is an extraordinary first novel--a brilliant work of fiction. I sort of can't believe Foer pulled this off. It's an audacious work, completely over the top at times, but it always works to great effect. Even great fiction these days is pretty flat: it's great in an entirely predictable way. Foer has done something different. He's gone out on a fragile limb--in terms of plot, style, ATTITUDE--and he manages to balance there, showing off a bit, with amazing elegnace and an honest instinct for the emotional life of his characters, and even more incrredibly, the emotional life of his readers. He trusts his readers; you can't say that about most writers.This is, quite simply, a wonderful book. It has its flaws; it may have been overhyped. But the book and Foer are very deserving of high praise. He's a scary talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest book","review":"Is this book perfect? No. Bu it comes across as so honest. It made me laugh many times out loud, and it also made me weep. I've bought a copy for my father, because I think he'll like it, and one for my son. I can't wait to see what the author comes up with next."},{"rating":"1","title":"too strange to enjoy","review":"I picked up this book because everyone raved about it, but I hated it and gave up trying to get through it. I was especially annoyed by the affected fashion of the writing and the strange and disturbing ways the author depicted Jewish life as he imagined it was lived in the distant past in Europe. This is the type of book that \\"intellectuals\\" love to praise because of its \\"complexity\\" but I think that the average book lover would, if he or she were honest, admit was badly done. -- Judy Gruen, author, \\"The Women's Daily Irony Supplement\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Half entertaining, half too clever and tedious","review":"I listend to this BOT. I laughed out loud during the opening sequence. Alex's \\"interpretation\\" of his American friend's story was fun to listen to. Then, the book switched to the 1700s, the story of the American's ancestors, and it was so relentlessly boring, repetetive, filled with minutia (lists, sorrows, etc) that at times I think I may have dozed off while walking. As Alex's grandfather's story is revealed by the woman they so much want to be the woman in the picture (who was a marvelous cahracter)the story reaches its emotional zenith. In retrospect, I wish it would have been easier to read rather than listen to this novel. Then I could have skimmed the historical sections, saved much time and not missed anything. But, in reading, I would have missed the mangled translations that made the novel worthwhile. 4 for Alex. 0 for everything else. Average=2."},{"rating":"2","title":"dialogue will set you free","review":"everyone says the reviews for this were way overrated, and the reviewers should be blamed for that instead of the author. yeah, it was a bit stuffy at times, but there was too much humanism to accuse Foer of being pseudo intellectual. there were a lot of lists of details that may seem gratuitous but i saw them as trying to give an accurate feeling for the idiosyncrosies of a certain culture. my favorites include the book of dreams and the different kinds of sadness. but the clincher is vernacular. it's not easy to write in voice like this, just ask irvine welsh or anthony burgess. additionally, i've been living overseas for the past few years, including europe, the balkans, and even the middle-east, and that's how people who learn English as a second language through academics sound. for all of you who've never been to europe or otherwise, the rest of the world has a much larger english vocabulary than the average ignorant american."},{"rating":"1","title":"russian new yorker","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I have many things in common with the author and the topic of his book. And, I read three glowing reviews. Sadly, I could not get past the first 20 pages.

I don't want to waste my time laboring over this book when I have so many other good books I can't wait to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"perhaps a bit too stylish for its own good?","review":"'Everything Is Illuminated' is truly a very inventive and remarkable first novel by Foer. He is definitely a talent to watch, and I will certainly seek out his other works. However in this novel, a curious tale of a young man returning to his family roots in Ukraine to pick up what might be left after Nazi genocide in WW II, the author might be guilty of being too stylish. The switching between different narrators is certainly effective to a large extent but for me it sort of ruined the dramatic impact of the book's ending. What should have been a moving moment came off flat. But otherwise I found this to be an interesting and at times hilarious read.Bottom line: somewhat overcooked but an entertaining read nonetheless.

I received mine in a box that stated to refrigerate before opening. After 24 hours in the refrigerator, I opened the box. I could see without even opening the wrappers that the bars had melted in shipment. They were caved in. When I tried to eat the bar, I could not bite off a piece to chew. The bar was hard and cold. I tried putting the unwrapped bar in the microwave for 5 seconds and it was still to hard. It took 10 seconds to make the bar edible. I did not enjoy a warm, melted bar. I did like the taste, but the warmth and the melted chocolate and caramel was not good. I did get a refund. I wish I could find these local so that I did not have to suffer shipping meltdown.

The texture is not dissimilar to numerous other bars and caramel, peanut butter and chocolate are standard in about 90% of nutrition bars on the market. The smell is normal, but 3 seconds after the first bite and suddenly I know exactly what cat crap must taste like! The taste suddenly makes me think I'm standing in the middle of a giant catbox trying to scoop out the poop! Anyone who has taste buds left should pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Best keeps getting Better!","review":"I've been consuming Pure Protein bars for years, and have tried and enjoyed all their chocolate peanut caramel varieties. This triple layer bar surpasses them all in robust flavor and palatable texture. This bar chews and tastes like a Mars Snikers bar and a Nestlé $100,000 bar combined. I eat one bar with a Metamucil Fiber Wafer cookie as a complete meal replacement for Lunch or Dinner, and am left feeling completely full and energized. If like me, you've tried other protein bars, you simply must try this next.

In many ways, this is my favorite over \\"Live At The Met\\", made 4 years later. I can't tell if Williams is on drugs during this performance, but if he was at the time, it just made him funnier. He interacts a lot with his audience here, kind of the way he does with 1988's Salute to the Improv. This is Robin Williams at his comedic peak, and is a must buy for a fan of his stand-up shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gift for a Robin Williaams Fan","review":"This was a gift that I was uncertain about, as many of us are. The gift was for a daughter out of town. She told me she loved it and had invited some of her friends over to watch with her. A Video is always a welcome gift for friends or family, if you know their taste. Even if they already have it, they can use it as a gift to someone else or trade it in at one of the used book/video/game store - like Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bold and Unique First Novel","review":"UNDO THE DEED is a bold and unique first novel. Even more importantly, it is a true resource for sufferers of domestic abuse of all ages. Although the storyline is rooted in many hallmarks of science fiction, I believe it is more properly appreciated when approached as a contemporary fantasy. Not to imply that the story is in any way wispy or easy, as it is anything but that. AMJ deals unflinchingly with the abusive episodes, and in the resulting emotional turmoil that all the characters feel. I would also particularly recommend this book for young readers - the teen and young adult, whom I think would find a particularly empathetic connection to the lead characters and the teenage centered storyline, and would be most likely to derive and apply the important messages this book has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Undo the Deed\\" Web Site!","review":"If you've made it this far, I'm Adam-Michael James and I thank you for coming to check out my book.

Well they appear in this book too so you get to find out what happened to them. This is Fiona's story. She is Faith's cousin back in modern England aand after a year of not knowing where Faith has gone to she decides to do a bit of investigating on her oen. She goes to Ireland where her cousin disapeared and finds herself at the same Druid circle of stones that Faith was at. The time portal opens again and she finds her self propelled back in time to the Ireland of 1649. There she meets up with Miles's friend a Scot with an attitude, named Ian. Together they must help Miles and Faith and along the way they fall for each other. Some of the supporting characters from the first book make an appearance here and it makes for a very enjoyable read. I also enjoyed the different ending it had. I would recommend this book and the first one to anyone who enjoys time travel books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even when \\"in the gutter\\" he sees the varied universes above","review":"Another autobiography/ethnography of a 20th/21st century man - beautifully written, descriptive, reflective - a gentle voice in a world of harsh realities. I find his voice honest and intentionally frank - he wants to tell us how it was, and does his best to do this with complete honesty; he trusts us, his readers, to hear honestly, to reflect with our verity, to compare our vision of truths, and he challenges us - to be as accepting as he is, to struggle with the difficult concepts (as we all do) and to dispel all doubts that might occur (whether these doubts spring from our own stuff or his writing).He shares his life experiences generously, asking for and providing acceptance. I found his views interesting & informative and his experiences courageous, revealing and alive with humanity.If you like reading your valued friend's up-market journal (with permission), enjoyable and revealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!

New Order writes compositons capable of making you feel, think, and dance all at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO MASTERING PROBLEMS!","review":"Attention buyers, the negative hype is surrounding the UK edition released in September.

And New Order practically defined the genre, albeit reluctantly. The disco hits \\"Perfect Kiss\\" and \\"Sub-Culture\\" were the singles, but the rest of the album is woven together by darker textures. The album is bookended by happy yet sad tracks. The fateful \\"Love Vigilantes\\" and the hateful yet poppy \\"Face Up\\". Much of the rest of the album brings together synthesizers with Peter Hook's urgent bass and fuzzed guitar hooks.Repeated synths become hypnotic in the mournful \\"Elegia\\" and the unknown gem of \\"This Time of Night\\". This track shows how New Order could weave all their elements into one cohesive amazing song. Also a standout is the more rocking \\"Sunrise\\" which hints at similar material from the upcoming Brotherhood.This album is very dear to me being my first New Order album. This one belongs in everyone's collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book 2 not available in Kindle for USA customers","review":"Do not buy the Kindle version of this book if you live in America, as book two of this series is not available for purchase by Americans (although I'm baffled as to why books one and three are available to us).

The world she has created, Valdemar, is interesting and exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent beginning to a new series","review":"Having already read the previous works, including the slightly disappointing Winds trilogy, I must admit that Mercedes Lackey has successfully drawn new inspiration, and created a series equal to her Arrows and Last Herald Mage trilogy.As you follow the adventures of Karal, a secretary to the Karsite envoy, you are granted a glimpse into the life of a Karsite as well as the troubles of adjusting in a foreign land.Also, we glimpse a quick look at the Eastern Empire, a mysterious empire in the far east that has been hinted about, but never before shown.On the whole, it is a wonderful and clearly well written work by a great author, and I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Version","review":"This is a fine tale ruined by a craptastic scan. There are many typos, garbled words and phrases, and even missing text.

I read about the Ma Sharda Youth Choir and was shocked to find out that all of the children were born and raised outside of India, yet they sing as if they have been singing in Hindi their whole lives.As always, Rajasree is a pleasure to listen to. This is her fifth album I have bought from Amazon.com after Man Mandir, Shurer Dhara, Moksha and Pyara Bharat. She seems to be getting better with every album.I had never heard of Shubhayan Entertainment before I started buying Rajasree's albums and now that I have five of this new record label's CDs, I am sure this is a label to watch out for in the future. All the CDs designs and graphics are unusually beautiful and even the actual CD face is so vibrant.I have decided that any albums released by Rajasree Mukherjee and produced by Shubhayan Entertainment are worth buying as they make such a wonderful combination."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting and worthwhile read","review":"As its title suggests, this is an alternate history which reads like a history book text rather than a novel, based on the theme that the South won the American Civil War (\\"The War for Southern Independence\\"). No spoilers here, but the book is about evenly divided into how the South wins the Civil War, and the aftermath.The distinguishing characteristic of this text is its optimism. Despite the division of what is now the USA, this book speculates that there would have been prompt reconciliation and a close feeling of kinship between the CSA and USA. Perhaps this would have been so. One likes to think so.This one appears to have been thoroughly researched, and the alternate-history actions and speeches by the key figures (i.e. Robert E. Lee, JEB Stuart, \\"Confederate President Woodrow Wilson\\") and many others) are realistic, and in fact are great fun. As is this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent alternate history","review":"Drawing on real events and real people, the author presents a concise and believable synopsis of what could have been if the South had won. He is sensitive to the emotions and motivations of those on both sides of the conflict while recognizing the mistakes and errors in judgment that led to it. Likewise, the relationships between the three nations (USA, CSA and Republic of Texas) in the aftermath are realistic and believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice quick read for those interested in \\"What ifs\\"","review":"I read this book in no time at all and found it interesting. Apparently this is one of the first \\"alternate history\\" fiction, though it reads more like a college history paper. I actually enjoyed this style alot and would love to see a more detailed version. I don't know if I follow the logic of every path Kantor takes, and I hate how some things happen at the exact same time as in real life only in a different places (Lincoln shot on same day, at same play, only in Chicago, for example - Turtledove's alternate history Lincoln is much more interesting). All in all, it is was a nice little book. Perhaps the lesson is how small events can really change things - in this case, a horse riding accident and generals following orders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Little Book","review":"A surprisingly upbeat effort to view the ramifications of a different result to the War of Northern Aggression, this book is worth reading more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a child's book","review":"No clue in the review that this is a child's book.

Instead of going to sleep, they tried to find ways to stay awake ~~ like painting word pictures, counting sheep and other things. It is a nap-time book ~~ perfect for my little boys who also don't like to take naps. It's a great book ~~ full of bright and colorful pictures.

SVR 08 was kind of a let down because is when thq started to incorporate the fighting abilitys for the wrestles and end up not feeling as good as previous games,.SVR 09 Well although it was the begining of something promising it was also not as good as wwe here comes the pain.SVR 10 again not as good as WWE shout your mouth even so that I like it the best from todays WWE games ( WWE 12, SVR 11)on difrent consoles.So give WWE here come the pain a shot and enjoy playing as Goldberg, Scott Stainer, Kevin Nash, Brock Lesnar, RVD, Kurt Angel, so enjoy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgia!!!!!","review":"I was at my local game store today looking for a game almost got another game when I came across this one put the other game back and got this got home and started playing reminded of when it first came out this game feels its age coming down on it but I have to admit it,has the best roster of wwe games I mean goldberg, the rock, stone cold and various other wrestlers I grew up watcthing. That alone made me enjoy it plus the gameplay is very good for a game from 2003 season mode is better than road to wrestlemania any day and I've played every wwe game out there and must admit this is the best one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Back to Shut Your Mouth","review":"Season mode is hard as all hell. If you are a challenger, you start with no Specials while th Champ has 1 or 2. It only takes that many to beat you. Also,one time Ihad to team with Tazz(IC CHAMP)To face Bret Hart and Ultimate Warrior with both of mine and Tazz's singles titles on the line. That makes no sense having any singles belts up in any type of tag match. Needless to say we lost the match and I was not the one pinned. All match tyoes really hard and the legends are so lame. If you want a game that you can actually put up offense in play WWE RAW 2 for X-BOX. RAW 2 blows this game out of the water no matter what. This game is highly overrated and you should go back to playing SD!SYM because HCTP is boring. I for one am glad Hogan and Jeff Hardy are not in this game. Oh and people, you are not Snoop Dogg and you never will be.So lets just put a stop to that right now. The A.I. is screwed up. As for the B & P matches, they are overrated, just like this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD AND IMPROVED GAME","review":"For all of you who don't like this game for minor reasons you are wasting time with your lame reviews. ALL I CARE ABOUT IN A GAME IS GAMEPLAY EVERYTHING ELSE IS ALMOST SECONDARY. THE GAMEPLAY IS DEEPER AND MUCH BETTER THAN MOST OTHER WRESTLING GAMES MADE WITHIN THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS, PLUS THE DETECTION FOR DAMAGE ADDS REALISM TO THE MATCHES LIKE IN NO MERCY. I don't care for the company anymore but the games are still decent and improving. If you have small problems outside of the gameplay then thats your problem because THAT IS THE REASON I BOUGHT THIS GAME."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smackdown 5","review":"Smackdown5 Hree comes the pain will b the game of the year and the best wrestling game ever it beats anyother game out if ur gonna buy only one game this year buy Smackdown 5 Here Comes The Pain NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SMACKDOWN5","review":"THis game is gonna rock!!!!!!Buy it definitly!with over 55 superstars, u will not get bored with this game.With the Elimanation chamber and bra and panties and first blood mathes this game will be the best wrestleing game ever.It is just like NO MERCY for N 64 but with better graphics.this game is gonna have the legends,but the one I will play the most is the OLD SCHOOL UNDERTAKER!BUY this game it is not a waste of money.I pre-ordered it all ready.I can't wait anymore for it.So buy it definitly"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Game is #1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This game is so sweet.

The Wresteling Has come Back To SmackDown!","review":"I enjoy Wresteling games alot, and this one was just a little treat to my craving for a good wresteling game. Lately, the wresteling genre has been somewhat boreing and repeative until now. SmackDown! Here Comes The Pain has hit shelves! This game is by far the most fun wresteling game to hit stores sence No Mercy, and by george it's about time!Within this fun game, you can have several options of what to do, many of which are new. You can do first blood matches for those who like to watch each other bleed. Or for those men (or women)who like to see girls rip each others clothes off and go at it, the bra and panties matches may somewhat satisfy you. Or you could simply just go to season mode and enjoy the great story it has in store for you. But either way you fold it, this game is by far the best wresteling game in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pain is here","review":"Previous Smackdown games had easier controls and fast-paced gameplay but this one complicates the grappling and reverse controls, which can wear on your fingers over time. There is a pain meter which makes high falls and injured regions of the body more realistic than the previous games in the series. There are few high profile legends in this game like Jimmy Snuka, the Road Warriors and Sgt. Slaughter. The CAW is not much different from last year's game and the season mode lasts for only a year but has an easier way to talk to superstars backstage. The elimination chamber is good but the bra and panties match becomes redundant after a few times. It is the best wrestling game on the market right now but that is not saying much if you played the ones for the other systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"dated theories that aren't accepted today","review":"Andrew Lang was a brilliant polymath who is best known for his work in folklore and anthropology. His collections of fairy tales remain staples of children's literature, although his theoretical works (including this one) are no longer widely read. He followed the then-current theory of cultural evolution, which assumed that it was possible to understand the irrational elements of folklore by finding similar examples in the cultures of modern \\"primitive\\" (i.e., not-19th century Victorian) societies. This theory has long been discredited, and therefore the value of the book is limited for modern readers--thus the 1 star rating. The book is worth reading, however, if you're interested in 19th century theories about folklore and cultural evolution, Although I've given it a 1 star rating, it would earn 5 stars if looked at in relation to the intellectual currents of its time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for budgies","review":"The treats are too hard for a budgie to eat.

Since they wouldn't take it from my hand, I laid a \\"banana\\" on the cage floor. Nothing doing.The next day I just placed a treat in their food dish. Again they wouldn't touch it.Finally I smashed a Birdie Banana to smithereens between two metal spoons and put the pieces in their food dishThis time they did eat some of the treat, a good thing because I was worried that I had wasted a dollar.Having to resort to such measures defeats the purpose of having a separate, special treat though.I had thought of hanging a treat on one of the cage bars but these treats are mighty small and they come with no hangers.The package says that Birdie Bananas have a taste that birds can't resist. Mine have done a pretty good job resisting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Birdies bananas","review":"The bird did not like these; not at all.

My favourite thing about the story was the the relationships bw Mke and his dad, the women in his life...and the decision points throughout the book - not to mention the touch of mystery that snakes into the plot. I'm a fan of Price, Selby, Hamil, Auster....this work definitely ranks, and borrows from a solid tradition & genre in writing while establishing its own voice. Engaging writing style.

However, it is an edition from the early 1970s and that renders it practically useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Words into Type with a question","review":"I find this book dated in terms of computer standards and terminology. What is the LATEST version of this? Is it 1974 as previous reviews indicated?How do I find this out? Someone reviewed the Prentice-Hall updated version and found it much poorer than the original. What is the date of that Prentice-Hall version?Is this book out of print as another editor recently told me?We are trying to decide on a standard style guide for our company documentation. I don't want to pick this guide if it is out of date or out of print."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the Best","review":"Granted, the most recent edition came out in 1974, but Words Into Type is still the reference I turn to first with grammar and usage questions. (For style, I keep the NY Times Manual of Style and Usage handy.) Unlike the Chicago Manual of Style, WIT has a usable index that must have been put together by a mind-reader. It's organized the way people think and usually anticipates the form my bewilderment will take: Does \\"what\\" take a plural or singular verb? The answer's under \\"what\\" in the index. Should I say \\"as if it was\\" or \\"as if it were\\"? Look under \\"If clauses.\\" Is it different from or different than? The index leads me right to my answer. I wish the editors would come out with a new edition, but for now I'm loyal to the increasingly ancient Third."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most outdated grammar book in existence!","review":"Don't waste your money on this one. I used this book back in the early 80s when I was in college, so I can say from experience that much has changed in the 27 years since this book was last published. Many of the standards are no longer the same. A much better reference for people who want to be up on the current trends in grammar and editing is the Microsoft Manual of Style. It's one of the most easy-to-use references out there. Also, the Chicago Manual of Style is a good reference source, even though it's a little cumbersome and sometimes hard to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"The content is probably great, the layout definitely poor.","review":"The content of this book is probably great. The earlier edition was. I first came across the second edition of \\"Words Into Type\\" when I was in the final stages of editing my first book. What a relief! It answered questions I didn't even know I had. So I bought the new, revised, third edition, sight unseen. It would be at least as good as the old one, right? Wrong. It was an expensive mistake. Prentice-Hall managed to take a great book and make it poor. The print is too small, they put an extra wide margin on the outside with too little margin on the inside, jamming the words into the middle of the book. A poor excuse for a serious reference work. The content of this book deserves better.Sue Robishaw, ManyTracks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old but definitely not obsolete","review":"I can only agree with what other reviewers have said. This book is a classic that far outstrips Chicago Manual of Style for ease of use. An updated version would be wonderful (provided the people doing the updating did as good a job as the original writers did), but in the absence of a new version, I'll happily go on using this one. One of the things I like best is that locating information in it always seems easy. This makes a lovely change from Chicago Style."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Arrived quickly.

It E","review":"Book lacks structure, and is therefore very difficult to read. Author jumps from subject to subject without warning, and provides unnecessary details on irrelevent topics.

Definately not a test-prep book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Piece of Junk for Exchange","review":"This is my last Microsoft exams (completed EVERY MCSE exams , SMS, SNA, IIS, etc) and since the initial books for NT looks OK, I decided to take a look at this book for exchange. Conclusion, the publisher has gone way off his bonker to release this junk. Since then, I have look at the rest of the series and the only books of any standards are the initial NT Server and NT WKS exams crams, the rest stinks. Trust me, I've done ALL the exams cover by EXAM cram without using any except this and it sucks. The only books worst than this is the \\"DUMMY\\" series !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong answers and inaccurate information","review":"As an experienced Exchange Admin who is just brushing up on a few points for the exam, it would seem a book touting itself as an \\"Exam Cram\\" would be just the ticket. What a disappointment. It took me only about an hour with this book to cast it aside. It offers wrong answers to test questions, along with a lot of poorly written questions that are nothing like the actual exam. When I see such low regard for accuracy with the things I'm familar with, I can't trust the rest of the material. As for being a reference for day-to-day use, as some other reviews suggest, that's a joke. There isn't enough depth.The Sybex book on this is good for brushing up on areas like the silly MS Mail Connector that MS still pounds you on. Trancender is still the best for exam simulations. As for day-to-day admin, nothing beats TechNet and the MS Knowledge Base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Use as a Stand-Alone Study Reference","review":"I realize that one must read a multitude of books on a topic to become well read in that subject, but this book is a definite waste of time. I can only say that I spent most of my time reading the Sybex Exchange Server 5.5 book and I received a 900 on my test the first time.

Generally they are very good. My strategy has been to use a study guide to study the material and to follow this up with the Cram. I have found that even if I dont quite know all the material in the study guide, I can do well on the tests if I know the material in the Cram. This was not the case with Exchange 5.5. I recommend the Sybex book instead or in addition to the Cram."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy if you want to pass.","review":"This is a horrible book for studying for the exam. If you study this book alone, you are guaranteed to fail. I made that mistake, and I hope this review prevents any of you from making the same mistake. The book will probably be helpful for on-the-job use, but if you are studying this book in hopes to pass the exam, look elsewhere.

SAD!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of the Worse","review":"To me, this whole series has been nothing but a disappointment. From the disorganization to the exceptional number of errors, this book here was the straw that broke the camel's back. It was overloaded with material cut and pasted from the NT Server book. It had excessive amounts of drivel heavily loaded on the client side. The Exchannge Server specific stuff looked as if it were directly lifted from the Trasncender questions.

Indeed, the Tom I remember probably didn't even have to act very much for this movie. (He's obviously grown up a bit since this was filmed).Anyhow, this a charming film. The real message for most of us is to try to look at the world - at least on occasion - with the eyes of a child. See the absurdities and laugh at what is genuinely funny. And, most of all, eat those minature corn cobs just like a big corn on the cob."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's with the blurb?","review":"This is a great movie, but to put the line \\"Hanks has never been better\\" on the cover is a terrible insult to an actor who's done ENORMOUS things since then.Other than that, a great flick with a superb transfer.

As aboy he makes a wish in front of a carnival fortune-telling machine to be big, and his wish is granted (physically but not mentally). He goes on a search to find the machine to change the wish; in the meantime he gets a job with a toy company. Basically the movie then becomes one long joke about a \\"child\\" in the adult world, but it tends toward other issues, too - the loss of innocence and that surface honesty that is so prevalent in childhood and then disappears in adulthood. Hanks, of course, is a hit at the toy company (what 13 year old wouldn't be?). But he falls in love with a co-worker, which makes the decision to go back to 13 again at the end more heartrending. Hanks is very good in this child's role. Worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Fun and A Message, too!","review":"A story of a young boy who has the chance to do what most of us all wish we could do - be a grown-up for a day.

How fun it would be to be a grown up.In Big we see the real bond of two young boys and how wonderful it is to be a child and have a best friend. It's heart-touching and lots of fun, too. Living the high life of making toys and having secretaries takes a toll on the best of friends. Oh how we know a busy grown-up schedule pulls us apart from the people we love - mom, dad, friends...Business success can beat you up, too.

Anyhow, the movie is wonderful and funny and very entertaining. I forgot how GOOD Tom Hanks is in this movie which could have very well been a bomb.The DVD has nothing new to offer except for the original trailer and a few cast fimographies. I would have liked an audio commentary by Penny Marshall (this being, after all, the first movie directed by a woman to gross 100 million at the box office), or at least a \\"making of\\" feauturette (The internet movie database says that Marshall filmed the adult sequences with a young Josh first so that Hanks could see how a child would ineteract in his place).Still, for the low price of this DVD, it is a bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a great movie!","review":"If you are thinking of watching this with kids under 10 think twice.

This game, 4 console generations down the line has the exact same sentiment, just grandly visualized in the most enriching bling I never imagined. I like things simple, unless people do things fantastically well in a fashion I could never imagine, in which case they can go to town and Treasure did just that.Fantastic title for any gradius fan, far better than bashing a historical relic around in an emulator."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF PETERSON'S BEST ALBUMS","review":"The whole album is outstanding. Nigerian Market Place is an absolutely breathtaking composition and performance by Perterson. It is both mysterious, hot, swinging. It starts and finishes quietly, but what an adventure in between ! This is powerful. All other traks are excellent. Au Privave is great. A very swinging and powerful piece is Peterson's performance of Nancy with the laughing face (please note that on the cd cover they made a mistake between this piece and the medley with Waltz for Debby, so Nancy... is #4 actually). To close the album, one of Peterson's bests performances of You look good to me. A real 5 star CD you must have. And what an energyser! The same kind of energy as in the album Walking the Line, reissued in the album TWO ORIGINALS. This Nigerian Market Place album is everlasting gold you will not regret."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL!","review":"This book. . . I can go on and on and on about this book.

As I got to reading it, I found that it was not as good as I had hoped. Imagine having an 11 year old cousin who won't stop talking about stupid ninja daydreams that he had while at school. That's about what we're dealing with here. It was mildly amusing and clever at times, but ultimately left me so disapointed that I threw the book away.If you are an adult and looking for a good read from the humor section, I'd suggest \\"The Alphabet of Manliness\\" (Maddox) or \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" (Max Brooks). Both are extremely entertaining and a far better way to spend your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for anyone over 12","review":"This book was either written by a teenager or an adult that never grew up.

This morning I ate mixed fruit and had a pack of twinkies. I chased it all down with some Nestle quick chocolate milk, the fat free kind. I think its weird that the Nestle chocolate milk has an expiration date that is like 2 months longer than the dates on regular milk. I want to go to the beach, that would be nice.

It is like Catcher In The Rye for people who love ninjas. It is not for everyone but is a must read for males between 18 and 35. Robert Hamburger has not only created a book and a website but an entire mythology including his own critics. His suposed hatemail beats his real critics to the punch by pointing out the absurdity of his claims.

I got the book expecting a literal copy of the website, a coffeetable book visitors could laugh at. However, when I started reading through the book, I saw my favorite pages, but while I read I noticed a much darker undertone, one that tells a story of a boy for whom ninjas are an escapist fantasy where he can run away from his horrible home life, his lack of friends and generally his alienation from the world, where he is a ninja and his hyperactive tendencies become not irritating and unmanageable, but totally sweet.While the website is all about Robert's view of ninjas, this book is most definitely not about ninjas.

I can only pop one while the show is on but I'm sure I'll have more by the end of the book. If you don't like read this book you must be a ultimate idiot or your poor.

Those punk kids down the street had ganked it along with a big potted cilantro plant.Using the basic Ninja skills that I had learned in the first 30 pages I quickly grabbed a machete and started down the street totally freaking out. When I got to the end of the block I found those punk kids but they were already toasted.Reading that book for 5 minutes made them so pumped that they died.

I have read the website and found everything from the hate mail to the seppuku methods to be hilarious, but after going through the book, the joke became a bit tired.

And another thing ninjas do not flip out. I dont think Robert Hamburger could track anything down like he says he can except for a can of crisco and a blow-up doll.This book is terrible for filling up our children's minds with this junk. He should just move to France and get out of here. Fujita and Pirates are way better than him. Join me in asking Amazon to take this book off their site!

We took the camera to Mexico for 9 days and using the camera everyday we never had to recharge it. We actually used it for a few days after we got back as well.

He became extremely frustrated because he wanted the cards to stay whole, and the pieces simply wouldn't do so. Which caused him to not want to play with the cards, and so made them useless as a learning tool. He had been so excited initially.

He loves to chew and sometimes gets sick eating too many rawhide treats. He loves his stuffed toys, but hates anything with a squeaker. If it squeaks, it must die. So, the first thing I did was remove the squeaker from the inside lambskin bag. I replaced the empty bag inside the bear, secured the Velcro and gave the bear to Buddy. The first thing he did was begin to chew on the Velcro closure. within 20 minutes he had the Velcro ripped off one side and was chewing up the inside bag. I have now replaced the empy bag and sewed the back shut with a strong twine. I give this toy about another hour or two and it will be ready for the trash. I wish someone would make stronger toys for dogs that do not have squeakers but are designed for chewing. Maybe they could use a tough canvas or something.

Each page is a double column, with the JST on the left-hand column, and the KJV version on the right-hand column. Be cautious--sometimes Jospeh Smith only corrected the punctuation in a verse.It has introductory essays about how we got the Joseph Smith Translation.

If most people will talk about the beauty appearances of the actress and actor or the island and the lagoon, I prefer to look deeper than the skin. This movie proposes us the new meaning of civilized and civilization. While most people think that civilized people come from the high civilization, this movie proves the contrary. From the story, we can conclude that advanced civilization does not always produce civilized society. In fact, the modest, or even somewhat primitive main characters are able to show the real meaning of civilized people; respect and love each other, keep the friendship alive, avoid the actions leading to conflict, and live harmoniously with nature.

If you're interested in the story of a very unique man, this is a good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good biography for the mathematically disinterested","review":"Ramanujan was a mathematician in Euler's class, that is the sort of mind you see once a century. For those interested by his life in India and at Cambridge University, this book explains the ins and outs of his existence quite well, and a bit else as well.Unfortunately those with a genuine interest in his work really will never get much further than realizing that he was incredibly gifted; perhaps his work was too complicated to describe; perhaps the author didn't want to sacrifice a good narrative to tedious equations.I'd recommend this book to students keen to read about the life of a mathematician, but not necessarily to those trying to get a grasp of Ramanujan's legacy as a mathematician."},{"rating":"2","title":"It covers every second of Ramanujan's life","review":"It is a superb biography, can as well serve as a guide to S.India and Cambridge.It is amazing to see that Kanigel has presented the lifestyle of S.Indians in all its details. No book has been written in India on an Indian mathematician giving utmost attention to even trivial details. The best biography I have ever come across."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ramanujan = combo of Galois and Abel ?","review":"I don't know much about orchestral music, but it should be the way \` what instrument is to music..Ramanujan was to maths '"},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"I think the worst book on mathematics or mathematicians I have read. The reader would have some knowledge, perhaps to the 9th grade, but is informed what a coefficient is, that the denominator is 'the number on the bottem'! Functions of interest to Ramanujan are mentioned but never adequately specified. Similarly for theorems. The author seems uncomfortable with mathematics.The reader comes away with the sense of great things done but no idea of what they were.This book is a read only for those interested in cataloging the faults of sloppy 'scientific' writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and difficult prose style","review":"Probably an exciting life; however, it refers back to pre-war I as a begining, seems very old, and is a terribly long book with a very old fashioned, boring writing style. Probably it should serve as THE source book, but for more ordninary people like me (Psychologist with some knowledge of, and interest in ,the history of Mathamatics) this needs to be re-written as a briefer edition( based on the above) by a Reader's Digest Editor. Martin J.Kaplan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This is an amazing book about an amazing man, just reading about him makes most math geniuses feel like a complete idiot. If Ramanujan had a proper education in the field, he could have become the greatest mathematician of his time, even greater than Hilbert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call Me The Sponsor...","review":"I LOVE THIS SCENT!I figured the scent wouldn't be as heavy considering the fact that I know that Beyonce is allergic to perfume.

Only got this movie because it was supposedly filmed in Lawerence, Kansas. Unfortunately, it was filmed way out in the boon-docks of Lawerence, and that was maybe the first 15 minutes.

It has been used and some of the tie down rings on it were rusted and there is a ripped spot in a couple of places but still holds air. We were also short the tie downs and we had to go but more tie downs after spending this high dollar price on this item and it will not stand up straight after blowing up, you have to prop things around it to keep it upright. Very disappointed in this item for the amount of money we spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copyright 1978? It's 2001, and it shows in this book.","review":"This book covers several areas about guitar repair, but only vaguely. It does not go into details that are needed before even trying most repairs. I was hoping to find help on removing binding and fingerboards to replace a truss rod. It touches in these areas, but that is all it does. I still have no clue. I already know the board and binding needs to come off, but how? Not enough info to even try attempting this feat.The book is 23 years old. Something that is not shown on the Amozon.com site before buying it. If you buy this book you're reading history, not up to date facts needed for guitar repair. This is more a reference book from the 60's and 70's and not a repair book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completelym undisputed guide","review":"This guide is the most needed, useful, great helper and bible for the guitar repair and maintenance. I had already browsed it once or twice and been advised with some tips from people who had it or read it.

It is a 3 LP set. This CD is only part of the second and third LP in the set. The first LP is the Jazz At The Philharmonic All Stars. The second LP is the Oscar Peterson Trio and the Gene Krupa Trio. The third LP is Ella Fitzgerald. It's too bad they didn't release the entire set on a 2 CD set. I can't comment on the concert itself, since I'm just discovering it myself. From what I've heard so far, it is a remarkably clean recording. The liner notes, which are extensive, indicate that this was a very well received concert of some historical significance. It was one of the first American Jazz tours to Japan after World War II."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD - defective","review":"The actual content of the video is great but the DVD stopped in the middle and doesn't play.

The people are so real its incredible. The way that Robert Coram describes the roads and the places in his book will give you goose bumps, because you can remember that corner at Peidmont and the way that Manuels looks and all the law enforcement officers that freuqent it and the knowledge of how the Atlanta Homocide Detectives wear only a certain type of hat, its uncanny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Stupid","review":"This is an unbelievable book. I can't believe that a detective would blab everything to a reporter. Although the author is african american, he paints a very small minded view of african american males. He makes his males always trying to get the big break from \\" the man\\". They all lust after white women, they respect their mothers and hate their fathers. I did not find that out to around the end of the book. You really don't know much about the main character at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only have one, this is it","review":"This volume contains all Luther's prefaces to the books of the Bible and therefore is a great reference to have.

This volume (48 pages) contains an excerpt from the book written by Jonathan Bresman. It also contains concept sketches, storyboards and full color illustrations by various artists, among them Doug Chiang, depicting scenes and characters from the movie Episode I: The Phantom Menace.From the preface: \\" This book offers a behind-the-scenes look at the lengths the art department went in its construction of George Lukas' universe. The evolutionary stages for each major character, vehicle, and planet are displayed so that the reader can get a sense of how the film was painstakingly sculpted, and finally, how a new style of filmmaking was founded.\\"This excerpt focuses on how sketches combine and evolve in the development of ideas into the final concepts for characters and other elements in the film.Staple bound. A Del Ray Book; Ballantine Publishing Group."},{"rating":"2","title":"No McQuarrie, and yet an awesome art of Star Wars Book","review":"I loved the art Ralph McQuarrie did for the first three Star Wars movies, and in the Art of Episode I, Doug Chiang takes the torch and does an awesome job. His grand scale works are so appealing and detailed, I loved it.The character concept work in intriguing, there is a lot of evolutionary type paintings which I like a lot. The Sith work is fascinating.The one draw back to the book was the lack of explaination each work had. I would have liked more insight as to what the artist was thinking, what Lucas liked and what he disliked. That wasn't in this version as much as I would have liked. But overall, one to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inside look at film design at its best","review":"This book is a must have for all serious Star Wars fans or anyone interested in film design. The book chronicles the design evolutions of all the major characters, vehicles, sets and props that were integral to the storytelling in The Phantom Menace. Star Wars fans will no doubt enjoy the 'what-could-have-beens' implied by the illustrations and discussions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely breathtaking","review":"I got this book when it first came out, and read every page before dawn. Doug Chiang's illustrations are outstanding, possibly better than McCreary's (is that possible) for the original trilogy. The rest of the illustrators are great in their own respects. Each page is full of original sketches (the first Darth Maul, beautiful), city layouts, and production paintings. A true gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to a Must Have","review":"The book is fabulous for anyone who likes to see the way ideas come together in the pre-production process of a movie or who adores the Star Wars Saga. Fabulous drawings and paintings bring The Phantom Menace to life in this book.However, saying that, there is one qualm I have about this book. That is the very little amount of background descriptions regarding the images; though that now seems to be because of their relationship to Episode II. Apparently, George Lucas has gone back to some of the discarded designs of The Phantom Menace and reused them in Episode II. Most notable are the \\"Solar Ship\\" which has become Count Dooku's Interstellar Sail Ship, the original concept art for the Neimoidians which have now become the Battle Droid creators known as the Geonesians, and some of the Queen's Starship which have become the Senatorial Starship.I highly recommend this book, even with the lack of descriptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISLEADING!!!","review":"Here is what I have ordered: \\"Product Details: Hardcover: 224 pages....\\"(from the description), I had taken that book from the library in the past and had a good idea of what I was looking for.

And it's not even new!The bottom line is: WRONG BOOK!!!The Art of Star Wars, Episode I - The Phantom MenaceVery misleading and annoying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not as good as other Star Wars Art of books","review":"I must say that the paintings were fantastic and the conceptual drawings were excellent. The only problem was that I didn't see nearly the range of work from the film that I saw in the other Art of Star Wars books! Also the artwork in the book had been seen many times before on the official website and in the Episode 1 Insiders Guide CD-rom. In fact the CD-rom had more artwork on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good as the hype","review":"No one comes close to the artwork of Ralpf McQuarrie. The art in this book was good overall, but not worth all the hype it is recieving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware this is the 44 page excerpt book","review":"Sellers are using this page to sell a book that is actually titled: THE ART OF STAR WARS EPISODE I: an excerpt of the book written by Jonathan Bresman. The ISBN matches this work, which is only 44 pages in length and was given away with the purchase of a VHS version of the Phantom Menace. The way Amazon lists this book can be misleading because they refer to it as the paperback edition in the review which claims it is a massive volume with over 600 illustrations. They are actually referring to another edition of the book... the TRADE PAPERBACK EDITION. This error has caused me a lot of fuss with two of the used book traders here at Amazon.

For the past 6 years I have been using this series of books for my children with great results. My children enjoy the books too. They are no nonsense, simple books with no twaddle. I highly recommend them. There are two years in each book, so Book 2 covers 5th and 6th grades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passion Wins Over the Bottom Line","review":"Although the setting in the 1950s (my guess is 1951 since it matches that calendar), the passion for the good of the company, its employees, and legacy extends beyond just the financial \\"bottom line\\" of success. This book portrays that well. It's refreshing as well as a reminder that such approach can still hold true in corporations of the 21st century. Both the movie of the same name and the book are worth seeing and reading.If there was any downside in the book it's that the author dwells a bit too long on the past -- a background story on nearly all of the characters in the story. The climax of the story however is worth the wait. Going to work may not be the same anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"An engrossing story about how business operates, the talents needed to run a successful business, and the suspense and difficulty that ensue when the head of the company suddenly dies. Portrays the multiple talents necessary to run a business: intellectual, artistic, analytic, etc. There should be more such stories to show people the honor of business and capitalism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective.","review":"I cannot take the recommended dosage, 1 cap 2x a day, because of digestive upset.

Thought I'd give it a try. Personally, the reaction wasn't what I was looking for. Too hormonal (As if we ladies don't have enough of that to deal with). It was like a major emotional PMS moment. Oh well on to the next one to try and see if its any good. Can't hurt to try right?

That worked fine for a while, but on the 4th or 5th time it started flashing all the lights, then they all went out. It now no longer works.

The motor sounds like a power drill is operating it, and the wire rope does not look like it will hold up for long.Because of where the trigger control is located, the operator will have to be right up to the work, and if something is lifted, be on a ladder over the work.

Before I got this puller I had to make 5 or 6 trips up the stairs to the kitchen loaded down with grocery bags when my wife did the weekly shopping. And because I work at home, I couldn't hide when she pulled into the driveway. My only option was to 'be on an important call' and wait it out. A dirty trick, and one that only works once or twice.I considered several solutions, including having a dumbwaiter installed. I even priced out an elevator (ok, so I'm lazy). Ultimately, instead of spending thousands, I bought this puller and rigged it up as a hoist from the third floor deck to bring the groceries (in a plastic storage bucket) from the car trunk up to the kitchen/dining room deck on the second floor. Instant sky hook that goes back into the closet when it's not in use!Works fine, fun to operate and may have saved my marriage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works excellent for car trailer with replacement cord","review":"We purchased this for our shop to use to put two cars into our race trailer. We needed something that could be moved around vs a single fixed winch. We attach this to a d ring on the floor and pull our cars in. Works great we have used it for a couple of years now with many many loading sessions. We have used this thing with shore power and our Honda eu2000i generator no problem.One modification we recommend straight away is to get a 4x4 shop to make you a 50' nylon ATV winch rope for it. This allows us very easily to pull for 50' and the nylon easily fits on the drum. The nylon rope is easily rated higher than the winch. Plus if it snaps there is no energy in it so its safer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't spend your money on this!","review":"Purchased several years ago.....right out of the box it made more noise than a chain saw, but seemed to work o.k.

Took to an authorized Warn repair shop as it was out of warranty and learned it needed an entirely new motor, which cost all of about $20 less than a new unit.
