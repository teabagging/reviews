To make matters worse Maya (Alias) is not dual processor aware on the Mac platform, despite claims to the contrary. So everything takes at least twice as long to render no matter what model G5 you buy.

Pluses: The Epson can scan slides and negatives; can scan multiple pix and \\"separate\\" them. Minuses: You press the 'copy' button, and again, and again, cuz you think nothing's happening - then 18 seconds after you pressed it the first time the copy program pops onto the screen (and I have 3Ghz with 1MB RAM)! My wife often crops and resizes her scans, which was a breeze with the software that came with my Acer, but torture with Epson's. She would also 'tile' a portion of a scan to make multiple copies on one page, which the supplied software can't do. And it's twice as noisy and half the speed as my old one with comparable resolution. The price was ok, but now I have to buy third party software to do fairly basic stuff.Needless to say, considering Epson is a big name, and I thought a 5 year newer scanner would be quieter and faster, with good software, I was terribly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death after 3 scans","review":"Initially I was very impressed.

After a half hour on the phone with Epson support, it was determined that it was a hardware issue and I needed to return the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epson 3490 Scanner","review":"As typical from Amazon, delivery was excellent.

A couple of week after I stopped using it, the tingling got considerably less, and then disappeared completely.Being an optimist, I thought maybe it was just a coincidence, and resumed using the comb. After the first night, I experienced facial tingling all over again. Then the following day it got better.

Singal wanders from psychobiography (including some ill-fitting speculation into Faulkner's neurological problems!) to literary analysis to critiques of other Faulkner critics. Singal ends his study when it reaches the midpoint of Faulkner's career, essentially saying that Faulkner did not write anything interesting after 1942 or so--and while this well may be a valid opinion, asserting it without substantiating it is a cop-out. At times I felt I was reading the work of a talented undergrad rather than that of a tenured professor.Readers interested in more rigorous studies of Faulkner's life and works should stick with Blotner's *Faulkner: A Biography*, Brooks's *WF: The Yoknapatawpha Country*, and Frederick Karl's relatively recent *WF: American Writer*."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites recommend it to everyone","review":"This is one of my all time favorite cds and I wish my brother hadn't of borrowed it and lost it for me.

Initially I didn't think it was that special. But over time, it grew on me. The forth song \\"Unbound\\" is particularly good. The fifth song (Sacrifice) is an unusual Indian convict rap that works. Sometimes I use its lyrics in my daily life (if I have to sacrifice some more...) This must be my favorite Robbie Robertson album, because I listen to it more than any of his others.

Robertson is truly an artist of the highest order and unpretentious to boot. I have got to buy Storyville!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was so good until ...","review":"I came to June Calvin not knowing what to expect from her, this being the first book I had read by her.To summarize briefly (without spoilers): the plain sister is the heroine - but the beautiful sister is not jealous, mean, nor petty-spirited. The family are all decent, and thoroughly believable. So is the hero Jack. Jack is brought along as a suitor for the beautiful sister, but as things fall out, he ends up offering for someone else.The problem: at the wedding, things started to go wrong... not just for the unhappy groom, but also for this reader. Reading the last chapter, I felt as if I were reading about a different heroine and a different family from the one I had encountered so pleasantly.Warning: Like Dorothy Mack's MOCK MARRIAGE, read upto about page 200, and then set aside. Contrive a happy ending for the couple then and there, by yourself.Rating = 4.1 ([points lost for hackneyed and out-of-context ending)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is more than just bedroom music!","review":"I will admit it that I, too, bought this CD for the Sunscreen song.

Check out different versions of The Cardigan's \\"Lovefool\\" and Prince's \\"When Doves Cry,\\" and Cyndi Lauper's \\"Time After Time.\\" They give the original songs a run for their money. And the mixture of original tracks infused with remixes is wonderful. One listen to Doris Day's \\"Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps,\\" and you will find the meaning of rejected love! The songs mostly come from the films that Buz directed, Strictly Ballroom and Romeo + Juliet. And if you haven't seen Ballroom, you are missing out!

Deeply cool graduation speech set to funky backbeat provided by Quindon Tarver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should own a copy...","review":"Everyone should own a copy of this album because of the \\"Sunscreen\\" song that Luhrmann wrote like a commencement address. I listen to it at least once a week as a reminder to not lose sight of the forest for the trees. it touches on universal truths that you hope everyone understands. they're so simple, but so important to enjoying life today."},{"rating":"1","title":"a one song CD","review":"I guess I got what I was looking for: the sunscreen song. However, I thought the rest of the CD would have music that wasn't just slapped together from other artists. Even those selections would have been better if more quality artists and songs were selected. I tried to find this in a single song selection but was told that the entire CD was all that was available."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rather inspiring tune...","review":"When I first heard this song it was at work. I work at a very large company that you need to drive your car from place to place, and I had to pull off to the side of the road. The ideas in this song are something we've all heard, just never heard together. I'm sure this song will wear off like all songs do, but this one is a song that you can listen to and still enjoy even if your musical tastes change. I believe it is best suited for when you are feeling overwhelmed, or just plain sad. It will crack a smile on anyone's face regardless of your mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"the cd for the real people in the world","review":"The cd is great. There are many great songs on it, such as: \\"Perhaps Perhaps Perhaps\\". But none of these songs can compare to the \\"song\\" called \\"Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)\\". I know many of you think it despences 7th grade advice, and really isn't worth the $16 or so. But those people need to take a look at their lives, a real close look, because when they do, they will realize that it the advice may be simple but not only is it good advice, but as true as jello is jiggly. I'm not going to sit here and praise it, but I'm saying that it's the only song or \\"song\\" in this world worth its salt. 60 years from now, I'm guessing, that it still will be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everybody's Free to be Talentless Just Like Luhrmann","review":"All that song amounts to is a guy talking over a beat. How deep! The people that actually like/bought this album and like \\"Everybody's Free(to wear Sunscreen)\\" must be incredibly ignorant of what music is. Anybody could make a song like \\"Sunscreen.\\" I don't see what's so hip, cool, or clever about this song. Baz Luhrmann is a disgrace to humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT WORRY, BE HAPPY","review":"brush your teeth -- dont eat red meat -- dont be mean -- pay your bills -- go to church -- pull my finger"},{"rating":"1","title":"Once Again...","review":"I submitted a review stating how much this CD sucks, and it never showed up. Perhaps I was too offensive. Well, once again, THIS CD SUCKS!!!!!!!! There are no \\"songs\\" on this, it's just a bunch of incoherent drivel. I don't understand why people like \\"Sunscreen\\" so much. It's not even a song. I tremble at the thought of music going in this direction. Take advice from a sane person and don't buy this CD. I'd like to add that Kurt Vonnegut (despite what you may have heard) did not write \\"Sunscreen\\". He's a genius, and he wouldn't waste his time.

Baz is great and this album is even greater. On a rainy afternoon, on a sunny lazy day, on your way in to the office - play it wherever and whenever you can - it will give you some laughs, some happy times and most of all - hopefully it will make you think. Keep it up Baz - and visit Australia for even more fun.

How many animations does it take to convey NO information? Apparently, a lot. This documentary consists of little more than image after image -- most of them unimaginative and unenlightening. Do I need to see apples falling on Brian Greene to understand gravity? Do I need to see those apples several times? No. The program is absurdly repetitive, and keeps promising information that it does not deliver. Save your money and read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant Universe is Glitzy","review":"A cleverly done video but I was hoping for more scientific propositions and explanation rather than a glitzy history of the idea.

The DVD was entertaining and the book was just as good. Either separately would of been sufficient. There are lots of good, pretty artwork on the DVD but the artwork really does not help a lot in String and M Theory explanation, but its entertaining. Learned no new information from the DVD after reading the book. The Nova DVD is a little less dry and may keep a casual String and M theory observer interested longer.I rate the DVD a 4 star and Brian's book The Elegant Universe a 3 star. If you prefer watching a movie, plus Brian keeps it a little simpler get the NOVA DVD. If you like reading ( a little harder to understand String and M theory , the 11 dimensions, branes and alternative universes) get the book. Both are recommended but you don't need both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good- Not Great...","review":"It was a great way to think about our universe in a different way than usual, a little repetitive though. Overall very insightful"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant Indeed","review":"The Elegant Universe attempts to give a basic overview of the complex concepts that are string theory. And it succeeds tremendously in this attempt.. It is very well presented and easily understandable even for those with little to no scientific background. The only thing that I was a little disappointed with was all the commercials in between the episodes, hence the 4 stars instead of 5... Overall, its well worth the time and money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING like the book!","review":"Brian Greene has no greater fan (except maybe his mother), and his magnificent book The Elegant Universe is phenomenal. I expected this tape to discuss some of the perplexing issues relating to superstring and M theory. Instead I ended up with something made to appeal to grade school children--lot's of goofy special effects and only the most cursory treatment of the subject. If you expect to learn anything from this video, you'll be bitterly disappointed. The only reason I gave it even one star was because it was nice to actually see and hear the author--a truly brilliant scientist who possesses the rare gift of illuminating complex subjects for the general public. Get the book instead. After you read The Elegant Universe, get his next book, The Fabric of the Cosmos. Forget about this ridiculous, juvenile video. (I do not mean to be nasty--just want to spare other people from the cost and disappointment of this video.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The search for \\"The Theory of Everything\\"","review":"I thoroughly enjoy this video. Having not seen the original release, I was pleased to have the included Einstein videos. As for \\"The Elegant Universe\\", it turns extremely complicated mathematical foundations of past, present and current advancing theoretical physics into visually inspiring explanations that a person who is not an everyday Stephen Hawking can comprehend. However, a person who is not somewhat familiar with these concepts may be completely blown away and may have a hard time believing let alone understanding them. I have read many books relating to the material so it painted a much clearer picture of what I already know. With that said, I recommend this DVD to anyone who has ever questioned the laws governing the existence of everyday natural phenomena as well as the existence of the universe itself, or just curious about physics in general. A++"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even too dumb for a dummy like me!","review":"If you're looking for a \\"String Theory for Dummies\\" type documentary, keep looking. Long on flashy animations and short on information, this bloated content-sparse snoozer spent most of its time fixed on scientists talking about how they \\"feel\\" about string theory. I kept waiting for Green to get down to business and actually describe some aspects of the theory, but all I came away with were a few underwhelming facts and a case of vertigo. It seemed like every other sentence was some variation on \\"String theory says that the universe is made of tiny vibrating strings.\\" That's a good start, but when it's the only direct fact presented over the course of a three-hour series, we've got problems. I thought my DVD was skipping. This documentary was redundant, visually hideous, uninformative and just a little bit too patronizing. Definitely one to skip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Service","review":"The DVD arrived within the time allotted. The condition was fabulous. Great service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amanda Peet destroys this series!","review":"This series is ruined by the presence of Amanda Peet, a joke of a professor at the University of Toronto.

The quantum world is the doorway to our future. This set is exquisite ! Great for all audiences !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Et tu, NOVA?","review":"Why does every TV documentary made nowadays have to try to look like those crappy Discovery Channel shows? I was so very disappointed in this program. NOVA used to be great, and a friend had told me that this episode was worth watching, but what I found was some interesting facts and interviews ruined by the nauseating repetition of images, the too-quick editing, and the overuse of goofy visual effects and noises that made me give up on the Discovery Channel long ago. What is the point? If I want to have something repeated over and over and over again, I can use my rewind button. But when it's done for me, I have to use the fast forward instead, and that gets really tiresome. If you want an intro to string theory, I'd suggest getting a book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Elegant Univese","review":"The Elegant Universe DVD wasn't trying to be a carbon copy of the book. Its graphics make everyday people understand complextheories, because if you are a physicist or had read lots of String Theory literature or Quantum Physics books and purchase this DVD you are going to be bored because the main idea of the DVD is to educate and reach people that are not that interested in physics or don't have the background to understand the complexities in the book. It is great because simple examples engage and explain its theories and if you want to go deeper you can purchase the book. I noticed that some people were criticizing the repeating parts in the DVD. They may not realize that the DVD was a 3 part presentation on PBS so repetition was required in order to get people who skipped a section on TV up to speed.I really enjoy the DVD set and now I want to read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An innovative concept of the universe!","review":"This set of care and zealously programs is to reveal and inform the great audience (who's not particularly with these concepts) the process of decantation since Newton's gravitational theory, passing through Einstein and the quantum mechanics and the big bang theory about a new concept originally based on a set of transcendental and illuminating mathematical concepts of Euler, carefully analysed and conveyed in order to try unsolved questions between the unification of the electromagnetic theory, gravitational theory and the concepts of two energies located on the atomic level.The string theory has been this outcome.. This new conception is still developing itself but counts with many aspects worthy to remark, and exposed with didactic clarity with easy to follow complex and abstracts ideas.Absolutely recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very repetitive","review":"There is maybe 20 minutes of unique interesting footage in 3 hours of video here. It was unbelievably repetitive. There are definitely some interesting explanations, and the animations were great, but how many times to do we need to see the same animation or quote from a physicist?I kept waiting for it to get into the meat of string theory, and it never did. Obviously the math is very complex, so there's a limit to what they could get into on a TV show. However, all the information given here on the actual theory could be easily summarized in about 5 sentences. 3 hours is a lot to watch for that much information.** Edit: ** To be fair, I watched this on PBS, not the DVD. The PBS version was probably much more repetitive because of segment lead-ins and other promos (\\"Next time on Elegant Universe...\\"). This is probably why I saw the same clips over and over. Still, I stand by my statment that there is very little informaton here. This is nothing more than a teaser on string theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this with Barney the Dinosaur and save!","review":"As a big fan of Brian Greene -- having read both The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos, I thought the DVD would help cement and retain ideas in the book.In fact, there is little if any content. There are, however, lots of pointless, flashy effects that convey no understanding. Lots of cool sound effects, too. Professor Greene jumps through walls and disappears with lots of swooshing noises.Toddlers will be mystified and enchanted by this. It really beats the mobile spinning over the crib."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not \\"Beyond,\\" just repackaged","review":"Like an aging rock band in need of money, PBS took The Elegant Universe and added two second rate documentaries to make it \\"Beyond.\\" The two added disc aren't the worst documentaries I've ever seen, but they are about Einstein and add nothing new to String Theory.

There was little to no useful information & constant repetition of the same interview pieces, historical perspectives & even the exact graphics throughout all 3 programs. I have no more knowledge of any facts behind String Theory than I did before. At best this could have been one glitzy & mostly pointless program .. instead, NOVA gave us 3 full hours that said the same things over & over & over again. With Brian Greene trying his best to be the second coming of Carl Sagan & failing miserably. Clearly a case of the producers stretching out limited content to fill 3 commercial time slots. I expected so much more & will look deeper next time before I buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece !","review":"This is an easy one to rate, for me anyway. The depth and continuity of this 3 part series on a heretofore uncovered topic is excellent.

While taking great liberty in trying to tie Benedict's life in with the other characters by inventing a whole storyline, soap opera style, about St. Benedict prior to his leaving Rome and being a hermit and monk. To me it was degrading to the true story of St. Benedict's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnifica","review":"This is a very touching documentary. Aside, from portraying the daily struggle of the people in Fondwa, it also captures what every Haitians want to do, which is the pursuit of their own progress.I am glad to have seen the whole documentary, and I strongly believe Haiti needs more Road to Fondwa to show to the rest of the world that Haitians are seeking their own solutions to Haiti's illness.Thank you so much for this documentary, and I would recommend with no reserve to anyone interesting in Haiti and its people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great documentary","review":"I was fortunate to see this film at a screening in Los Angeles. The documentary is a great window into the life of those living in Fondwa and the major cities of Haiti. It focuses greatly on the daily struggles Haitain's encounter. It has an uplifting message, urging people to help those in Fondwa not through monetary gains, but by teaching them crafts and farming techniques that will improve their life. As one wise interviewee states, \\"Do not give me a fish, but teach me how to fish.\\" The documentary goes further to illustrate how the people of Fondwa are trying to improve their lives by creating a university and organizing community groups.

As someone who has worked with both development scholars and filmmakers, I am amazed at the skill of Brandon, Schnorr, and McElroy to bring the statistics of development to life in an engaging story that is visually magnificent. The Road to Fondwa has profoundly impacted my impressions of Haiti and is a true testament to the incredible impact that can be made by a few dedicated individuals.

Amazing colors, panoramics, sounds, words, a rocking soundtrack ... and a message that both makes you want to be more involved in development and also makes you believe in the power of the human spirit to work together for change. Kudos to the filmmakers - I think they were wise to realize that the movie wasn't about them - the real story is the strength of the people of Fondwa. They're on a \\"konbit,\\" and it's awesome to see.The filmmakers take you up close without seeming invasive, they inspire you to do something without feeling like the first world is evil, and they are hopeful about Haiti's future without being disingenuous about the challenges. In my view this is the gold standard for a new type of documentary about the developing world. You have to see it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Anime!","review":"This is one of my all time favorite anime. The perfect blend of fun and serious storyline.

I still think its a great metal album although a bit hokey (especially the cover). The production value could be better obviously but there's a great metal spirit in most of the songs and I still listen to this one once in awhile.The biggest influence this album had on me was that I began saying Death to False Metal, Into Glory Ride! all the time.Its written on the album somewhere.The bottom line is that it isn't as good as Iron Maiden but Manowar is a great epic metal band in their own right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manowar","review":"Well, well. What I can say, manowar is actually good metal band, and some composition are really awesome, but lyrics... I'm just getting tired of these lyrics- fight, fight, fight for the metal, fight to be a kings of metal etc. this is sooo immature. It's like a little kid - I want to be a king. Don't get me wrong though, songs like Courage are absolutely amazing. I think these guys need to find a good lyric writer. I gave them 4 starts just because of some crappy lyrics.

While Battlehymns wasn't the greatest metal album ever, it did show a lot of promise for things to come. Unfortunately, this album let me down BIG TIME !! This is one of only two Manowar albums I don't like (Hail to England is the other one.) The songs are chaotic and fail to convey any sort of feeling whatsoever. Listening to this album you get the feeling someone told them they had a week to put their next album together and this is what happened. About the only thing positive about this disaster is that it shows Manowar slowly slipping into their own groove, with songs like Gates of Valhalla and March for Revenge. The lyrics are already at true Manowar ability but the music is a poor excuse for musicianship. If you're looking for true glory, keep riding!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Man, what a joke!!

But this remains a great and dynamic document of a legendary under-recorded unit. Miles is most athletic, and the band just burns. More than once I have had the trippy sensation of listening to this start to finish, and feeling as if the whole thing took 15 minutes. It's pretty staggering and straddles jazz and rock like nothing else I know. This show and one other from the same tour were at one time supposed to be the final project in Sony's amazing archival series of Miles Davis' Columbia work. It's worth 40-50 bucks, if you love Miles Davis, because there are no comparable substitute recordings of this quintet.

I guess I was looking for a sort of signature fragrance, something no one else wore. Recently I was browsing Amazon and noticed Happy was available on sale and thought maybe I should give it another go, despite my desire to find some obscure scent. There is a reason Happy is so well known, it has a pleasing and not-too-strong smell. The smell lingers on my sweaters and jackets, so I do not have to re-apply all the time.

The story goes fairly well until the ending. This is the worst ending I have ever scene in an anime and I've seen a lot. The only reason I gave Sin 2 stars instead of one is for the dub, which brilliantly done, but doesn't make up for the laging story and bad animation.

And when one color runs out, the printer won't work at all. It is very frustrating. And getting to be very expensive.

The pictures are grainy and show the dots. The ink colors on my prints were good but could have been better. Using the special Epson papers, my photographs were still not good due to the graininess. My digital camera is a Canon-7MP so my pictures are good to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW, expensive ink, but good quality","review":"The print quality is good on this machines, it just takes forever to print something. When you turn it on and try to print something it takes a least a full minute maybe longer to warm up before it even starts printing. If you are printing a detailed color job, it then takes a long time to print. For simple black ink jobs, once it is warmed up it is pretty quick. No wireless printing capabilities built in, and difficult to install the drivers if you don't have the disk.The thing I dislike the most is that the ink is really expensive, and you are not able to refill cartridges, you have to buy new every time. I would recommend a different printer.My next choice of printers will be something like theBrother Printer Wireless Monochrome Printer, Dark Grey (HL2280DW). For a comparable price you can get a laser printer, which means it will be way faster, and have wireless networking capabilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper doesn't feed properly","review":"A fine printer- if you don't mind constantly standing over it and sheperding each page of paper into the machine.

The advertised 20 pages or so per minute in black ink on draft mode is really misleading in my opinion because it does not provide a measurement of how fast it will print at a normal resolution.The draft mode printout is very dotty and light, and is not really suitable for anything in my opinion. The next level of print quality (there are 5 levels) takes very long. I think it took about 40 seconds or longer to print a color page. For this reason alone, I give the printer 1 star rating.I personally like the Epson brand and strongly recommend purchasing the next model up, which is the CX4800.I was lucky enought to have a store that was willing to make the exchange without a restocking fee. I am pleased with the CX4800 and it is worth the additional money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very efficient","review":"We've had this printer for almost 2 years.

You might as well throw the whole thing out. It won't register the new cartridge even though it's the correct one. I complained to the company and they sent a replacement ink cartridge, which didn't work and then they sent a new printer, which again only worked until ONE of the initial ink cartridges ran out.

At least with HPs, if I'm out of ink and desperate for a page, I can just pick a color that's still in stock and print with that. Right now, as I sit here with an empty yellow print cartridge and an entirely black-ink project that I'd REALLY like to get done tonight, this is a total dealbreaker for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"spend a little bit more","review":"For a few bucks more you can get a decent 3 in 1 from HP that will probably work better than this.

There are 2 things that really bother me.1. I wanted to be able to scan a page of text and import it into a word processing program, but according to Epson's tech support, you can't do it unless you purchase additional 3rd party sofware...my old HP would scan into MS Word right out of the box.2.

I'm not saying that Congo ruined my life, but I sincerely suspect that it might have.However, it did provide an early credit for Dylan Walsh, who would eventually star in the great show 'Nip/Tuck'. Thus the damage is mitigated slightly, and there can now be some amount of healing. But for some of us, it is too late. Too, too late.Grade: D-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Con-Don't Go","review":"This movie stinks feet.Horrible writing,lousy acting and worst of all,cruddy directing.The ape suits are so bad and cheap they make Roddy Mcdowall look like a endangered species.The 1933 King Kong looked more convincing then the ones in this bullflop.Tim Curry's Romanian accent in this film is hilarious and there should have been a laugh track everything he talked.The only \\"cool\\" things in the movie are Bruce Campbell,Ernie Hudson and the ape-zapper laser gun but it's still not worth it in the long-run.The special effects are just stupid and it's cornballish storylines are just silly & laughable.I give this film a 3 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Of The Worst Movies Ever!","review":"This movie looked and felted like it took about three days to put together. Apes that you don't even see until the last ten minutes of the movie leave bloody trails of uncharismatic actors. This film was a HUGE disappointment.

Felt for the actors having to endure this lousy script, i don't blame them too much, but the filmmaker who should've done better job before releasing it in the first place.yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with the amazon review","review":"Pretty bad that even the company that sells this movie agrees with me...this has my vote as worst movie I've ever seen...hell, at least Plan Nine from Outer Space was fun to poke fun at...this is just...torture!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough Monkey Business!","review":"Everybody say CONGO is a film about scientists find killer gorillas in th rain forest. This is true, but before we get to the psycho monkeys, we have to sit trough hostile militants, the Hungry Hungry Hippos in their cruel retirement, and guys who just get this occasional urge to shoot planes out of the sky with seeker rockets that thwarted with flare guns. The killer gorillas show up in the first five minutes to kill Bruce Campbell (dang you monkeys!) and disappear until the last twenty minutes or so. And this film is 110 minutes.Well, I guess I can't get too angry at CONGO, it at least has decent effect and a few cool action sequences. Those are really the only two good things I can say about this borefest. Stay away unless your a Michael Chritchon completest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Congo goes absolutely Wrongo","review":"A lot of talented people went wrong with this movie. The director is Frank Marshall,who directed Arachnophobia. That movie had genuine suspense and lots of laughs. Congo has neither, except for a few unintentional ones(Tim Curry's accent is unbelievably bad.) The effects person, Stan Winston, is one of the most talented in Hollywood, but his gorillas look just like what they are-men in monkey suits. It takes forever to get to them, and their first appearance is done with one of the most poorly shot and laughable slo-mo scenes ever done for a movie. The composer, Jerry Goldsmith, is one of my favorite movie musicians, but his bongo drums and African chant score is distracting and annoying. The violence is very bloody and brutal for a PG-13movie. In fact, the only reason I'm giving this two stars is the beautiful African setting. Avoid Congo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Congo Schmongo","review":"If monkeys can be trained to do almost anything, do you think they could have written a better script than this schlockly B-movie-style rubbish? Although it's based on another Michael Crichton mega-seller, it borrows heavily from classics like Lost Horizon and King Kong. But woe is us.Despite some breathtaking photography (most of it, by the way, taken in the deepest, darkest reaches of California) filmmakers have only succeeded in making the best 1940s film of 1995. Be very afraid of Congo. When guys in gorilla suits meet laser technology, the result is, in this sorry case, nothing short of banana-brained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilarious...! Oh wait, I'm told it's NOT a comedy!","review":"The very beginning is really quite impressive with the technological wizardry they use, but within 5 minutes the dialogue will have you in stitches. It's so badly written!!! The apes look phony and it's an incredible waste of good actors (Ernie Hudson and Tim Curry who have since registered their embarrassment about making this disaster). Amazing it made as much money as it did at the box office! (Go figure.) Deserves the Razzie Award for the Worst Movie of The Decade!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent enough film","review":"This film story-wise isn't that great or particularly interesting. It has its moments though, especially with Tim Curry in it. I enjoy Laura Linney's work alot so I certainly don't mind watching this film a few more times if just to watch her. I suppose its mildly entertaining, in parts, though the ending was a bit stupid and completely unrealistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most underrated comedy of the 90's","review":"People may make the mistake when viewing Congo in thinking that they are seeing a suspenseful action flick. On the contrary, it is in fact an unintentional jungle adventure spoof comedy. Ernie Hudson is hilarious and delivers great lines such as \\"I'm your great white hunter, though I happen to be black.\\" Tim Curry is hilarious as always. The scene where Hudson, Linney and Curry are bribing the warlord is one of the best comedy scenes of the 90's (Seriously, who doesn't find \\"STOP EATING MY SESAME CAKE!\\" funny?) This movie was misrepresented as a thriller but in reality it is Crichton's successful stab at comedy. I give this funny piece of crap 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure stupidity","review":"This is a complete waste of time to watch. First of all it drags WAY too much, is uninvolving and often boring. Do your brain a favor and stay clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid, boring film - 4.5 out of 10","review":"This film sucks. Almost in a good way, but right when it heats up to hilarious or exciting, it cops out and turns lame again. Ernie Hudson is a good action protagonist, but the filmmakers give the film to some boring and annoying gorilla trainer. Laura Linney is her usual stern and unlikable self. Bruce Campbell has a tiny, but vital part... why didn't they cast him as the trainer? Tim Curry is really great with some of the hammiest acting of his later career.The evil gorillas could have been way better but are kinda creepy at parts. The ridiculous volcano ending is hilariously bad. Overall, this could have been a very good \\"Jurassic Park\\" ripoff, but ends up an embarrasment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie ordered","review":"I have never received the item they charged me for!

The characters played well with and against each other. The plot is more or less tightly woven. I can't find any major bloopers. The setting is authentic. This is a good movie to watch if you are interested in these elements."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun and goofy ride","review":"Come on, this movie isn't so bad. I can name dozens of films that are far, far worse. At least this one is entertaining all the way through, no slow spots, a lot of humor, great scenes in Africa, a talking gorilla, decent cast. What's not to like?Tim Curry and Joe Don Baker overdo it on purpose as the greedy guys who just want diamonds and don't care who dies. Laura Linney sounds like she's on the verge of shrieking and her hair looks perfect even while she's on a safari. Dylan Walsh is very engaging as the scientist with the talking ape, Amy. Grant Heslov is the hapless assistant who is just along for the ride but wants to go home. Ernie Hudson is an interesting guide who turns out to be very resourceful.Don't take it too seriously. Just enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horror Movie with a touch of tenderness.","review":"The horror genere containing \\"far-out\\" monsters give the viewer a true break from \\"reality\\" movie and daily news breaks. This movie inhances that much needed break. It'll make you jump. scream, laugh and cry. It may not be \\"KING KONG,\\" but will give the viewer a full range of emotions. We loved every minute of it in our home, and stll watch it once every ten, or so days, sometimes for the music as well as the \\"jumps.\\" Well written and well-directed, we wish a \\"part two\\" was in the offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explores what could still lie in the most unexplored region","review":"One thing about Congo was that Michael Chrichton explored the idea about the mysterys that still await us in the vast untouched Virunga region of the Congo.

Who knows what could still be lying hiding in the thick vast rainforests awaiting to be discovered by twenty first century man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Join the Amy fanclub","review":"I thought the scene with Amy in the airplane and wanting to booze it up was hilarious.

And Mr. Curry is worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Movie After Reading the Book.","review":"This movie could have been so much better if they had taken a little more from the book.I enjoyed the idea of the 'glove' that allows the gorilla who can sign, to speak. I didn't enjoy the ex CIA operative who, \\"put's them on the endangered species list\\". When I saw this movie at the theater, I was quite annoyed that I had spent so much money to watch what must have been a slap in the face for Crichton.Crichton is well known for using science to make his stories believable, but all the science in the world couldn't take care of what they did to his book. Try renting this one before you buy, and if you like it, by all means read the book. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me up when it's over","review":"I absolutely hated this movie! The whole movie was a waste of time. All they do is go through the jungle in search of some diamonds for a telephone company...laser?? You didn't even see the flesh-eating...gorillas until the end of the movie, and the people, very predictably I may say, were caught in a situation that they couldn't possibly get out of, but something saves them, but still adds to the danger. OK, I'll give them this, a volcanic eruption saving them was the last thing on my mind. And what's with the talking gorilla? It did nothing in the film except annoy you and say stupid things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Terrible","review":"I had high hopes for this film when it first came out but the result is a complete waste of time.The Actors look like they really dont want to be there and the \\"Gorilla\\" is totally unbelievable. To make matters worse, halfway through the film they seem to throw in some pointless special effects which although very pretty ( I think they were done by ILM ) serve no purpose.Avoid this one or you'll stink up your dvd player"},{"rating":"1","title":"A HORRIBLE FLICK THAT SHOULD HAVE GONE STRAIGHT TO VIDEO","review":"This movie is not the worst in the world, but it really is THAT damn bad. Congo should be re-named \\"Fake Voice\\". In case you haven't noticed around 3 or 4 characters in the movie change their accents halfway through the movie. Also, Tim Curry delivers one of the worst accents EVER in a movie, on tv or anything. He also develops a lisp later in the movie. The only reason this movie grossed so much was because it was coming off of the popularity of Jurrasic Park, which was great. This movie is good for one reason, and that is for a good laugh. (it is not meant to be a comedy) Some of the scenes are funny like the Sesame Cake scene, but still...this movie falls way short of how good it could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST FILM EVER MADE","review":"(...) This film is terrible-it is in fact, in my opinion, the worst film ever made.The reason for this is simple-it could have been so good. A brilliantly entertaining novel by Michael Crichtion as the foundation, Marshall-a Spielberg producer and protege of sorts, coming off the recent success of telling a good story with \\"Alive\\"- the photography of Allen Daviau-these three men should have at least garunteed a halfway decent film. But of course not.(...) perhaps be as good as Jurassic Park was in theatres. How wrong I was.The only people who deserve credit on this film are Paramount's advertisement people who managed to put together 30 second spots that actually made it look like the film had a chance.(...) Some films (especially in the past two years) have come close, but none has been able to take this one off the mantel of the worst film ever made.Don't spend a dime on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film is worse than the book","review":"I read the book in highschool and enjoyed it somewhat. A few months later I rented the video and was upset at how bad it was. Outside of The Lost world this is the worst adaption of a Michael Crichton novel that I have ever seen.

This wall cover perforator does next to nothing to my twice painted wallpaper, which is all I have left. If the wallpaper weren't painted, the Paper Tigers wouldn't have broken. While this will probably not break from over use, it is also worthless to me. Eventually I'll find something useful for this tool, just not for wallpaper removal. So, save yourself some money and buy the Paper Tiger, and not one of its knock offs either. The triple head Paper Tiger is even better, lasts longer, but is more bulky and it is not depth limited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biggest surprise of the year (at least so far...)","review":"Having seen these guys live, I really wasn't expecting too much from this album, though I know their studio work is far more polished and coherent than their shows might lead you to believe.

Just a one-track pony?Nope.Remixes Compiled is a streamlined sonic surprise. Many of the tracks are vocal, the musical styles of the tracks are wide-ranging, yet the whole album feels totally cohesive, glued together with clicks, blips, and glitches. There's such immense detail in every track-- layers of sounds, sweeping and fading in and out, beautifully timed, always fascinating.

Otherwise it seemed fine, so I began using it to pack my kindergartener's daily snacks in. It's a bit small for snack, lunch, and water bottle, but it's fine for the days he doesn't need lunch. However, it's really poorly constructed. The clasp lost a screw within the first week, and the entire lid came off today when it fell off the counter. I was able to get it back on and bend the metal hinge into shape so that (hopefully) it'll hold up a little longer, but we've been using it for about a month, and it already needs to be replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute box for an immature adult","review":"I got this lunch box since I often bring lunch to work and figure it'll be nice to have Snoopy help me with my lunch instead of boring adult lunch boxes with no designs. And I have gotten a few compliments on my cute lunch box from people in my office building.It's big enough to fit a medium-sized round Pyrex glass container, which is what I usually put my lunch in. Though sadly, that's about all that can fit in there when I have the Pyrex in there. If I want to bring a yogurt or apple with me as a snack, they won't fit in there with the Pyrex and I end up having to bring a separate bag. So I find myself using this lunch box less and less, which is a darn shame!So in short, great lunch box and cute design.

The latin roots taught in this book make it possible to recognize zounds of words not presented in these pages but in every day life. Also the words provided here are frequently used in our daily environment so it really does help to be familiar with them. There are also interesting little tid bits about common usage of language, and what is socially acceptible (if inaccurate by its original meaning). There are interesting tid bits such as a list of all the phobias. It's fun to quiz my know-it-all friends on their vocabulary, or better yet correct them ; ) As far as difficulty, I would say this book gives you a graduate level non-specialized vocabulary, but it does make a difference when reading, speaking to educated people, or taking entrance exams such as the GRE.

If you are someone like me who believes that words give so much power, then you will want to ensure you maximize your understanding of the choices of words you can use.Also, this book is designed to introduce a word to you then expand on that word so you have a solid understanding of that word and related words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Starting Point for Building Your Vocabulary!","review":"These guys do an excellent job explaining the origins of words and their latin roots. Instead of memorizing long lists of words, you learn about roots and different words that stem from the roots. It becomes much easier and more natural to remember words in this fashion. Once caveat is that this book is pretty old, so a few of the words are a little outdated.

If you want just want to show off then this may be a book for you. However, if you want to be able to formulate your thoughts more precisely stay away from it. The method that the author proposes gives you a rough idea of the meaning of a word. That's it. After working through the book you may be able to say the same thing in six different ways, but you will not be able to tell the subtle differences in implication. That the author likewise lacks this level of sophistication becomes abundantly clear, e.g., when he claims that a palace and a castle are 'the same'.

The radio, being worse, is especially bad at capturing \\"highs\\". Since the EQ only works for the MP3 player, you can't tweak the radio sound.The tinny sounding TDK earbuds do actually make the radio sound OK. But do you really want to use your \\"good\\" headphones for the MP3 player and the TDK ones for the radio function?Also the FM tuner does not do well in pulling in stations in San Francisco (a tough environment).Otherwise it has reasonably good functionality. Good manual. Good software. Good user interface.

All four books are quite different and all are classic Maisy. Each page features one picture and one descriptor (some have up to three, but most are 1-to-1). Some of the descriptors are more British \\"push horse, paddling pool, jumper, swimming costume), but the majority work in either British or American English.They are about 2.5\\"x2.5\\"x2.5\\" so they are the perfect size for diaper bags, eating out, carseat, etc. We love these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nocturne!!

Nothing original here, at times the music can be ok but the vocals are just awful. I don't know what it is about this band but everything about their sound strikes me as a really bad ripoff, the music, production, mix are all poor and as I stated above the vocals are just horrid.To be fair, I have never been a fan of this type of rock music, I had got the release expecting something goth/industrial. Fans of Bon Jovi, Europe, Quiet Riot, Poison might like this, its only a step or two down for those types of bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money Wasted","review":"Weak,generic,rehashed cookie cutter B.S.I can't believe I actually spent money on this.Well that's the last time I buy ANYTHING on a certain someones(who shall remain nameless)recomendation.Only two decent songs on this cd.I'm going to smash it with a hammer now.ENTOMBED RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lacey and Crew We Love You!","review":"I met Lacey during a Clan Of Xymox show in Austin many years back. She was strikingly demure and friendly. After a few conversations she was obviously serious about her work and her stage presence was intoxicating. The whole show was provocative and intense. Ever since I've been a true fan, going to shows and helping promote. The band has opened for and toured with many of the greats including Ohgr, NIN, Thrill Kill Kult and Pigface! This release assured them a major seat in the underground music scene. Measure it by it's dark sexuality and the quiet brooding urge to break out of your freakin' skin! Dangerous, sinuous, and downright stunning! It's quite unfortunate that labels are placed on bands as it is an unworthy form of insulting. Nocturne in my opinion show true conviction in their craft and will continue to pride themselves in the music and the adoring fans that follow them forever.

Seven amazing tracks, that keep you mezmorized, throughout the entire length of the C.D. Honestly, this is an Import that you have to get your grubby little hands on, if you don't own it already. If you are a true Radiohead fan, you'll add this to your cart amongst all of the other Imports they have to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"An anxiety filled 'tribute' to the world we live in.","review":"OK Computer was a brilliant artist leap from The bends, and this EP might very well be the next step up the ladder. Although there are no standout singles, this helps rather than hinder the surreal quality of the album. As \\"airbag\\" ends, fans expect the beginning of \\"Paranoid Android\\", but end up with \\"Pearly*\\", a strikingly different tune of unusual beauty. Polyethylene [part 1 and 2], hits quite hard as Thom struggles to overpower the rest of the band with his unequaled vocals (the fact that he never quite does never ceases to amaze me). The lyrics (like on any of Radiohead's albums) are decidely melancholy, and I suggest reading them or printing them off a web-site in order to shine some light onto their meaning. But don't get too hopeful in that regard, for any interpretation is likely to be valid. I Guess only Thom can do them true justice, or maybe they are just his idea of a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another quality release from those Radio GUYS","review":"This is one of many quality CD's from Radiohead. Its contains some of Radioheads lastest master pieces in the form of Palo Alto, Polyethylene (Parts 1 and 2), and Meeting at the Aisle is a neat piece dance music. This is a good bargin and I would advise it if you have the 3 Albums already. This is not as good as \\"The Bends\\" and \\"OK Computer\\" but they are in a legue of their own. Still if you want some quality meaningful music then look no futher."},{"rating":"2","title":"the missing link?","review":"great songs; kinda sorta bridges the gap between ok computer and kid a. mostly made up of cool guitar-based songs like \\"polyethylene\\" and \\"palo alto\\" (the latter is heard in the \\"meeting people is easy\\" documentary), and of course \\"airbag\\". also has 2 good electronic/synth tunes, i.e. \\"meeting in the aisle\\" (instrumental) and \\"melatonin\\". really solid overall; no need to skip around the cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This American single release for Airbag also contains all the b-sides from the uk versions of the Paranoid Android, Karma Police, and No Surprises singles. Polyethylene is one of the best Radiohead songs ever and Palo Alto is a straight ahead rock song with chorus flourishes remenisciant of Creep. The instrumental Meeting in the Aisle and Melatonin are precursors of the band's experimental sound on Kid A and Amnesiac. Overall, a brilliant selection of songs that deserve a full-scale release. Thats the one thing about Radiohead - consistent quality...even their b-sides are awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Collection of Music","review":"I am a rabid Radiohead fan and this CD was no disappointment! If you add these tunes to your iPod's library they blend right in with all of the other Radiohead tracks. A must-buy for anyone who is a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fallowing in the footsteps of its bigger brother.","review":"The Airbag EP is the small fallow up to highly regarded Ok Computer. Other then Airbag, the rest of the tracks are b-sides of the Ok computer sessions. Songs like Polyethylene, Pearly, and Palo Alto are very well composed songs from the band which each have their own eerie computer awareness. While Melatonin and A reminder, a very sleepy fish headed ballards (which are very relaxing) slip away from the high effected powered guitar driven songs. This sets a new standard for EPs. This album has a little of very thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is no significant risk to your health","review":"Typical Radiohead experience. What you get out of this depends exactly on what you put into it. For the shallow and overall musically unappreciative type, you will probably remain the comatose invalid that you are. Anyone who suffers from a true musical obsession, meaning you prefer a session of soul stirring music that shakes you to the core of your being at a volume level generally considered a health risk over conversation say, with your closest companion, well then you're probably already a Radiohead fan and own this CD anyway. It's peanuts... Buy it if only to see which category you fall into."},{"rating":"2","title":"there should be a box set of Radiohead B-sides","review":"Seriously, Radiohead's b-sides make it perfectly clear how great a band they really are. Their b-sides are top notch, even compared to their own album tracks. So why not put together a three- or four-disc set of their b-sides, rare tracks, live recordings, etc? There is money to be made here, and God knows Catpitol has no compunction. I only hope it's done tastefully when they finally get around to it. In the meantine, Airbag, Com Lag, Pyramid Song, and the like are the only (legal) means of collecting these fantastic recordings, but it's far from complete. In any event, they are eminently listenable and enjoyable. \\"Metting in the Aisle\\" and \\"Palo Alto\\" and \\"Polyethylene\\" are fantastic songs all, \\"How I Made my Millions\\" is essential.... I can't in fact remember whether all of these songs are on this album, but it's worthy of your money regardless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best, but better than most others...","review":"After getting Radiohead's 3 full albums, I thought I'd take a chance and buy this little baby. Though their other albums are better, this one's pretty good too..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It just plain rocks","review":"This is Radiohead at its best. The group has definitely brushed up on its talents, which is hard to do in following up \\"OK Computer.\\" One of the best tracks on the \\"Airbag/How am I Driving?\\" has to be \\"Meeting in the Aisle.\\" This instrumental song is a very deep mysterious one. \\"Pearly\\" is another great track on the album. \\"Palo Alto\\" gives hard-driving beats. This mini-album \\"aimed at the USA\\" is definitely one to get, even if you're not a Radiohead fan. The only negative aspect of the album is its length. It's definitely too short an album for Radiohead to showcase all its talents. But the album is still flawless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Let me just start by saying OK Computer is one of my favorite albums ever. That level of creativity has rarely been approached by anybody. That being said, there is a reason these songs were not included in that album: it's because they're just not really that great. The material on \\"Airbag\\" just does not stand up to the OK Computer material.Airbag, which incidentally happens to be the only track on OK Computer, happens to be the best song on this EP. Most of the others seem disorganized and disoriented... \\"Pearly\\" is a clear step down from the track that precedes it. \\"Polyethylene\\" is decent, but would still only make an average (at best) song on OK Computer.If you already have all of Radiohead's material, go ahead and get this. But get the rest of it (with the obvious exception of Pablo Honey) first."},{"rating":"1","title":"this cd STINKES it is to smelley for words","review":"DO NOT BUY!!!! this so called CD is so bad I thought my dog died when I played it.what the #*%! is what I said after I played the worst CD on sale today.So before you buy this peice of $!#% think TWICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD; Even Better Value","review":"4.5 Stars, actually. This CD is a must-buy for all Radiohead fans. It contains 6 b-sides that were initially featured on 3 different singles (UK imports of \\"Paranoid Android\\", \\"Karma Police\\" and \\"No Surprises\\") for a bargain basement price of 9 bucks. \\"Polyethylene\\" is probably my favorite Radiohead song from their \\"Ok Computer\\" era, and while the rest of the tracks may not live up to the level of their \\"Bends\\" era b-sides, they are still more than adequate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great EP for Radiohead/OK Computer fans","review":"\\"Airbag/How Am I Driving?\\" includes the superb track \\"Airbag\\" from Radiohead's 1997 OK Computer, as well as six B side tracks. From the hypnotic instrumental \\"Meeting in the Aisle\\" to the spacious mallets of \\"A Reminder\\", there is too much good stuff on this EP to not hear it.

Maybe he should have listened to this record before he reviewed it. Celtic Frost is not a black/death metal group. There is absolutely no satanic content on any of their albums. However, if you are interested in exploring the beginnings of the extreme metal movement, this is a great place to start. Please don't let close-minded reviewers define what is and isn't good metal. The performances on Morbid Tales lean more towards heavy power chording as opposed to intricate technical riffing. This is a great album and very significant in the development of extreme music.

The 1st 2 tracks set the the expectations...but it doesnt progress.Pretty heavy regardless, and the remaster sounds great.Classic dark metal, slightly boring, dated.What I like about these guys is how they tuned the guitar and bass. Great tone..you only wish theyd dig into the wierd riffs more often, do some more time changes. They got the right sound...but not the best of material to play.Into The Pandemonium has a few killer tracks that pick up where this left off...and a few strange ones. I beleive Into.. is their best achievment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gutter Metal","review":"I am too much of progressive metal and good musicianship to like this album. You might see it on some of the lists of the best metal albums ever. However, Morbid Tales doesn't have much to offer. There is a certain type of fan though that would love this. For example, if you love Bleach by Nirvana, which was Nirvana's first effort, put out before they got big, then you might like Morbid Tales. Another band Morbid Tales by Celtic Frost reminds me of is Type O Negative. There is not much talent, but the music accomplishes something through just being so primitive and dark. And, keep in mind when I give an album a star, I give it a start because I live the album! I don't give starred reviews to albums that I don't like!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They Screwed Up Circle of the Tyrants","review":"This is a killer album. The first half, or the \\"Morbid Tales\\" portion, sounds great. Great remix. But when you get to the \\"Emperor's Return\\" portion, the remix is horrible. Which sucks, because the main reason I bought this album was for the original \\"Circle of the Tyrants\\" recording. The guitars are way too low on this portion, and the vocals are almost completely drowned out. The wonderful reverb on the vocals is lost. It sounds as if he's singing under a blanket behind a closed door. I was pissed.But I will say that I was thrilled with \\"Dethroned Emperor\\" and \\"Into Crypts of Rays,\\" which sound awesome. I love the way he pronounces it \\"DATHroned EPAHrah!!\\" If they would have left the other portion alone, this would be a perfect album."},{"rating":"2","title":"an album that is unique","review":"This is one of my favorite albums of all time. Im sure this band had influnces on other bands of its time.

The band is pure bad. If you like heavy thrash music you should love any of the first three Frost albums. Morbid Tales, Emperors Return, To Mega Therion.

This is a lyrically based album- so if your main concern is funky-fresh beats, I wouldn't suggest buying this album. The Album is more of a lyrical showcase than an actual album. Many of the tracks are freestyles and most of the tracks use very raw production methods which give it a pretty old school feel.

I know about suspending belief but come on.While I am at it, I wish these authors would get rid of the female character who throws a fit when she realizes the protagonist is going to do his job.

Both the concert and the documentary are extremely moving, both in terms of the band's stunning musical virtuosity and the time-mocking brilliance and originality of their songwriting. The Police just plain embarrass most music acts present and past. And although I'd love another studio album, you'll see in the concert footage that the old songs have become living entities of their own, and are so loaded into people's lives and consciousness through generations and across cultures that only groups like the Beatles can compare. I'm extremely bummed out that I missed this tour, but the DVD/CD pack almost makes up for it. Don't hesitate even if you have all the Police albums.

Brian Setzer voice is glorious sometimes and he gives flavour to upbeat tempo songs, and the more slower songs . The duet with Ann-Margret Track 6 Baby Its Cold Outside, is a winner, and you dont need to heat up the temperature in your living room. It\`s enough to listen to this one. Im impressed how Setzer and his Orchestra can create his own identity and signature on many of this songs. Another winner is certainly Track 9 Sleigh Ride, with a swing tempo up beat, and a glorius rock and roll guitar solo which just blow you away. To nearly end the album is Track 11 O Holy night, shows what voice Setzer realy has. Full of emotions with a big E.

Despite having every material thing he might wish for, the wealthy protagonist can't seem to produce his ultimate dream: a literary work of art. His attempt at resolving the dilemma provides a deceptive resolution, and ultimately threatens his entire concept of himself.Moravia's storytelling style is incisive, simple and quite addictive. I literally couldn't put the book down once I started. The plot is simple yet intriguing, and one feels immediately invested with the character's struggle. Some surprising and wise observations about human nature, and our inability to rise above our shortcomings. Interesting that the setting is 1937, because the concerns feel so contemporary. And yet, the end does provide hope. Looking forward to re-reading this, and reading all of Moravia's other works.Highly recommended read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep through the night","review":"This supplement is what I wish all supplements would be like.

Without any sort of side effect at all, my worrysome mornings as well as anxiety throughout the day were gone. And the best part is that I haven't adapted to it! My doctor recommended taking 2 in the AM and PM but that made me kind of sleepy all the time so I just take one at night and it really helps.

I think Amazon it much better than circuitcity on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Compatibility! The Worst Warranty I ever Met!!","review":"Poor Compatibility! Not a single disc burnt! The Worst Warranty I ever Met!! As simple as that.I bought it from Staples two months ago, and I hsve been struggling with it ever since. I contacted I/O Magic technical support and customer service several times, of course, I have been asked to update all drivers from Desktop chipset to ATPI driver, DVDRW drive's firmware. This product at last simply even stopped reading days ago. Then I met with the worst warranty I ever have before. The WARRANTY simply asks you to pay for the return and replacement delivery no matter it is a defective one or not!!!!!!!Watch out and follow experts' advice on some reliable brands, unless you want to struggle with this product with poor quality and pay for the freight youself!This is definitely my last experience with I/OMagic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable, expensive","review":"First, let me point out that you can get a namebrand (NEC, Toshiba, etc.) internal DL/all-format DVD burner for under $80; try Amazon and Newegg. I found this I/O Magic at my local computer store so I bought it. Big mistake. The drive reads DVDs slower than my 3-year-old Iomega (no relation!) and write speed (on DVD-Rs) is nowhere near as advertised. Worse, about half the time it would not recognize my DVD-Rs when first inserted. This is a terrible product. Luckily I returned it for a full refund. Then I found out I could buy a better brand on Newegg for less.This was my first I/O Magic product. I just read online reviews of their hard drive products and looks like this company's products suck big-time. They also sell under the Hi-Val brand, so beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing with errors after 3 months","review":"It was great for the first 3 months. I use Nero Ultra 6 (not OEM from this product) and is up to date. After 3 months of use, it wrote with errors and cannot use those discs. Nero can varify whatever writing with it. Now, it's just a DVD-ROM, not DVD-RW double layer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even fit for firewood","review":"This is hands down the worst novel I have ever read, ever...EVER. It was incongruent from beginning to end. I don't even know why I kept reading it. Quite possibly the most malignant and offensive work of fiction I've ever experienced that sells out any sense of integrity established by his last novel Novus Ordo Seclorum. I'd rather read a laundry list of things I have to do before my mother-in-law visits for Christmas than read this work of sludge. The loose connections and abrupt transitions were the selling points of the novel besides the somewhat ironic political incorrectness which was refreshing. Whoever wrote the editor review didn't read the same book. Writing this review is probably a waste unless it saves one person the $$$$$ or time reading it. DOn't buy this book it is aweful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal Cutoff Saw","review":"One of the most useful tools in my metal cutting shop. I use it several times per day. Works great with smooth cuts that require no grinding. I never use my former abrasive blade cutoff machine anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it.","review":"I bought this saw for our metal shop thinking I would save some money on a cold saw. No dice. we have 3 ($100 each) blades that we keep in rotation sending them to be sharpened to keep my with our semi moderate production. Beyond that I now have had the base crack and the clamp has failed. We have highly experience metal workers using this saw, it is just not up to par. For lightweight extremely occasional use it would be great, or for mobility to a job site. We are using it on lightweight steel and it just wont take the 7 hours of constant use once a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Milwaukee metal cutting saw","review":"The saw arrived by UPS. The factory box was damaged and showed signs of water damage. The saw was packaged upside down in the box. The saw housing fasteners backed off after a days worth of cutting. This could have resulted in a catastrophic failure if not discovered. The Milwaukee blade lasted half a day. I swithched over to another brand blade with no issues. Overall, I rate the saw as fair after the initial problems with packaging, delivery and quality control where I would give a poor rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXPENSIVE TO USE","review":"Have had mine for three weeks and just installed my third blade today (at a hundred dollars a pop. If you are buying them with expectations of saving money over the abrasive cut off blades , you will surely be disappointed. I have not cut a lot of metal and the metal i have cut has all been mild steel 1/4\\" hot roll flatstockAm waiting to hear from a milwaukee but i think i am just going to find out they are what they are.Will most likley be selling this one on ebay if i cannot get Milwaukee to take it back.The first two blades were the Milwaukee blades. The one i put on today was a Morse I bought from Amazon last week for 138.00"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Built","review":"With the exception of the rubber feet, this saw appears to be well built with a good fit and finish. Cuts very nice leaving a smooth edge with little debri and no dust, particlalry when compared to the abrasive blade versions of this saw. So far no issues with the blade, but they do warn that you should cut slow and start with the thinnest part of the metal first. For example barstock should be edge up, not flat. The blade also warns against cutting rebar, but other blades that are available for this saw claim to cut rebar, but I have not tested them. Besides the rubber feet, that will not likely last, the only other issue I have with the saw as that the fourth hold in the base (rear) is blocked by the saw's assemble, which can make it very difficult to mount on the foldable typ saw stands. If not for this bit of laziness from Milwaukee's engineers it would have been given five stars, so it you don't need that hole, consider this a five star saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for small home workshop","review":"I purchased this after comparing the Dewalt & Porter Cable versions in person. The saw works great, the angle fence is easy to adjust. The stock stays put while cutting. Very easy to release tension on the vise. When the upper motor is in the locked down position it is well balanced for carrying. Like others have mentioned, this saw requires a lighter touch than an abrasive style chop saw. I've cut 3x3x1/4 steel tube with not much more than a light downward pressure. It is much faster to clean up the chips from this saw vs the dust from an abrasive style chop saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"HEAVY...BUT GETS OLD FAST...","review":"Honestly,I only bought this because the name of the band was very original. The guitar,drums,and vocals are nothing we haven't heard a thousand times before. Nothing but growling and the same guitar in every song. To bad the CD isn't as original as the name. SORRY GUYS! nothing great here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great copy of \\"Satanic rites...\\"","review":"To Me, the transfer of \\"Satinic rites...\\" is great. It seems to be really letterboxed.

This is a great,great,great cd. This is one of those cd's that you want to listen to every song on, where every song is incredible and quite unique, quite a diversity of style. I am very impressed - certainly one of the better recent cd's I own - ranks up there with Forty Foot Echo, Hoobastank, and a few others. Definitely worth buying. Hope to hear more from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"They\`ve almost done it again!","review":"After listening to \\"Halfway down the Sky\\", I just couldn\`t wait for Splender to release another album. It\`s always hard to follow up a superb first release, but I really think they have managed to create a classic yet again! I rate this album as a a very strong four-star.Their first single from this album was \\"Save it for Later\\", which in my opinion is perhaps the weakest track on the entire album. Don\`t get me wrong, it is still an ok song. But other songs like \\"But, Anyway\\" and the opening track \\"Happier this Way\\" is almost magical. Splender has matured from writing rather melancholic songs, into more edgier rock, an appropriate term would be \\"songs with an attitude\\". Just listen to \\"The Loneliest Person I Know\\"....wow, such sad lyrics, but with such a \\"happy\\" melody, it\`s just great! That kinda runs through the entire new album....they are \\"Happier this Way\\"!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what they are capable of...","review":"I wrote a great review for this album when it first came out right here on Amazon, I said this album was a must by. Now I realize I was just excited that Splender finally released a second album. After going back and listening to the album, I realized it very boring and repetitive. Then going back listening to the FIRST album, I realized To whom it may concern is awful. It just isnt Splender, it was made to try to make them famous. Splender should stick with what they are good at-making good music. This however, is far from what they are truly capable of. If you want real music, pick up the first album, Halfway Down The Sky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophomore Slump AVOIDED and EXCEEDED","review":"If you are anything like me, you were hooked on Splender's debut album \\"Halfway Down The Sky\\" for months. That was before \\"I think God Can Explain\\" even hit the radio. A song which i thought was a skip over track if the album had one. Songs you couldnt get out of your head and could sing along with time and time again. A couple years and a record company later Splender releases \\"To Whom It May Concern\\" and continues what their fans of their first disc expected. Great hooks, great harmonies, and catchy songs. Lyrics are fun and intelligent just like HDTS. Not a bad song on the disc, which all Splender fans will be expecting. Recommended to fans of Our Lady Peace, Third Eye Blind, The Marvelous 3 and Butch Walker. BUY IT NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great album","review":"Like the other reviewers, I really liked Halfway Down the Sky. This album, song for song is just as good. If you like the Splender sound, I would highly recommend this album. There truly is no best song, but \\"Good Evening\\" may rival \\"London\\" in terms of Splender's most powerful song. I have had this album less than a week, and I would already classify it as great. Do yourself a favor and go out and buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardest Working Band title reassured","review":"These guys are known as the hardest working band out there and it shows. No stupid songs that shouldn't be there...all are worthy of airtime. I breathed a sigh of relief after listening through the first time because I was worried they can't match the 1st album. The guitar melodies are so creative and Boone's voice as striking as Halfway Down the Sky. The songs are somewhat poppier which is why I rank it 4 stars instead of 5. Splender is probably the most underrated band in this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted it to be GREAT","review":"This is one of those cd's I expected to rock, since the first splender CD blew me away--and I mean every song--this album just doesn't have that dark, catchy feel to it. The lyrics fall flat, and that seriously saddens me, because I waited so long for it to come out. The last song on the cd is the only good cut, and captures the feel of Splender. The rest are dull, and not worth the time. Hope the guys come out with something from a label who understands them, cause J Records doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Purchase","review":"I bought this CD as new one and I received it with the cd box opened and broken as if I had bought as used. Fortunately the CD looks like new and it doesn't have any scratch.Regards"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ct Volunteers a good resource","review":"This book is basically a compilation of facts from two volumes of Ct State Records on Volunteers during the Civil War. I have the earliest version of the State book, from 1869 and it was revised in 1889. The Hines book uses mostly material from the later more correct version of the tome. Data is organized and presented so you can trace the actions and men of the various units from CT as they evolved during the War. A very useful resource for quick searches of who fought in what unit and where. Also has info on what happened to these men (captured, deserted, re-enlisted etc). If you are into CT history or the Civil War, a fine book to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for lovers of older country music history","review":"Interesting reading for lovers of country before the so called new country music.

This book is worthless. The author talks of spirits, and raising spirits. VERY MISLEADING in concept, and poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhhhh....","review":"This book had very little to reveal about Masonary or Magic. The author does include copies of spells he uses with brief discriptions of how to use them, but over all the book lacked any real meat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original Content? Hardly","review":"Part II of this book essentially reprints the Lesser Key of Solomon, for which many now no-longer copyrighted editions are available over the internet as PDF. Part I is some not exactly interesting speculation that somehow implies that the connection between Freemasonry's aesthetic of spiritual self-improvement and DuQuette's speculated discovery by the Knights Templar that much the Hebrew Bible history was fabricated relates to summoning demons to command as the lower parts of ourselves. Absolutely none of this is new; while it could have been interesting, DuQuette's book reads like an abbreviated, beer-soaked memior, devoid of content. I am not opposed to someone elucidating old ideas, but DuQuette here doesn't offer much beyond a very high-level view of these old theories. Do yourself a favor and spend the money you save on tacos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I am a fan of Duquette's works, they are a bit light o n technical information, and heavy on how to view it and approach it. There is much to be gained by reading him, thoughI wish he got into the nuts and bolts of ritual more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great band, great cd","review":"I'm a fan of Crimson Glory. Have been for decades. I would recommend this cd to anyone. The rock is a bit hard at times, but then i don't know many albums where every song is awesome. Floyd and Queensryche are the only 2 that come to mind where every song rocks. Maybe Maiden too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crimson Glory - self-titled (Roadrunner)","review":"Forgot all about this neo-progressive metal band as I haven't seen any of their material for several years now. This self-titled CD was the 1986 debut as I saw them play a club a few years later. Crimson Glory was a metal band that had plenty to offer it's fans. Tracks here that had me sit up and take notice were \\"Valhalla\\", the headbanging \\"Dragon Lady\\", \\"Queen Of The Masquerade\\" and the anthem {sort to speak} \\"Angels of War\\". Line-up: Midnight-vocals, Jon Drenning & Ben Jackson-guitars, Jeff Lords-bass and Dana Burnell-drums. Should appeal to fans of Queensryche {duh!}, Fates Warning, Yngwie Malmsteen. Give it a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic...","review":"I concur with everyone else's comments; this is simply an amazing prog metal album. I would have given five stars, but I am knocking off one star because this CD is missing a song called \\"Dream Dancer\\" which was available on the cassette version (alas, my own copy of the cassette has long since become unplayable). As good as all the other tunes are, that song was probably my favorite, and I'm disappointed that it was not included on the CD. If the powers that be are reading this - PLEASE re-release this album with that song!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book! Very funny","review":"I love this book. I teach 7th grade English and read it aloud to my students. They loved it and couldn't wait to hear what Limpy was up to next. It's rare to find a book that a majority of 7th graders will enjoy. They all want to hear Toad Heaven, so they can see more of Limpy and his family. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book rocks.","review":"this book was very exciteing because it was all about toads not people. if you like toads you will love this book. if you liked toad heaven you will like toad rage. there are also crickets and rats and sloths and many more animals. I liked when george and bob were hanging on the back of a truck and they jumped off and they coudnt breath but they just got the wind knocked out of them. that shows excitement and suspense.I liked this book because of the adventure excitement and suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stethoscope for a low price...","review":"My son was diagnosed with asthma at 6 months.

She is a nurse and she has one of those over priced Littman stethoscopes she uses at work in the hospital. My daughter has asthma and we use it daily to see if she is wheezing, and to check if she is moving her air well.I figured how bad could this be? The price should have tipped me off. The sound is very \\"tinny\\", like hitting the side of an empty pop can. Plus it's way too low. You cannot make out any breath sounds and even barely the heartbeat. I will be returning it promptly. The only plus I can think of is the neon pink color is very cute, and the stethoscope itself is very lightweight. I cannot recommend this to anyone at all for home use, and definitely not in a professional medical setting.I will continue to search for a middle ground in price and quality for a home-use stethoscope, but this is definitely bottom of the barrel."},{"rating":"2","title":"LUKE","review":"I really liked LUKE , the Characters, LUKE and Valeria were so good together, when I was reading the book I almost felt like I was there, the only thing about the book was I don't understand how Valeria , a rich ,spoiled self-involved young women could change her ways so fast, but it was only a book, I think in the real world it wouldn't happenDJ"},{"rating":"2","title":"LUKE IS A WONDERFUL ROMANTIC WESTERN!","review":"Luke is the first Leigh Greenwood novel I have read, and I am impressed!

It showed as in stock and I ordered this scanner on 1/15 and upgraded to next day shipping. As of 1/20, they still haven't shipped it yet even though the item is still supposedly in stock. I've emailed them on three occasions, each time Amazon responded with a promise that it would be shipping that day and each time it didn't. They refuse to cancel the order, telling me to return the scanner when I receive it if I no longer want it. They won't even refund the charge for overnight shipping even though it's been almost a week and has yet to leave their building. I've been an Amazon customer for a long time, but this experience has been so frustrating that I think I'll look elsewhere for future purchases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this product!","review":"I bought this scanner because my other scanner is an all-in-one and too bulky to haul from place to place. I took my new scanner on a scrapbooking retreat weekend and even with the limited space that I was alloted, I was able to scan to my heart's content. It's fast and the quality looks wonderful on my computer. I haven't printed any of the pictures out yet, but I'm getting all my picts scanned.

I'm very happy with this purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection realized-4490 Photo","review":"It took less then 10 minutes to get set up with Windows Vista and test this out. My number one reason for buying was for the 35 MM slide archive I have and want to convert my favorites to digital images. I had heard stories about scanners trying to capture the 35MM slide image and my dad who is a photo buff had an HP sometime back and got so dissatisfied he went to an outfit to get slides converted for more then I paid for the EPSON. The result, it blew away all expectations. I was able to digitize easily at 8Meg and pop it onto my plasma 50\\" screen with amazing results of the Virgin Islands taken 25 years ago. (I actually had to throttle back from 1200 DPI because it produced an 18Meg file.) Colors were rich and detail was crisp. I haven't had a chance to test it with old photos yet but for converting the slides it was worth every dime and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first scanner","review":"It's my first scanner, so I'm not the best person to write a review about scanners. But, for someone with almost 30 years of photos of trips and family (and many wonderful memories), this is a nice scanner. The photos look beautiful after being scanned. It scans pretty quickly, but if you have a lot of photos to scan it will take you awhile since you can only do one photo at a time. On the plus side, it's easy to use. It also does a good job with documents. For the price, it was a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great results but the build could be a little better.","review":"I love this scanner, it gives me great results and will save me a lot of money in development costs.

This is the best consumer slide scanner I have used to date and I would venture to say that some of the neg scans are as good as what I have gotten from some professional houses. I'm getting great detail in the shadows and coupled with Photoshop have managed to restore a number of images that I thought were goners.The software is a little cranky and the auto framing is really nice to have when it decides to work. I wish it scanned faster, but at this price, I consider it a good deal. It's better than a simple document scanner and has higher resolution than a lot of image scanners. Now that I have used it do I think it's worth the money? Yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mac Intel users beware!","review":"I bought this item and have experienced none of the loud sounds or lid issues however after my first batch of 5 or six scans, which went beautifully and yielded great scans, the software crashed.

He walked me through several possible conflicts and we uninstalled things deep under the hood only to find that it now worked but with half the functionality (the buttons on the face were no longer functional). Then on the very next use of the scanner the software crashed anyways! Oh well. I've even tried to install the latest drivers. Nothing!

I was looking for one to transfer a lot of my Dad's slides (from his childhood and honeymoon). It was going to cost me $5 a slide to have them digitized at a local place and with 100s of slides that just wouldn't work. I read every review out there and finally settled on this one because of the reported quality and the great price. In the end I figured I would spend less money and see what would happen. I LOVE IT. It has done a really great job with the slides. Even some of the ones I thought were a lost cause have turned out great. It is super easy to use. The only thing is I'm scanning at higher resolutions and it takes 25-30 minutes for every 4 slides. But totally worth it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4490 Photo Scanner","review":"First of all the scanner was delivered to me on the scheduled date.

I don't usually write reviews, but Epson is selling this product without fully supporting Windows 7 with updated scanner utility software.

The Creative Suite installs okay and now the scanner buttons work except the COPY button which is the one I use the most (...or used to use when it work with WIndows XP). Also note that the EMAIL button has always only worked with Outlook Express which of course is no longer provided in Windows 7.

My Epson 980 inkjet printer has worked extremely well for a long time, and the software update for XP works fine. However, just a month or two after installing the Epson 4490, the software stopped working. I uninstalled and reinstalled, with no success. I downloaded and installed the latest driver (dated 10/06), but still the software remains nonfunctional, simply putting a blue strip in the left corner of the desktop with options of minimizing, moving, or closing. I would (and will) check users' opinions of both hardware and software combined, relative to scanners, and not trust editorial reviews alone, none of which mentioned the software problems. (A problem with editors' reviews is that they frequently do not reflect moderately longterm use of the product so that problems that emerge over a few weeks or months go unreported.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel cheated","review":"One of the reasons I purchased this scanner is because it claimed to include Adobe Photoshop Elements.

Since the first time I used it, it intermittently stops working issuing an error message of \\"can not properly communcate with scanner. etc..\\" So every time I scan something I am very nervous hoping it could get through. Sometimes to be able to finish scanning 10 pages of document I will have to restart the scanner three times. When talked to tech support(supprisingly EPSON doesn't have 1-800 number for their customer to contact them) for more than 6 hours in total. They pushed me away to contact my computer vendor saying my USB chipset is too basic which doesn't have enough power to drive the scanner. Wow, what a good explaination! Because they think their scanner is so special that normal PC couldn't handle it!

One drawback: no capability for scanning transparencies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Software Downgrade of fine hardware","review":"Excellent scanner -- fast and accurate.Software has been damaged compared to earlier releases. Email function oddly does not work with Outlook and Epson Scan is strangely crippled. Your settings can no longer be descriptively named. They come up \\"Setting 1\\" \\"Setting 2\\" etc., which is not useful.The hardware is without fault. While not quite the dynamic range of the pricey 4990, this scanner will be useful for people looking to scan 35mm or medium format film unless they demand very high quality.

Noticeably sharper than my previous Epson scanner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great expectations!","review":"My first reason for checking out this scanner is because its made by Epson. Every Epson product I had purchased in the past proved to be great. In this case I was interested in the quality of scans from 35mm slides.

After having such a headache trying to figure out the correct settings on the scanner, I called the Epson's tech department. They have no clue regarding scanning negative films and was not a help at all. We decided to return the scanner instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Scanner!","review":"After a lot of research and reading reviews I finally decided to buy the 4490, primarily due to its film/transparency capabilities and the fact that a limited budget prevented getting a better one (a film scanner). I've done a lot of work on film with formats up 4x5 so I would have preferred a scanner that would handle the larger size, but, for now, I've decided to at least start scanning some of my negatives and slides-some of which date back to the late 40's (I have an 11x14 print from a scanned 35mm slide made in 1970 that looks fantastic!). To test the capabilities of the 4490 I've scanned both color and BW and the results look very good (even at 300dpi). Though I discovered that this model has been replaced, I still chose it-the newer models not only cost substantially more, but the capabilities weren't any better! The price on this one was a really great deal and it was delivered very fast! The only downside is that it won't do larger transparencies (at least 4x5)."},{"rating":"2","title":"love my epson","review":"I received my Epson scanner within two days of order.

Have a lot of negs that I needed to check out, various size formats. The frame guides included are for limited size, so you may have to improvise or purchase as extra. Regardless of size negs or photos I have processed, this unit has done very well. It has showed no signs of problems. From past knowledge I have learned not to stack books, etc on the top lid, (when not in use) nor do I use this unit for much of anything else, (it is a photo scanner) altho I do documents and such, but never lay anything too heavy on the scan glass.

The section of the slide/negative holder for negatives could have a few teeth for 35mm film sprocket holes to ensure that negatives, particularly old ones that haven't been properly stored, are flat rather than buckled up. The document mat is easy to remove, but there are no really decent guides so that re-inserting it is a pain, and leads to frustration.The scans are okay, but the software has a cheesy look and feel to it, and Photoshop CS4 no longer uses TWAIN so it doesn't see it, unless you insert the plug-in by copying it. Even then it may not see the scanner.It comes with Fine Reader, but for the Mac at least the version is not a full version. I used a demo some years back, and if I recall correctly it could scan bilingual books (Latin-English) without difficulty. This will scan Latin, Greek, etc, but I don't think you can set it to scan Latin on one side and English on the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot recommend","review":"This scanner was trouble from the start. It made this crazy noise during prescanning and scanning, sometimes producing a scan and sometimes just a blur of the image.

I am quite disappointed and would be very hesitant to buy another Epson scanner of any type."},{"rating":"1","title":"slide scanning very disappointing","review":"I purchase this product specifically to scan slides after a glowing review I had read.

I have never had the patience to wait for the higher dpis, for four slides at 4800 dpi, the time frame is 252 minutes. 2400 dpi looks exactly like 800.

I was not disappointed by the Epson 4490 Photo scanner. Epson's supplied software is compatible with Intel processor based Macs and the 4490 is recognized by OS X 10.5's Image Capture software as well. It also works fine with the excellent VueScan application that is very popular on the Mac platform. So all in all I'm well pleased with the product on my Mac computer. The 4490 Photo also provides for 35mm color slide scanning and can scan four 35mm slides at a time.Finding a product that works well on the Macintosh can be a daunting task sometimes. Not in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible for slides","review":"the scanner does a very good job with prints.but, it is terrible for slides. i've tried every possible setting using the software and, not matter what, scans of 35mm slides are always out of focus.the software included with the scanner has a poor interface and is confusing to use. the \\"manual\\" is very poor as well.don't buy this scanner if you want to scan slides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unstable glass","review":"Flimsy design and feels cheap.

I expected to be taken on a wild ride through the rodeo circuit. But instead I found myself reading a pseudo-feminist treatise on the shallowness of rodeo and the empty mythos of a West that never existed.

I have never heard of anyone going to an anesthesiologist for a mental problem, unless they beg to be euthanized and put out of their misery. The reviewer from London, UK also says maybe Betty's attempts to escape Iran was the cause of her husband's anger and abuse. Well, since her husband had promised they were only going for a 2-week visit to Iran to visit his family, and then held her against her will there, I think she had the right to be very angry herself. Too bad she couldn't give back some of the beatings he gave her. Also, Betty said they bathed every two months, not once a year.I marvel at Betty's determination and courage.

It's for people without children as well, as everyone can relate to the American protagonists in this story.There are no punches pulled. The story is disturbing at times.The reader often doesn't know what to expect, what is going to happen.

We hope you are not still trying to control your child's mind, but it's a guess you probably are and oh, yes, we really have no proof of that.

The trip was only scheduled for two weeks but as Moody becomes close to his Iranian beliefs again, he imprisons them in his sisters house with no way out. Through a long strugle, Betty and her four year-old daughter Mahtob finally make it out of Iran after they have been beaten and abused by Moody.

I think in this country writers have changed from the days of having to qualify their accusations into simply saying it is so and LO & Behold it does become! Sorry but I have read the books and seen the movie several times and still it leaves something of question in my mind. Ever heard of writer's license? I would give it a zero if possible because when a writer lays claim to events but uses the excuse that they can't reveal any sources I classify it as a fiction. I must say that although much of what the writer writes may have happened, no one can ever really know until the husband or someone who will speak up for him reveals that side of the story. Yes, in this case a big zero but you'll have to settle for a one as that is all that's offered here.

Since the book is touted as being true, these false statements are particularly damaging.I really sympathize with all individuals whose lives were damaged by the trauma of divorce, and the particular complications of international custody laws.However, because the book and the movie contain numerous, broad, negative generalizations about Iranians, and because portions of the book are certainly false, I condemn the book and movie on the grounds that it strengthens false and negative perceptions about Iranians.At a time when the importance of tolerance is appreciated by all, it is sad to see that an individual propagates false information and targets for fame by defaming one of the strongest cultures in the world in such a trifling manner. Freedom of speech has seldom been mocked so carelessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edge-of-your-seat...","review":"When I was in high school, a friend of mine recommended \\"Not Without My Daughter.\\" Twenty years later, I finally got around to reading it.

It is a riveting tale of domestic abuse and a harrowing escape, occuring in Tehran in 1984. Yes, there were moments that made me squirm because Betty Mahmoody seemed like a spoiled American making sweeping generalizations about a culture she had little time to experience, but the story overall is a compelling one.I recommend the book highly, with reservations. I also read \\"Persepolis\\" recently and that provided a much needed counterpoint to Mahmoody's biases. It is essential to consider more than one person's experiences. Not everyone in Iran is like the family she married into.

I thought her story was amazing. The trials this mother had to face day after day in a world that loathed Americans blew my mind. I kept putting myself in her shoes throughout the book and comparing myself with her. I would have to say I definitely wouldn't have had as much courage as she did. This novel is so great mainly because of the fact that it gives so much hope to almost any situation in life. If she could make it through all that, we can make it through hard times too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!!! A Real Eye Opener........","review":"This book is a must for women everywhere. It shows real courage in the face of deception. Betty Mahmoody describes life, as she experienced it, within the confines of both Islam and Iran. Most women (especially American women) do not know that such treatment of women in other lands and other religions exists. Having been in a similar situation myself, although thankfully I had previously read Betty Mahmoody's book, I, at least, was somewhat knowledgeable on what the circumstances would be outside of American jurisdiction and knew enough not to leave American soil. This book takes you from a somewhat gentile life in America to that of a chatoic life experienced within Iran. Your heart will be pounding with each encounter of a new persona in Betty Mahmoody's book.

Even of their own children. Personally I saw the whole situation as a matter of control by both parties. A lot of people have custody battles. The Dr. did what he had to do to try to secure his parental rights too didn't he? Didn't he realize that if the writer filed for divorce that she would use the child as a leverage for alimony and support? After all he was a doctor and Betty was, well, what?

When actual proof can be presented for someone's experiences then readers can actually make an opinion. Otherwise I would certainly hate for someone like PaulDX to be on any jury in this country.

It is awful. The pad itself is very tiny. The surface is rough -- not smooth. None of the advanced scrolling functions are available. There are no included directions, and no included software. The cable comes out of the right side of the touch pad so if your computer is on your left side, or you are left handed (like me), then it does not sit right. It is jumpy and rough to the touch.

This is just to small an area to work on,( or with), it is EXTREMELY sensitive! To much so! And, at the same time,you can do all but hit the thing w/a hammer, & it wont respond! So, if you can understand this, it is much to responsive, & NOT nearly responsive, ( or sensitive) enough at the same time!

Compared to that version the touchpad is about 25% smaller and the whole mouse is about 50% smaller. While I may be able to deal with the smaller touchpad (because it is much more responsive), the smaller physical footprint is driving me insane. It just fits wrong (and my wrist is already getting sore) and it is tippy. The old version had about a 1/2 inch on the frontside of the buttons - in this version the buttons are up to the edge. So when you press them you tip the device forward. Not too much but enough to make you tense up.

The Power Cat was terrific. It had a large touch area, it was very responsive but not over responsive. But it did not work with Win7 and they did not update the drivers so I was forced to use it as a simple USB touchpad with no scrolling features. So I picked this up. I work at home and have 3 PC's attached by a 4 port KVM. 2 PC's are Win7 home premium and prof. One is Vista. This does not work well with the Win7 prof. I do not recommend this to be used this way.

His charm and sincerity translates on the page to weave a gripping narative of his experiences and revelations as he struggles to make a fortune doing what he loves, roping and wrangling. While the book is educational and engaging on the subject of ranching, herding, and spotting a cheat, it tends to lose the audience if they're not already absolutely fascinated with those subjects.No one could write about being a modern cowboy better than John Dunklee, but the reader must be in love with cowboys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great scent, poor staying power","review":"I absolutely love this scent.

The Solar System has been colonized, and the various and many moons are in a war with the two colonized planets, Earth and Mars. In Delaney's heterotopia, anyone can find their pleasure by outwardly declaring their sexual preference (or lack thereof), by having said preference adjusted for them, and by switching genders at will. Hunger, homelessness, and lack of anything are pretty much eliminated.In this strange paradise, we meet Bron, a cringingly un-self-aware man who is completely unable to be happy. The book chronicles his wanderings and his pursuit of the object of his alleged love, a performance artist named The Spike.Interesting, well-written, yet also somehow forgettable, I don't think I'd recommend this one unless you're really bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can a book be worse than this?","review":"Maybe I just missed the boat on the whole Delany thing. The guy won back-to-back Nebulas in the late 60s, but everything I've read by him is just bizarre. I read Dhalgren, and that was pretty pornographic, but the book had a real message to it, which almost outweighed the graphic sex. Trouble on Triton though, ugh. They don't come worse than this. First of all, the book is completely lacking in plot. Second of all it has nothing enjoyable about it. To summarize: strange man tries to find love, but ends up hanging out with 74 year old homosexuals who don't wear clothes playing calculus games. I found the stuff that wasn't disgusting to be stupid, and what wasn't stupid was disgusting.

The writing skill is still there, no question. But Delany's pornographical and intellectual self-indulgence begin their corrosive process on his work. How sad. All that imagination and storytelling skill undermined by meaningless (and often tasteless) philosophical and sexual noodlings. In a parallel universe, Delany kept writing appealing and entertaining books in the vein of his early science fiction.

Furthermore, as a vegetarian I'm very comfortable with it because it is a VegCap. I have no complaints whatsoever, and buying it on Amazon is a lot more economical than buying it at the health food store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet relief!","review":"As someone who used to get UTIs pretty frequently, I can honestly say that since I started using CranActin, I haven't had a single UTI! And unlike many vitamins, I can take them on an empty stomach without any nasty taste or stomach aches! Yay for Cranberries!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"As a woman, cranberry is great for keeping UTI's at bay, but this product is also beneficial for men. Since my husband began taking them, he sleeps through the night and no longer has to get up to go to the bathroom. A welcome relief after years of doing so. Solaray is my favorite company--a bit pricey on some items, but well worth the extra assurance I feel when taking their products. Never any hidden ingredients or fillers. We love the vegcaps vegetarian options they offer--we try to stay away from the gelatin caps as they tend to give us heartburn. A great product for men and women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"This isn't the type of book that leaves you with a happy feeling at the end of it. Despite that, I still enjoyed this book. Sara's journey throught this book is definitely trying and kept my interest. I definitely reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor at best","review":"This story had loads of potential, with an interesting plot line, the development and coming of age of the young girl, however fell short of being an interesting read. For a plot like this to be effective, the reader must be drawn to the character, establishing a relation between reader and character, however this book sped straight into high drama and spent no time developing this vital connection between reader and character. The writing is overwhelmingly basic, but is perhaps the intent of the author. This book fell short of my expectations, and i would suggest skipping this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Book could have been good but just didnt really please me. Author has great talent but this book just falls short. I seen the cover and name and it seemed like a book I would love. I felt that there was really no plot and it was kinda hard to follow at times. The author did not use quotation when people spoke making it kinda hard to read. Would not recomend to read. I read around a book a week or more and was disappointed at the ending. It left me hanging and angry that I don't know what happened. The ending was also unrealistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmph.","review":"I was kind of dissapointed. I read all the reviews and the idea sounded wonderful, but when I started reading it I was a little disappointed. Ever have one of those books in the corner that you start and you keep thinking \\"I want to finish it..\\" but you never do? That's the authors fault, not yours. I remember one part where Justine first meets her, and she is suddenly asking the main character if she wants to go to a crazy party with her, out of nowhere. Just seems really unrealistic, and when you read it you feel as if your blind to something, like the character is looking at the ground 80 percent of the time, and looks up every once in a while.Sorry, i really wanted to like this book but found that I couldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Deliver","review":"Eh. I'm more than a little disappointed. If you like the \\"Go Ask Alice\\" type of thing, this is the book for you. I didn't care for that one either. The whole time I was reading \\"The Torn Skirt\\" I kept thinking to myself, 'is this repetitive melodrama or is it just me?'"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it was going to be better....","review":"I had high expectations for this book and I bought it off amazon.com hoping it was going to be good. I was wrong. At first I thought the book was just off to a slow start and would eventually get better. I read the book in about a week and found hardly any improvement in it's entertainment value. I would have checked it out from the library except there wasn't a copy that wasn't lost. Although there were some decent parts, it wasn't enough to make me think this book was worth the money it costs. If you really want to read this book, buy it used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fresh? Brutally Honest? No.","review":"The writing is incredibly unsophisticated, which indicates one of two things: the writer is simply an unsophisticated writer or the writer was shooting for the \\"voice\\" of a teen, in which case she failed because no teen talks with that mixture of bad poetry and dimwittedness the writer attempts in this book. The fragments really put me off: lots of empty words, no substance. The whole opening fragment, for example, should have been cut from day one. Sex and drugs and masturbation are issues not often covered in a \\"fresh\\" or \\"brutally honest\\" way. This author is neither fresh, nor brutally honest. She's self-absorbed and artless. So is her character. This is one of those books that everyone would freak out over if a sixteen year-old had written it one crazy summer between sophomore and junior year. This proud holder of an MFA from Sarah Lawrence would do better as a staff reporter for the National Inquirer."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's so shocking about this?","review":"Supposedly this book is incredibly shocking and disturbing---nah. I've read worse. I got through half of it and stopped reading it, it disappointed me so much. I was building myself up because every review raves about it, but frankly, it ain't that great.Perhaps it's Godfrey's style that did it for me. I believe it's called stream of consciousness...? Anywho, it didn't sit well with me. When the narrarator has abstract thoughts floating in and out of her lines, the reader starts to feel as wasted as the main characters....Although maybe I'm being too harsh. I should have given it a fair chance by at least finishing it, but it was too much of a let-down. I expected more stomach-churching, gut-wrenching, gritty events...and it was more like a shrug-your-shoulders kind of deal.Plus, if the author has the character(s) use the f-word that much, it just shows they're trying too hard to come off as tough guys. It achieves the opposite effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"This book kind of sucked. I was sure I was going to like it but it failed to live up to some of the comments that others have said about it. I never really got into the story and the characters weren't at all people you would want to meet let alone read about. Save your money and buy a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed.","review":"I didn't care for this book, I think it's highly overrated. I think the author has seen too many movies that use flashback scenes, because she tried to use them all over the place in this novel and it just made it more incoherent."},{"rating":"1","title":"dumb","review":"This girl didn't really do anything that bad. And it was just unrealistic with the whole parenting situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"I assume anybody buying this title is because of Shannon Tweed. Let me tell you, there is only one love scene by Tweed. Therefore I give it one star just for the one love scene (not too bad though). The rest of the girls are nowhere as attractive as Tweed. The plot is ridiculous that is not worth mentioning. The sound quality of the DVD is terrible. You hardly can hear the dialog without turning up your center channel (If you want to hear the dialog at all). If you are looking for entertaining soft porn. Look elsewhere. Avoid this at all cost. One last note, this movie also known as \\"Singapore Sling\\" so don't be fooled."},{"rating":"2","title":"could be better","review":"First of all, this film is very short.

The reviews at the bottom of the page refer to the Soundtrack album with songs by Garth, Trisha, Dylan, etc., but in fact the CD in question at the top of page only contains the ORIGINAL SCORE from the movie and NONE of the songs by various artists.

Dumas is in jail waiting to be sentenced for manslaughter.

She has enjoyed this toy for almost a full year now. In the first week she had all the ribbons off of the toy and I'm still finding them from time to time under furniture. But, she still has a great time with the balls. She loves to throw the toy in the air and catch it and then try and pull it apart. Just a few weeks ago the elastic snapped from her using it too much and the green side went flying. I tried going to the local pet stores but after 4 or 5 stores I haven't been able to find the toy so I'm going to buy 2 more and hide one until this next one breaks.

If you like shows that teach you how to be a good friend, be yourself, and with a lot of humor, this is the show for you. This show has a lot of valuable lessons, but taught with a little humor.

Luigi Capuano's film focusing on the pirates and court of medieval Venice starring Gordon Scott and lovely Gianna Maria Canale is a joy to watch. The transfer is very good and film has not lost any of its charm. This will be a nice addition if you are collecting films covering European medieval period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lion Of St. Mark","review":"I recently purchased Sandokan Pirate of Malaysia, The Executioner of Venice , and Lion of St Mark. Stay Away From These Titles From Sinister Cinema! First of all the movie prints are of such bad quality you can barely watch them! The colors are faded, and dark, which means the original print must've been pretty bad to begin with . All three of these movies have been reviewed by one reviewer, Paul Scott , who gave 4 out of 5 stars for each movie. After seeing how truly awful these movies are ,one has to wonder how unbiased Mr. Scott's reviews are? Hopefully Amazon will have their movie review staff rereview the brand of movies being offered by Sinister Cinema, and check these movies out with unbiased reviews. The movie copies look like they've been recorded by some cheap home processing as the menus were done from a person using a home dvd recorder . Very tacky!! Buyers Beware!!!! I feel like I've ripped off, and you will too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A realistic, dramatic book","review":"I think an author has done his job when I want to enter the pages of his novel and talk to his characters. That's a testament to the complexity and realism of the personas you meet in this book, and to the vividness and high stakes of the struggles they face. Aside from that, no writer I know has a keener eye than Mr. Poyer for details that create verisimilitude. I was not alive in 1936, I have never been to Pennsylvania, never been to an oil field or oil refinery, and never participated in a hard-fought wildcat strike. But after reading this book I felt like I had been there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time Machine","review":"Years after reading this novel, I vividly remember many scenes from it. A gifted amateur boxer fights a real pro for high stakes. Poyer simultaneously describes the surroundings, the fighters, the action, and the strategy at a breakneck pace, but with crystal clarity. None of the fights I've seen in the real world were as vivid to me as the one I read about in this book. This novel puts you in the time and place and surrounds you with realistic characters. The characters do NOT act, talk, and think like modern Americans - they are people of their period in history, and again, all the details feel right. You sympathize with the characters on both sides of the conflict (with one exception, a somewhat two-dimensional villain). Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"a/k/a","review":"I had never heard of this movie, but I'm sure my friend Lupe is going to enjoy it. I just want to say thank you very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Documentary!!!!!!!","review":"I watched this film expecting to see a comedic, biographical portrait of a stoner comedian but instead, much to my surprise, witnessed a truly compelling political documentary about misguided government excess. Not that there weren't funny parts to it, but it was the seriousness of political underpinning that truly impressed me. To think that a stoner burn out who was selling bongs on the internet would end being aggressively targeted and martyred by an over-zealous federal prosecutor in her multi million dollar campaign to put Chong behind bars continues to boggle my mind. I was wondering why I hadn't heard of this film much sooner, but just read on the internet about how the feds raided the warehouse and seized the a/k/a Tommy Chong DVD's!!!!! The story just gets weirder! A must see film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this watch","review":"Terrible battery life, light doesn't illuminate well, settings are not intuitive.

I like how this curling iron has a temperature dial that allows you to adjust how hot you want the iron, and it heats up within seconds. I like that it is tourmaline ceramic which will lessen damage to hair, decrease frizz, and increase shine. The cord is also swivel on the end, which prevents the cord from tangling. If I purchase another curling iron with a larger barrel, I will buy a Hot Tools curling iron again."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy any hot tools products","review":"I have many curling irons, but I was looking for one made of tourmaline.

If you don't rush out and buy both for yourself @ a few copies for someone else than you need help!My personal favorites are as follows:From Real Day; all exellent, but 'Cracks & Daggers' has to be heard to be belived, a wonderful sound, fasinating timing, and intriguing lyrics that leave you hitting \\"repeat\\" over & over & over again!From 'Alice Peacock'; again, totally incredible! but I'd have to pick 'some things get lost' as my new #1, I'm a big guy & I was moved almost (ok, all the way) to tears by this one, thankfully \\"alabama boy\\" had me up & groovin' again in no time-what a masterpiece.Also 'Alice Peacock' has a seceret track! #14 !also a movie! you can't beat these!buy them both! you won't regret it! I garuntee it!sincerely,Brian S Snyder"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great blend of pop, country and rock.","review":"This is a record with uniform strengths. Alice Peacock's singing is subtle yet soulful; her songwriting is catchy but brainy, with great lyrical turns; and the arrangements are appealing -- at times harkening back to Globe Sessions-era Sheryl Crow.Lead track \\"Alabama Boy\\" grabbed me right away on the basis of a very confident lead vocal; \\"Bliss\\" is not the keyboard-heavy ballad you might expect from the title -- rather, an aggressive, whiny electric guitar and techno-ed up drumbeats lend this song a highly unusual and delicious vibe. \\"Imagination\\", co-written with Indigo Girl Emily Saliers, progressive from a moody, bass-heavy verse to a soaring, beautifully harmonized chorus; and \\"Some Things Get Lost\\" takes things into a more conventional route, a smoky, old-time piano ballad that works fine thanks to Peacock's singing. She is very good at delivering even the most sugary melodies while keeping her voice earthy, strong and textured.A wonderful record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing!","review":"Alice has an absolutely gorgeous voice, which is the perfect compliment to her insightful lyrics. Her songs are about things we can all relate to, and really tap into the full range of human emotion. I believe two of the songs on this new album are co-written by Emily Saliers from the Indigo Girls and Kristen Hall, a fabulous solo artist. You will not regret buying this CD . . . and if you have a chance to see her live, do it! Her web-site at www.alicepeacock.com lists her tour schedule and is very well done - can you tell I'm a big fan?????"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Surprise.......","review":"...Alice did it again with her 2nd CD! What a voice! There isn't one bad song on the entire CD. However, if I had to pick my favorite - I pick Alice and her piano on \\"Northern Star\\" - true honesty and grace as well as strong passion. My other favorites would have to be \\"Some Things Get Lost\\" (she has a great voice for ballads) and \\"Parallel Life\\". Although it took some getting use to, I do like the new versions of \\"I Hear You Say\\" and \\"I'll Be The One\\". Hopefully, we'll start hearing it in Columbus soon! Way to go Alice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have, solid CD","review":"When I first heard this CD by Alice Peacock, I was blown away. Even today, the song SOME THINGS GET LOST is enough to cause me to pause in reflection. Peacock's voice is filled with emotion and the skills necessary to pull off an amazing CD where other's fail. I have purchased and given away as presents several dozen copies of this CD to friends because I believe it is that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"a keeper","review":"Months ago I had heard the song \\"I'll Be the One\\" on the radio several times. I really liked the voice of the singer and it was one of the better new songs I was hearing at the time. It took a while to find out that the artist was Alice Peacock. I never heard of her until that one song, and it was quite some time before I was wandering through Best Buy and happened to see this album sitting on the shelf. I checked the track listing and decided to buy it. Buying an album for only one song is very risky, but this was a risk that paid off. This is an excellent album.The opening track of \\"Alabama Boy\\" is a great song to open the album with, and the album only gets better. \\"Bliss\\" and \\"I Hear You Say\\" are two of my new favorite songs and it is only in the slowest tracks that I feel the album loses anything, and even that isn't much.

I get it that he's trying to break the conformist in you, but *Example* telling you that parents don't really love their children, they are just scared of what will happen to themselves if something happens to their child, is flat-out freaking rediculous.Krishnamurti picks apart questions asked at the end of every chapter and basically answers the audience's question in the form of another question, hence, creating confusion and indirectness.

I plugged it in and used it right away without reading the instructions. I still have not read them and have no problem. I do wish the battery lasted a little longer. But than again I am on it all day, usually 7 hours before I get static. If the earpiece was a little smaller I would like it more as well but no real complaints here.

Films, produced and directed by Moustapha Akkad. He imagined it would become a Muslim holiday classic, sort of an Arabian \\"Ten Commandments\\", shown on TV every Ramadan. Not. The Western version starred Anthony Quinn as Mohammad's uncle; Akkad had to film a second version side by side, with an all-Muslim cast, to quiet Saudi protests. Yet protests dogged the film, forcing shooting to move from country to country, and terrorists did prevent the opening in NY (despite the fact that they hadn't seen the film!). Check out the film's chapter in the Medved brothers inHollywood Hall of Shame: The Most Expensive Flops in Movie History, which details all of the politics and catastrophic production decisions that doomed the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"British Invasion in one album.","review":"Okay, there are some major groups missing but this is a nice selection of songs that managed to get air play during the first British Invasion.I bought this on tape when this collection was first issued and I still have the tape. When I found the album in this great condition, I bought it to frame in my den.The sound is very warm and in keeping with the industry standard of that time. A lot of memories in these tracks and a lot of younger folks I know have gotten into The Small Faces, Donovan and Marianne Faithfull after hearing their tunes on this fine collection.It's difficult to realize how the years have sped by since these acts, along with the more prolific bands of the 60's ruled AM radio but the sounds are still valid, still get me up."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a bargan!","review":"Wow.... these look really nice and are VERY solidly constructed.

I thought it was exciting and that Fielding gave a good portrayal of a psychopath, Brad Fisher, and his victim Jamie. It reminded me of the character Colin Friendly in a previous book of hers. The only criticism I have is the ending was a bit abrupt, though it had a nice twist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After seeing Joy Fielding books on store shelves for a long time, I finally bought one, but if Mad River Road is typical of her stories, I won't be buying any more.The one thing she has going is the suspense. Yes, the story is plenty suspenseful, enough foreboding of future events to keep the pages turning. But the problem is, I don't LIKE any of the characters. The women make lifelong bad decisions and then we're supposed to think of them as victims? We're supposed to worry for them? Jamie, in particular, verges on criminally stupid. Emma is irresponsible, Lily is better but none of them provoke my concern, none really make me cheer them on. I truly do not understand why this is a bestseller. I'm guessing it's riding on the coattails of some of Joy Fielding's earlier books. Which I probably won't read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Story...Abrupt Ending!","review":"I enjoy Fielding's writing. I have read a few of her other pieces and find her to keep the story moving at a very fast pace as she presents the reader with several twists and turns. This work was no different. After having read her \\"Whispers and Lies\\" (which has one of the best endings of modern day fiction) I turned the pages of this novel faster than the Pope passes out holy cards, and I was rather disappointed as I got to the climax because it was so abrupt (however, not bad), it left me with a sense of wanting more and asking myself...Is this it? That's OK Joy, you kept me going and I enjoyed the ride. I will look forward to reading another one of her novels in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"I really loved this book. I can normally tell you what happens in the end by the 2nd chapter, but this one really threw me a curvball. I was happy with the ending and with the other characters viewpoints throughout the book. A little dark, but very hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"This was a first book of J. Fielding I read. A friend is trying to convince me to give a try to another one of her books. I did not have to get too far in the book to pretty much put together what's going to happen. The main character could not be more stupid, is that how Fielding views women? Fielding used characters that had absolutely nothing to do with, or contribute to the main story. The way I see it she needed to have more pages for the book, so she wrote, frankly, useless conversations to give it bulk. The book is very shallow, not a good fiction and not even \\"true\\" to real life, not a thriller. It leaves you empty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Format","review":"The size of the book is VERY annoying. Because it's 4\\" x 7.5\\" it's difficult to read.

You see, if uses the same power connector as the Treo, so you only need one power cord to charge up both (not at the same time, of course). If you don't have a spare charger for your phone, this essentially gives you one for free.

The position on my ear is awkward. It flops around and will actually fly off my ear if I turn my head too quickly.2. The speaker does not line up in front of my eardrum unless I rotate the unit with the mic facing almost upward.3. Volume is marginal - OK for quiet locations but not for stores, airports, etc.4. People on the other end report a slight echo. As soon as I deactivate the headset, the echo goes away.5. I hear a clicking whenever I use it, no matter how close the piece is to my 650.On the positive side, it uses the same charger as the phone. Ummmm... that's about it.I really don't want to return this (what a pain!), but I probably will. Just too many problems.

The features it offers such as being able to mute the call or switch to another incoming call and put the first caller on hold are convenient, but the signal quality is terrible. The only time there wasn't any interference was when I held my Treo 650 two inches from the headset, so I might as well have just used the Treo without the headset.I tried calling several people, and they all stated that I was breaking up. I also missed out on parts of their conversations because of the interference. I have a Motorola HS820, which I changed out with the Treo headset on the same call to test the signal quality.

Musically, its another mixed bag; the title track cooks with Stones-y aploomb (it is rumoured that Keith Richards played on it), as does 'Rebel Rebel'. The long melody of 'Sweet Thing' sometimes grates, but adds to the 'concept album' air of the album. Other recommended cuts- the spooky-sounding 'We Are The Dead' and 'Big Brother'.

The CD has generally poor, flat sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"1/8th inch blade","review":"This blade was shipped promptly and was very well wrapped.

Duran Duran's roots were in night clubs (where their videos \\"Girls on Film\\", Hungry Like the Wolf\\" -- among others -- were first introduced in New York and other U.S. night spots). I was always a big fan of their remixes -- whether it was \\"Girls on Film\\" or \\"Notorious\\" or \\"Planet Earth\\". Duran Duran's task (to maintain their longevity as a group) is to do more dance-oriented material. That strategy will not only keep their original fans like myself, but gain legions of new fans as well. I think they're starting to do just that. Recently (March 1999), Duran Duran came out with a revamped version of \\"Girls on Film\\" that I heard on the New York New Wave/New Music station WLIR (92.7 FM). Great remix!! It's do well in clubs.Overall, this is a great CD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the coolest Duran albums ever","review":"Definitely one of the coolest Duran albums ever.

Actually, I could have written something better than this. If I were given this free, I would throw it away. The 101 sample toasts are contrived and would, in my opinion, sound so coming out of your mouth at your friend's wedding. I was hoping to find some valuable, useful information and words I could put into my toast by buying this book. Not only did I not find these things, but I would be embarrased to say most of these things he writes. Speak from your heart about your friend and his new wife, you'll be much better off.

That said, after this review is posted, I will shred this item into as many pieces as possible, and use the remains to build a fire in an attempt to exorcise my blunder. I could have crapped on a sheet of paper and produced a more remarkable work.

First, the book is filled with anecdotal reports, which are intended to be a guide to training. The problem with this approach is that every dog is an individual! What worked for the author's dog, Trapper, will not necessarily work for mine. Second, the \\"Health Care\\" chapter contains ridiculous advice. The author recommends taking your dog to an herbalist, accupuncturist, or chiropractor. When she includes such bizarre recommendations without any data to illustrate that they work, it is an indictment of the rest of her book. If you want cute pictures of border collies that warm your heart, this book is as good as any other. If, however, you are looking for advice on how to raise a border collie, there are other, more factual books out there that you should consider before this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whats that i see?

I therefore rather reluctantly bought the Register this year thinking the promised addition of On-base and slugging percentages would at least make the new Register better than the old ones. I was very disappointed, though, to find out that room had been created for OBP and Slug by dumping putouts and assists from the fielding stats. One of the few advantages the older Registers had was that they did not ignore a player's yearly fielding stats. (The Stats Handbook only provided them for the past season.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't just appreciate it for what it is.","review":"You must face facts. This book killed the revolutionary STATS Major and Minor League Handbook series.The Sporting News is over 125 years old, and it shows in this book.

It doesn't have a lot or worked examples and so can't really be thought of as an introductory tutorial. It is very thorough and provides a moderately deep overview of the subject. Undergrad engineering math is a prereq for understanding the book.

It broadened my horizons of what music can be, free of the constraints of convention.The whole ride (60 min) is one orgasmic musical pleasure like I had not known.Set time aside time for this alone with a good stereo and/or headphones and expect a lot because you're going to get it.

Harkening back to his earliest instrumental/rock symphonic works, Amarok is for those who love the concept of Tubular Bells. Ommadawn was my favorite Mike Oldfield CD until I heard Amarok. Amarok is truly original, inspired, creative, different, and challenging. Sound effects, spoken words, and those unique sounds he gets out of his guitars all add to the mystic feeling of this work.

It is not particularly well written, and the stories presented are unbelievably sanguine. It sounds as though the author simply asked the women what they wanted in the book and wrote it as a panacea to them; there is no critical eye. Obviously, the author is not a trained journalist or a polished writer. Additionally, most of the more interesting information, e.g. on Pat Schroeder or Sandra Day O'Conner, can be found in their much better written autobiographies.

It shows us that when we allow the full participation of women, everyone gains. And it raises questions as to why women were not permitted or were not welcome to the corridors of power and influence before, now that we have proven that we can make a contribution and the world will not end. Look at Karen Hughes and Condaleeza Rice in this Administration to see the contributions women are making in leadership that they were not making 10-15 years ago.

If you don't have this goal in mind - don't bother.The book is really wordy, boring, slightly amusing, and quite pointless. Murder mystery very much like those by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, although completely lacking any hint of brilliance, set in a 14th century monastery, injected with some doctrine, some history, some Latin. (And when I say \\"some\\", I mean a lot). It leaves you with a lingering aftertaste of wasted time and trees.The author has an obsession with written word and should stick to semiotics."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"Maybe I lack the classical training needed to appreciate this book. I found it tedious. The author is continually going off on long philosophic or pedantic discussions that as far as I could see had nothing to do with the development of the characters or the plot. After the first third of the book I found myself skipping many pages at a time to get to the place where he dropped the intellectual tedium and got back to the story.

The underlying themes went far beyond the apparent murders in the monastery. The writing is at times scholarly but clear and profound.

Umberto Eco has created a fluid narrative where there is a perfect balance between disparate elements. The story is seamlessly intertwined with historic exposition. The characters work both as devices of satire and as unforgetable people. They inhabit a world that is both magical and believable. The story has both the detail of a small mystery and the sweep of an epic drama. The hero is brilliant, but imperfect. The narrator is both objective and passionate. The book is about the search for the truth, but it is also a meditation on humanity's eternal state of mystery"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Knew High School Latin Would Come in Handy Someday.","review":"Humor is the central theme of this medieval mystery. William of Baskerville is the Holmesiansleuth who stumbles into a web of secrets that explode into murder.Every time I read this book I find new jokes. But behind and around the humor is a story rich inhistorical detail. The central mystery of the story is complemented by philosophical, religious,and historical puzzles.One of the more challenging puzzles is the use of language. While you don't need to be a polyglotto enjoy The Name of the Rose, it certainly helps.There are a number of untranslated lines in Latin, German, French, Italian -- and -- there's onecharacter who speaks a twisted amalgam of all languages. Some readers have found this distracting. I tookit on as a challenge and enjoyed the linquistic tangles."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am not smart, but smart enough to recognize a great book.","review":"I am no literary genius and parts of Eco's books are difficult for me to get through, but the read was worth it. I rarely come away from reading historical novels with such a feeling of what it may have actually been like to live and think in the time it was written. Eco makes me want to learn more about the subject of his books and makes me really think about his characters minds. Each of his characters are vivid and their motivations give insight into the 14th century. How infrequent were bastions of rationalism like Brother William at the time of the novel? Eco leads me to believe that this novel could have actually happened and this makes it even more rewarding for me. Also the movie \\"The Name of the Rose\\" is excellent also."},{"rating":"2","title":"the perfect novel","review":"Contrary to what some people say, it is not necessary to be an expert on medieval history etc. to appreciate certain parts of the novel. the more involved parts of the novel about medieval history etc. teach you about the subject. If Eco assumed to much out of a reader he would not be considered a good novelist. anyway be prepared to contemplate many thought provoking ideas, learn about the politics of the Roman Catholic church in the middle ages, go through a day in the life of a medieval monk, and if this was not great enough you get to enjoy an intricate and thrilling plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please ignore an bad reviews of this book - here's the deal","review":"Let's start with the basics: This is a mystery novel. It is also a history lesson,a meditation on the abuses of power, and an argument for logic's inevitable triumph over ignorance. Not so bad so far, eh? How 'bout this - it's an enjoyable read. Honest. You will not be bored, I promise.Hell, you might even pick up a little extra knowledge about...oh, let's say the Cathars, for example. That's more than you'll pick up from Oprah's book-o-rama, or the latest CyberPunk tome. In the end, you'll wish that this book had been a few hundred pages longer - no, I'm not joking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant book, Brilliant parallels.","review":"William of Baskerville represents Sherlock Holmes. Why? 1st. The name is a clear indicator.( Hound of the Baskervilles ) 2nd. he is english. 3rd. He finds answers throuh logic. 4th. He is described very similarly to how Arthur Conan Doyle describes his sleuth. Adso represents Watson. 1st. His name: Adso sounds a lot like Watson. 2nd. He narrates the story ( like Watson ) 3rd. He is Baskervilles faithfull companion. Jorge of Burgos represents Argentinian fabulist and poet Jorge Luis Borges. Why? 1st. They are both blind 2nd. They have similar names 3rd. Borges was made Argentinas Chief librarian 4th. Borges poetry contains many references to libraries being like labrynths.Where does this leave me, I dont know, I just wanted to point it out. I know for a fact that Eco loves Borges, but why he used him in this book is beyond me. Nevertheless, excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books of all time","review":"As I first read \\"The Name of the Rose\\", it must now be well over 10 years ago, I was facinated by the murder mystery. Later on it was Ecos' fabulous discriptions (I even drew my own lay-out of the labyrinth) I must have read it over the years at least 10 times including in different languages to better my skills. I only wish I could read it in its original italian. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars is not enough for this extraordinaire book","review":"I don't know what edition some reviewers were reading, but my spanish edition (I'm from M��xico) comes with the translation of latin passages.Reading this book made me feel more educated, well read and intellectual, because it made me study and investigate more about medieval history and Latin. Besides, I don't think you have to learn latin to understand the book (The latin phrases don't add much to the story or plot). It's full of mistery, and medieval history and that's what I liked about it. Why does it always have to be the Americans who complain about other languages?? It happened with Inglourious Basterds and Pan's Labyrinth... I just don't get it. This is not a complicated book at all, I think Foucault's Pendulum was complicated. This one was a pleasurable reading. I can't wait to read the rest of Eco's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Umberto Eco could write something like this!","review":"This fascinating book is something only a genius as Umberto Eco can write.In this book, he managed to describe monk's life in the monastery, a complete psycological review of all the characters and all the clerical environment which includes the struggle between the different parts, the struggle between the pope and the monarchy and the Inquisition.I read the book several times, each time with emphasys in one of these aspects. First time as a mistery novel, second time as a middle ages essay, third time as a essay about religion and its paradigms, fourth time as a phylosophical discussion about \\"laughing\\" (special attention to the final chapters) and many other times as a unique masterpiece.No one can pass without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magnificent first. Eco can really tell a story.","review":"Eco's first attempt at a work of fiction is as rich and complex as one would expect from an experienced novelist. Not only does Eco tell a fascinating mystery, he also tells it with the accuracy and realism of a historical work. The subtle agenda of present-day philosophy creeps into the book as well. No where else have I seen a fusing together of Pre-Modern, Modern, and Post-Modern views and ideals."},{"rating":"2","title":"The novelist as charismatic show off","review":"Man, Umberto Eco really, REALLY knows a lot about the middle ages. And what a charming, horrifying, messy age it was. This book feels almost pressurized by the amount of erudition in it. He loves weaving together all of these layers of puzzles, labyrinths, and religious hallucinations into the mix, which both reinforce and distract from the main murder-mystery set up in a thoroughly delightful way. Kind of like with Borges and Cervantes, books and bookishness seem more like the raw substance that Eco works with rather than merely a subject or style he uses. I had trouble keeping the court intrigues of the various heretical factions straight in my head, but I was so engaged that I wasn't too bothered by it. I for one think the world would be a much cooler place if there were monks trained in classical logic who roamed around the country side, solving crimes and being witty"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Latin practice","review":"Although this book contained a lot of church history that at times was hard to follow, I enjoyed reading it and trying to solve the mystery along with William and Adso. I was also happy to be able to practice my Latin. I was too lazy to look up unknown words in the dictionary, but I usually could figure out the basic meanings and sometimes I even had a complete translation. Very exciting! But the end of the book was hard to read, seeing all those manuscripts burning, mourning what was lost, even though it was a fictional fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive descriptions","review":"A long read but worth the time. Umberto Eco is the master of the art of decribing environments with words. I loved reading pages long descriptions of the middle ages environments and characters. If you like the book check the movie out too - a Sean Connery classic introducing Christian Slater."},{"rating":"2","title":"magnificent","review":"IFollowing one review published here,I would like to note I do understand that some poeple do not have time and energy to read some books, but that doesnot allowed them to speak about the book just because they\`ve heard it is valuable to read.I have read \\"The name of the rose\\" and find it very intriguing and written with tremendeous skill. Umberto Eco is one of the best novelist in the world. Not to many novelist are condsider good these days (if we speak about level of Tolstoy or Dostoyevski). What I find most fascinated regarding Eco\`s novels, particulary this one is that \\"smell\\" of middle century. Literally you can feel the atmosfere of the monastery and the dialogues are beyond the ordinary...At the end, no one can read Dostoyevski but everyone can read Helen Fielding. I dont want to insult but that does not means she will be remmembered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable!!!","review":"I was given this book for my birthday and I tried to read it. I had such a hard time reading the book which seemed to drag on and on. Eco seems to go into tangeants and details such mundane scenes that I didn't get past page 30. I am an avid reader and have read everything from fiction to non-fiction to classics. I just couldn't get into the book and found it difficult to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a 5-star read","review":"To potential readers: don't pick this one up if you are looking for an easy read. There was more of a focus on the philosophy and religion of the era than on the murder mystery, which I wish I had known before I picked up the book. I did find parts of the book to be pretty good, but for me it wasn't worth struggling through 400 pages to enjoy the other 100. If you aren't interested in religion, philosophy, and history of this time period, you probably won't get much out of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to expectations","review":"While I found Eco's writing to be quite good, the book fell short of my expectations as a mystery novel. It seemed to move too slowly, and digress way too often. I had read reviews suggesting that the book is a mystery for history lovers, but that statement should be amended to only include the history of religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many speeches, not enough focus on character & narrative flow","review":"2-1/2 stars. It obviously took much research and skill to write such a book in such a manner, but that doesn't mean its the most readable thing ever written. I can only go through so many speeches about whether laughter is good or evil and whether purposely not owning anything beyond the clothes on your back is good or evil before boredom sets in. The monastic setting of this book is fascinating and in addition to being very educational, technically the plot is action packed with a monk getting killed every day and a predecessor to the Sherlock Holmes & Watson team trying to figure out the mystery before the next death. Yet it manages to read like a dissertation on religion in the days of yore rather than an edge of your seat whodunnit, and that kept me from rounding up to 3 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learn Latin first","review":"The other reviewers either must have been paid by the publisher, or are monks. Here is what you really need to know. It promises a great mystery, and was actually suspenseful, but very anticlimactic. The book is more philosophy than mystery. In addition, you really need to learn Latin before reading this book. There are many Latin phrases, in which entire pages discuss the phrase, but without knowing Latin the reader is lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"Am I the only reviewer who found this book to be utterly pretentious? The author's main goal seems to be to see how many words he can cram into one sentence. No one in my book club could get through this drivel. I've read another of Eco's books (The Island of the Day Before) and it was much more readable. Perhaps the translator was partly to blame, since a friend of mine read it in a different language and really enjoyed it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two, two, two books in one, not counting the Postscript","review":"TNOTR is two books uncomfortably mated in one manuscript. One is a conventional, not very unusual historical mystery novel, a pastiche of the Sherlock Holmes stories with Occam thrown in. The other is a tedious textbook on heresy. If you must read this book consider skipping every other chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my all-time favorites","review":"Thank you for the opportunity to write about a classic story I had the pleasure of reading a few years ago. It is one of my favorite vhs movies and look forward to seeing the dvd in letterbox form."},{"rating":"2","title":"translation leaves stuff out","review":"I was given a copy of Il Nome della Rosa and, because my Italian is only so-so, started to compare it with the English translation to make sure I was missing nothing. I wasn't - but the translor was! For those who found the medieval details a bit dry (I am not one of them) you should know that already on p. 3 of the text (excluding Ecco's prologue, which I did not check) half a dozen lines of text have been omitted. I don't know who made the decision, but when you are publishing a book that is going to be over five hundred pages anyway, why trim phrases here and there? (Especially when adding a lengthy introduction by David Lodge!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"1300 medieval Italy","review":"Adso de Melk, a young Benedictine novice, follows Franciscan Brother William of Baskerville, to facilitate a meeting between Pope John XXII's and Louis the Bavarian's emissaries. Through their journey, they end in an Italian Abbey. There they will find a large library, protected fiercely by the Abbot and a librarian, a body of monks who diligently copy and illustrate books. The Abbey has many mysteries and several deaths follow. The book takes us in a fascinating journey of emotions and beliefs in the 1300 century. The days of Adso and his reflections are majestically described. It made reflect on how many injustices were made in the name of God. I found the first pages hard to follow, yet the book is easier to follow after the first chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can be a difficult read","review":"This book had a fantastic story and was rich in characterisation and setting however the book often used difficult and rare words, latin and introduced a vast array of characters which at times was hard to keep track of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knowledge to Conserve or to Share","review":"The historical context within which this story takes place adds depth to the novel that would otherwise be missing. I agree with other reviewers, the ending sequence is obvious and a bit of a let down. But the journey up to the closing sequence, and the themes explored along the way, makes for an interesting read.The idea that the conflict in this novel centers around the role of laughter in theology isn't accurate. Whether knowledge should be conserved, worshipped, restricted, and elitist, or whether knowledge should be open, accessible, shared, and inclusive represents a more accurate focus for the book. Though obvious, the ending answers the question for us. Restricted knowledge is ultimately wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"suspenseful and intelligent","review":"I am not much of a suspense/thriller fan, but this book captivated me completely, probably because it is not our contemporary \\"suspense\\" fiction. Obviously, it is extremely well written with vivid and lively scenes and characters, but also it is written on solid and skillfully layered foundations of universal curiosity on important issues and the conflicts between them. God, Devil, human intellect, free will, politics, and survival of political and religious entities in the intellectually mobile culture etc, bring so much depth to this book. Reading this book was a wonderful way of starting my new year."},{"rating":"2","title":"WE ONLY HAVE ITS NAME","review":"We have given so many names to some things that at the end only the name remains. This book is a real masterpiece , written in a simple form in the guise of a mystery novel, the book takes us down to the middle ages and to monastic life, that life which seems so unhealthy, it takes us through grimmy corridors and a maze like library which is full of mystery.this book is by any means more than it seems.In one day it shows us the rituals of the monks and his bad habits too. hope you enjoy it and analyze it."},{"rating":"2","title":"When you listen with your soul the cd is very powerful.","review":"I think that Sarah Mclachlan's cd surrfacing is a treat because you can relate to it on a different level of enjoyment. If one can feel the pain or the happiness I think that it will help you enjoy the songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sarah, enough of the same song over and over!","review":"I am a huge fan of Sarah McLachlan and always will be, though one area she's weak in is her choice of b-sides for her singles. Not surprisingly, Sarah provides us with 5 remixes of the same song, and it grows quite tiresome. The radio mix of the song is great, placing a higher emphasis on her gorgeous voice, though the same cannot be said for the dance remixes. Sarah's songs nor her voice are suitable for a dance remix. Can you honestly say it's enjoyable to hear her say \\"Sweet Surrender\\" over and over? Whenever Sarah releases another album, I hope she puts some amazing b-sides on her singles."},{"rating":"1","title":"pleasant but flawed","review":"A pleasant read, but Ms. Buck has some homework to do. First let me mention her command of English, or lack thereof. At times we know what word she meant, even when she apparently does not. Unexceptional, for example, is not the same as unexceptionable, nor is credible, at all the same as creditable. After a few of these, one begins to wonder what she does mean. Then, dear Ms. Buck, allow me to offer a piece of advice: there is no surer route to tedium than to tell everything. The Chester houseparty went on for weeks, but after a few pages detailing who sat beside whom to no apparant purpose, most readers must be willing to pack up and go home. That said, I ought to allow that there is a credible love story here, a young woman has jilted an unexceptionable young man whom, much to her credit, she now comes to regard with quite exceptional tenderness. What I found exceptinable, was the amount of tedium en route."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! WONDERFUL BOOK!","review":"What a great story. I was into it from page one and I didn't want it to end. The characters are wonderfully written. The story has a great flow. I could not put it down. Never a boring spot. I will be purchasing more Christie Golden! A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted","review":"I am a jewelry designer myself and it often inspires me when I see interesting jewelry by other artists. My work is sometimes considered to be a bit out there, but definitely wearable. So photos are important to me, not prose. The first part of this book is essays which may please others but not me. The rest of the book is indeed photos, but most of the work isn't wearable and much of it isn't interesting to me. Much of it is more art, less jewelry. Lots of it was tacky-looking, in my opinion. I often get inspiration from all kinds of non-jewelry things; nature, fabrics, clothing, shapes, materials. These pieces didn't do anything for me. I was really disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating book - especially if you've been to the area","review":"This book gives the reader a nice glimpse of what life is like in this remote coastal area, and also of the sense of community that is difficult to grasp if you're only passing through. And, seaplanes are just fun to read about - this book talks about many different ones for a real learning experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating at best","review":"The sheer style of writing in this book made it nearly impossible for me to get through the first few chapters. It felt like the author was talking to a first grader instead of an adult. There are so many fluff words which are not necessary to the actual content that I found myself looking for a needle in a haystack. I simply could not see the forest for the trees in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Simple Truth About Nutition","review":"The title sums it up!

He appreciates the wide spaced slots for keeping multiple folders organized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I got this 23.2-inch organizer and the 11.375-inch model too. Both fit perfectly into my file cabinet, but I prefer the 11.375 organizer because the spacing between the wire spacers is smaller. I put just one folder in each space so that they stand up straight, making the folder label very easy to see and identify. I ordered another 11.375 organizer to put in the same file cabinet drawer. I have the 23.2 incher down below in the lower drawer for bigger file folders like ones stuffed with old letters and product manuals, as well as folders I don't access very often so I can bunch them together with other folders in the same space. It's not as easy to identify them that way, because they tend to lean into each other, but if they're folders you don't access very often it doesn't matter and the folders take up less space."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for 1\\" binders!","review":"I am a teacher and I keep everything organized in 1\\" binders and then I needed a way to keep the binders themselves organized and this was PERFECT!

Shane Gulliver and Mark Tate are stationed in Basra. When their company's captain is killed during a mission, they capture two alleged suspects and are told to use whatever means necessary to extract information (i.e. torture). This film captures the difficult task of maintaining a personal code of ethics inside a powerful organization like the military. With the success of docs like 'Taxi to the Dark Side' and 'Standard Operating Procedure', hopefully this film will continue to spotlight the military's blatant disregard for the standards of the Geneva Convention.

The chapters on how chemicals are tested (Chapters 6, 7 and 8) were not as interesting as the rest of the book, but if anyone is using this as a college textbook, these chapters would be more important. Chapter 8 which discusses some of the major chemical spills as well as air and water pollution was very useful. I also liked reading about some of the drug recalls and how it is possible that new toxicity is found after all of the testing done before drugs are approved. Chapter 11-The Study of Risk- is absolutely necessary for everyone to read.

Every radio station in America plays these songs every hour, over and over and over again. Not to mention their endless display on MTV. The worst part is that these actually top the charts every time and go at least triple platinum, which just encourages the record companies to keep releasing these, driving artists who actually put passion and creativity into their music further and further into obscurity.So do yourself a favor and listen to a college radio station or any other non-commercial radio for your music, this is just the clearest example of big corporations telling you what to listen to and purchase.And if you must have these songs, just download them for free on a Peer to Peer, no need to pump more money into this big corporate scheme."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH RAP","review":"I LOVE THE NOW SERIES BUT NOT NOW 21.

But what really drives it is Deborah Cox' wonderful voice. This new version of the song is a powerful dance track that ignites an already wonderful song. The original release was a slower more hip hop jam that accompanied a sound track and was released as a single. This version is all dance. The haunting lyrics, sung any other way, would bring tears. But Deborah sings them like a woman dying of thirst in the desert. You can actually hear her throaty breath in several portions of the song, and you believe her pain. She puts true emotion into the song, and it comes alive. You dance and you listen to her vocal power, but you never lose sight of the yearning in her voice, nor the meaning of the lyrics.

Maybe I am wrong, check it out for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, I'll never waste money on this author again","review":"I generally prefer non-fiction, but like the occasional mystery/legal thriller. This was a bad choice. It is light on character development, has an awkard pace, and then introduces one of the most implausible plot lines I have ever read in this genre. The trial is interesting, but that's about it. The final dozen or so pages seem like they are from a differnt book, and don't fit with the plot. Even the very last page of the book; the main characters are celebrating, yet don't mention a single word about one of the more emotional issues in the book. Could be the most forgetable book I have read. Unless for some reason you have an affinity for this author and his work, I would highly suggest look elsewhere for an entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great legal thriller. Lescroart is great! Weird ending...?","review":"This is my favorite one from Lescroart. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and the character development throughout. It was classic Perry Mason-Law and Order with the murder mystery in part 1; the courtroom drama in part 2. And then the author does himself an injustice with his kind of convoluted ending that came way out of left field. In my opinion the book could have just ended with us finiding out what happened and could have done without the weird ending. The first 2/3 of the book is interesting enough. Dismas Hardy and Abe Glitzky are great characters. What is the point of a whodunnit if the ending is so far out there from what you have been reading that it is impossible to figure out. I did however enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally not believable Plot!","review":"I don't want to give away the \\"MOTIVE\\" for the killing, but it is totally not believable. I am very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and Awkwardly Paced","review":"I've read a couple of Lescroart's books and found them fairly entertaining. But this one was fustrating. Too many characters having meaningless dialogs for no good reason (speculations on things they had no control over). I stopped reading at page 120 or so (too many good books out there to waste your time on one that you find fustrating and inane).Inspector Glitsky's madding political correctness on sexual harrassment by one of his detectives was silly. He has a long drawn out discussion with Hardy about it without even having spoken to the detective involved. Duh. The detective involved, Cuneo, has so many unattractive personal traits that he can't keep a partner with the SFPD. Yet he's this sexual stud? Doesn't say much for the women of San Fransisco. I only read about 30% of the book. I just got fustrated with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pieces don't fit.","review":"I liked the beginning and I was initially intrigued, but things went downhill fast starting with the introduction of the police character Cuneo - a stereotypical egotist, male chauvinist, lazy, and not too bright cop. The story leads the reader from one boring scenario to the next and then into a long drawn out trial which is like a rehash of what preceded. Finally, in the end you learn of what might have taken place, but it's so out of the blue that you're left feeling led on. I doubt I'll read any more by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top of the line thriller ... again","review":"Stories full of gritty, realistic characters. Plots that hurtle forward at breakneck speed. Unpredictable twists, even for silverback mystery readers ... John Lescroart is quite simply one of the most underappreciated best-sellers in American letters today. His Dismas Hardy/Abe Glitsky series is as sharp as Turow and Grisham, and \\"The Motive\\" does nothing to dim the light that rightfully shines on his work. There should be more. If you haven't yet picked up a Lescroart crime fiction, \\"The Motive\\" isn't a bad place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and engrossing","review":"I loved the story, however I felt there were too many different plot lines. I would have liked to have the \\"Beck\\" story line more complete, along with Hardy's other relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Courtroom Thriller","review":"I consider John Lescroart one of the best crime fiction writers on the scene today. I look forward to his books and have not been let down yet. The current entry in the series is no exception. The plot, which revolves around Hardy's defense of his first love in a double homicide, grabs you from the first page and does not let go until the climatic ending. His characters of Dismas Hardy and Abe Glitsky feel like real people who are sometimes flawed, mostly complex and often admirable. Glitsky is dealing with some pretty heavy health issues with his newborn son in this story. The characters continually evolve within the story, book to book. Hardy and Glitsky are not the same men they were in the beginning of the series. Lescroart fans will not be let down, and new readers will be reading the backlist after this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great legal thriller.","review":"Dismas and Abe have a strong, realistic friendship and personal lives. Lescroart obviously knows and loves San Francisco to the point that it almost becomes another character in the story. The story itself is interesting and involved me from beginning to end.

They are awesome books!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Lindsey Ever!","review":"I have read every one of Johanna Lindsey's books. I own them and love them. This is the worst book I have ever read of hers. It doesn't have the same style, the plot is forced, the emotions aren't real or believable and it was a struggle for me to finish it. If you love her books, it will be a struggle to keep reading it instead of throwing it away before finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, to say the least","review":"Lindsey was one of my favorite authors when I first started reading romance novels, but this one falls short. Even if you can get past all the implausibility of the plot (what romance novel doesn't have those) and accept the situation as is, there's still the incredibly trite, cheesy, clich�� \`Raven' moniker to deal with. And we hear it over and over and over.And with the exception of the grandmother, none of the characters are remotely interesting. The mystery portion of the story fizzles out with a most unsatisfactory explanation, and the rest of it is just plain dull. It's the sort of book that, the day after you finish it, you can't remember a single thing about.There are tons of better romance novels out there, including many by Lindsey. Do yourself a favor and skip this one, go read one worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the REAL Johanna Lindsey?","review":"I too adored Johanna's earlier books and I was willing to forgive much, but this latest offering left me cold. With cardboard characters, anachronistic and stilted dialogue, a sketchy and improbable plot, it, and several books before it, must have been written by someone else! I was annoyed by the overuse of \\"bloody\\", on every page at least, perhaps to increase the word count? Save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not come across as a romance novel","review":"This is the first book review i've written...ever. The only reason i'm writing this one is because i actually bought this book full price at B&N; for a last minute trip i had to take thinking \\"you can't go wrong with Johanna Lindsey\\", and ended up hating it...profusely.I have always loved reading Johanna Lindsey's books, but unfortunately the past few that have recently come out have really sucked. This one is a good example of one. It seems as if Ms. Lindsey \\"attempted\\" to write a mystery novel and then added the romance as an after thought. The characters were dull and boring, didn't seem as if the author put much care into developing them. Did Ms. Lindsey really write this? I couldn't help but think that perhaps someone else wrote the book and just burrowed her name to publish it, the style is so different from her older more interesting books i've enjoyed reading. I think from now on, her books will have to be burrowed from the library instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"tame","review":"OK. The writing is obviously NOT Johanna Lindsey's style. There are just too many coincidences replacing an actual plot. There is no sense of the time period that Lindsey could embroider into her story. The humor is silly. The characters are just plain plain! The romance is shallow where you expect steam to rise from the pages -- if you read her earlier work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too apathetic to be disappointed.","review":"I have loved reading Johanna Lindsey books for a long, long while. I was excited to get this book. That was a short lived emotion. Overall it is OK. It isn't cringe worthy. I guess my problem with it is that it lacks the typical hook of most Lindsey books, regardless of how formulaic they can be. In reading this story I found that I just didn't care. At this point, I'm not even sure I remember the entire plot... you can see how vibrant the images were! not! If you love Lindsey, grab a copy from the library... live through the disapointment of this lackluster book and spend your money on something that will keep you awake, like a good cup of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to recommend it","review":"I hate to \\"me too!\\" all the other negative reviews, but... me too! Lindseys used to be my secret indulgence that I was embarrassed to admit I really enjoyed. Now I'm embarrassed to admit I spent good money for this one. REALLY contrived plot, really one-dimensional, unlikable characters, and absolutely no authenticity for the time period the story was set, except a constant use of the contraction \\"at'all\\", which was jarring and silly. Really, choose another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"I read this book in 2005 when i was deployed. I enjoy the story every time i read it. It is romantic and just wonderful.

I completely agree with the first two reviewers--there were terrible characters, poor writing, and horrendous plot development--finally, it felt like she finally got bored and decided to wrap up the entire story in the last two chapters so she could finally put an end to it. It was so disappointing that I had to check the inside cover three times to make sure this was truly was a book Johanna Lindsey had written."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story falls apart","review":"This book started out with some promise. I agree with the other reviewer, the hero and herione didn't seem to really like each other. It was more like it was time to interject the love scene.The loose ends were neatly tied up at the end with a disappointing payoff. There was no emotional build up at all.The unrealistic points such as Maggie living alone at 23 or her being a ward of a family friend didn't bother me as much as the way they tied up the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scandalous to pay the price!","review":"Second waste of money for my business trip! I wanted something light and entertaining. Never read Johanna Lindsey so thought this should be a nice piece of fluff. What a waste of money.It started out pretty well and I kept hoping after the hero and heroine met it would take off! What a DUD. The plot was endless drivel and the solution was in the twilight zone. I didnt like either the hero or the heroine. They had no depth. And the love story - - this is love???Well, the aiport bookstore and Ms Lindsey made money on me.

The pieces are a fine introduction to these composers: once you get turned on, you might explore their lesser known (some might say more \\"difficult to enjoy\\") works (Bartok's sonata for solo violin, his Miraculous Mandarin, and Kodaly's sonatas for solo cello, cello and violin, etc. and his choral works)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and function!","review":"This chain is adorable, brightly colored with interesting wooden shapes that my little teether just loves to chew on (in fact, I think the chain itself spends more time in his mouth than the pacifier does). He likes to look at it alot, too, and feels the different textures with his fingers (the swirl on the circle and the dots on the bowtie are slightly indented). My only concern is that the nose on the bear is not of a piece with the bear's head; it *seems* pretty securely fastened to it, but I do worry about a choking hazard. Luckily, if you clip the bottom of the chain far enough down his outfit, he can't get the bear's nose into his mouth, so as long as it's clipped securely it's a non-issue.

He writes as he speaks--real country, real people"},{"rating":"2","title":"Country Boy Gone Soldiering","review":"The value of the book is in providing an authentic account of one man's life that is important and interesting. It's the story of real life by a very real person. It spans growing up in Virginia, early Army life and tours in Europe in WWII and in Korea. He has some very interesting experiences and touches many people, some famous, like General Omar Bradley, Marilyn Monroe and Joe Dimaggio. A well written book and a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Mustard","review":"I love this mustard, but cannot find it locally.

I suggest you read Storming Heaven.... Storming Heaven is about Dillon's mother and father, and about Tony Angelelli's mother.... If you read this one first you can get their background....

My father was involved in these events. Although I cannot say I enjoyed the book, ( because it was so realistic and tragic), I found it very ,very well written and so moving I lived with it for weeks. It is written entirely from the miners view, and is therefore one sided, but is nevertheless accurate in content. It is obvious that the author knew these people. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the history of this area. katydid"},{"rating":"1","title":"truly disappointing","review":"After the wonderful Storming Heaven I was so excited to read this book, and then so disappointed. The plot is melodramatic, the characterizations cardboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"An update since my last review.","review":"I have to admit that I have warmed to this album quite a bit since my last review. Other reviewers were right, it needs time to sink in. I am giving the album 4 stars only because of its incredible daring and sonic experimentation. There are a few tracks, like Ccec, that I still feel are unlistenable and my overall feeling is that many of the songs contain elements that just don't work together. A perfect example of this is the song Dropp in which a beautiful, haunting melody is played against an amazing rolling, inverted rush of washed out \\"beats.\\" Both elements of the song are great on their own, but the delicate melody gets torn to shreds by the violence of the percussive sounds. Still, there are amazing tracks like Rpeg, Maphive 6.1, and Pir that make this album a worthy purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disastrous!","review":"I must agree with the other reviewer from Berkeley,California. This is really their worst effort. Comparing this with their earlier work up to \\"Tri Repetae\\", I am driven to tears. There is no melodic and rhythmic power here anymore, just a messed-up, directionless sound. I think they were the greatest techno-act in the world, but after their masterpiece \\"Tri Repetae\\" they had no idea what to do and released completely superficial music. After this total disappointment with their new EP7, I will never buy any future release from Autechre."},{"rating":"1","title":"near unlistenable","review":"This is what I call going off the deep end. I thought Amber is one of the best ambient albums I've heard. But to my ears, ep7 is just a dissonant collection of noise. Perhaps one can appreciate the somewhat inventive way they interpret noise as music, but that's nothing new. Aesthetically speaking, it's difficult to stomach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's not be partial","review":"It is frustrating to me that fans of a given act will jump online and rate all of their respective albums highly. Where is the justice in only reading reviews coming from fans? EP7's reviews are this sort of scenario. I feel the album lacks the direction of Autechre's \\"Amber\\" and \\"Tri R-\\". This album is very difficult to listen to, as it stretches the drill and bass concept a bit too far. So then, I think it is only fitting that I rate EP7 low."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugly trash","review":"This cd is some kind of joke. Autechre used to be one of the leaders of ambient/idm.

Nine minutes, that like missing a whole track. Does Nothing think their fans are too dumb to realise it's even there?

Where they previously created fascinating sonic textures with touches of emotion, they now create unlistenable experiments in noise that induce headaches rather than fascination. Do they own stock in an aspirin company or something?The dried up talent of Autechre is a sad but clear sign that the golden years of electronica are gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Genuine Article","review":"I believe this recording to be the best Autechre album yet. Most listeners claim that Autechre's later works are weak because they don't sound like the \\"Autechre\\" that first debuted. I find these comments to be ignorant of the fact that any art must grow and change with time. In fact, the duo that makes up Autechre, Sean Booth & Rob Brown, mentioned in a 1999 article that their music was more about sound than emotion. Emotion is how the majority of average music listeners both consciously and subconsciously internalize music. Now don't get me wrong, emotional classification can be fun, and can lead to new ideas. Unfortunately, this is only the upper crust of interpreting music that has an organized structure. Yes, I do believe that the music Autechre produces is structured. What may seem on the outside to be chaos is a simple structure that binds the universe together. Open your mind further and listen to this CD many, many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"It aint so cold","review":"For all of the reveiws on amazon and otherwise that call Ep7 \\"cold\\" and \\"inaccessable,\\" it may be one of the most comforting disks I've got. As soon as one gets past the first reaction, this is a shockingly warm and unabashedly fun record, especialy for people into current glitch music. One feals like this was a hugely artistic undertaking for Autechre, yet at the same time just cuting loose. It seems like a constant, avant guard atempt to dodge populist hooks, then sudenly it sounds like bumpin fractal hip hop.We all though autechre was trying to fight off popularity and style biters, but it turns out the where just making a glitch soul classic further insider their own heads.

Director Eddie Romero patently believes that use of dialogue adds little to a movie's sense of purpose and as with a great deal of his work, this effort is composed essentially of long scenes of various combinations of men shooting at each other, but with such as the wooden Derek and the rather untalented Bronwyn Fitzsimons as leading players, it is perhaps an advantage to let the guns do the talking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book defines relationship marketing","review":"My teacher in grad school used this book in our database marketing class and Mr. Vavra hits the nail on the head.

The cardigans sing the only song that I've liked by them on the CD, and Abra Moores \\"four leaf clover\\" has poppy girl brilliance. September 67 sounds beautiful,and I can't really pull myself from the first cd to listen to the next. Lisa Loeb always has good songs, and Dayna Manning is promising, with a Jewel-esque voice.

Although the Reingers are evil, they have motivations as well. Although, they were still minimally explained. You could read this many times over and not get tired of it.

However, I like Diana Wynne Jones's books a lot. I read Howl's Moving Castle on recommendation of a friend and loved it. At the age of 34, I bought Hexwood in a 1st edition hardback on a whim and thought it was fabulous. It is a weird combination of archetypal fable, Arthurian legend, romantic story, and futuristic SF tale. It reminded me of the movie Pulp Fiction with its complete disregard of a linear timeline. I was consistently surprised as I read along, waiting anxiously for the next plot twist. Jones manages to keep all her plot twists in order and ties everything up at the end.

The introductions were done by Jennifer O'Neal and Jon Voight and they both were extremely amateurish. Voight was bouncing around the stage and acting very unprofessional like he was at a ho-down. It was a shame because Mr. Legrand is the composer of some of film's best loved themes and music. I've always loved the theme to \\"Summer of '42\\" as well as the music for \\"Yentl\\".

Was unable to reach anyone to rectify the problem. The costume says size 8-10, but actually fits a child of about size 5-6. Not well made.

Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cabanatuan , Murder Under the Sun","review":"I was disappointed in the book. Granted, one may take liberties in writing historical fiction, but within limits. The author describes an actual massacre during the Death March at a roadblock near the town of Balanga. True enough, but in actuality, that particular atrocity was suffered by loyal Filipino troops and not American soldiers as depicted in the novel. The life of a prisoner at Cabanatuan was horrendous, but the prisoners themselves discouraged escape. The Japanese established a \\"Rule of Ten.\\" All prisoners were members of individual ten man squads called, \\"blood brothers.\\" If, someone escaped, those squad members left behind could be summarily executed. This proved very successful in preventing escape at Cabanatuan. Therefore, group escapes as depicted in the novel did not ring true, and in fact, never happened at the prison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate in comparison with other Sociology Dictionaries","review":"I was so disapointed with this book! In comparison to similar dictionaries I have consulted,I found it to be quite inadeqate and at times not quite accurate in some of the explanations given.There were so many vital concepts,theorists,and theories absent, that it is not really possible to consider it a comprehensive reference for undergrad students embarking on a study of Sociology for the first time.I am almost at Doctoral level and I can honestly say I found relatively little in the book that was of any use to me, whereas I have other dictionaries which I purchased as an undergrad that I still find extremely useful when writing.

Temple does not set out to provide a critical commentary of the gospel but rather more personal devotional reflections. He writes in the introduction that he is writing as he perceives the Holy Spirit speaking to his mind and heart through John's gospel. As such an erudite scholar, his reflections are also filled with scholarly insights in addition to writing touching the heart and soul. His insights are presented by chapter and most verses and help one gain a better understanding of the gospel and to come to a closer relationship the the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Temple opens the book in simple yet profound ways that would be helpful to Christians of all levels of maturity. This book is definitely worth buying and reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reissue of 1988 Book","review":"Although published in November 2005, this a reissue of a book published in 1988, but it actually reads more like a book written in the 1950s!

And even in 1988 it seems dated that the bridesmaids were going to walk down the aisle wearing gold-mesh-and-pearl snoods and crinolines!

The best thing about it is that it covers all the bases orienting the reader to why six sigma is worth doing, priorities for aligning it with your business needs, and what you need to get in hand preparing to set up six sigma in your organization. You'll need other guides, too, of course. (Leading Six Sigma by Snee and Hoerl is another terrific reference for getting oriented to what's worked and what hasn't in various organizations' deployment of Six Sigma.)

The original manga version is simple, short, and sweet. Unfortunately, the anime version I'm reviewing now is the exact opposite. While the zany plot is more or less retained, the execution is what kills the MTC anime. Things unfold slowly, and everything just gets so long-winded. There are lots of useless panning through scenes where characters traverse - whether walking on land or flying through space. I marvel at how they managed to extend a very short manga story to a 45-minute anime feature. The art and animation are okay. The overall look and feel are somewhat dated but it's generally not bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"Another \\"girl too strong for her own good\\" anime. Maris is in trouble, her parents are always breaking things (and expecting her to pay for it), she owes for 4 space craft herself, and she just can't seem to break even. Her partner, Murphy the 9 tailed transforming fox adds to the story. It is funny in the \\"kicking them while they're down\\" and \\"accidental mayhem\\" sort of way. And let us not forget the outtakes at the end... Author Rumiko Takahashi does a good job of telling the story, though it may have lost something in the translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"My brief notes for this simply say \\"Alpha male ********. This is why I don't think I'll marry.\\" Granted, I can be prone to exaggeration, but this book is not at all an example of a remotely healthy relationship. Penniless earl decides to marry unconventional heiress. He knows she's concerned about fortune hunters so he lies and schemes and promises her the adventure she craves, and then once they're married to avoid her ruination by scandal, he promptly strips her of her independence, intellectual pursuits, and personal fashion choices. At some point among all this repressing, they solve a mystery. Woohoo. Not at all Quick's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I was so disappointed in this story. Liked the heroine but never warmed up to the hero. She was strong, intelligent, and unconventional. I expected a hero who was her equal. Unfortunately, that was not to be. I never could get past the fact that Lucas admitted he loved Lady Atherton enough to propose marriage but didn't love Vicky until he experienced her passion at the inn. Even then he was a real tyrant and a bully. I could have overlooked the Lady Atherton infatuation if it had been made in the ignorance of youth, but he was 30 years old. Yuck. Lucas never measured up and I don't know what Vicky saw in him. Maybe we can hope for a sequel in which the widowed Vicky finds a man that is her equal - maybe someone like a Tobias March!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FLOWED IN WAVES OF BOREDOM---","review":"This story drug on through the first half, rehashing the same info over and over, then picked up the pace and became interesting only to fizzle out once again. It didn't help that the villain was so anticlimactic and the reasons behind the misdeeds so lame. The worst part was the hero/heroine were quite delightful and the very few \\"adventures\\" were quite fun. This could have been an enjoyable story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've never met a character I despised as much as Lucas. While it may reflect the way of life back in the day where a man controlled the money and dictated a woman's comings and goings, my more modern sensibilities found nothing romantic about the manipulation of Vicky. What a way to crush the spirit of a genuinely interesting romantic heroine. Hope I'm not giving away the plot ending by saying, It's a shame he didn't befall a tragic ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hero is not","review":"Lucas is clearly a man who uses Victoria for his own means and strings her along with adventure until she is tricked into marrying him. Once she does, he friendly facade fades and she is left with an overbearing \\"lord\\" who lords his power over her. What makes her still love him? I certainly don't know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Winch EP9000","review":"Comes with a snatch block and remote, which is better than the original SW remote, which is like the warn winch remote.My old SW 9000 had smaller cable, but this cable was too damaged after using it 4 times.

It is now all kinked and the wire splitting. the other negative is the little plastic cap over the remote plug broke off. another negative is that it is too hard to pull the cable out on free spool.

Idyllic, but at what price comes Stalin's 'utopia'? This movie demonstrates a case of this seeming utopia crashing down for one family. Stalin's victims included everybody, the young, the old, those opposed to Stalin, and those who truly believed in the Soviet dream. The performances given by the actors in this movie are extraordinary, and the depth portrayed by their characters is amazing. The tragedy is one that was repeated over and over through Stalin's and Soviet rule, and this movie stands as a memorial for us to remember that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Silly Start... Then Morphs Into A Powerful Narrative","review":"Starts out farcically, foolishly, and tempts you to walk away believing this is an amateurish, silly, foolish movie. Then the primary characters begin to interest you, to intrigue you... and one in particular enchants you. Then you begin to realize the gravity of what is happening, and that this particular story, involving but a few handfuls of characters, is a profound narrative on the madness, brutality inhumanity of Stalin's Soviet empire.(Minor defect: the English subtitles cannot be turned off... somewhat irritating for those that can follow the Russian dialog and don't want the distraction of the subtitles)."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful and moving","review":"Wrenchingly emotional, this is one day in the life of a family that is on the surface idyllic...so full of life and love...and is actually a nightmare when the political reality of Stalin's rule intrudes into their world. The entire cast is brilliant with Nikita Mikhalkov ( who also wrote and directed ) as the war hero and patriarch, and Oleg Menshikov as the man who sells his soul for survival standouts. Like the fireballs that waft through rooms and over landscapes in this film, there is something magical about it that becomes more evident with each viewing. The winner of many awards, ( including an Oscar for Best Foreign Film ) it shouldn't be missed, you'll see they were well deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Beautiful little gem with the main sound leaving you humming for days.

The ending is an unexpected twist and Mikhalkov's real life daughter puts on a superb performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars - if you can overlook the orb","review":"This was a wonderful movie. I'm surprised at the comment from the person in Austin, claiming that the acting was sub-par - the intelligence of the daughter alone was enough to keep my interest piqued, but the rest of the characters were equally impressive. The only thing I can think of is that the reviewer in Austin doesn't know enough Russian to be able to see it...?The golden orb (which I'm assuming is supposed to represent the sun) is an enigma; at the first sight of it, I thought someone had gotten a hold of the video tape and overdubbed a different movie. Overall, though, I thought it was great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT \\"THE PIANIST\\" WAS TO POLAND, THIS IS TO RUSSIA.","review":"This absolute poetry on camera, which bagged the 1995 best international film award, is a masterpiece I highly recommend you to watch.Russians (or other followers of Stalin's times) may be a bit jaded by the theme of 30's USSR suffering. But for the rest of us, \\"Burnt by the Sun\\" glides effortlessly, seamlessly though the genres as it tells of a handful of Russian characters who collectively constitute a family of sorts with great humor and drama, poignant and sweetly sentimental moments, and excellence both technically and artistically.What is more, the film's story is interesting, unpredictable, and well told with depth and neatly developed characters.The reviewers who have lamented about the politics of the our time, the academy award and the bravura with which it was accepted etc. are making weirdly baseless comments. If you enjoyed Polanski's opus \\"Pianist\\", I guarantee you're in for a visual and sentimental treat with this one as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stalin's Terror","review":"This film is a painful look at the effect Stalin's terror had on even his closest officials. The film itself is beautiful, set at a peaceful country \\"dacha\\". The action begins to pick up when Mitya arrives. The Mitya and Kotov characters provide an interesting contrast of Russian men. Mitya is a hollowed out soul searching for reminents of his past life and Kotov is the ideal Russian who always believes in his homeland. Several scenes are very poignant, particularly the one where Marussia realizes that Mitya has returned. The conclusion is painful and frightening, but that is how Stalin's crimes were to the Russian people."},{"rating":"2","title":"A viewer","review":"I saw bits of Burnt by the Sun years ago, but when I saw it fully recently I was impressed. It's a film basically about love and life in the Soviet Union in the 1930's. It might be a bit long for western viewers especially when reading subtitles, but if you give it a chance you will gain some insight into the cult of Stalin leading to the \\"purges of '36\\". The ending in this film is one that you'll probably never forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre","review":"The fild does not reflect history in all its dimensions. I would even say it distorts the truth by presenting a very single-sided point of view. It is definitly popular abroad, as people in the West tend not to know much about Russia and the former Soviet Union. In Russia, however, very few find the director historically honest. The West is also very often scared by the Russian mafia. Perhaps, it would be interesting for many to know that the film's director is one of the Oligarchs' men, a servant of robber barons, who pay him for service with money they steal from the people."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING....Do not watch this movie!!!...","review":"This movie is a disaster, the actors are shallow, the director is awfull and it doesn't deserve an academy award...

Hulk was selected by the hand of God to revitalize the music industry. After listening to this album, I cannot even utter the words Da Vinci, Einstein, or Tesla, without first mentioning the Hulkster, otherwise known as Hulk Hogan, otherwise known as the Hulk, inventor and grandmaster of the religion known as Hulkamania. Hulk's musical genius is utterly amazing, possibly supernatural. After seventeen times of listening to the album straight through, although the orgasms stopped, the euphoria of the superb rythm and bass still makes my hair stand on end.

And the only reason Alice isn't just as annoying is because the author neglected to write very much about her at all. Whatever happened to character development??? And a decent plotline???"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown","review":"Mary Stewart's Merlin trilogy was my favorite trilogy of all time, so I looked forward to this book eagerly, and was majorly disappointed. I bought this book in hardcover and it was a complete waste of my money. Even a paperback would have been a complete waste of my money, and borrowing it from a library would have been a complete waste of my time.Mary Stewart is quite elderly these days. She should have had the good sense to stop writing when she was still at the top of her powers rather than writing stuff like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Weak Plant From a Potent Seed","review":"Stories involving King Arthur and sundry acts of chivalrous derring 'do have always entertained me, so I was heartily disappointed in Stewart's novel, a return to the world of her Merlyn trilogy. Honestly, it seems like she simply ran out of gas or out of time. The novel sets up nicely, with two different plot threads that promise an epic resolution. Instead, the two main characters miraculously meet, fall in love and save the day, all in the space of about 90 pages. You know you are in trouble when you are reading a novel about the holy grail and one of the characters scoffs that it isn't the real holy grail, all the other characters agree, and everyone moves on. Yikes! I think Merlyn is rolling over in his crystal cave."},{"rating":"1","title":"A well written, if not passionate, book.","review":"Although this book is quite well written, with a satisfactory craftmanship of words, I must say that I was not particularly excited about this novel. It held my interest fairly well, but I didn't feel the flood of emotions truly good books always bring me. I liked the way both Alexander and Alice have, in their way, their own seperate sections, like how it explained their youth, but I didn't really enjoy how they didn't meet until close to the end of the book. It seemed short and fake when Alexander proclaimed his love to Alice, and lacked the ability to set my heart thumping and my eyes watering as a passionate romance novel may have. Since it was obvious how the book would end, I didn't feel the suspense or intrigue I expected. Although it may have its faults, it was not a completely bad book, and in the end, I would dub it \\"okay\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Williams Gold","review":"Another Classic of John Williams scores. It can charm you and scare you at the same time. The last track is the best of all on the CD. A big musical flourish is great for the ending of this sci-fi epic. Who else to direct such a film then Steven Speilberg."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Grand Composition Deserving the Highest Praise","review":"While most remember the five-note \\"communication\\" melody that is heard in the exchange between the alien craft and earth scientists, I recall fondly the interpolated \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" featured in the closing credits. This is a fitting tribute by Williams and Spielberg to \\"Uncle Walt\\" who for so many years transported us to other worlds, fantasy and real life.\\"Close Encounters\\" remains one of Williams' most passionate works. It, along with \\"E.T.\\" will go down in movie history as unsurpassed in its depth and orchestral wizardry.This re-mastered version of the soundtrack is an essential for any fan of the composer, as well as those that appreciate the work of a capable and gifted musician."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's What You Need","review":"The soundtrack to my favorite movie. All the familiar themes and cues are intact, and in the correct order as heard in the film.For those that know and enjoy the movie after all these years will find new life in the soundtrack with the extra tracks not used in the film, or found on earlier versions of the film music.It only made me appreciate the movie more, and all will rejoice in the attention and effort put into this soundtrack. Of course, I can't help but look behind me in my truck when the scarier tracks play, but isn't that the essence of what a soundtrack is supposed to accomplish? Evoke the emotions you felt when watching the film. It was a dream realized when this soundtrack was re-released. Superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Williams At His Finest--Yet Again!","review":"John Williams has to rank as this era's single most popular film music composer. Evidence of this is readily apparent in his complete score for Steven Spielberg's 1977 science fiction masterpiece CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND. With seventy-eight minutes worth of music, following the film's story from start to finish, the score is brilliantly done, with echoes of Ravel, Ligeti, and Penderecki finding their way in. The celebrated five-note UFO signal piece wisely stays in, as does the use of \\"When You Wish Upon A Star\\" (from PINOCCHIO). A tremendous endeavor from a master composer of our time, film music or otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Piece of Work","review":"I love this score. It is a true accomplishment on Williams' behalf. Also, the sound quality has been greatly improved from the Varese release thanks to Shawn Murphy and the 20 bit Digital Mastering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"It happened as I thought but was different than I expected. Very good story telling and strong characters. I fell into the story from the first words and it held me until the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern Wambaugh","review":"This period of the south and the steamy afternoons of country drama play all the cards for Family, Patriotism, Race, Class and long forgotten prejudices. Joseph Wambaugh took the rural north for a journey and recently departed Larry Brown does the same for the northern reaches of Mississippi. Not an easy book to put down and not an easy set of emotions to find comfort in. Much like the works of author & Tennessee Sheriff David Hunter's works the less pleasant and the un-glossed image of the south remains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"If you are interested in the \\"Age of Queens\\" and looking for something with more than timelines and geneology, this is a GREAT pick. The book is nearly 900 pages but so engrossing that it flies by. I have read several books on both Mary Queen of Scotts and Queen Elizabeth of England, (I am well versed on the subject) but I found myself in tears upon the execution of Mary. Margret George bares Marys thoughts and feelings with honesty. You cannot help but to love and pity Mary at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted potential...","review":"What a disappointment! The book starts out very good, and it's thoroughly engaging, but then George spoils herself (and the book, and the reader, and your appetite) with a series of sex scenes that are neither necessary nor remotely appropriate. Worst of all was the gay rape scene (yes, you read that right). The worst part was the utterly charming ending---why did she have to ruin it with such lewd descriptions? It felt as though you were suddenly reading some kind of sleazy novel. Very upsetting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mary, I don't like you.","review":"I struggled reading this tomb. I really enjoyed reading her Cleopatra book. What I finally realized was I disrespected Mary's decisions. I got the impression she was a rich bitch. I read about half the book and put it down because this is not a person I wanted to know anything more about."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm on Page 86....","review":"I am absolutely blown away by how different this book is than her Henry autobiography. Whereas the title would imply that this book is about Mary Stuart...the wedding scene alone disproves that idea. I know more about how her uncle was feeling during the ceremony than she did.So far, not a ringing endorsement for the rest of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary Stuart","review":"I haven't read this book, but I would love to. It sounds like an exciting and gripping tale of Mary, Queen of Scots. I have read a lot about her and she sounds wonderful. I can't wait to read it. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book , a bit long , but seems well researched","review":"By reading this book , I have learned quite a bit about this sovereign . It makes interesting reading and I can see that Margaret George must have delved into the history of the woman , England , Scotland and France ... A lengthy book but an enjoyable read ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read for 43 cents!","review":"This is a great story of Mary Queen of Scots. I'd read it before but wanted to re read the story before going back to Scotland this August. And for 43 cents how can you go wrong?"},{"rating":"2","title":"extremely well written","review":"This book is amazing. I love Tudor and Stuart history. All the books I've read had bits and pieces of the story. This book helped me understand most of it and helped me piece it together. Over all, this book is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"LONG. And fantastic.","review":"From her first days to her last, Mary Stewart, the unwanted Queen of Scotland, lives and breathes upon the pages of Margaret George -- all 900 of them. She, as well as the rest of the cast (especially her brother, her lover Bothwell, and everybody's favorite preacher, John Knox) is very well-written, and her gripping and tragic story is told with enthusiasm and attention to historical detail. Kudos to Margaret George -- this is her best book so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical fiction to get lost in.","review":"I am an ardent fan of historical fiction and was definitely not disappointed with this book! Don't be fooled by its length; it is engrossing and exciting, and you'll wish it was longer! Queen Mary's life starts out innocently enough...she is crowned Queen of Scotland at the age of 9 days and at the age of 5 years, after being threatened by the English, she is moved to France for sanctuary. There she is engaged to marry the Dauphin and she lives a lush, happy life until the age of 17, when her husband, the King of France dies and leaves her with no recourse but to reclaim her throne in Scotland. The plots, intrigue, and scandal that follow will capture your imagination. Also interesting is the struggle between Catholicism and Protestantism in her native country. You will not regret reading this novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A reader in Pasadena, Maryland","review":"M. George has really put a presence in her novel of this intriguing character. Mary, Queen of Scotland is truly an enigmatic woman as well as ruler. Her life is truly shaded in plot after plot, intrigue after intrigue which M. George carefully tells in her story. However, in doing so, she has whitewashed this particular monarch and cleared her of suspicion.But this book is a must read for anyone who loves a great story of intrigue. M. George tells her story, as best as can be understood, through all of the \\"high roads\\" and \\"low roads\\" of this Scottish and French Queen. It is worth a careful inspection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another doozie from Margaret George","review":"If you think you know all there is to know about Mary, Queen of Scots, reading this book will change your mind. Although it is a novel, reading this book touches upon the more personal facts that can be verified elsewhere. Also, Ms George makes some choices about things that can never be verified but make a splendid good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow and wordy","review":"Unlike most of Ms. George's historical novels this book is slow, drug out, and exceptionally wordy. I only finished half of the book. If you are interested in Mary Queen of Scots I recommed the movie by the same title because it mirrors the book exactly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, but dry in the middle","review":"I read Cleopatra, and absolutly loved it. I even cried at the end, even though I knew what would happen to Cleopatra and Marc Antony. So I was excited to read George's version of Mary Queen of Scots.The story started off interesting, but soon became a drag. I understand Mary spent most of her time in confinement, but she didn't need to spend so much time over those years.I know when I don't care for a book when I am anxious to get to the end...not out of suspense, but out of boredom. Unfortunately, this book was the type I was looking forward to the end because I grew tired of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Factual novel","review":"Overall I liked the book, it is a novel but a great part of the book is factual. The genealogy section was actually quite helpful to me because I am working on my family tree and we are related to both the Stewart (Stuart) and Tudor lines. The first two thirds of the book flew by, but I have to admit that reading how Mary made the wrong decisions over and over got pretty tedious. The last part being her imprisonment at the hands of Elizabeth I, dragged on. But I have read other books by Margaret George and she doesn't seem to know how to end her books, the ending is always weak with details about the food served and embroidery patterns. I did read to the end of the book but it was hard work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Royal prisoner","review":"An engrossing work of historical fiction. This is the perfect book to keep on your bedside table for weeks as you read work your way through the tale of Mary, Queen of Scots. As one who enjoys British history, I thoroughly enjoyed the tale and the intrigue inherent within. It's got it all -- romance, murder, and mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!!!!","review":"Because of this book I went to Scotland and fell in love with scottish history! George wrote a wonderful book that opened a new world to me. She created Mary Queen of Scots into a character that I could sympathize with and cheer for.Although this book is \\"long\\" I couldn't put it down and was sad when I finished the last page.If only all historical novels could be of this quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but. . .","review":"Okay, I picked up this book at the library expecting the best. I had read all those good reviews here at Amazon and I was expecting some phenomonal novel. Well, I began it, and found it a little boring until she got to France. Then it was wonderful. I read and read and by the time I got to Part II I was totally enveloped in Mary's (a woman formally too boring to interest me) story. Then Lord Darnley came in and the book lost its interest to me. The book was mutilated and changed into this barfable romance novel. Now don't get me wrong, I really like romance in my novels, but all of a sudden it was Darnley this Darnley that, and it portrayed him as a guy that he wasn't. And then came this horribly inappropriate scene between Mary and Darnley. I shrugge it off, though, but within fifty more pages there was another scene, except this time it was John Knox and wife. If you're offended wiyth stuff like that, then I don't recomend it. This book was a real let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truthful and Compelling Read","review":"when I first picked up this book I was a little intimidated by the size (I have never read anything this long before)yet decided to give it a try. Before long I was hooked. it took me only a week to finish this 800 page story, and I enjoyed every minute of it. The author's writing style can become a little dull in some places yet her descriptions of the important events of Mary's life are thrilling and exeptionally written. I loved the descriptions of the battles and Mary's many escapes from prisons and enemies. The end of the book was hard to read though, as I already knew how it must end, and was just waiting for Mary to die, but it was told really well. I recomend this book to anyone who like historical fiction and learning about famous women of the past. It is a wonderful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Insightful","review":"Although this book is terribly long and rather dense, if you can manage to get through it you will be rewarded with a portrait of a young girl terribly ill-suited to be a queen. I knew very little about Mary before, and now that I know more I feel like she is definitely a woman I would not want to spend much time with. She begins her life as a self-consumed pampered child more interested in dresses and parties than preparing for any future role she might have as a queen. When she does become queen, she makes all the wrong choices again and again, starting with marriage to a man everyone warns her against. This is a very interesting look at a headstrong child who becomes a headstrong woman determined to win and get her way at any cost. It seemed as though she never really grew up. A solid four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the three","review":"I felt that this was the most realistic of the three books. I have read it twice and was completely drawn into the intrigue and emotions of the drama. The book is an amazing piece of writing. All three of her books are wonderful, but I feel that this is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful.","review":"This book is a heart-felt educational visual through the times of the dear girl-queen who never grew out of her naivity until it was much too late. It tells of earnest love for the betraying Elizabeth and it broke my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"It may have been long, but it was worth it!","review":"I thought that this book was a very good way to brush up on my Scottish history. It explored and portrayed the characters well, and showed Mary as I had thought of her: well-meaning, with very poor judgement. It was rather lengthy, but I still did not find myself skipping pages. It kept the interest, and had excellent character development. The historical aspect was accurate, and was a good point of view to have learned. So often we just learn of Queen Elizabeth's killing of a conspirator ex-queen, rather than a real queen in a desparate situation"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, if a bit long","review":"After having tackled Henry VIII, Margaret George turns her considerable talents to the story of Mary Queen of Scots, with mixed results. George herself admits in the author's note that she had to make a lot of educated guesses about events, so those of you looking for historical accuracy will probably be disappointed. The story zooms through Mary's life up until her incarceration by Elizabeth I, then it gets a bit tedious. Overall though, a good introduction to this often maligned queen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Margaret continues her smooth, easy reading style of writing","review":"Margaret George continues her smooth, easy reading style chucked full of surprises making her tome not only an interesting read but a capativating one. She brings history to life by giving her characters very human qualities. After reading Cleopatra, I ran out and bought this book and was not in the least bit disappointed. The only thing that was disturbing was that the life of Mary Queen of Scots was so sad and depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The essential guide works","review":"This book is really good to follow instructions and to figure out what supplies you will need and shows you how to create something but giving you basic instructions which are good. It's isn't too wordy and you can follow unlike other books I've purchased. If you are a beginner you will enjoy looking through the pages and creating projects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the July 2000 edition instead","review":"This version is just so strange. It looks like it is made up of cheap black and white photocopies of the original book by the same name with a publishing date of July 2000. I'm not sure what the publishers were thinking by making this sad edition--a lot of detail of the photos are lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did Lightscribe go?","review":"I was really, excited about Lightscribe.

When I tried to access the dvd the next day, it wouldn't open or read the cd. Never did get my cd back.Still, I wanted Lightscribe, so I looked for a replacement dvd burner.

However, after I brought it home, the picture quality was very disappointing. It looked very grainy, colors were washed out, and dark compared to my old Philips. Trying to adjust the contrast and brightness controls did not help.After living with this model for a week, I think I'm going to return it for a more dependable Sony KV-27FS120, which is in the same price range and screen size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard gay porn and erotica","review":"The editors, Paul J. Willis and Ron Jackson, claim that the stories in this collection \\"chronicle unfamiliar aspects of desire and lust.\\" Frankly if anyone is familiar at all with any thing beyond the reproductive model of sex, I find it difficult to believe that the stories really live up to that claim. Of the stories in this collection, fewer than half, 7 in all, had characters that touched me on some level, making me want to reread the story. Most of the stories are written in the first person, the common point of view for much porn though not for most fiction. Given the point of view there is ample opportunity to help the reader connect deeply with the main character and yet most of the story fail. If you want a wide range of kinks and are only interested in the sex, then this collection may be just want you want. If you want more, I suggest you look elsewhere because there is some very high quality gay male SM fiction on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"ASE Test Prep Series -- Automobile (A2): Automotive Transmis","review":"I found this book very poor in that there are numerous typographical errors, cross referances to non existing paragraphs and referances from the sample test questions to paragraphs that had no information that pertained to the question!

Vonda McIntyre tends to incorporate a few favorite elements into many of her short stories and novels, and I consider this series to be the culmination of her imaginings, even if it didn't get the same kind of critical attention as \\"Dreamsnake\\" or \\"The Moon and the Sun.\\" \\"Starfarers\\" is a bit slow, used mainly to introduce the principals and really only hinting at the adventures to come, but the payoff in the next three novels is more than worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A definite disappointment from a wonderful writer","review":"This story looked like it was going to be about a group of people on a journey to the stars to find other life but instead we get all the politics and preparations and junk preceding the journey. The real search for other life only starts on the 4th-to-last-page of the book.

However, this book seems to limit itself to certain situations. It doesn't give enough examples and the \\"skills\\" it mentioned sometimes just don't make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money on this one, we were so dissapointed . . .","review":"The only thing that works on this vehicle is the marketing. My 5 year old really wanted this toy and we searched high and low to find it for christmas . . . It seemed so cool, until we tried to fold it up, it was nearly impossible to fold it up correctly. The pieces were so flimsy that they broke. When we finally would get it closed up (to the hummer)stuff would pop open when we were trying to play with it. This is an inferior product and unfortunatly the company is not fixing it since they are re-marketing it this christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Bought this toy when my boy was 8 1/2 now a year has gone by and he played with it once. I read reviews on how difficult it is too close and they are true. It is just a little track inside a huge truck. Not worth the money. I would say that this toy is more for a 5 year old who likes to play with cars still."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXPENSIVE PIECE OF JUNK!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY","review":"We bought this for our son for Christmas. Too bad the hummer isn't as it is represented on the commercial. It sounds like it is breaking apart when you unfold it, and it takes too much time to set up the track. The front hood keeps falling off no matter how you snap it onto the push pins. Folding it back up is a bigger nightmare. The hummer won't stay together and wobbles like an old jalopy when it is pushed like a car. We contacted Playmates and they indicated the \\"breaking noise\\" and hood falling off were normal. I would hate to see what they consider defective!!! Thank goodness we saved our box and receipt. We returned the toy to the store and got our money back. I wish the scale started at zero because we would have rated it zero stars across the board."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am a little dissapointed","review":"My mom got htis for me and although the concept is good I don't love it. It is a pain to put away by myself. i thought it would fold up but I have to take pieces off. Some are loose. The tracks are short. I like my hotweheels tracks instead. THe speedeez work great on them and that is OK. It is not that I can't do it it just takes too long and when you are a busy kid time counts. So I will use my other tracks till something better comes out. I do like the Hummer that came in it. The mini one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"My 7 year old son was thrilled when he opened this gift - something he really wanted. The raceway was easy to put together however, it it does not fold back up easily - if at all. The latches do not stay and most everything pops open once you try to pick it up (not mobile). Unfortunately, the speed launcher does not stay attached and we have to manually push down on it while launching.Very disappointed with the durability and agility."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprized by this race track","review":"My 3yr old son received this race track for Christmas and to my surprize it is actually easy to set up and put up and he loves playing with it..Also you can put the cars in the hood, so everything stays together...I thought it was very easy to set up. He received a dinosaur race track and it is awlful..overall I think this is a good race track."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Parents Nightmare! Playmates goldmine!","review":"I agree with most of the other reviews. This was purchased as a gift for my son, for Christmas. I wish I had checked it out before my son saw it, I would have returned it. Not only was it difficult to set up, it was more difficult to transform back into the Hummer. I find myself telling my son to play with it as a truck, not the city. What an expensive truck. Very disappointed. Never even heard back from Playmates when I tried to email them."},{"rating":"2","title":"It takes some patience","review":"My kids like this toy. After reading some of the bad reveiws I contacted Playmates. They responded very rapidly and were very helpful explaining the toy. You need to be patient and practice opening and closing it a few times. It is pretty nifty once you get the hang of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun toy","review":"My son and I have a blast playing with this toy. He is about to turn 3, so I have to help him set it up and show him how it works, but it has kept him entertained for some time now. I can understand how if it didn't come with directions it could be diffuclt to put together, but we really did not have a problem. Once you do it a few times, It's a real breeze. It seems to be duralbe too. My son literally sits on the car and rides around our house,(we have wood floors.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Money!","review":"My 5 yr old son saved his money and waited months to get this toy.

I didn't even let my son see it, I just put it back in the box and returned it. It looks like it will be broken in a few days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyped up commercial ... poorly made toy","review":"STAY AWAY! The commercial looks amazing but basically this is three short tracks and they just roll down them. Besides being quite boring, it took me over an hour to try to fold it back together and even then it wouldn't close. I put it right back in the box and returned it for something else. Also, the rep at Toys R Us told me quite a few were being returned. You would think such garbage would be pulled from the shelf. It was a lesson for my 4 year old on how things are not always how they appear on TV!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disfunctional","review":"why cant every thing be like the old tonka toys indestructable.i bought this for my 6 year old son.which he is quite carefullfor a little boy.the hummer 2 is a faulty toy it sounds like it is going to break every time you open it .he hood has already broken off 1one! day.forget trying to put it back to hummer mode. very unhappy with design. taking it back tommorrow!!!!p.s was not easy to find almost attacked in store because it was the last one. i wished ilet them have it"},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"This toy was on the top of my son's Christmas list. As soon as we opened the box and took out the toy, my husband and I could see it was poorly made. We could not even open the truck without feeling it was about to break into pieces. I immediately got it back into the box and told my son we would bring him to the store for something else. I wish I had read the reviews here first, before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"One BIG Headache!","review":"We bought this toy for my sons 5th birthday. Wow what a disappointment...I would like to see one child be able to set this toy up and fold it back down. Way too complicated and now most of the time it just sits in a big pile of pieces in the corner because nobody wants to tackle the task of cleaning it up only to have it fall apart again during just simple pushing around of the H2. When it is set up the boys only play with it for minutes because there really isn't much to do. Yet another waste of money. DO NOT buy this toy!!! Ours will eventually end up in the great toy graveyard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank Goodness it's yellow because it's a LEMON!","review":"We bought the hummer for our son for Christmas, as most did. My husband pulled it out of the box, as my son's eyes gleamed with joy, but what with his wondering eyes did he see, a box full of poorly constructed yellow plastic with a hood that collasped in my husband's hands. The joints are poorly made and crack as you try to assemble it. Once put together it was . . . okay. Don't even try to resume into hummer mode, that is just not possible for a child to do by himself or herself! Yes, I could do it with patience as others have stated, however this is not an adult toy, but rather created for children to play with! The heartbreaking part is our son doesn't understand how or why Santa would make a toy that would fall apart(the hood) or was so hard for him to play with by himself. Needless to say it will be RETURNED! After all even Santa makes mistakes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"Playmates should be ashamed. What a piece of junk. This is not for anyone who wants a toy that lasts more than 1 hour. The tabs that keep the track together break too easily, the track pieces bend in ways they shouldn't bend, the mirrors on the truck make setting it up awkward. Just a piece of junk. You are better off donating your $40 than wasting your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't recommend it","review":"I bought this toy for my son. He wanted it for Christmas. It is not durable. It is a cute idea the hummer that turns into a race track. I would not recommend this toy for a child under the age of 12 years. It was pretty pricy for what we got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"We bought this for our 5 year old son for Christmas. It is a peice of junk! The peices don't stay together and every time we try to make it back into the hummer it sounds like it is breaking and peices fall off. My son likes the toy, but complains all the time about it falling apart. I would not bother spending the amount of money they want for this toy!!! I was VERY dissapointed in this toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this toy!","review":"This toy is way too diificult for my EIGHT year old to put together and fold up! I have to do it and it takes me 10 minutes and some colorful language everytime! Get the Stunt City by MicroMachines. We got that one for the 10 year old and it's much better, more fun and totally self contained. The Hummer ranks up there with the worst toys I've ever bought and I have three boys and a lot of experience with choosing toys for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable but expensive toy","review":"Our just turned 5 grandson really wanted this for Christmas. He enjoys it very much. He has learned to assemble and disassemble it which is educational. He takes it to his friends to play with. I don't think it is that great a toy. It really doesn't do much and there are better toys on the market which are less expensive. But it doesn't require batteries. My grandson looks at whats on the box and he figured out that there were additional sets of vehicles which he wants to suppliment what came with the set but we can't find the sets he wants for sale anywhere.Some claim this is a flimsy toy. It is in a way but it is still a very usable toy and if a 5 year old can assemble and disassemble it then it is not that flimsy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!!!","review":"All my grandson wanted Santa to bring this year was that Hummer H2. So, of course, I got it the first chance I got! He was So excited that Santa remembered! What a frustrating toy not only to assemble but really confusing to put away. The ratings are for 3 yrs and above. That alone should be changed. The front of the truck keeps coming apart from the body of the truck. And when he tries to push it around as a vehicle, his hands hit the release buttons to unfold the truck and the whole thing comes apart. What a big disappointment but thank goodness I kept the box and receipt! Needless to say, like the person from PA, I have returned it to the store as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should call this Speedeez BUMMER not Hummer","review":"I wish I could rate this less than one star for the durability. It broke Christmas day before my son played with it. I am bringing it back tomorrow. The front part of the car slipped out from the plastic hinges and won't stay on so it just breaks. It's a good idea but just a piece of junk. Keep your receipts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU MIGHT JUST ENJOY IT","review":"I bought this toy for my five year old, prior to reading all the horrible reviews. I'm glad I didn't return it. We enjoy it. It's true that I have to set it up and put it away for my son, but I have to do that with just about any race track my children have ever had (and we've had many). The set-up is a little complicated. If you don't have a lot of patients, then you should pass on this toy. If you don't mind a little bit of assembly then you will probably enjoy it. Judging by the feelings of most people, I don't think the toy will be on the market for very long anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"typical american composer","review":"Like most American composers Howard Hanson is a little on the bland side. His 2nd symphony has some admirers although I'm not sure why. At least the CD isn't expensive so you can be bored cheaply."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"This CD is a classic. Hanson's First speaks of the rugged grandeur of the Finnish north with its rushing glissandos in the strings, its broad chords in the brass, and its nuances in the woodwinds.His Second is more thematic in content.

The inspiration to follow God's leading in all that he has for us to do and trust Him to provide the strength is the main theme. The exortation to live within our means and be satisfied with what the Lord has blessed us with is the underlying theme. The writing, as always with Bunn, is gripping, hard to put down.

The first novel in Italy to actually acknowledge and reveal some of the secrets of the Mafia. The mystery is not terribly convincing, but what matters is the sense of place and culture--which is wonderful. Not quite a police procedural, though it has the shape of one---but more a series of character and cultural portraits. For that, it deserves 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anger and frustration by Nobel winner","review":"An interesting overview by a Nobel Prize of the way he would remake human nature, if he had been able; as the way it ought to have been. His earlier books such as \\"King Solomon's Ring\\" and \\"Man meets Dog {as well as giggles about women and cats, both unmentioned in the title} were pot-boilers for the street with some excellent observations about fish and birds, but dubious and/or nonsense poking fun about dogs and humans - which in my opinion forewarned of his attitude about humans and dogs to fit marketing and ideology preferences - precursors of \\"Behind the Mirror ... \\" The book can have immense value to researchers of the history of animal behavioral research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"What a simple, yet great little product!

It is clear, so any decorative boutique tissue box looks nice. It would have received 5 stars if the manufacturer had included a top to cover the bottom of tissue box.

Purity, directness and unflinching honesty are just some of the hallmarks of June Tabor's work, and for me this is one of her finest collections. No fancy arrangements, simple (almost stark) accompaniment or none at all, but with a voice such as hers, who needs it? \\"The Scarecrow\\", \\"She Moves Among Men\\" and \\"Lay This Body Down\\" are my personal favourites although there are no weak tracks here. \\"One Night as I Lay On My Bed\\" recalls Steeleye Span's early days and June's excellent work with Maddy Prior in Silly Sisters. I would recommend this album and \\"Against the Streams\\" as prime June Tabor...easy listening, however, it certainly is not. Be amazed at the vocal power & control, but be prepared for a harrowing time in the choice of subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading ad","review":"The listing said it was a Panasonic bulb.

They are definitely a group to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Can Seem Unfair","review":"Yes, perhaps these ladies from Norway do sound a lot like the Bangles, but they do it so well! This is going to be one of those bands who didn't make it, broke up, leaving behind one blasting set for music hunters to enjoy. \\"What Is Love\\" is a strong rock anthem with slashing guitar licks and Laila Samuels' vocals holding the stage. My favorite track is what was the single, \\"I'll Be Here.\\" It's got a slower grinding groove and a great melody with Samuels again nailing the vocal, \\"When dreams seem far away do yesterdays keep haunting you? Do they bring you down? Well life can seem unfair.\\" Yes, it's sentimental, but it is a great track. Other songs show some sense of humor like on \\"I Was Thinking of You\\" about an unfaithful girlfriend who tries to make her affair seem a bit more acceptable. Sometimes great bands don't make it and the music biz can seem unfair. The Tuesdays is a great rocking set that is worth seeking out.

I received the Bancroft Strategy as a birthday present from my daughter who takes gift-giving very personally, so I had to keep it. The only reason I give it 2 Stars is because I'm still reading it, waiting for two DeMille books I ordered to arrive. The stuff in this book is just plain D U M B.

Also, unnecessary blasphemy is offensive, juvenile, and shows no respect for the reader's beliefs, and sensitivities. It also shows a like of writing quality displayed in the older, more reverent authors, but is sorely lacking in today's writers. It's time authors learned to keep their anger, and rebellion to themselves, and not to offend their readership. Heck, if they were writing to the Islamic market, they'd be killed for this mistake! I on the other hand respectfully suggest that they keep their beliefs, or lack thereof to themselves, and to cleanup their writing style so as not to offend their readers!I Tossed this book in the garbage, after reading, not one, but several blasphemies in the prologue, itself!A note from a faithful reader; cleanup your writing style, and omit offensive language from your books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This book is terribly written. The plot was cryptic when it shouldn't have been and pathetically obvious when it was trying to foreshadow the \\"twists\\" in the story line. The dialogue seemed purposefully verbose and forced.

If you're going to say someone is irately angry, just say that he is angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bancroft A Miss","review":"I used to be a big fan of Robert Ludlum, but his latest books are just missing with me. The Bancroft Strategy has the Ludlum-standard fast-paced action and the twisting plot, but it never gripped me the way his earlier works did.

Bottom line: If you're going on a long plane trip and someone loans you a copy of the book then go ahead and read it, but otherwise keep looking for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely Disappointed","review":"If I hadn't downloaded this as an audio book, I wouldn't have wasted my time reading this novel.I read the Bourne series, and immediately became a big fan of Ludlum's ability to write intense spy vs. spy novels. But the Bancroft Strategy was filled with weak characters, unrealistic/unexplained solutions to what should have been impossible problems, and far too many cliche phrases/metaphors from the characters (oftentimes in rapid succession). I kept waiting for the book to get better, but was disappointed in the end. My only consolation is that I checked the audio book out from my local library and didn't spend any money on it.If this book was truly written by Robert Ludlum, it should have been left to rest in peace along with the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. Ludlum, if he did actually write the script, gave fanciful details about a rogue agent with moral ambitions (the ultimate mea culpa?).The story line was good, although I won't detail what so many others have already written, but there were some twists that bordered on the laughable.Most of the read was quick and allowed the reader the enjoyment of looking into the world of deep espionage, but so much of it was beyond reason.That being said, Ludlum did provide for some great action and his character detail is always interesting. He seems to be able to develop characters with carefully crafted detail without watering down the storyline.Overall I would recommend this book, but don't set the bar so high that you find disappointment at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"boring, boring, boring...after chapter 17 I was ready to toss the book but instead I went to chapter 24 to see if it got more interesting... hardly...this book does not compare very well to the Bourne trilogy...it took 24 chapter of f*ck-teasing before they finally got it on... but you knew from the beginning it was going to happen... very predictable???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"1.

Not only is this cookbook a necessity for every cook, but it is rich in history. Thank you Betty Crocker. I can't wait to make my favorite poppy seed cake, I thought that recipe was gone forever.

She used it almost exclusively, so all of my favorite foods as a kid came from recipes in this cookbook. I've tried newer versions of Betty Crocker's cookbooks, but for some reason they've been changed. The recipes just were not the same. Since finding this edition however, my wife and I have been using it a lot and I can honestly say it is just like mom's home cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best baking recipes ever written for the home baker","review":"Although I will probably never serve flaming cabbage (guests broil cocktail weanies over a sterno can hidden in a hollowed out head of cabbage, p. 50), I will be pulling out this book for any baking I do for the rest of my life. If all you buy this book for is the sections on baked goods, it is well worth the investment. I suspect these recipes were tested many times over before they made cookbook status. The main courses are very basic American-style dishes with little seasoning or flair, but most of them are extremely economical to make. Not for feminists, this tome is replete with quotes that indicate in no uncertain terms that the wife's place is in the kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a bit of nostalgia that is worth the cover price","review":"This book takes me back to my mother's kitchen and my first attempt to cook all on my own (cinnamon rolls).

I also wanted to give one to each of my children. It looks like the same book but those die hard BC cooks will notice right away that this is an edited version and not a reprint of the original! Gone is \\"Pink Bunny\\" (I only made it once and have never heard the end of it!) \\"Black Midnight\\" (the ONLY chocolate cake you'll ever need! and other favorites. Some recipes were updated for 90's nutrition which took away the 1950's authenticity.

This documentary is the exception.In short, If you're looking for a documentary into the birth, and life to the twin towers, you'll appreciate this .If you're looking for 9/11 material, This probably won't suffice except for some backgrounds Into on the construction of the towers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt work","review":"It will not play it on my DVD player and it is too much hassle to send it back for another one.

She doesn't seem to know the President at all when addressing him or his policies. Not to mention she just mirrors current secular society that really doesn't understand consequences. This is the jest of the song especially in relation to moral issues. Yes, some of the lines are true and I do feel politicians rarely know what the average person suffers (I'm sure the new president, Obama doesn't know either given both him and his wife are rich and have been for quite some time).

Brokeback Mountain has the feeling that I never read in other story before.The story gets you to understand how really LOVE is all about. Brokeback Mountain goes beyond age, race, and gender. I am in love with this unique love story. If you have the opportunity to read it, just do it. You will not regret it. You will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for Brokeback fans","review":"\\"Story to Screenplay\\" is an incredible compilation of the Proulx short story, the amazing Osanna/McMurtry screenplay, and photos and comments from writers and director. It shows how painstakingly faithful the screenplay is to the story and also will 'fill in the blanks' for any lines from the movie that may have been hard to hear. And, despite the screenplay's format, reading it is as gut-wrenching and heartbreaking as reading the short story and seeing the film. The comments from Prolux, Osanna, McMurtry and Eng show how this film was a geniuine labor of love from all of its participants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning to Write Short Story to Screeplay","review":"In an effort to check out my approach to writing a book adaption to screenplay, I thought it would be a good exercise to experience how others have done it. After reading the Brokeback Mountain short story, then reading the shooting script, then watching the film, I knew I was right on target. It is invigorating to experience and understand the progression from story to screenplay to film. The book also includes backround information from the short story writer, Annie Proulx and the two screenwriters, Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, which tops off the value of this book. Reading it is a great process, and once you've read the book, you'll appreciate the film even more.-Catherine Busch-Johnston-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brokeback Breaks Hearts","review":"Brokeback is a descriptive short story told with depth. Annie Proulx takes the reader into the minds and hearts of two characters who are anything but unforgettable. Ennis and Jack are two young cowboys who were raised with nothing but their names. Ennis is the quiet one out of the pair. An introvert who is in a constant strugle with his true self. Jack Twist is out going, a rodeo lover and a kinder spirit who loves with all his heart. Brokeback takes you on a journey of these two lovers and reveals the shame, silence, agony, desire, and love two people must suffer in order to be together. Despite the length of this story at the end you will be left with a broken heart and a single tear for the love Ennis and Jack shared."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute \\"must have\\"","review":"A \\"must-have\\" for anyone who has been touched by this extraordinary, complex, and profound film. (To describe \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" simply as a love story between two men is like describing \\"Moby Dick\\" as a story about deep-sea fishing.) Comparing the movie script with the original short story helps you see the various layers and subtexts underlying the main story line and leads to a deeper understanding of both the short story and the film. Highly recommended also for anyone who has not yet read Proulx --- her work is unforgettable. She can create a more stunning impact with fewer words than any writer I know. Her essay on being \\"movied\\" is fascinating, including, among other things, her inspiration for some of the major scenes in the book; the pieces by Larry McMurtry and Dana Ossana are very rewarding to read. It's a terrific story, a fabulous and haunting film, and this book helps you realize how much is being said in both of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful Read","review":"It was fun and exciting to learn how the story was created and translated to film. The essays all of the creators wrote inspired me to know all I could on creating a beautiful movie. The story is where it all began, Thank You Annie Proulx and everyone for believing in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Timeless Book\\"","review":"\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is probably the best gay-themed film Hollywood has ever made. Telling the love story of two cowboys over a twenty year period Annie Proulx did a remarkable job with her short story that was first publsihed in \\"The New Yorker\\". In this book not only is Proulx's version included, but the entire screenplay is added, written by Diana Ossana and Larry McMurtry, along with their thoughts on this wonderful work.If your a fan of \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" this soft-cover book is a great companion piece to one of the greatest films ever made, even though it lost the Oscar the year it was nominated."},{"rating":"2","title":"The next best thing to seeing the movie","review":"I wasn't fortunate enough to see Brokeback Mountain in the theaters due to the lack of people willing to go see it with me (an added pain when you don't have a car). Without the means to go and see it I had to bring Brokeback to my home and boy do I love this book! You get Annie Proulx's short story in the first half of the book, then the movie screenplay and then three essays from Annie Proulx and the screenwriters. I started with the screenplay and my emotions were moved. The love between Jack and Ennis is both touching and heartbreaking. There are wonderful moments that were expanded upon in the screenplay such as Jack and Ennis' wives and the moments the two cowboys shared together. Annie Proulx's short story would have sold me even without the screenplay and essays. While short (hence \\"short story\\") it captures all the emotions and beautiful scenery of the mountain landscapes. Trust me, this book is worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely frank yet subtle","review":"The screenplay manifests in a strong and precise way that which must not be done with one's own life. That is, to not live fully because of social constraints."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"This volume collects Annie Proulx's short story \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" (first published in the New Yorker and collected in her \\"Close Range: Wyoming Stories\\"), Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana's screenplay, a short piece called \\"Getting Movied\\" by Proulx, and a piece by each screenwriter. As such, it offers good value for money for what you get.I don't normally buy screenplays, but the film is so beautiful and the adaptation from the story is of such quality that I wanted to own the screenplay. The film is, quite simply, a work of extraordinary genius by a director who is now at the height of his powers. The screenplay, too, is of uncommon quality. You should own this. Simple as that."},{"rating":"2","title":"You thought you understood BBM","review":"Many people that I've discussed BBM with, were amazed how delicately close and truthful Ang Lee's movie follows the short story by Annie Proulx. When you actually read the script and even more so the three essays by Mrs Proulx and screenwriters Ossana and McMurtry a whole new window opens on the what's and why's of everything that happens in both story and movie. Rereading the story or watching the movie again becomes a new and surprising experience with many a \\"Aha-Erlebnis\\" to savour.I have never been much of a script reader, but if you've been bowled over by the story of how stupidly people can ruin their lives and that of others, this book is the key to an even more gutwrenching and deeper understanding of how clever story and movie have been crafted. Defenitely a book to put on that list everybody makes to prepare for stays on deserted islands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Short-Story and Faultless Adaptation","review":"\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" deservedly won the Oscar (2006) for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay. Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana fleshed-out an illustrative and poignant script from the skeleton of Annie Proulx's short story. The ability to read and compare them side-by-side in one manuscript is an illuminating experience into the art of screen-writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An invaluable film reference","review":"The original story with the preface, the screenplay and in particular the author's essay were invaluable resources of insight into the creative process of filmmaking. Each individual piece is as moving as the film itself. An important reference that is sure to be picked up by a number of great film schools in the years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this book, see the movie - Brilliant!","review":"There's nothing more to say than to recommend this book and see this film. Both are brilliant, moving and touching. Hollywood has turned a corner with this story and it's about time that stories based on the human spirit are recognized and rewarded for the power they have to change lives. A wonderful read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must-have","review":"This is a book for everyone who was moved by the movie. It is very interesting to read the original short story and review the script afterwards. Just a few pages were enough for the original author to create all the passion and complexity that we enjoyed during the 90 minutes of motion picture. More impressive is that the short story has even some details that were not included in the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"This item took you through the entire life of the book to the screenplay to the movie. It was great reading what the writers said about the project and how it was a labor of love for everyone involved. It was wonderful reading how devoted everyone was to the project. Much how the two main characters were devoted to each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"This book is excellent. For anyone who saw this movie and loved it, or for anyone who is simply interested in how the story and screenplay came about, this book has the original short story, the screenplay, and sections by the author about writing the original story, and by Larry McMurtry and Diana Osana about writing the screenplay and what the story meant to them. Worth the time and money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short story, screenplay, then movie","review":"I first heard about the making of the movie and was interested in what the storyline was. After a lot of searching I realized it was a short story and aquired it through Amazon. After reading it and being so incredibly moved in only 28 pages, I anticipated the movie, but with much trepidation. The brief story had me in tears, what would a full length film do to me. I was incredibly moved, yet again. When I saw the 'Story to Screenplay', I was intrigued by the process that it takes for screenwriting and though it doesn't take you step by step, it gives you a sense of a creative process. Lastly, the essays by Annie Prouix, Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana are worth the price of the book on their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brokeback Mountain: Story to Screenplay","review":"I thoroughy enjoyed reading the actual story by Annie Proulx, the screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana was an extra bonus for me. I enjoyed all aspects of the film, the beautiful scenery, the haunting music score and the acting was so wonderful. Although Jake Gyllenhaal did win a BAFTA Award for his performance as Jack Twist, I was disappointed that neither he, nor Heath Ledger didn't win an Oscar because I truly believe they both deserved to. Brokeback Montain is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen and no doubt will remain one of my all time favourites. Well done to all concerned, a magnificent achievement, a real classic love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful!","review":"I would highly recommend this book to anyone!

This book is self-published and begs for professional editing. There are countless glowing spelling and grammatical errors. If one were to eliminate the redundancy and material not related to the subject, this rather expensive book would barely reach 100 pages. And, as if the contents were all his original ideas, he offers no bibliographic reference for any of the opinions, facts, or conclusions, even though many are contrary to conventional trapshooting wisdom and instruction. While Russell is quick to point out that the book is only useful if kept constantly on hand during practice and competition, he also sells it as an e-book that cannot be printed. All things considered, I have to seriously question the accuracy of the material and the validity of Mr. Russell's opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere","review":"I truly believe there may be some good information in this book.

The unfortunate thing about this printer is that the software refuses to recognize the ink once a certain amount of time or prints have passed. If you still have ink or not.

So, if you just want good coffee in the morning, do what I did and shut it all off. When and if the carafe breaks, I'll buy another one, which by the way costs about the same as other name brands if you do the research.

Aside from the poorly design water reservoir and water level indicator which the two combined make for a lovely time trying to fill each morning, I think my coffee is coming out weaker than I care for. I believe it has to do with the fast brewing that comes from the 1100W element. The coffee maker is marketed as having \\"Cascading brew head delivers a shower of hot water to ensure even flavor extraction\\". The head cascades a shower less than 40% of the total area of coffee, even for just a 4cup brew, and the speed of the brew combines for a weaker cup.Increasing the amount of coffee would only increase the volume of grind that falls outside of this shower. Tomorrow I am going to try the 1-3c setting to slow it down.

Secondly, the washable basket does not sit flat in the rinse side of the sink, you must also hold it to rinse it. It makes fine coffee, but another problem is that the gold filter does NOT FIT THIS COFFEEMAKER! You must buy paper filters.Either go back to the original or redesign.

The replacement came off in the dishwasher and we had to get a re-replacement. Then after 7 months, the electronic pad stopped working. For us, that's 3 defective elements in one machine!

The lid was made to come off in order to wash it, but after six months the thing was falling off quite easily.The bubble in the measuring tube was a constant annoyance, so it was difficult to determine exactly how much water was it the reservior.What made me throw this piece of junk in the trash was that the handle came off the coffee pot while pouring a cup of coffee on Easter morning.

In addition, the indicator gets air bubbles in it (probably from the inside water filter) making it completely useless.

For right handed people, the number of cups in the carafe is on the wrong side. The timer is complex and unless you want to use the timer at exactly the same time every day, you have to not use the timer at all or reprogram every day.The pot had two features that made me replace my old, burned out Braun coffeepot: The 5 hour on feature, and the carafe itself is microwaveable (no metal bands holding the handle to the carafe.)

Over automation can be a downer. It did allow us to program how long before it tunrs off, so it's now set at 3 hours.

The coffee it brews is truly great fresh, and it's even very good after sitting on the warmer for 3 hours. And this is the least expensive one - unless I needed one that looked better, I can't think of any reason to buy one of their pricier ones. After I received mine and tested it, I bought another just like it (we need two). The coffee is the thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disapointment","review":"This coffee maker is a major disappointment. I've had a Krups coffee maker since 1981 that works great but has started to have visual wear so I decided to replace it. I received the FME2 as a gift Christmas 2005 and have had nothing but problems. The water reservoir gets air pockets in it when water is poured into the tank, the coffee tastes burned after sitting in the carafe for a half hour, when pouring a cup of coffee the carafe leaks all over the counter and lastly the filter basket just broke. Fortunately I saved my old Krups which is now brewing my morning coffee. It isn't pretty to look at but it makes wonderful coffee without any problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad electronics","review":"I liked this coffee maker at first. It brewed quickly and made a good cup of coffee. Unfortunately after 3-4 months the electronic panel started acting funny and we were unable to turn the unit on or off. The time clock also stopped working and were unable to program the start time. In the end we had to unplug the machine because it would constantly turn itself on and off at random times. What good is a coffee maker when the unit will not turn on due to a faulty electronics panel? Guess it's time to find another coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Multiple issues","review":"I have had Krups coffee makers before and have been very happy with them. I bought this one as a replacement for one that was old enough that when I broke the carafe I couldn't find a replacement. So, prior to this I have been very happy with them. However, this maker has had multiple problems. The programmable feature stopped working early on. Now the reminder beeps are stuck in the on mode. I wake up earlier than my husband and this drives him crazy. About a year into owning it, the outer part of the handle came loose. It reattaches, but frequently falls off in my hand and recently fell off in the dishwasher, hit the heating element and partially melted. Its newest problem (1 1/2 yr mark) is the basket door swinging open in the middle of brewing. I am on this site looking at reviews of other coffee maker brands since I am having so many problems with it that I have to replace it. On a positive note, I do like the quality of the coffee it makes."},{"rating":"1","title":"problems, problems, problems","review":"I was given this coffee maker as a Christmas present and liked it right off. Made decent coffee and I really liked the fact that it would keep my coffee hot up to 5 hours however..... One week in and the water level indicator now has a bubble so I can't tell how much water to put in. I don't like using the pot to measure as it's always off. The carafe drips if you pour fast unless you lift the top of the carafe which I had to do with my old pot. I also don't like the #4 type filters they are very expensive when compared to the basket filters. All in all the coffee maker is being returned and I'm back to my old Mr Coffee until I can find a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to the drawing board","review":"I've been using Krups coffeemakers for over 20 years, this being the fourth I've purchased. It may also be the last.Programming the device is moderately frustrating, with less than clear directions. The water gauge is badly placed and too narrow - bubbles form in the gauge making it useless as a measure. The attached lid on the carafe makes it harder to clean. That it took three weeks of use before the smell of new, wet plastic infusing the coffee subsided also makes me wonder what has happened to the quality I'd come to expect.Krups seems to have decided to let appearance trump function, resulting in a machine that looks better than it works. Unlike its predecessors, I expect I'll be replacing this machine before it quits working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Krups Coffee Maker","review":"It makes great tasting coffee, really quickly. The buzzer does buzz when it is finished making & when it is going to turn off.I really like how the water level is magnified as you add water for easier viewing.

It makes a great cup of coffee and has a 1-3 cup setting. Plus, it is easy to clean and maintain."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst programming buttons ever!","review":"Have had this coffeemaker for about a year, the buttons already don't work. You have to press them 10 times on average to get it to work one time. Finally, the buttons are now failing so we can't program it anymore. Very confusing, and we are intelligent people who've owned many coffee makers in our lifetime. Don't lose the instruction book on this one - you will need it everytime the power goes out or you unplug it and have to start from scratch. Of course, that's if you can get the buttons to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffee Lover","review":"I bought this coffee maker four months ago. At first I was not pleased with it. I loved my old Krups coffee maker - great cup of coffee. This new one tasted like plastic. So I added a cup of vinegar to a 11 cups of water. Ran it through until the mix was in the system and let it stand for an hour. Then I ran the rest through. Ran two additional pots of plain water through and now this coffee maker makes as good a cup of coffee as my old Krups. Hope this helps anyone who is not satisfied with this maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Substitute for Braun","review":"I bought this coffee maker about 8 months ago, and had difficulty from the beginning. It was difficult to program - couldn't get the program for automatic brewing set, and then couldn't figure out how to turn it off, forcing me to unplug and cancel all programming. It leaked small amounts of water from the outset, and several times got into the clock/programming area. Recently, the water had apparently gotten into the program again, and all displays began flashing, and the coffee maker just shut down. I had a Braun Aroma Select which worked perfectly for 9 years before it finally gave out. I would never buy Krups again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful...poor quality, Krups customer service does not care","review":"Pot leaks when pouring coffee, water gauge is impossible to read because of air bubbles, programming is not intuitive - actually anti-intuitive - AND when I called Krups customer service, they offered no help...said that's just the way it is, they know about the problems, but will not do anything. Forget this unit, a waste of good money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Coffee Pot","review":"Pros: Overall size and design is streamlined. Right or left hand pot access. Brew basket door locks in place. Water compartment door opens away from user. Once the auto brew function is set, no need to turn \\"on.\\" Just remember to fill pot. \\"CALC\\" displays when pot needs to be demineralized. Cons: Little rubber feet on bottom of unit - to prevent sliding on counter did not stay on. Carafe lid not easily removable for cleaning. How long will those little lid pins last? The water level indicator tube sometimes allows an air bubble, but not a problem if you pour a premeasured amount of water. Coffee temp could be a few degrees hotter for my personal taste. Overall there is nothing that would prevent me from buying this unit again as the plusses far outweigh the annoyances of other brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Krups rules","review":"Makes 12 cups delicious hot coffee in 9-10 minutes. The water filter definitely performs as claimed. I have well water and this pot has made over 100 pots so far without descaling. My Bunn required weekly descaling. One piece of advise. This pot takes a little longer breakin. After running a few pots of just water per owners manual the first 8 to 10 pots were not drinkable. By the 15th pot, it's the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"Bought this to replace a Braun that died. Nothing works right--it overflowed until I took the filter out, coffee not hot, turns itself off and if it does you can't get it to warm the pot again. Hard to program, not intuitive, fussy about the grind of the coffee. I have this in the garage and have ordered another Braun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krups FME2-14 12-Cup...Skip this one!","review":"I've been a big supporter of Krups Coffee makers for more than 20-years, but this latest offering was pure garbage. The ergonomics of opening and closing the filter chamber felt cumbersome and the indicator level was always challenging to read (multiple bubbles formed inside). I literally had to use a flashlight to read it! Even worse, the coffee (Starbucks, I might add) tasted terrible. I had to dispose of my new Krups in the rubbish and buy a Cuisinart. Talk about a brand image self destructing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality product","review":"I purchased this item thinking it would be the same high quality as I had been used to by Krups in the past.Alas, this company too has succumbed to the high profit, low quality lure.The hot plate started rusting within 2 months, and upon my request for answers, I got a three line email stating I could mail the unit in for \\"service\\" many states away.Do they honestly think I will be going w/out a coffee maker for Lord knows how many weeks?I am shocked at their handling of the situation, moreover, the very low quality of the product...I will purchase a coffee maker from a different company next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY! - PIECE OF JUNK!","review":"I ordered this coffee pot based on the Krup's name and as a repeat buyer. Either they have gotten very bad at making them or Amazon got a batch of lemons! The first one the water indicator had so many air bubbles in it you could not tell how much water you put in it. I went on-line and exchanged it. The 2nd one had the same problem plus the auto shut off appeared to have shut the pot off 2 hours after brew but it really doesn't! Extreme Fire Hazard!I'm not going to blame Amazon for this one as they have never been a problem but Do not buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have owned several Krups coffee makers for many years and this model is a major disappointment. Where to start with the design flaws. The two piece carafe handle came apart within a month and will barely stay together. As other people have commented, the water level tube always has bubbles in it. Programing not intuitive so if there is a power outage you need the book. And you have to unplug it and reprogram when it decides it needs to be cleaned. I don't have hard water. And the light thing is just weird. On, off, blinking. There are better buys for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"Second Krups unit that has failed now - both lasted less than 2 years, and the LCD went out both times. The one I have now still shows the time, but you can't program it, or silence the beeps for when the coffee is ready. We've been using it that way for several months, but now it's leaking out the bottom - so It's going in the trash. DO NOT buy this brand of coffee maker, unless you want to replace it in 1-2 years.

In their defense I had some pretty EPIC heartburn while pregnant (didn't matter what I ate....I could have had bread and water the whole time), it pretty much felt like the fires of hell had set up camp in my stomach with some pretty rowdy parties in my esophagus (even a prescription from the doc never cured the heartburn).

It was him that led the independence struggle as some of his ideologue brothers spent time in American thinking of an Irish Republic. Mick Collins led the independence struggle while much of the IRA was either in exile or prison. He did so at great risk to himself. When the British wanted to negotiate, it was Mick who was the lead diplomat. He got the best deal he could from the British and then was opposed by the same ideolgues who spent their struggle in prison or America. This led to the Irish Civil War between Republicans and Free Staters. The capstone of the Civil War was when Mick was assasinated.This is not a complete biography of Michael Collins. If one desires a lengthy biography, please read Coogan's book. However this book provides a measure of the man. A good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fawning portrayal from a fan, not a historian","review":"Sadly, Frank O'Connor seems to have been more of an idolizer of Collins than an historian interested in focusing the reader on the important events of his life. One has to wade through multiple tepid apologies for his occasional boorishness, though O'Connor seems to find these stories irresistably cute and keeps going back to him again and again. It may be that the book is best suited to those who have read extensively the other biographers and historians so that this could be understood in context. The Big Fellow is not for the novice Irish history student, because you learn precious little from it and have to work hard to get that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barnette makes it easy","review":"I've looked through word origin books that were dry and hard to read, but Dog Days and Dandelions is a delight.

I hope either some of you readers will sell your used ones, or that more will be written or printed soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Language Fun!","review":"A friend gave me this book, and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. The author uses linguistic detective work to show us the tracks of all sorts of animal stories hidden inside familiar English words (like the little dog that inspired the word \\"feisty\\" and the caterpillar in \\"chenille\\"). She also makes it easy to learn some surprising new words. My favorite so far is \\"chatoyant,\\" which means \\"shining like a cats' eyes\\"!It is clear the author loves animals and also loves words. Her delight in both of them is infectious. Like everybody's favorite teacher, she clearly knows a lot about her subject, and communicates it with enthusiasm, plus a great sense of humor. I would recommend this book to any word lover, as well as to anyone else who's naturally curious about animals and the world around us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beastly fun","review":"Martha Barnette is the best. Few others can enliven dry and obsure facts and information like she can - all her books about words should be required reading for anyone with any aspiration of becoming a writer.

She loves it when you spin it around for her and will happily coo at it while being changed. It's great for parent/baby interaction together.I wish I would have thought to hang something like this over my son's changing table when he was younger.I will say that the only drawback is that it doesn't have a hook to hang it, so you have to find a way to secure it to the ceiling. Right now, I have it thumbtacked up there, which is working fine, but once she gets older and is able to reach it, I'll have to hang it more securely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunny Mobile!","review":"My baby loves this mobile and so do I!

As an example it was the renegade squadron that held off the empire while the rebels fled Hoth. The entire single play campaign is played from their perspectives and the levels are varied which is nice. The best part of this game is the multiplayer which is typical Battlefront style game play. Every map has numerous capture points that you'll need to hold. The more capture points you hold the faster your enemies reinforcement points lower. When you or the enemy run out of reinforcement points the game is over. The only new element they've added is the space battles which are a neat novelty.

Their claim that it eliminates odors is ridiculous. I even tried scooping it every day (which they say you don't have to do) but it made almost no difference. The cat urine soaks into the flaky bark material, and just makes big wet clumps that reek. The only way it \\"works\\" is to completely dump it 2X per day. Not exactly cost effective!

Suite No. 1 in G-sharp major!) is most disconcerting.I was so shocked when I first put the CD on I had to run to a friend's house, who still had the LPs, just to see if I had somehow remembered the original sound wrong. No, the LPs were fine, Suite No. 1 is in G major and so on.Starker's new set, on RCA, is wonderful, so perhaps it doesn't matter, but it is still distressing to hear this happen. Why? Why? Why?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a crying shame","review":"It does sound a half-step sharp. I consider Starker, Rostropovich and Colin Carr as the very best modern cellists.

Stacks perfectly - Love It!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT stack these racks!","review":"Initially I bought these racks and the idea seemed brilliant. No counter space for your cookies? Just stack them up. Well, I've had them collapse on me three or four of the half dozen times I've tried to stack them. The racks have little feet on the four corners that are supposed to set into the rack beneath them. In my experience, only three of the four feet actually set properly into one another. It's the feet that I blame for the collapse. Sometimes the cookies are cooled enough and the collapse doesn't do much damage, but usually several are banged up pretty badly and others slide to the floor (and then they're really dead!). If you are desperate for space and feeling brave, try it out, but if you're working on 'special' cookies for an event, etc, don't trust them.Overall they are easy to clean and only slightly thicker than normal racks to store. However, since the whole point of purchasing the racks was for their stacking ability, I only give them two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusty already","review":"These racks are a good idea, poorly executed. They're a little flimsy and tricky to set up, particularly if you're holding a tray of cookies in one hand and trying to set up another rack on top of the first. The racks are quite small so you need more than one for a typical baking sheet. They've also started to rust already around the hinge area and I've only used them about half a dozen times. Short of breaking out the hair dryer it's just not possible to get that area totally dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"What a disappointment! I had a set of these for many years - still going strong - but I needed a 2nd set - It is NOT the same. Same dimensions but each rack is 8.2 oz less metal then the originals.

I was sorry to see how much Wilton had cheapened the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"These cookie racks are steady and strong. They clean up easily and cookies don't stick.

The surface is easy to clean if cookie crumbs get stuck and having 3-tiers is great for a tiny apartment with limited kitchen space. I've cooled pies and brownies on them too, but only 1-tier high. I don't think they'd handle anything else.The quality is pretty good, one tier is kind of bent from use, but admittedly it did fall off my small counter top. It fell because the legs collapse very easily. I've nearly dumped a few dozen cookies on the floor a couple times because of the unstable legs.When I make small cookies, sometimes they fall through the mesh, too. The spacing should be a bit closer together, that would solve the problem.For the price and space-saving qualities, I would recommend this rack. However, if you have the money to buy a better one, do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Fit","review":"I'm glad I bought these. I bought 2 sets for Christmas baking and had plenty of room.

It's as advertised, and it works well, but be aware you have to play around a bit to get them to stack, and one was bent down in the middle. Still, they work for me and they've already been useful with my one batch of cookies that has made loads of cookies! I do like that the tiers fold down, so they will fit in the drawer I want them in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilton 3-tier cooling rack","review":"I have a small kitchen and without a lot of counter space, these racks are very handy. They fold down for storage so for me, they are very convenient.Beverly M"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great space saver","review":"Prior to purchasing these I had one large flat cookie rack, the problem being that I didn't have enough room to cool down more than 10-12 cookies at once. These racks come apart completely so you can use one, two or all of them at one time. There are also two ways you can position the legs - so the rack is tall like in the picture, or so that it is closer to the counter which is useful if you're not stacking them or trying to cool something heavier than cookies.That being said, these racks really are meant for cookies. They're not as heavy duty as a single tier cooling rack so I wouldn't use it to stack pies or something. The racks are easy to clean and are dishwasher safe. I would highly recommend these if you're a bit constrained for space or need an affordable set of racks. I don't think the set is a replacement for a heavy duty rack if you like to bake heavier items such as bread/loaves or pies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as expected","review":"They do the trick and stackable takes up less space in the kitchen, awesome!

The only issue I have is that I find them to be very unstable whether stacked or not. The 'legs' easily slip and collapse which is very annoying, especially if you have your hands full. They don't snap into place when stacking with is a feature that I assumed was there.

I'll probably be ordering more before Christmas gets here. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"Cannot find a better substitute!!

I first thought the racks seemed a bit flimsy, but they work great and I have had no problems with them. They are easy to clean, and I like that you can also use each rack seperately, as well as stacked. The only minor complaint is that you can't slide the entire cookie sheet onto the racks when they are stacked, a drawback for those recipes in which the cookies need those last few minutes of contact with the hot pan outside of the oven to finish baking, but not a deal breaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"cookie rack","review":"not very sturdy.

I find that they are easier to use if they are not stacked, but I have limited counter space and I love that I can choose to stack them if I like. I also don't have to waste paper towels, which is what I used before to set cookies on to cool. Plus, they prevent the counter from getting all greasy. Easy to clean and store. I would buy them again and again. Another great product from Wilton!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wobbly and unstable","review":"I thought this would be an ideal set of racks but I do think I will use them.

They have been utilized ever since. They were also an amazing price. Perfect for when i need the space for baking for the holidays, easy storage and no more need for several smaller baking racks that take up too much room. Grab these if your looking for an easy solution. Also perfect gift for the bakers in your life.

I sent this set back and will be buying a second set with the crossbars going all the way across."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wilton, really?","review":"Sadly this product does not deserve the Wilton name. I totally expected more from this company. The $10 price is ok for this product, but expect these to be VERY flimsy. I have a set of Pampered Chef racks and I thought they would be similar, since Wilton quality on other products is comparable to PC. REALLY not so. They are smaller and really unstable. I would expect these to have some random never heard of brand on them. They work fine as long as I set them up for my kids to be able to put cookies on, but they've dumped when I've let my kids stack them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but rusty already?!","review":"I received this and it was rusty out of the box! The black coating had chipped off in several of the corners and it was rusting. I would have asked for a replacement if it wasn't ALL three pieces, but I really don't think that just three pieces slipped past quality control, I think it's just a cheap product. I think this is a really good product idea but poorly implemented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for our needs","review":"These racks are great and perfect for our needs. I bought one set of racks, then came back and bought another set. We've used them stacked 6 high with cookies and muffins, and we've used them not stacked for several loaves of bread and loaf pans. Since I use glass loaf pans, they take a longer time to cool. The racks are arranged three across and 2 deep and that gives a perfect surface for both the loaves and the loaf pans. Six racks is all we ever need, but if one ever gets damaged or lost, I'll be back to buy another set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"I've used the cooling racks twice since I received them. For purpose of cooling they server there intended use. Although a bit uneven they work great for my 3 layer cake. Once you begin stacking another layer, you have work carefully to keep the racks from collapsing on to other layers of cake. Would have been ideal if you could lock the legs of the stand in place. Seem to be a good product I would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stackable has its advantages","review":"These racks are so easy to use I should have bought more and probably will later.

They are packaged in a plastic clam-shell that rubs up against the actual metal parts, and because of this made circular scratches all over the cover and drain. There needs to be a protective foam or something to keep these parts protected. I am tired of buying and returning these, so I will look for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks, useless, will need to purchase something else","review":"This product does not work. First they tell you to place plumbers putty under the flange of the part that screws into the drain, and never tell you what to do with the washer itself.

Do yourself a favor and find a better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works OK, doesn't support itself in unplugged position","review":"This was reasonable to install and came on time with all the parts. But the screw drain plug is annoying. When you are trying to drain the tub, you can't unscrew it a little and leave it to let the water drain out - it gets sucked down into the drain again, and stops the water flow. You have to unscrew the entire top all the way and take it off to get the water to drain out.

You can tell that a lot of quality and detail are built into this tent. We had two nights of pretty steady rain, and not a single drop got inside the tent. This thing is huge, and when we put the room divider in place it seemed even larger. Very cool. One thing that we really liked - the stuff bag was huge! and so easy to put the tent back into. Dont know why but thats always been a pet peeve of mine. I am gonna buy the floor saver, I think it will help protect the tent floor a little more.I dont ordinarily write reviews on the net, but I was moved to write about this.

We were 2 stakes short and one of the snaps on the rain fly broke when we were taking it down. The divider fastens in the four corners and the top and is little more than a screen. There is only one small pocket on the tent wall which may hold a pair of glasses and you have to choose whether you use the loft or the room divider as both cannot be up at the same time.

As he should be; Wright's day job was orchestrating for Radio City Music Hall. The sound is lush, the dynamics amazing, the performance spot on. It gets four stars only because I can't justify five, not having heard the Gershwin half.I suppose that if you can't find a nice copy to play on a good turntable with a warm amplifier, then this CD would do - but then, you miss the excitement of hearing sound you've been taught can only come from a CD, magically floating straight up from ancient vinyl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick With The Computer's Internal Speakers","review":"I didn't go into this purchase expecting much, just some cheap speakers that would be better than my computer's internal speakers.

You must crank your stereo up loud! The whole symphony comes off just as well and this has to be Paray's finest moment on disc (along with the Suppe overtures also on Mercury).

Current conductors in recent recordings have versions that are blah in comparison. I really like Paray's performance, but there are two annoyances that ruin it for me. In the Poco Adagio towards the end, one of the violins slides (sort of glissandos) into the high notes. Towards the end of the Maestoso, a violin makes a prominent sqeaking noise.I thought the Charles Munch BSO version was much superior both in sonics, recording, musicianship, interpration, excitement, emotion, and punch. If Symphony #3 is one of your favorite pieces, it is good to have both versions, both 'old masters,' and you make the comparison yourself. For me, Munch gets 5 stars and Paray gets 4.

The events have clearly inspired her and appear to have served as the catalyst for her greatest musical achievement. My personal favorite, \\"Riding Heaven's Wave: Eulogy to a Surfer,\\" is a piece that captures the hope, faith, and renewal that characterizes so much of her work.

The batteries can be quickly changed when needed. It sure is nice not having to waste time trying to plug a mouse in.The only drawback it has is the lack of a \\"battery life\\" meter, so when the mouse stops working I'd recommend checking the batteries first thing.The batteries that came with the mouse didn't have a \\"best by\\" date so I have no idea if they were in good condition, but the new batteries I installed have already exceeded the life of the previous ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice.","review":"Nice little mouse so far.

In fact, my saw was so poorly constructed that it shook while running. The dealer suggested I try different blade.

I've been doing this for 25+ years so I know how to set up a saw for a particular blade.This blade broke after about 10 minutes. And it was probably less than 5 minutes of actual cutting. The job at hand required trimming a stack of 3/8 x 1/8 plastic strips to length.An extended fence was used which supports the plastic strip on both sides of the blade.

This scheme will not produce good English for any chemical equation and will produce incorrect statements for most (A + B -> C + D does NOT mean to imply that C reacts with D). What could be simpler than + means \\"and\\"? Then the arrow means \\"reacts to produce\\", and everything works. In the same paragraph, the book confuses number and numeral and gets it wrong.

I bought this saw knowing it wouldn't be the best but hoping it would be adequate. The natural blade twist (always to the LEFT! despite snugging up the guides as well as possible) causes you to twist your piece to compensate. This causes burn on the wood and has a tendency to rip the blade out of the guides or bind it. As an added bonus, the guides eventually wear down, worsening the problem!

A lot of people have had hard lives, but let's face it, she was almost unknown until she married one of the most famous men in the world.The book was a total bore - Heather, if you had hired a better ghost writer, I might have felt differently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old story -- you've heard it before","review":"It's the same old rags-to-riches story. We've heard it a hundred times. It is no different coming from a billionaire's wife. Sorry, but it's a little trite.The part that bothers me most is that she claims Paul McCartney is incapable of compromise -- that he got rich and famous at a very young age, and this made him unable to compromise. My response is this: you cannot have a successful and beautiful 30-year marriage to the same woman, and raise 4 happy and healthy children, if you are \\"incapable of compromise\\". Her attitude is poor and selfish. It totally turned me off and I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"COULD'VE BEEN BETTER","review":"VALERIE IS A GREAT WRITER, WITH GREAT THOUGHTS BUT IT TAKES HER TO LONG TO GET THERE.

This is a different area of writing for Ms. Wesley, however, I did enjoy her novel. The problems with these characters were typical for people who never learned how to love. Medora was a strong woman and knew what she wanted out of life. Randall never felt love,was never taught how to love so when he had love, he didn't know what he had. Ana had been hurt before, but was willing to give love another chance and thought that Randall was the right man for her, however, Ana was misguided again. All in all, it was a good book with a great storyline. I did enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I started this book and it took me about five days to read up to page thirty. I absolutely hated this book. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This story lacked a plot and the climax was a huge let down. Each time I put it down it was really hard to pick back up, but I'm one of those people who needs closure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"First problem. Getting the front and back pieces of the case apart without damage was somewhat difficult.Second problem. Putting the two halves of the case back together so that they snap together without damage is also more difficult than it seems it should be.Third (and most serious) problem. Although it's possible to operate the Zen without removing it from the protective case, the design of the case interferes with the proper operation of the unit. Pressing the Back button on the Zen activated the Play/Pause button instead. This happens because the plastic tab on the case that should depress the Back button on the Zen is offset from where it should be; so the wrong button gets pushed. You can fiddle with the case and the Zen to get things lined up, but they won't stay aligned.Because of these problems, I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Description from the inside of dust jacket","review":"This delightful book, with its lively, informative text and beautiful, full-color photographs, explores all aspects of the world of horses. Their story is one that covers many thousands of years - from eohippus, the tiny dawn horse to equus, the horse as we know it today.Since its domestication the horse has been a faithful and constant companion, both in work and leisure. This is a superb introduction to many of the world's breeds: the mongolian wild horses of the gobi desert, the splendid, purebred arabians, the sturdy native pony breeds and the impressive heavy horses. There is all the glamour of the horse show, the excitement of racing, the thrills of the rodeo, and the pleasures of just owning a horse, whether for showing or family riding.Description from inside of dust jacket-submitted by peruvianpaso."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Delta...","review":"Nothing personal,but Delta dropped the ball on this one.It will make a true mortise cut,but adjusting the chisel with the auger bit is a lot a work.I purchased this tool hoping to save some work.Tends to overheat.I'm a casual user of this tool.The Idea is wonderful,but needs some re-engineering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delta Mortising Attachment","review":"This set appears to be good quality and set up is easy enough.It requires bit sets with 5/8 shoulder and those appear to be mostly delta bits.

It ended up being as challenging as the graduate courses I had been taking.Even though this book has gone through a few editions and revisions, there are still edits that need to be made. There are numerous problem sets where the data is not correct, or is not complete enough to answer the questions asked in the book.Sebba vaguely defines terms once and then uses different non-defined terms for the rest of the book, leading readers to guessing whether or not the two terms are actually referring to the same thing. It doesn't help that the definitions he gives for some of his terms are not the definitions the rest of the linguistic world uses for those same terms.In short, don't buy this book unless you are absolutely required to. And read everything else you can find on pidgins and creoles so that you can halfway understand the points that Sebba is trying to convey."},{"rating":"2","title":"high quality machine","review":"I used this exact machine in shop class in school and this is the best drill press in the class room.

The splendid colors are soothing and pleasing to the eye, while the theme of focusing on the Star image for inner strength and healing is gently brought home on each page. This reminds me of a visual mantra, so to speak, a way of easily connecting with the universal love energy within us all. I have personally used the Star image not only for myself, but for sending healing energy to family and friends. I believe it has been very helpful. For readers desiring to learn more about White Eagle's teachings, there are many more books available on this site to explore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winsome Wood Book Case","review":"Box arrived on time and everything looked OK, One of the shelf looked like someone filled a hole with putty but didn't sand it before the stain went on. Top shelf is warped, I couldn't tighten enough, there's a big gap on both sides. Wasn't a very good buy. It is sturdy though."},{"rating":"1","title":"cracked top","review":"I would not recommend this shelf because it was very hard to assemble. The pieces didn't fit together and pilot holes did not line up. After about one week, the top cracked and I assume it was due to the stress caused by the pieces not fitting properly. It looked nice at least until the crack. The color is very dark, much darker than I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price.","review":"Great price with free shipping for a solid piece of furniture. One note - the grain of the wood varies and that causes the color of the stain to vary with it. Every shelf is a little different shade of espresso.

I liked it so much that I purchased another unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"cracked","review":"Large crack at bottom, that was actually stained over.

The color was spot on to match the crib and glider. Easy to assemble and good quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality","review":"I was very disappointed with this shelf. The top shelf looked like it was upside down and the unfinshed side is facing up. The wood is not nice looking and it was scratched on the top. Definately not worth the 69.99 that I paid for it. Also, isn't exactly what is shown in picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to assemble, easy on the eyes","review":"I was looking for an alternative to the overpriced and oversized TV stands out there, and this looked perfect. It couldn't be better without having it custom built; it's sturdy with clean lines that don't clash with other pieces in my living room. It's just deep enough for my blu ray player, which is bigger than my DVR or my DVD player. It's not quite as wide as my TV but until I get a custom unit (or move) it's well suited for the space. It also assembled in under 5 minutes. On the downside, as mentioned in another review, there are flaws in the surface of the wood, but only in two small spots, and the pieces can be reversed to minimize that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shelves are of very little quality","review":"The shelves are of very little quality. It looks like that were glued together as 2 broke while in the process of assembling and 1 came half broken and you could noticed that they were actually 2 tables glued into one."},{"rating":"1","title":"WINSOME WOOD SHELF","review":"This was the second Winsome wood shelf I had purchased. After receiving the first one, which met my expectations with a decent sleek and shiny finish, I decided to order another. The second was NOT the same quality. The finish was dry and dull, had some minor nicks in it, and its finish did not match the first one I bought, dull vs shiny. Instead of having it \\"out there\\" where it could be seen next to the sofa along with its companion shelf as I had wanted, I put cork on the top of it and shoved it in a corner. I'm not sure where it will go next. I considered \\"trying it again\\" by ordering another one, but then decided it wasn't worth the gamble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eileen Geeson is as smart as a poodle!","review":"I've owned standard poodles for 50 years and have been reading about them for about that long.

Contrary to another review I saw, I think the author does a fun and elegant job of distinguishing the standard from the other sizes of poodle. I have had all sizes over my 40 years, and reading this book or just perusing it on occasion reminds me of how much I love them. I regret that I lent my original copy out because I never got it back.

In addition to this, you will find a great story teller. These are songs whose performance comes from the heart. Everytime I listen to this album, I find new meaning in the words that Ms. O'Connor sings. This album contains a range of styles, from country to broadway to contemporary cabaret. Ms. O'Connor's interpretation of each of these is right on the mark. I particularly enjoyed the David Friedman songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet as Summer","review":"Anita's blend of warmth and richness give her voice a very distinctive quality that reminds me of a Summer Night down by the lake.

However, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major dissapointment","review":"I liked Wings of Desire so much that I rented and watched this sequel. Frankly it was major dissapointment to me. It seems Wenders tries to have a \\"real plot\\" and some \\"action\\" in the movie.

But it's quite fine and useful for further analysis. especially if you are reading or working out Heidegger and existentialist thought as well. To see over and over again. A masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price for the director's commentary alone","review":"Although I'd already seen the movie when it was released on VHS some years ago, I purchased this DVD because of the blurb on the back cover mentioning that it contained \\"Director Wim Wenders' Audio Commentary.\\" It turned out to be just that: Wender's commentary overlaid throughout the full length of the movie. It was like being in the theater with Wender's sitting next to me, explaining every scene and regaling the listener with anecdotes about the movie, its actors, and his experiences as a director. It would be wonderful if more directors did this sort of thing; a feature uniquely suited to DVD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Void of meaning; boring enough to put you to sleep","review":"Starts out great, then descends into a horrifying hell of boredom and ambiguity and mixed up wastelands of celluloid. There was no point to this movie and it literally put me out; yep, it put me to sleep. I thought the beginning looked promising but then it turned into one of the most enigmatic wastes of time I have ever watched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are you Anne?!?!?!?","review":"This book was so void of Anne or even her children, it made you depressed to read it. The story of the Merediths was intresting, but i think they should perhaps have their own story and not take up a whole book of Anne's. It's even harder to find Gilbert, there is NO romance between them at all in this book. This is by far my least favorite Anne book. Bottom line: good book in its self but she should have just cut Anne out of it and started a new series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"Well, Anne's children sure have grown up! Jem is now 13, Walter 12, Di & Nan 10, Shirley 8, and Rilla 6! I just ADORE the Blythe children as WELL as the Meredith children. It took me a while to get used to the Meredith clan being main characters, but I now have. The wonderful stories in this book give it a lively feeling. The only thing I don't like is the fact that there seems to be a ghost in Ingleside. His name? Shirley. Where is he in this book besides the beginning? But otherwise, I love it from cover to cover. Let the piper come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most charming book in the world","review":"I had already read all the Anne books, when I found this one and I liked more than any other book in the world.

The Wagner pieces are rich, superbly balanced in the lower brass and horn sections (most notably). Furthermore, the Respighi La Boutique Fantasque, is a sleeper. One most often thinks of the \\"Pines\\" as the only symphonic band epic here. The ensemble does a great job with dynamics/contracts, a very interesting interpretation. I do prefer the impact of a \\"full\\" symphonic band versus an ensemble however in Elsa's Procession. The only CD/recording that I would suggest as an alternative would be in the University of Illinois Symphonic Band collection.It would give Eastman a run for the money, but you have to contact UI direct. You can't find the band recordings any more and therefore Eastman, as the most prolific symphonic training institution for brasses/winds, can't be beat in most cases."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"I agree with the reviewer questioning the book's accuracy. Brill is very dogmatic and not a particulalry engaging writer. It seems as though he has fabricated or inaccurately represented a large part of the book's content to fit his agenda.

You have to read between the lines to see it though. I am not sure what you should do first though, read the book or watch the movie. I watched the movie first.

I don't like the sameness of the titling theme for a start, since it is sometimes, hardly part of the story at all. I have read several of her books, and I loved some and others, I was not so enthralled. This author likes to throw in French phrases, and words, and it irrates me, since I don't know very many, (if any,) meanings of those phrases and am irrated by the fact, that the author doesn't bother to translate them either.

I kept reading because it really has potential but it never lives up to it, so save yourself the trouble and agony and try a a different series, such as Carolyn Hart'sDeath on Demand (Death on Demand Mysteries, No. 1)series, most of which are fun and enjoyable, or stop afterThe Body in the Cast: A Faith Fairchild Mystery, which was probably the best of the series.

This puts her right in the middle of a murder of one of the actresses and one of the candidates.

The book shines with Hall's personality and depth of professional experience. For those new to Reiki, there are photos which clearly depict the technical \\"hands-on\\" aspect of a Reiki Session. Students may find a useful study guide in Chapter 10 which details the interrelatedness of the endocrine system and the energy centers (chakras) of the body. Of course such things are not *just* interesting to Reiki practitioners, but to anyone exploring \\"energy medicine\\" and on the lookout for comprehensible information.

As I read this book, I wondered if perhaps she had initially conceived this series running for six or seven books. That would really be a tragic ending to what should have been a promising trilogy.

It does appeal to teenagers as both my friend and I have read the whole series and understood it.And changing from different characters is different but I found it to be effective, as some books are ruined by a boring narrator.

I was 300 pages into the novel when I realized that I could skip entire chapters and I would still understand the entire book! Utterly horrible and contemptible! Nothing...NOTHING happens in this book! Go buy Readers Digest, it's much more fun. This is almost as bad as a Terry Goodkind novel!. The worst thing is that the first book held so much promise.

In order to accomplish this, she has so many storylines and so many characters going in so many different directions, one gets lost (the geneological chart at the front of the book is of absolutely no help at all). As one gets further and further into the book, you'll find yourself flipping over whole chapters and saying, \\"end already!\\"The crime is that she has, in the tale of Bloodheart's successor, a truly fascinating and creative story-line that goes nowhere and has no apparent relationship to the rest of the book.For those of us who loved her JARAN series, this a real disappointment. Let's hope she will mercifully end it all soon and go on to something worthy of her talents"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Saga Continues","review":"This book continues the King's Dragon saga, resolving some of the conflicts and building towards the climax. Elliott's understanding of history, reality, and people is profound and woven into a vivid world. She avoids cliches, flat simple characters, and shallow places and races that often plague the literature of the fantastic. Instead she gives us a world in which the veil that separates reality and fantasy is lifted and the two worlds blend for a rich reading experience. The characters are us, frail, dynamic, and strong all at once. A definite read for those who want to feel when they read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard wait for the fourth in the series","review":"...This is a great series but I advise waiting til the lastbook comes out before getting hooked; the cliffhanger endings canleave you grinding your teeth in frustration....Elliott leaves her characters chained up with homicidal dogs, stranded in other dimensions, and so forth.

The first two books in this series are also worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some witty moments...","review":"\\"Irish Tenure\\" has some witty moments, but they are few and far between. As a matter of fact, the wittiest part of the book is the title! (Irish Tenure--tenor. Get it?) The puzzle centers on a long-lost story of G.K. Chesterton, and the political faculty catfights of academe. There are some dry little jokes scattered about, and some clever puns, but not much in the way of plot to involve us or characters to care about. In the end, it is a relief to put the book down. To phrase the final words of Ralph McInerny, \\"It's the only tenure that matters.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Irish Bore","review":"I saw a copy of this book at the library and thought I would give it a chance.

Don't get me wrong the girl does have lyrical potential(although she fails to execute it here) but she is seriously lacking in all other aspects of music developement. I mean, who wrote the hooks to the songs. She kept talking about how she was going to blow up--she was right, because I am going to pour the gasoline on the disk personally. The only song that was decent on the album was the first single, Romeo & Juliet, but I don't think she knows that they killed themselves at the end of the story, or maybe she did, because this listening experience made me want to die."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD rulz!!","review":"I first heard this CD in my boyfriend's car and I fell in love with it.

Is it really worth it for a few dollars worth of cable?"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this printer!","review":"I've had this printer fro 2.5 years and, if I could, I would throw it out the window. Every time I try to print it makes weird noises and refuses to print. When it finally does print it leaves huge smudges of ink all over the paper so that you have to print again, wasting time, money, ink, and paper. When it does print, it prints ok, but still has blotches on the paper. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER, IT IS SUCH A WASTE!! I wouldn't even give it one star, but the page said I had to put some rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper Jams","review":"I have found that this printer gets paper jams quite often. Then it jams and you get a code for service. Clearing the jam does not help when you get the service code. Have not had the copier very long.There have also been other print problems (partial characters printed, partial color or more than one color on characters.I had another Epsen printer (a model before this one) and it had exactly the same problems. It's now sitting in storage with a code saying to have it serviced. That was also brought on by a paper jam.Both of the above printers had the exact same problems, even though they were different models.I am not pleased with the quality of Epson printers. They look nice and perform ok for a few months, then start having problems.Overall, I have had 5 Epson printers. Not satisfied with any of them.I would highly recommend to avoid Epson printers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect any good support from Epson. Period.","review":"Windows Vista has been post-RTM for months now, and Epson still doesn't have a driver for this product? Pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure frustration","review":"Epson has designed their printers to malfunction without frequent replacement of their own extremely over-priced ink cartridges. If you try a more affordable after market cartridge you will need to send your printer to Epson repair for servicing. Another of the many examples of the joys of Epson: if the yellow cartridge, for example, begins to get low the unit will stop functioning, even if you only need to print in black. This is a real treat late at night when you're facing a deadline. I will NEVER buy another printer, or any device for that matter, from Epson again. If there was an option for zero stars - this would get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works","review":"Ok, SO I didn't give it five, because although it was easy to install and prints fine and all, it is pretty slow (even with the high speed usb cardbus pcmica card from compusa)and loud! Also, I can't figue out how to edit the pictures I've scanned. It only lets me select number of copies and choose between 4X6 or 5X7 or letter size. This is even with the restoration mode on. Otherwize, it is great for regular print jobs, and love the slide scan (even though it takes forever). Finally, the pictures come out looking very good. Never have to go to kinkos again (i don't think!)Epson doesn't recyle their ink into paper at office depot like HP does, so I will miss the recycled paper bonus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ink Cartridges are a sore spot.","review":"Nice all around features EXCEPT, the ink cartridges frequently clog and have to be replaced way too often. If I had it to do all over, I would definitely not purchase this printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"No!","review":"I bought one of these in March '06, and it was dead by August. The replacement that the store gave me in August died in December. The store no longer sells the printer, so I got a refund. The quality of the prints was fine, but the problem was that the paper would not feed through the machine. It would pull the paper through on one side but not the other, resulting in constant paper jams. Extremely frustrating. In both cases, it finally got to the point where it would not feed paper through at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Driver for Intel-based Macs?!","review":"Great printer/scanner--when it works. (The CX7800; I apparently wrote another review on the CX6000 page by mistake?!) Does suck ink... but I was able to print 150 full-color letter-size Xmas cards without replacing cartridges for another week afterwards. I am on my second CX7800--the first died after a simple paper jam. The current problem is: I have since upgraded from a Mac G4 to a MacBook Pro Intel-based laptop, and have spent HOURS installing/uninstalling re-downloading, resetting, restarting, etc. to make the recommended \\"driver\\" for this printer work, but IT DOES NOT SHOW UP!!! Now I wonder if it really even exists? Epson Support only repeats its same incomplete instructions without addressing the issue. I give up... and am on the lookout for a better solution from any OTHER company. Epson had its chances... and did not deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Printer with Inefficient Ink Use","review":"I have owned this printer for about two years. It hasn't malfunctioned yet, which I suppose is good, but also it hasn't wowed me with its abilities. It is an entry-level printer/scanner/card reader with few advanced features. It requires frequent preventative maintenance (print head alignment etc.). But the most frustrating facet of Epson CX-7800 ownership is just how inefficient it is with ink! Ink runs out frequently, especially black, and the replacements are expensive. Next time I'll buy an HP."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"Do not buy this printer! I spent hours working on a paper I need for class and then I tried to print it out...it's only text, black and white. My blue ink is out so I CANNOT PRINT!!!!!

I've had very little trouble with it. One print didn't come out well, but I think it might have been the glossy paper I used. As a single sheet scanner it is fine, as expected. What I didn't expect was that I could print from slides (not too surprising) and photo-negatives (which did surprise me). The carriers for the slides and negatives fit neatly in their own compartments in the lid, so you don't loose them, and they index the film or slide so the printer handles them flawlessly.I think its a great product for the price.But I wish I could refill the ink cartridges. It's got to be where Epson planned to make their fortune. Hence the 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Funn","review":"Not as fun as some other money mazes I've used.

They're all three tremendously good works, among the best of their creators, full of the burgeoning creativity of the American compositional mind.This disk is just as valuable as testament to Hanson's amazing power as an interpreter and advocate for the best American music. He never pretended he understood all of it, or cherished all of it, but he unfailingly selected first-rate material that he could communicate like no one else for his recordings, and we're all the better for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have for Old School Ballad Fans","review":"This album has some of the best smooth jams from the early 90's. \\"Always and Forever\\" is a nice cover for Heatwave's original version, and \\"Whatever Happened To Us\\" is a nice slow jam if you're in the mood for something thought-provoking. \\"Right Next To Me\\" is definitely a top-notch slow jam for anyone that appreciates romantic music.

However, I must make an exception when it comes to my favourite author Kaye Gibbons.I eagerly (and obsessively) awaited the publication of her latest novel. Of course, it was worth the wait. Yet again I feel validated as a woman, capable of anything, and am more keenly aware of the influence my life has on the males in it and vice versa.Ms. Gibbons writes the most darkly, inspiring stories in the most beautiful way. It's not just what she writes but the way she writes it. Thank you, Ms. Gibbons and when can we expect more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good - But Not Her Best","review":"First, let me say that I LOVE Kaye Gibbons and have read all of her books, so naturally I couldn't wait to get my hands on this, her latest.I was slightly disappointed because I thought it wasn't nearly as powerful as some of her previous novels. BUT: I enjoyed it and gained some insights into the terrible harm that verbal abuse can produce.And: Kaye Gibbons is STILL one of my favorite authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"not Ms Gibbons best work","review":"Although this book was good it is not Ms Gibbons best work in my opinion. It starts out way too slow. Troop is unbearable and why his wife didn't totally lose her mind is beyond me. I was very disappointed in Ms Gibbons remarks in her acknowledgements. \\"I called my agent and threatened to find a real job. I could be a prison guard or bottle soda pop, for the daily terror and repetitive drudgery of both jobs seemed in line with what was being required of me right then...' I do not have either of those jobs myself, but I would think anyone who does would take offense.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weak Book","review":"This is a pretty dismal book. The characters are one-dimensional and stereotypical, be they major or minor characters, and as a result, they are not interesting at all. In a book in which there is not much plot, the characters should be much more complex. The writing style in general is not bad, and does a decent job of evoking the tone of the early 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divining Women","review":"This book was so good!!! I fell over laughing at some of the dialogue in here and because I am a Labor & Delivery nurse, I was compelled to recite to my fellow nurses at the nurses station the part of the book where the aunt recounts how her husband planned for her to have a hysterectomy because it was the cause of all the emotional turmoil that he thought she was going through.... and the other treatments that he had subjected her to: shock treatment, vaginal fumigation, etc. We were all on the floor with laughter at the silliness of it all. What she needed no doubt was a divorce from her crazy, overbearing, spouse!! I truly enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I have loved all of Kaye Gibbons' books, and couldn't wait to get my hands on Divining Women. Started reading it immediately, and just could not get into it for about two years. I finally read it, and found it to be so one-dimensional that I would never recommend it. Such a tragedy too, because there are morsels of gold scattered here and there, which actually kept me reading and hoping (and laughing). But I honestly didn't care too much one way or the other whether Maureen stayed or left. And Troop was too much; too unbelievable, too pompous, too rediculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and shallow","review":"Matt Braun is my favorite western author. His ability to bring the likes of John Hardin and Dr. Holiday back to life within the pages of his books is amazing. It is/was in that spirit I ordered this book.Dakota is about the time Theodore Roosevelt spent in the Dakota territory after the death of his first wife, the conflict between Roosevelt and De Mores and several incidents that occurred the Dakota's that would help form the man Roosevelt became latter in life.In short a time period that was full potential, adventure and historically available documentation. There was so much that Matt Braun could have done with this. Yet Roosevelt comes across as a caricature. He is never fully fleshed out nor was I ever even remotely drawn in to the man's being.It is a sad thing that Mr. Braun was not able to bring Theodore Roosevelt to life as he had done with other characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I have a 7 week old baby and this is the only bag we have used, thus far.

It's like a peastant trying to debate Stalin on the merits of agricultural collectives. The great irony is that for all their critiques of power structure, they assume the most dominating of all power structures: perspective and truth.

Cool idea; straightforward string locking mechanism and built in cutter. They look very nice, too. However, right from the get-go the tuner for the high E string would often let it slip. I ended up using multiple wraps around the post just like a standard tuner to make it hold. Minor aggravation. Now, within the last month, two of the tuners have broken. Yes, I play strings that are a little heavier than usual, and I do a bunch of string bending. Still, for what these things cost and the hype, I expected more. I ended up replacing these with Wilkinson tuners for a LOT less money. The Wilkinsons have two holes at 90 degree angles through each post. It results in a very simple, yet very effective string locking system. And the Wilkinsons are very well made. I took one apart before deciding to use them on my guitar, and was surprised and impressed at the quality of the components."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy These","review":"I installed these tuning machines on a Fender Strat and quickly blew through $15 worth of \\"B\\" and high \\"E\\" strings which slipped and popped out as I tried to bring them to pitch. There was nothing unusual about the strings I used -- in fact they were made by D'Addario, the maker of these tuning machines. Thinking the machines might be defective, I ordered a second set, but had the same problem. I've since gone online (too little, too late) and found that others have reported the exact same problem (see the Musician's Friend website). On top of everything else, you have to drill pilot holes in the peg head to install them, which is not only a pain, but also I now have a bunch of holes in my peghead. These tuning machines are a disaster and should be recalled."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Male Status Symbol","review":"\\"Catch and Release\\" is supposedly a book about trout fishing. That it is; however, much more is contained in this book by Mark Kingwell. I bought the book for a friend, thinking he would like all the fishing information. But as I leafed through the book, I found much more information on various subjects....cooking osso bucco, the measure of a martini glass, golf, writing and wrtier's block, philosophy, and Canadian masculinity. Canadian masculinity by the way, seems to be a cut above that of the US fisherman.It was rather neatly summarized with Kingwell's comment re: Cary Grant.\\"If Cary Grant isn't man enough for you, there's something wrong with your picture of manhood.\\" This was in reply to some men or women who think of Grant as effeminate.

He attempts to display his own renaissance-man activities and proclivities and demonstrates, instead, the type of guy you pray to god is not on the river when you are, and how this type of guy spends his \\"free-time.\\" I wouldn't be surprised if he owned a beret or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely meditative experience","review":"I had Mountain Light on tape but listened to it so often the tape wore out.

You take a Potter, or a Carter, or a Redman and they'd be in the frey ripping it up.

This means that her instruments are rather more modern than the original Moogs and Buchlas that I'd been expecting to hear. It feels to me like some essential history of electronic music went unrecorded.And then, considering that the instruments were so much more modern than the old Moogs and Buchlas, this album sounds paradoxically extremely dated.

These vintage recordings, over half a century old, retain their freshness and power, so much so that I've never bothered to search out competing renditions.

In the 2nd and 3rd chapters, the writer talks about using power tools that are either outrageously expensive or not even avilable any more. Further, there is no discussion or summary of basic roof geometry and calculations. The tag phrase \\"for pros by pros\\" is quite misleading. It is merely 15 chapters of guys telling how THEY frame a roof. Anyone, even pro carpenters using this as a refresher, should start off with a tutorial on basic roof geometry, design, and construction methods.

I have used no-name saws costing a third the price and obtained better results."},{"rating":"2","title":"handy and dandy","review":"As a contractor who does a lot of his own trim work and custom woodworking, this saw has proved to be one of my favorites. The ease of setup and portability make it a joy to work with. I've used other chop type saws and find the blade guard on my delta to be the easyest and least bothersome one ever. If there is any downside to this saw, it might be the dust bag, it doesn't collect as well as I like but, I do a lot of remodel work and try to keep a clean job site(we work around the home owners). Good saw-good price. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with the Delta Sidekick","review":"Overall, I've been disappointed with the Delta Sidekick miter saw with the integral stand. Almost from day one, I have found pieces of the stand which have fallen off. The screw that the blade guard pivots on was not seated far enough and starting to wobble after a few weeks of use. This was an easy fix, though because I just replaced it with a longer screw. The next thing that happened was that the screw that holds the blade guard on (back and top of the saw) broke off rendering the guard unusable. I had to remove the blade guard which makes using this saw a little unnerving. I thought at the time of purchase I was saving myself a few bucks but you know the old adage - you get what you pay for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This saw is garbage","review":"There is nearly nothing about tis saw that i like. It has been constructed very cheaply with plastic parts falling off to major head flex. You will never get an accurate miter cut with this saw due to the excessive movement in the head. The positive stops barely work at all. Go with a Bosch or Makita."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Saw with accessories for Good price","review":"This is a really good saw with a host of accessories that usually are not included with others. The stand is nice and sturdy although the work supports could be a little beefier. The only real gripe I have with this saw is the table adjustment. The table does not lock at the common mitre's very well. It takes a little time to get it precise because of the lack of stops.

Given that data and statistics are often misused, I was pleasantly surprised by the sophistication and disclosure of his analytical approach. Stanley's classification of high-income earners into Balance Sheet Affluent (BA) and Income Statement Affluent (IA) is particularly compelling as it lays bare the follies that likely bankrupt many in the recent economic downturn. Even so, this book is based on the central tendencies of domestically collected data and, thus, I am unsure of its relevance in an increasing global economy where many more transnational factors are at play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Stanley really knows this topic in and out","review":"If you ever wondered what separates the wealthy from everyone else, then you will love this book.

The book shouldn't even have one star---don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big Disappiontment","review":"I read Stanley's first book, The Millionaire Next Door, and while it wasn't great, I finished it. I thought that this second try was going to be more what I was hoping the first one would be. I wanted to read a book about what makes a millionaire. What were they like in school, how did they start out their career, what was their life like. I really wanted to hear first hand stories and examples. Instead, this book was simply pages upon pages of statistics restated to the reader who is seemingly incapable of reading a table of results themselves. This book could simply be a 50 pages packet of all the hard data results and be just as effective. Stanley used too much of his own commentary and not enough from the millionaires that he studied."},{"rating":"1","title":"statistical, boring and dry","review":"I bought this book only because his first one \\"the millionaire next door' was so good. Big disappoinment. He re-hashes the same material over and over again, then uses charts and graphs to reiterate what has already been said. I forced myself to finish it, and it did get a little better toward the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Is A Case Study Of Millionares","review":"Simply put the author studies millionares and tells you what they have in common. If you're hoping for a hidden secret to wealth, you'll be disappointed. Most of the book will tell you how millionares purchase wisely and live within their means. Other books have said similar things. You can learn a lot from this book, but not if you're looking for the secrets of stock picking and real estate investing. This is a less glamorous path to wealth. It's still very valid and valuable. But not every reader will appreciate it.

Why acumulate wealth and live cheap? Not much sense to me. Becoming wealthy for me is becoming wealthy in all aspects of life, not just economically. One of the teachings of this book was that millionaires ride american made cars, and most of them not luxurious ones. For me, that is a clear example of being cheap.There is nothing like a well made european car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, there's more to life than money...","review":"This shallow work assumes that the only measure of success in life is how many bucks you're worth. Forget being kind and compassionate and a good Mom or Dad--you folks are life's losers!Let's tell the truth: Lots of millionaires are just plain jerks (Does Donald Trump come to mind? ). Honesty and integrity got them where they are? Yeah, right. (Anyone ever hear how Ross Perot got rich? ) I'm sure these \\"success determinants\\" were self-reported. Who checked up on these people's real degree of honesty, dedication, etc.? I think these millionaires have swallowed their own P.R. and have bought into the Horatio Alger myth. I don't buy it, or this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring continuation to a fascinating start","review":"The \\"Millionaire Next Door\\" was a fascinating read that was almost impossible to put down. Research which acknowledged that the Sears charge card was one of the most popular credit cards in a millionaires wallet and many people with net worth over a million never made more than 70k a year was truly eye-opening information. However, \\"The Millionaire Mind\\" is full of boring platitudes. The book goes on and on about millionaire attributes of honesty and hard work. Furthermore it seems that the author only based his study on millionaires in the American South. The new economy millionaires of Silicon Valley and Seattle are curiously missing from Stanley's work. Furthermore, Stanley endlessly talked about how people achieved wealth,only in this book the average millionaire makes far more than the more modest yearly salaries of millionaires discussed in the \\"The Millionaire Next Door.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" to be truly enlightening and inspiring -- I've read it three times and recommended it to several people. \\"The Millionaire Mind\\" was not nearly as well written. Dr. Stanley has an overinflated opinion regarding how interested his readers are in him personally. I'd venture to guess that if he is, in fact, now a millionaire, it's not because he practiced the frugality of typical millionaires, but because he wrote a best-selling book and made a bundle all at once. His self-congratulating segues into discussing how he chose his wife, etc., rang false to me. This book was a boring sequel to the original, and not nearly as insightful. Skip it and reread the first one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sequel to The millionaire next door","review":"If you read and enjoyed the Millionaire next door this book is a great follow up for more of how the real millionaires think. It is basically the same as the before mentioned book however in this book the author makes a successful attempt to get inside a millionaires head by studying their behavior.Examples:They don't waste money on new furniture they reupolster when possible.They think differently from the crowd.They surround themselves with competatant people.They find employment that allows them to use all of their abilities and talents.They accurately judge people.When marrying they choose partners that they are attracted to and are intelligent,honest, unselfish, and well adjusted.And, much more.This book is a wealth of information on how REAL millionaires think. It is a little long but the book will pay for itself in insights. These principles have brought me from poverty to a $175,000 net worth and I am truly just getting started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try something else","review":"If you feel driven to become a millionaire, perhaps because someone once cast doubt on your potential, treat yourself to some therapeutic insights by reading \\"Wealth Addiction\\", by Philip Slater, rather than this kind of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely keeps my wobbly table stable","review":"A cracking good read - proving that almost anyone with the will to abandon their parents and family can succeed financially in life. I really enjoyed it.I wish there were more like this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope for the masses ?","review":"I got the perception that the work was very much playing on the hopes of the masses rather than providing true insight. It was almost saying ... 'its ok if your SATs scores are low because you too can be a millionaire...'. The constant reference to statistics also got a bit tedious. All in all, I was not impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT STUFF!","review":"I found this to be a fascinating book on a subject that interests a majority of the people in today's society.The author does a great job in explaining the mindset of a millionaire and how they got there.As expected,it takes hard work and discipline to get ahead,not luck,which may disappoint some liberals out there.Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"some useful info in an obnoxious package","review":"While there is interesting and possibly usable information in the book, Dr. Stanley comes across as a smug, tedious and obnoxious individual, I was very tired of spending time with him by the time I finished. There are a number of no-brainer insights presented as if they were the wisdom of the ages - decamillionaires are unlikely to play the lottery...hmmm. The spouse selection chapter reminds me of Gordon Liddy. It seemed there were twenty five mentions of the importance of clipping coupons before shopping for groceries - sorry, I just don't believe this is the key issue. And while Stanley has a point about interpersonal skills being as important as academic excellence, I am a little queasy about feeling sorry for the high school class president and football star afraid he won't measure up against the \\"class brains\\". I think you can get the maximum out of this book by skimming it in twenty minutes at a bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I LOVED The Millionaire Next Door and I was looking forward to this book. What a waste of time and money. The author jumps to conclusions and then spends a lot of time belaboring the point. There is a fair amount of patting his own back. He zeroes in on small sub-groups of the millionaire club and praises them heavily (the low SAT-scorers and the religiously inclined.) This book was full of opinion and light on data. Without a careful listen, I would walk away believing I needed to join a cult and do poorly in school in order to build wealth.If you did poorly in school and are religious, you will LOVE this book because it'll make you feel like a rock star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Analysis","review":"I really liked \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\", but this book is a pale imitation.Here is the central logical flaw: the author offers a number of characteristics of the wealthy. In short, they are: people of integrity, hard working, tenascious, married, not necessarily straight A students, and good at getting along with people, frequently religious, and health conscious.And all of these characteristics may be frequently found among the wealth. I don't really doubt that.However, all of these characteristics can also be found among millions of people who are NOT wealthy.It is almost like saying: the wealthy typically own some socks. Ok. I am sure that is true. And yet it really doesn't help anyone understand the wealthy in a meaningful way since everyone, poor, wealthy or in between probably has some socks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book will bore you if you read the first one","review":"A whole lot of nothing is in this book. I was very dissapointed because I thought there would be something new. But if you already read the first book, then I suggest to you to stay away from this one. There were a few interesting stories like the guy who sold salvaged truck parts and became a millionaire, but other than that, it is a total loss. It is basically a paper weight in my house now. Very dry reading as well. Like many other reviewers have said. Dryer than the first book, and that is hard to top.Also, someone is inflating (and deflating) the helpfullness votes for most of the reviews here. Take a look: If the review is a positive, then it would get over 50-100 helpful votes. And if it was a negative review, it would receive the opposite, 50-100 unhelpful votes. Can you guess which votes I'm going to get? If it's the author himself doing this, then you are a sad sad man."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few useful nuggets of information","review":"Thomas J. Stanley hits on a few good points in this book. For instance taking more chances is associated with the millionaire mindset as are the patterns of intelligent spending as opposed to wasteful indulgence. But I felt that he was talking down to the reader and in order to get to the interesting and useful information you had to get past his ego, which wasn't always easy to do. Lastly it seemed to me that some of the examples he presented aren't exactly valid for the claims he makes. For instance he mentions how a former football player and successful businessman went bankrupt and he used the man's divorce as the reason after he quoted the article which stated the millionaire had failed to pay his taxes. Maybe he knows something more than he presented but it sounds to me that it was more likely his lack of paying taxes got him in trouble than the divorce settlement."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Millionaire Mind","review":"This book is very easy to read, and covers allot of very good information. I have read his other book also, but this book gives more details of what millionaires actually do and how they sustain their fortunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled, \\"The Marketer-to-Millionaire's Mind\\"","review":"The author surveyed a very biased sample of millionaires -- those living in the 1% of U.S. neighborhoods with high concentrations of affluent -- and then received back less than 20% of the surveys he sent out. He then makes a big deal that so many live in similar types of houses (you could guess this just by the survey distribution method) and are 45-year-old white males (ditto). He then liberally praises these people, and himself, for being so virtuous as to accumulate wealth. I really liked the first book (\\"Next door\\"), and was very disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Millionaire Rip Off","review":"This book made me so angry I don't know where to begin. I wish I had more than a 1000 words, because I could go on for 10 pages about the problems of this book. Even if you can get through the artless, tedious writing style, this book doesn't deliver anything new. I read The Millionaire Next Door, and I feel like I just read the same book again, only twice as long. What a waste of time.Don't be fooled: This book is nothing more than a transparent attempt to cash in on an earlier success. The author should be ashamed of himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attemps to Prove Incorrect Thesis","review":"The thesis of this and the author's prior books is that \\"millionaires\\" live relatively frugal life styles. No research backs this hypothesis in this edition. And it strains credibility. Yes the average millionaire may love relatively frugally. Howver the average millionaire does not generate enough income from a million dollars to live otherwise. If you subtract those with net worth of a couple of million dollars, the very wealthy do indeed live life like the Gatsbys.Those palaces in Palm Beach, the Hamptons, Beverly Hills. The second homes in Vail, the rolls royces and ferraris are not owner by those with \\"big hat, no cattle.\\"And the author seems less interested in truth than seeking out the relatively rare multimillionaire who lives in a $250,000 home.The book is a quick interesting read tho for its anecdotes only.

The underlying thesis attempts to place all life decisons into a life-balance sheetequation.

This book repeats itself over and over and over, and the examples often contradicted the advice given. For example, the book said that millionaires often rely on themselves for financial advice and don't follow the herd mentality. Then it provided examples of how selecting financial advisers was extremely important. I'll give you some advice: walk into a bookstore, read the first chapter, and then put the book back on the shelf. The rest of the book is BS--an obvious attempt by Dr. Stanley to become a millionaire himself without providing anything substantive. He ragged on economists for not contributing actual work--he should take his own advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The Millionaire Next Door was great.

Unlike most personal finance books, the ideas are not based on one person, the author. It is surprising to see some of the misconceptions we usually associate with millionaires such as fancy cars and houses when the majority of the millionaires do not want fancy cars because they depreciate rapidly in value and live in respectable residents that they got for a deep discount. It is also inspirational because most of the millionaires were not A-students. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto","review":"Dr.Stanley used this sequel to line his millionaire pockets with our aspiring dollars.

Right from the introduction I was dissappointed. I was looking for some insight on the thinking process of the wealthy, but only found the obvious- people who earn in the top 1% are wealthy. They say the first million is the hardest to make, but when your earning [...] per year, it's probably not that hard. It made me realize that I have the same or more discipline than they do, and the same values, just no college education or an income approaching 7 figures. In my opinion, save the [...] , put it toward your first million."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's nothing new in this book","review":"A really bad book. Here's why1. The first two chapters pretty much cover everything in the book. The rest of the book is full of examples.2. Not a very scientific study. For an author with a PhD, this is sad.3. There's nothing new this book has to offer, that isn't already in his previous book.4. Some of the examples come across as outrageous. And these are anecdotes - no way of verifying if they are true.5. The author comes to conclusions too soon, too fast. Lacks in-depth research.I bought this book for a penny, and thought it was a great deal. There's a reason why people are selling it for next to nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but there are better.","review":"The co-author's prior work, \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" is better. This work is also very good in that it gives more data on the average millionaire, showing that millionairedom is not out of anyone's reach. However, though the data he presents states that over 90% of millionaires are college grads, his book is disproporionately rich in anecdotes of high school drop-outs that became millioinaires. Also, he deals largely in absolute numbers. Though he states that the majority of millionaires are business owners and entrepreneurs, not physicians, CPA's or attorneys, he fails to address the PERCENTAGE of business owners that are millionaires, vs. the PERCENTAGE of attorneys, physicians, etc. that are millionaires. This additional data would be helpful for those still deciding on a career. Despite this, the principles in this book are sound and overall it is a worthwhile read. One doesn't need to be an academic \\"Superstar\\" to become a millionaire as he clearly shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bore .....

I would read the classic first (\\"The Millionaire Next Door\\") and check this book out at the local library.My impression after reading and finally finishing this book was that Stanley wanted to create another bestseller, but this one was a mere compilation of facts and was not as well received by the critics as his classic. I imagine if you're a statistician or actuarian you're going to love this, but if you want a fast, easy, and conclusive read this is not for you.In retrospect, I could have spent my time better than reading this book. What a disspointment .... especially after reading \\"The Millionaire Next Door.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-rounded book on the subject","review":"Although this book came before the more popular \\"The millionaire next door\\", I found this book to more balanced. The book talks about the urge of an individual spending money against a variety of factors like the actual need, the emotional (perceived) happiness in high consumption lifestyle.

The substance of his songs, as well as their music and performance, are amongst the best I know and Parker has never had the credit he deserves, especially for his Stiff work which clearly influenced Elvis Costello. These stories show the same essentially noir sensibility -- wry, involved, bitter-sweet -- which informs the songs. After reading it, my guess is you'll want to go and listen to one of Parker's great albums like Burning Questions. On the other hand you might like to buy an album first -- and then get the book. Either way, you're in for some quality stuff. It reminds me of the vast amount of talent that flowered in the days when Notting Hill was a real place and not just a Julia Roberts vehicle. All Parker's quirky, edgy seminal music is reflected in this outstanding first story collection.

Graham Parker has been delighting his loyal musical fans for decades now with his own brand of integral rock and roll, a style marked by thoughtful, poetic lyrics, deft melodies, and a passionate energy. But in \\"Carp Fishing on Valium\\" Parker shows himself to be a fine storyteller too, in a series of endearing and often piercing tales ranging from boyhood escapades in Surrey, in a Huck Finn vein, to deliciously worldly-wise rock-star-on-the-road stories, with some surprisingly poignant twists. Parker's characteristic energy and fine musical ear give his prose an engaging vigor and freshness; and in these stories he shows us not only the tough kid from the south of England, with his dark, sly humor and his combative ethic, but also the vulnerable sides of a complex man, the fears, and doubts, and the touching love for nature, in stories lit at unexpected moments by a furtive, almost involuntary tenderness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lever broke but they are fixing it","review":"Update -- Customer service did fix the toaster and it worked like a champ for a year or so.

It is possible for something to Suck and Blow at the same time because this album pulls it off.I am normally a mark for even a 1/2 decent comedian, I like comedians from Mitch Hedberg, Doug Stanhope, and Lewis Black to Dave Attell, Jim Norton, and The Blue Collar Guys. I've heard set after set of great comedy and this album may very well be the worst I've ever heard.Steve Hofstetter trys to come off as edgy and attempts to sound like David Cross. He has to resort to slamming an established comedian like Larry The Cable Guy instead of coming up with some material that is even remotely funny. I might donate this CD to the prison system as a new form of punishment, inmates will be begging for \\"the chair\\" after 10 minutes of this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, unfunny, name-dropper","review":"Forget the Cable Guy bashing, that's what we call low-hanging fruit at this point, not to mention it takes up less than a minute of the CD. It's the other names invoked in the liner notes and promotional materials for this decidedly unfunny CD that annoy me. Is he like David Cross? No, sir. George Carlin. Uh-uh. Bill Hicks? Not even close, Sonny. This is not \\"The Thinking Man's Comic,\\" as his website would have you believe. These are cheap shots at easy targets, and there's absolutely nothing new or funny here. One more thing: If you have a chance, listen very carefully to the \\"laugh track\\" on this CD, and I call it that because that's exactly what it sounds like. Notice how the audience laughs start and stop on dime, which makes the CD sound suspiciously like he recorded it in a studio and added the \\"sweetening\\" later. Whaddya say, Steve-o?

Steve Hoffstetter doesn't appeal to such a broad lowest-common-denominator audience, but he largely succeeds in his vein of sometimes dry and usually wry sociopolitical humor. He can be raunchy and politically incorrect, but it's always with satire in mind, recalling greats such as Bill Hicks and David Cross. It's safe to say that Hicks and Cross needn't make room on their hall of fame platform yet - Hofstetter occasionally descends into mediocre rants and rambles between the album's high points, and lacks the glowing originality of his influences - but the album is worth a listen, and not just out of spite for Larry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hack Attack","review":"How much money did this guy's mom pay to have this thing made?

TRANSFORMER may have been a landmark, but it was too polished and mainstream, so it was only natural that the very versatile Reed go in the other direction.

It still sounds great after all these years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art on a Fractured Canvas","review":"With an all-star cast of musicians - including the Brecker Brothers, Jack Bruce, Tony Levin and Aynsley Dunbar - Lou Reed's third solo album was an ambitious rock-opera from the depths of the soul and with a heart beating rapidly from drugs, depression and depravity.Dark and brooding, Reed follows the fast times and brutal life of a doomed couple; this is the siren call to the abyss and heard from the shadows of burned-out buildings and ripped up sidewalks in an area that police will only tread with proper back-up.A planed stage adaptation was abandoned due to mostly negative reviews by critics an fan indifference. But the album has quietly emerged as a classic from a period when Reed created art on a fractured canvas that depicted those who thought they could manipulate the shadows of street life, but found out much too late that they were dancing into the abyss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Depressing!","review":"Berlin is one of the saddest, most deppressive albums ever made. If there is a more depressive album, it was probably one of Lou's other albums. Isn't he ever happy? Anyways, the songs and the overall effect and presentation of the album is great. I know Caroline Says is a different version of The VU's Stephanie Says, but who cares? Lou wrote the song in the first place and this version is just as good.

The other listeners have to be blind (and deaf) followers of Lou Reed or get stoned when they listen to this album. Fingers on a chalkboard.

The crushing lines in caroline says 2 \\"Caroline says as she gets up from the floor,You can hit me all you want to, but I dont love you anymore\\" illustrates the characters of this play perfectly,detached and hopeless. Many don't like believing these people exist. But reed has never been afraid to confront his listeners with such true depictions of the human condition. This album is also more approprietly produced than the critically acclaimed \\"transformer\\". \\"BERLIN\\" Belong behind only \\"blood on the tracks\\" as the best album of the 70's."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not for the weak of heart or mind","review":"This cd is \\"wonderfully depressing\\".

Verant Interactive rushed to get this product out of the door and in the processes caused a lot of stability issues with the Luclin client.

Why? Because it is unplayable. I own a mid range system, well over 1/2 GIG of ram, voodoo5 with 64megs. I found that swiming through molassas would be faster than trying to play in the new zones. Ive never seen such terriable frame rate/lag in 20 years of gameing on a puter. And for the record, Ive been a loyal EQ fan for 3+ years, paying in beta, and throught ever expansion release. Ive never seen such horrible performace. Sony/Verant has really done a backslide on their ability to present a playable module. Some might say it runs great on a P<whatever> with a 1 gig+ processor, well to you i say, if you need a 1 gig proc, to run an app that is not server or DB related, somethings wrong...

I have a great computer, and have heard of most I know being able to run the expansion on VARIOUS systems, even if they barely meet the specs.Yes, this was a HUGE upgrade, therefore, many bugs to work out. There are patches nearly everyday to fix the problems that may still be occuring for some. Many users don't understand the programming of this game is so extensive, OF COURSE there are several bugs, and yes, many system requirements to be met.The graphics are wonderful. Lag is no different, but then I never had a problem with that to begin with. It is very exciting to know I have many new places to explore.Overall Everquest is an incredible game, that has thousands upon thousands addicted, even after having issues to work through."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok..

I've also experimented with blades and saw stands. This saw is simply not well designed. If you can't reproduce the same angle of cut consistently, then the saw has no right on a job site. Specifically, the locking system for the miter stop is difficult to control precisely. You must check the gage on both sides to ensure it's even in the range-forget fine control. More importantly, the sliding system that supports the saw head flexes and allows the blade to deflect. Even with thicker, stiffer blades, I get multiple cut lines on the material. Lastly, the safety guard is dangerously sloppy. It gets stuck on the work material or interrupts saw use in general. With the prices of other well-designed saws dropping (e.g. Hitachi, Makita) why even consider this saw. If you inherit one you can use it as a chop saw or for decking! Delta makes many fine tools, but this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"not an accurate saw.","review":"i bought one of these saws and used it on a few projects, and noticed the cuts weren't square.with the way it drops into each setting , it is hard to get a accurate setting. if you use this for rough framing , it would be a great saw.it is also fairly heavy , so if it has to be moved alot , you might want to consider another saw.i just bought a hitachi c8fb2 , and am very happy with this saw!it can be more easily adjusted than the delta."},{"rating":"1","title":"one star, because 0 was not available","review":"Inaccurate table stops, stand keeps falling apart,motor did not last long, I found this site searching for parts, which are near impossible to find and 3 times more expensive than other brands, I have saws from two other brands with little or no problems, this one is a major dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloviating","review":"What a piece of badly written bilge. Rohr certainly enjoys pontificating about life and its many mysteries. He is fond of taking familiar quotes completely out of context or misinterpreting them fully in order to support his postulations. I for one put little stock into any proclamations about maleness and relationships, particularly those as they relate to women, when the the author has had no serious physical or emotional relationships with women other than family members. This book is for men who are afraid of what Rohr calls the deeply feminized culture. You know what guys? We are born, we live, we die. Make your piece with it. Enjoy the ride while it lasts. Rohr tries to make these basic truth into something much deeper and profound without offering scholarship and through a very narrow prism of experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"The slingshot","review":"poor picture quality,several picture dropouts,looks like a bad copy of a VHS original,I was very disappointed when viewing this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"short working range, picky on mouse-pad or surface color, be aware!","review":"I definitely agree with the assessements of other two buyers.

I bought this to take pictures of my very active and adorable granddaughter. I took one whole roll the first day I had this camera and I could not have gotten better results. The zoom is fabulous!

What matters is that \\"Marvelous Things\\" is a beautiful little EP that will probably be better recognized and appreciated after the \\"Room Noises\\" LP comes out.The standout track is undoubtedly the title song \\"Marvelous Things.\\" Just as most of the more successful Eisley songs, the beginning of the song is eerily simple and builds until it explodes into a beautiful harmonic chorus.There are few bands that sound this good. Eisley is a band, like Steely Dan or Queen, that sounds like they are meant to play with each other.Any of the 4 songs are recommended. \\"Marvelous Things\\" is an EP filled with promise that is more than worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystical","review":"Eisley is one of those bands that you must check out.

Although there isn't one thing i do not like about this cd. it flows quite lovely just like the voices of Stacy & Sherri Dupree"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I became totally enamored with Eisley the moment I first heard them. Their music is soooooooo great. I'm just happy that there's still some really good music out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit disappointing but still a good EP","review":"The order of the tracks on this EP is really the order of the best songs to the not-so-good songs.\\"Marvelous things\\" is a wonderful, I immediately fell in love when I first heard it. It is definetly the best song on this EP but when I listened to the next track, \\"Memories\\" it struck me as one of those not-so-good/not-up-to-the-par-of-Eisley songs. I admit it grew on me after a while, the lyrics are great (a little muddled at times though) and the vocals at the ending are superb, a song that really gets stuck in your head. \\"Sea King\\" is a song that isn't all that distinct and could easily be confused with the tune of \\"Memories.\\" It is a nice dreamy song but not a great song. \\"The Winter Song\\" has yet to grow on me, it's nice to listen to as background music maybe to study or read but one I rarely hit the repeat button on.It's a good EP to have for all the Eisley die-hard fans but ones that enjoy only their best songs I'd wait until their full CD comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"where to begin!","review":"I originally bought this cd for the track Marvelous Things, but if someone asked me to pick a favorite, I couldn't do it! First of all, Sherri and Stacys vocals work so well together and they sound incredible. Also, each track on the cd just seems to warm you up and cheer you up if you are down, which I think is a must for any great cd. If you want to hear a band that has real talent and is original or want a CD that puts you in a good mood, I totally recommend this disc to you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"Eisley is the best.

I liked the serious consequences for behavior in this seasons arcs. It is time. My favorite performance for the season was Rhys Coiro as a newly sober Billy Walsh. How lovely to see a turn around of a character like that; the actor really sells it.I also enjoyed Sasha Grey's performance and Kevin Connolly always amazes. Scott Caan also does some terrific work. I admire actors who are fearless about their height.I was a lot less interested in the (to my mind) stupid stories about the NFL & tequila, Mark Cuban, a lot of sports figures I do not know and a badly played Mexican patriarch. They just fell flat for me.However, I was fascinated by the animated Drama show and love it when Kevin Dillon's character gets the slightest bump. Overall, I am pleased with the season and can't wait to get season 8 on DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to admit it...","review":"\\"Entourage\\" is one of my favorite shows, and I own every season. This season however has been the weakest yet, as the storylines disrespect the characters we love, and they are almost all depressing. Vince is going the way of Lindsay Lohan. Turtle is a struggling business owner. Drama and Eric are going through the exact same things they did last season. There is a major lack of fun - the balance is just off.

It wasn't even that the show was showing the \\"darker side\\" of Hollywood - it was that it was pulled off in the most unbelievable way. Like you were waiting for the characters to crack up in the middle of a scene or something because it was all just so dumb. If you're going to have a show where everything (sex, drugs) is over the top, it had better be a great story to justify it all. And this season just wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa..","review":"Well, I went into this season very excited and curious to what was going to happen.. And then all the sudden it was the season final... What?! There is only 10 not even 30 minute episodes, and honestly I don't even remember what happened in some of the episodes. Let alone this season.. Sorry guys, I love this show but this season was a bit weak. I am excited and hoping for something better next season!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ari Gold show","review":"Loved this show for the first few seasons, but I think they ran out of situations for Vince to get laid a couple of seasons back. This season was very disappointing, I agree with a lot of the other posters that the writers seemed to backtrack on the motivations that seemed to make these characters tick for six seasons to try to squeeze a little more life out of this show. Jeremy Piven as Ari Gold is the saving grace of this season, and to me, has always been this shows's strongest part. I think HBO should think about a reboot focusing just on Ari and his life and other clients. I think there's a lot more material there if you want to keep the premise going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost unlistenable","review":"I saw them at the Fillmore E. twice. I loved their albums.

They're not nearly as clever as they think they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This album is disappointing for a band of this caliber. The production values are sub-par and vary per track as to whether or not you can actually hear Jorma's lead guitar. The band also sounds a little loose and unfocused on some of the tracks as well. Go to \\"Bless It's Little Pointed Head\\" or the live stuff on the box set \\"Jefferson Airplane Loves You\\" if you want to hear what this band could really do live.

The first talent books, Pegasus in Flight and Pegasus in Space were interesting and fun because we were reading about real characters.They had Talent, but they were still real people.The characters in the latter talent books are nothing less than gods, with an almost all-powerful Talent, and seemingly little or no personal problems or limitations (which makes th books dull). Also, what the books really portray, without actually saying it is basically a Talent autocracy. Non talented are inferior and unimportant, and the talented rule over everyone else with their powers. This reminds me of Star Trek, where everyone is law abiding, and the authority of the Federation is unquestioned.So what happens to those who question the authority of the Federation? They are automatically outlaws.

Punk rock is forever, and this album is a great choice for those lover's of scratchy voices. This peticular CD contains the all-time U.S. hit \\"Inside Out.\\" Overall this group is not unlike \\"Green Day\\" although is different in ways such as that it has cleaner lyrics than \\"Green Day's\\" It's appropriate and an all-time favorite of mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I bought this album expecting much and was highly disappointed.

This album lacks diversity (it has even less than the aforementioned band's earlier works), it is overrated and annoying. There may be nothing I can do to keep clueless teenyboppers from slapping 5 stars on this garbage, but at the very least I can warn rock's more intelligent fans away.What verbal skills? \\"the lack thereof would leave me empty inside?\\" \\"I feel ambitious today, and so does my foot, as I press it to the floor?\\" Forgive me for laughing. This record is an embarassment to modern music. There are few things more annoying than derivative, undeserving teenage rock stars. The catchy melodies are there behind the horrendous lyrics...problem is, we've heard them all before. Eve 6 oughta hit the books--they've got the instrumental skills to make some real music...if they can find their own sound and produce poetry that's more than laughable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't swallow this.","review":"Thisn't punk, it is a corperations attept to produce \\"punk\\".

The singer's voice (I couldn't be botherd to get his name) is horrible, while their music is lacking in one main ingredient: talent. Like Deep Blue Something before them, they'll essentially remain one-hit wonders, and terrible ones at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! One of the best albums I've heard in a long time!","review":"In their debut album, Eve 6 shows everything from great guitar riffs to slower, softer songs that make you stop to think of their meaning.

I first heard \\"Inside Out\\" and enjoyed the song so much that I had to find out about the rest of the album. Color me more than pleasantly surprised when I discovered that the rest of the tracks were *as good or better* than \\"Inside Out\\". The lyrics are absolutely the best part of the whole package. Tight rifts, impeccable timing, and really interesting musicality make this a personal favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Buy","review":"I never really planned on buying this album, I was just at the store about a year ago, trying to decide what to buy, and I just decided to pick this one up, and well, I'm very glad I did. Great album, all the way through. Max is quite a songwriter (even if he thinks congruent rhymes with student). My picks would have to be the killer radio hit, \\"Leech\\", \\"Open Road Song\\" (haven't gotten to crank it in my car yet), and \\"Jesus Nitelite\\", their finest moment, I'd be surprised if they ever topped this one. Yes, a very great album, somewhat like Green Day, but a bit better. If you haven't bought this album yet, you must get it now. I also recommend \\"Horrorscope\\", which I just bought, but haven't gotten to listen to yet. Also, check em out live, they put on a great show.

When I am consistent, it works well. But if I miss a dose, or go out in sun without sun block, (usually when driving), the pigment comes back with a vengeance! So, I guess if one is consistent and uses sunblock religiously, or avoids total sun... it can work pretty fast! It is only 2%, but I did notice a change sooner than I imagined."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enthralling Fantastique for the ages","review":"This classic from 1960 is among Paul Paray's best recorded efforts, and that is at dizzying heights.The artist sticks to the score closely, yet utilizes the wide range of the conductor's art to mesmerizing effect. The waltz is demonic, the Sabbath manaical, the reveries and passions neurotic to the point that we have a portrait of Berlioz himself with all his obsessions. Paray is really the only conductor to give us all this and not have the work run away from him.Throughout, the Detroit Symphony revels in its virtuosity, with power to burn, tossing off wind passages in particular as if they were bon-mots.For my taste, this is one of the finest Berlioz recordings of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning Symphonie Fantastique","review":"Of all the performances of Berlioz's visionary symphony that I've heard (all of Davis's, Chung, Gardiner, and others) this one is my favorite. It boasts tempi markedly faster than most versions, and with the amazing agility of the Detroit Symphony, the result is pure exhilaration. As with most Mercury Living Presence discs, the recorded sound is up close and personal--there is a certain loss of ambience, but with a performance this hot one doesn't mind being in the front row! Paray's grip of this work is so compelling it doesn't let up for a moment--by the end one is both amazed and exhausted. The overtures and marches are also performed with tremendous gusto. A spectacular achievement."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a long forgotten trip it must have been...","review":"...and though they all look like they're having a fun, silly, nonsensical time, the experiment didn't work.

A lost documentary of the events in the mid-1960s sounds great in theory. But in reality is a bunch of old damaged home movies thrown together decades after the fact. I suspect that it will be a profitable mine in the future for clips to be used in other documentaries but as a work itself, its nothing special. Will be enjoyed for nostalgia value but not a interesting documentery in itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted Something Nice","review":"After using a cheap set of Koss Sparkplugs for sometime I wanted to treat myself to something nicer. The Metro.fi 2 would seem to be a nice step up from what I had and they were. Sure there was the breakin time and the time it took to get use to putting the product in my ears. I liked the sound that the Metro.fi 2 provided from my MP3 player.Here's what I didn't like about the product, the latter causing me to return them. When walking in cold weather, the thick wires are very stiff and get in the way of everything. Yeah, I know that they are thick for a reason, still not all of us live in a warm climate 365 days a year. After about a week of using them, the left channel became muffled. I first thought that maybe it was 'ear by-product' (wax), but after a good cleaning of both ear and product the issue remained. I even waited a day or so and tried it again, still no joy. So, I choose to return the product for a refund because Amazon had none in stock the trade out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound great, terrible fit!","review":"These sound great. But there are two major issues that were deal breakers for me. First, the cord is way too thick and stiff. The stiffness causes the ear buds to easily lift out of your ears during normal use. Second, although four different sizes of ear bud are included, none of them fit my average ears well. Also, the ear bud material is somewhat rigid and becomes uncomfortable after a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, poor durability","review":"I purchased these in August 2007, and was initially pleased with them. Reasonably good sound and comfort. However, one side completely dropped out after a few months. Ultimate Ears replaced the earbuds, and the replacement pair just failed today - they lasted about a year. Bottom line: good sound, good comfort, good customer service, lousy durability. I don't think I'll venture down this road again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay headphones","review":"I think these headphones are over-priced.

I would not purchase or recommend these headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Treble - Sounds Tinny","review":"I was disappointed in the sound of these earphones which seemed tinny as a result of too much treble.

Tried them out with an iPod Shuffle and MacBook Pro. THERE'S NO BASS!!!Tried my original iPod earphones as well as Sony MDR W08 for comparison and both blew away this junk. These sound tinny and should be selling for about $1 not $50.The five-star reviews are obviously by company shills.Going back to Amazon tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extended high end, but lacking in bass","review":"The high end is clear and extended. But the bass is really lacking. There is no floor in the music, the bass extension is absent. There is a marked dropoff around 200 clycles. The low end is absent. I was very disappointed. The sound is thin. The human voice is reproduced with over emphasized highs, and the s sounds end up being annoying. For the price, you can do better with the much cheaper Sony brand either in the ear of out of the ear. I tried these and was disappointed, especially at the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Ears Metro.fi 2 Earphones","review":"I just received my Metro.fi2 headphones through Amazon.com this morning and I'm very impressed with these headphones right out the box. I also own a pair of Ultimate Ears Super.fi5EB's and a pair of Sennheiser CX300's to which the Metro.fi's sound falls somewhere in between. The bass very deep and powerfull, tighter and more detailed than the CX300, but not that \\"make you wanna' smack your momma\\" kind of bass found in the super.fi5EB's. The midrange is somewhat distant, but can be boosted with ipod presets. The highs are very apparent and not as overpowerd by bass as the Super.fi5EB's nor as tinny as the CX300's. The chord is just the right legth for a tall person such as myself, and thicker than the chord supplied the CX300. I would recommend these headphones for listening to House, Hip Hop, Techno and Reggea."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are terrible, eventually","review":"This product seemed like a great buy at first. The quality of the sound was amazing and the different options for the ear piece sizes was great. However, I have had these for about three months now and one of the ear pieces suddenly cut out. These are over 60 bucks so you can be assured that I took quality care of them, putting them away neatly after every use, but the one ear phone just cut out. This is a TERRIBLE product and TERRIBLE quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"sounded good but stopped working; replacement did too!!","review":"I bought these earphones after reading lots of reviews and because of an excellent price on Amazon. I really liked the sound quality and the substantial wires didn't tangle. After two months the left ear plug stopped working - no sound. I contacted Ultimate Ears as they are still under warranty. They have a pretty simple process for returns which I am in the process of doing. We'll see how it goes. Hoping that some new ones will last considerably longer.ack theUpdate December 2007. My second pair just failed. The first pair failed in about 2 months and was replaced (without any trouble) by Ultimate Ears. I am about to send back the replacement set - again after less than 3 months of light use. Both times one of the earbuds just stopped producing any sound!!! I am 50+ years old and use these lighly and sporadically - they aren't used every day or abused.

Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better earphones out there...","review":"These don't really fit well in the ears, like others have said.

At first i liked them, the sound quality was always just okay. There is little to no low end on these things but im not a bass head so that was okay. Then they started to slip out of my ears more and more. Next, the left bud got really faint, so much so you could barely hear it unless you cranked the volume would make the right one blare into your ear. Not good. The cord is also very stiff and the buds(phones themselves) are quite heavy. I just purchased the Sony MDR EX-75 earbuds for half that price and the sound quality is amazing. Much better bass, and great stereo effect that makes you feel immersed in the music, not distant like another reviewer said of the metro 2s. Save yourself some money and just buy some Sony ex75's. You'll be much happier. The only thing nice about the metro 2's is the small leather velcro case."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT what I expected.","review":"With all the hype surrounding Ultimate's earbuds, I couldn't wait to get a pair of the Metros and try them out with my new iPod Touch. Once they came, I couldn't wait to return them. I should have heeded an earlier review noting the \\"tinny\\" quality of the Metros. They are indeed tinny, with no strong \\"fullness\\" to create a sense of being immersed in the music - instead you seem to be strangely detached from the music like you're listening to it through a tin can at the end of a string. Seriously... the stock earbuds that come with all iPods provide a far more satisfying musical experience. Save your money. Perhaps the more expensive Ultimates with more than one driver will perform better, but the Metros are thoroughly expendable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor fit...always drop out...","review":"They just drop out all the time from the ears.Totally unusable when standing (walking, etc..)Moreover I had two times such an ear irritation caused by these earplugs, that I had to go to doctor and take drugs (ok,ok, i didn't disinfected them, that was also probably the cause). When this happend me for a second time (even after desinfection), i said, ok, i will never use them.I have to say, that when I holded them in my ears, they have TERRIFIC SOUND (better than sure e2c). What a pity, that they don't fit me.Overally: I do not recommend to purchase it without trying out them first in a studio.p.s.: i had no similiar problems with shure e2c, probably because they had a soft fit).UPDATE: i just realized that one of the speakers is not working. just after less then one years?! i didn't even use these and always kept the cable properly! definitely do not recommed these one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short Entertaining!","review":"This book is basically about the demise of the human race across planets and one man's search to find out why.

And giving in to her desire for the man would result in a greater good. A Justice of the King's Bench, Sir Stevyn Strongbow had come to destroy a man whom Camilla knew to be a saint, a bishop who had saved her from perdition. If she could sway Stevyn from prosecuting the innocent priest, she would be doing God's will. But if the bishop was blameless, why had she been asked to resort to seduction and lies? Camilla knew she must learn for herself. And in her quest, the beauty feared that her greatest obstacle would be her greatest temptation: Sir Stevyn, a man of strong convictions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product of the times...","review":"Back in the late 1980's and early 1990's, there was a disturbing trend among some jazz artists to incorporate drum machines, sequencers and cheesy sounding sampled instruments instead of using organic instruments, possibly to lower costs. While these changes might have caused less problems personally and gave the music a 'hip' feeling, these recordings sound unbelievably dated a simple fifteen years later. On this album, Kim Pensyl attempts to cover a Babyface song with the aforementioned instrumentation, and the result fails miserably. Fortunately not every song on this CD is like this, and it is at these moments (like the wonderful 'Say You Will') that he adopts a more organic feel, thus giving this song a truly timeless quality. If you are a fan of less-than-organic jazz, feel free to purchase.

The late Jim Varney (Ernest)has close competition from the McTeer character. Or maybe you could call this an aquarium movie, because it is like watching fish swim stupidly around in circles. Kimberly Brown's Ava character carries the movie, especially in the scene in the motor home with Gavin O'Connor.

Those two albums are Willie's best solo projects. On \\"Solo\\" the instrumentals Chinacubana, Colonizaciones and Julia are superb (especially Chinacubana). The song \\"Juancito\\" tells a familiar story as does \\"Mentiras Tuyas\\". I love the entire album. I love the length of the songs and even if you do not speak Spanish (fortunately for me I do), you will appreciate the crisp clarity of the timbales, bongos, congas, tumbadoras and horn section throughout both albums. \\"Solo\\" is definitely a Latin/Jazz classic which belongs in everyone's collection.

We created a sandy area where our dogs could eliminate, so that they would not use the whole yard. We pick up the pooh and began by rinsing the area regularly with water. But after a few months the urine began to smell anyway. We tried lime, baking soda, and then something made for farms which was highly recommended by the feed store. The first two just didn't work, and the last was full of poisons.Eventually I discovered OderMute online. It was the answer to our problems. We mix it at the \\"skunk level\\" (from the instructions) in a large water bottle with a squirty \\"sport top\\". Whenever the boys \\"go\\" we irrigate it well with the odormute.

Later on the abused children look after their dying father, a WWII veteran with a PhD, and seek his love. These terrible childhoods always make good stories when told by their survivors. The worse the childhood the better the story because we know that the writer survived to become a person who could write a book. It's always a question as to how much is true (I've heard that Frank McCourt's mother was a New York secretary) but this one could stand on its own as fiction. We're given a lot of jacket biography, and even a cover designed by the author, that form an intrinsic part of the story.

It is to be hoped that this fine work will find success in academic circles, certainly, but even more importantly, that the current resurgence in interest in the language will find this a valuable tool. Anyone who loves language, as I do, will recognize the brilliance with which Dr. Quintero approached this task.

He then walks throughout the city trying to find this woman, and he thinks that her first name is Grace. He crosses paths with 4 different women while having flashbacks about Grace, and how their relationship unfolds from beginning to end with all the ups and downs from Buddwing's self-centered egotistical nature to Grace's depression, and losing their baby, and her mental deterioration into suicide attempts, alcoholism, and gambling before having to be committed into a asylum.

This is one of the handful of albums which gets played repeatedly. The music is sometimes melancholy, sometimes bitter-sweet, but always \\"accessible\\" yet spiritually fulfilling. I don't want you to think that it will make you depressed--it won't. But it's great for those times you want something to think by, remember by, mourn by. (I'm buying it for a friend who just lost a close relative). I'm thrilled to see there is a second volume available on CD.

My picky dog said no right away even though I was hoping the peanut butter flavor would help. The oldest dog just took hers to guard for a few hours than abandoned it to the puppy who just couldn't wait to have two now (puppy greed). 3 hours later they are still around and almost caused a fight since the older dog just wanted to check again to see if maybe I'll give it another go (only because the puppy now had it).If your dog likes these types of chews than I say go for it.

It turns out to be a humbling experience, thus the title, Me and My Little Brain. While some people may tell you that this book isn't as good without the presence of the Great Brain, I found this book just as entertaining as the rest. The storytelling is as superb as the rest. You don't want to miss this book because it introduces the character, Frankie, who allows this book to still be about brothers. Towards the end of this book, we find out that J.D. can still do some amazing stuff even though he has a little brain.

Airdream Believer is a recent release of material that spans his career, all recorded anew. Although some of the songs pale in comparison with the original versions (e.g., \\"Gold,\\" originally on Bombs Away Dreambabies, and \\"Reverend Mr. Black,\\" originally on the Kingston Trio's Album #17), others are delightful reworkings of familiar favorites (e.g., \\"Lost Her in the Sun\\" and \\"Daydream Believer\\"). If nothing else, this collection is worthwhile for a rockabilly rendition of \\"Get Rythym\\" (a duet with the late, great Johnny Cash) and an etherial \\"Shadows of the Angels' Wings.\\" All in all, not his best recording, but very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"These are re-working of the original songs and the difference is loud and clear This is particularly noticeable on John's top hit \\"Gold\\" with Stevie Nicks....."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great DVD to Add to Your Collection","review":"This is the best musical DVD title that I own.

Particularly well written is the description of the 1942 rush into the Caucasus. The Mius battles in 1943 and the heroic defense of 1944 are covered in perhaps the most detail of the book. The Warsaw and Budapest battles follow. The exploits of Fritz Vogt during the Budapest relief offensive provide excitement. The end, at Lake Balaton and then Austria follows. This is the most detailed account you will get of this unusual European formation which was at the climactic point of some of the War's most important battles.

This is not a traditional medical guide -- don't look here for the symptoms of meningitis -- rather, it is a guide to the key developmental and behavioral issues of this age group. The book does NOT endorse an authoritarian approach-- to the contrary, it encourages parents to learn to communicate effectively with their kids, to develop a trusting, supportive relationship. Neither does it reinforce traditional gender roles. It shows the wide range of what is normal, including helpful descriptions of various temperaments, and what kind of behavior parents should consider warning signs that more help is needed.

No offense, but maybe you need to listen to more salsa in general or more Lavoe in particular to truly grasp the greatness of this man's voice, passion, and improvisational talent.

All of the cuts are keepers and the compositions and performances are spectacular. They are a bit reminiscent of Pat Metheny at his best without (hold your breath Metheny fans!) the boring bits in between the genius. My favorite track is \\"For M.

This is without a dought the best CD I have ever bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but still Dave","review":"Took me two times straight through to really \\"get\\" this CD (very unlike Under the Table and Dreaming and Crash), but once I got the flow, I have been listening to it non-stop. If you like classic DMB, Rapunzel (song #2) and Stay (#5) are classic, fun, hard-driving, mega-jamming tunes. The rest of the CD is still upbeat, but seemingly more spiritual and dense than other Dave CDs. If you are a long-time fan of a band, you like when your artist's music develops and this is what this band has done with Before These Crowded Streets."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful departure.","review":"BFTCS is a delightful departure from ealier DMB's earlier work that that takes risks but does not dissappoint. \\"Rapunzel\\" and \\"Stay(Wasting Time)\\" are upbeat danceable grooves. \\"Halloween\\" is an insanely creepy piece of loveable cacauphony. \\"Don't Drink the Water\\" and \\"The Dreamin Tree\\" are haunting, melodic achievements. \\"Pig\\" and \\"Spoon\\" are sweetly easy going. The albums great achievement is the provocative, startlingly romantic, groove-drenched \\"Crush\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"DMB's finest","review":"I love this disc. It's their most solid, captivating, thought-provoking release. I feel it is as good as \\"Under the Table and Dreaming\\", maybe better. I can't seem to make my mind up. anyway, the tracks are solid. I like \\"Everyday\\" as well, but I've already kind of killed that disc (and \\"Crash\\" for that matter). But I never get tired of this one. Check out \\"Spoon\\" and \\"The Dreaming Tree\\". Great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"really really good","review":"This awsome CD is a DMB classic already. Rapunzel is the best song they've ever written and Stay has an unforgetable beat and melody. Dreaming Tree, though nearly nine minutes long, keeps the attention of the listener through out the CD. The only reason for the loss of one star is the one rather weak song. \\"The Last Stop\\" has a troubled tribal sound which I personally don't like. It is a great CD but doesn't have the uniquelytight sound of it's five star counter parts: \\"Remember Two Things,\\" \\"Under The Table And Dreaming,\\" and \\"Crash.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"let the music splash over you","review":"this would be five stars without any question is it didn't contain alanis, or 'halloween'. it is much darker than dave's other studio efforts, but at the time it is also much sexier. although i prefer the deep sound of CRASH, BTCS, is worth buying for all those who are unsure about dmb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenominal, lives up to DMB standards.","review":"I have long been a fan of Dave Matthews, and I think that Before These Crowded Streets is another great step in their long and winding road of music. I would recommend this CD to anyone, regardless of their musical preference. Dave and the guys have an incredible way of bridging the gap between all forms of music, making them one of the most incredible bands on the market today. I've heard a lot of talk about how this album wasn't like all of the others, and people are right, but that's what makes it a masterpiece. I love the album, and look forward to many, many more! Thanks to Dave, Boyd, Carter, and everyone else involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Their Best","review":"I am a big Dave Matthews Band fan and am very impressed by his past albums. This album, however, does not live up to their reputation. Every song has an undertone of angst about fame and the lyrics are less than creative. The actual music does have merit in that the band has decided to experiment but songs like Crush and Pig leave sonething to be desired in terms of both lyrics and music. Also, it seems this album was just made to fill there fans' demand (as the title suggests). Each song has a parallel on one of their previous albums, but not as well done as the the song each reflects. I would definately recommend buying \\"Under the Table and Dreaming\\" and \\"Crash\\" before this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"We expect more than this from DMB","review":"The \\"Spin\\" commentary had it right. This CD may well be exciting at a live performance, but the songs are all more than five minutes (besides the intro) and have no melody. Each song is like an endless introduction to a more meaty song... but the introduction keeps playing, playing, you think maybe the next track will have the good song... and then you listen to a few wailings of Alanis Morissette (they underused her) and it's over."},{"rating":"2","title":"DMB's most creative.","review":"Every single song on this CD speaks to me in a different way. It certainly has the most creative instrumentals and lyrics (wow, these lyrics are amazing) of any DMB album released thus far.The Stone, Pig, Spoon, The Dreaming Tree, and Stay are all exquisite songs. They don't get any better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent","review":"Many people do not know of this album, but the fact is that there are many great Dave songs that havn't really gone into the mainstream so many people have not heard these earlier songs by Dave and the gang. If your a Dave fan you will love this CD, if your not, some songs are a little different than more recent Dave, either way you look at it this album is great though, \\"The Last Stop\\" is one of my favorite Dave songs of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great yet Different","review":"I am a big Dave fan and have been for the last couple of years, and I believe this to be the greatest work from him and the boys to date. The songs are very different for the most part from the previous albums, however they are just as spectactular. The songs vary from the two stepping of \\"Pantala Naga Pampa\\" and \\"Rapunzel\\" to the slower love sonnet like \\"Crush.\\" This cd is a must have for any and all Dave Matthews Band fans young and old."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD Ever","review":"This is by far the greatest jazz/rock/folk album ever made. The songs are both smooth and energizing at the same time. If you don't buy this CD, then you are just simply, well... not nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE!!!","review":"I don't know how anyone can slam this CD. \\"Under the Table . . .\\" is still my favorite DMB CD, but I have found in \\"Before These Crowded Streets\\" a new favorite DMB song - \\"Crush\\" (used to be \\"Dancing Nancies.\\" The lyrics of \\"Crush\\" give me chills!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have! :-)","review":"Before These Crowded Streets is a very inventive piece of work. Their music is a potluck of emotions including love, hate, and extreme happiness. It's much different from Crash and Under the Table and Dreaming but I think the way they expressed themselves through their music is amazing! This cd has stayed in my cd player for 6 weeks and will probably stay in there for a very long time. If you are a Dave Matthews fan, I suggest you get it. Have a nice day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonder!","review":"This is CD is interesting! Some of the songs are less popular on this Cd and it is a wonder to me!?! Some of the most amazing lyrics, and beats are on this cd. I have to say my favorites are Pig, Spoon, The Stone, Crush. This Cd in my mind is one of the least well known, but simply the best. I had to listen to it a few times before I was singing along and enjoying it fully. Definately a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's so relaxing yet very upbeat and with creativity.","review":"Geez, you have to get this CD it's my very favorite, much better than the last two. He just gets so many different instruments and mixes them very successfully. It's very unique , in my opinon, and it just puts me in a state of happiness. I would never ever give this CD away or even let anyone borrow it. I have like 25 cds and of all those this is the only CD where I like the enitre CD and I listen to it everyday. = Ems"},{"rating":"2","title":"an invigorating recording that will mature very nicely","review":"A strong example of blending music of varied origin into harmonies that expose music fans to different and even foreign sounds. The album is quite consistent with the band's previous releases. To put it simply, BRAVO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Before these crowded streets i present...","review":"The Vomit machine! This album could make me sick. All the songs are 10-minute long ballads. This is not worth my timw nor yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"Dave Matthews sucks, and so does anyone who listens to him. The only reason you trend following moronic fans like this drivel is because it is shoved down your throat by mainstream radio and Canadian beer commercials. Get a clue people. Go pick up a \\"Yo La Tengo\\" or \\"Stereolab\\" CD and find out what REAL music is like."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!","review":"This is NOT the way to make an album! Listen up all you up-and-coming bands: If you EVER make the best album of your career, DO NOT follow it up with something like THIS! Capitalizing on the success of the great \\"Crash\\" album, Dave And His Anonymous Band Of Virtuoso Musicians substitute banjo playing and Alanis Morrisette for actual MELODIES! Ever heard \\"Don't Drink The Water\\"? Ever notice that you can't hum it in your head? You know why? BECAUSE IT HAS NO MELODY! \\"Rapunzel\\" is absolutely gross. \\"Pig\\" is just stupid. Oh and for the record \\"Halloween\\" may very well be the worst, most annoying song I've EVER heard! And I've heard's R.E.M.'s \\"Burning Hell\\"!\\"Crush\\" is great though. Dig that bass line!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A failed experiment","review":"With BEFORE THESE CROWDED STREETS, you can feel DMB trying to stretch. The main problem is that it stretches a too thin. The songs are all over the place musically; at no point can the listener make a connection to the CD as a whole. Middle Eastern rhythms, faux classical, a little country, are thrown together in an unappealing mess. Songs meander, than eventually peter out without any real payoff. There are no hooks to hang on to and no melodies worth remembering. Vocally, Matthews goes from falsetto to growling without any real purpose. It only makes the listener wonder, \\"Why is he doing this?\\" And that pretty much sums up the whole recording. I don't feel artists should go stagnant; growth is important. But in this case, it really doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but a fad for high school kids....","review":"Their music is the same...all the time. Uninteresting and dull all at the same time. When I was in high school this is all the kids listened to and I didn't understand why because there is much more great music out there. This is nothing but a fad for high school students..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure to Warn","review":"Seller failed to warn buyers that the last three tracks are unplayable due to skipping. Seller stated that CD was in good or great condition (I don't remember which). I will be avoiding the seller in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best whole CD ever!!!","review":"This is the only CD that I can listen to through and through and never get tired. My little brother calls most of the songs boring. I disagree. Dave Mathews is intensity, not only in the way he sings and uses the lyrics as another instrument, but the way so many instruments are playing their own thing in an intricate harmony of feeling. I recommend this to anyone. I live by this and the DUNE series of books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Unbelievable","review":"For anyone who likes to FEEL their music, not just listen to it, this is the album! Dave Matthews has to be one of the most incredible songwritters of our time. Definetely worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Band Yet","review":"Dave Matthews Band is the best band I have ever heard in my life. Dave's lyrics are very in- spiring. He is just amazing. He must have been through rough times along with good times. No artist has ever touched me so deeply. I was in love with this band as soon as \\"Crash\\" aired on the radio. All I can say is this band will be together a long time. There is so much to say about them. I would love to meet Dave and the band. The lyrics and music go right to my soul. Good Luck Guys!!!Becky"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Matthews Band Going Classical","review":"I really like Dave Matthews Band's music. The first thing I did when I got this CD is stick it in my computer to test my speakers. My CD player on my computer said that the CD Genre was Rock. When I listened to the whole CD it sound more like Classical Music than Rock. If I would want a Rock CD I would get Led Zepplin or Hendrix, not Dave Matthews Band. I am really not putting down Dave Matthews Band but I would like them to, if they want to stick with the Rock Genre, get a new tune."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best!","review":"My friends think I'm crazy cause I listen to this CD so much. But it's hardley left my CD player ever since I got it a couple months ago. The lyrics are cool, and make you think a little. Without a doubt, it's one of my top 5 CDs. This CD rocks! It has made me a true Dave Matthews fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Un disco fant��stico!!","review":"Este disco es incre��ble!! \\"Crush\\" es la canci��n mejor del disco.

Throw out \\"Crush\\", and the rest of the album is an awful mess. \\"Don't Drink the Water\\", \\"The Last Stop\\" and \\"Halloween\\" are a dramatic change from Dave's usual playfulness and hopeless romanticism. Dave sounds angry in these songs and I don't like it. Dave is at his best when he is having fun(\\"Ants Marching\\" and \\"Dancing Nancies\\")and he when he brings it down a notch (\\"Crash\\" and \\"Satellite\\"). No more grumpy Dave; bring back the nice guy we all learned to love."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's had better!","review":"There are a few good songs on this album, such as Crush, Stay, and The Dreaming Tree, but this in no way comes even close to the amazingness of their other albums.

He seriously sounds like Adam Sandler!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not feeling it","review":"I have listened to this CD over and over and I just dont feel it. I would not recommend this album for purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy, scary sound","review":"I am a big fan of the Dave Matthews Band, but this album really turns me off. Almost every song on the album has a creepy, nasty sound that leaves me feeling disturbed and irritated. The singing consists mostly of angry growling. I simply do not enjoy listening to this album, and this surprises me, since I still listen to Crash three or four times a week and enjoy every song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music from Dave","review":"Every year I go to the Dave Matthews concert at the Gorge, and this just adds to my Dave collection. Great music from a good man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Ingenius","review":"This album is a priceless work of art. After listening to it hundreds upon hundreds of times as I've gone through life, I've come to realize that this album as a whole is so much more than the specifics mentioned in so many of these reviews - don't get me wrong, these specifics captivate many stories within life's journey, but as a whole, this album is the journey of life in itself... from the state of unconsciousness to total consciousness. What a wild ride, highlighted by a musical sound and lyrics that compliment this journey near flawlessly.... the greatest album ever on so many levels..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This band crafts the music of the soul","review":"The best CD I've heard of Dave Mathews Band yet. Some tunes take a little time to grow on you. But it becomes quite clear that these tunes were crafted from the bowls of the artists' souls. They are the types of tunes that you end up relating to some part of your life, and that take you away from the daily rat race and spark your imagination, bringing to a beautiful place. Some of the tunes just allow you to feel a little crazy - and let's face it we all need to just 'let go' sometimes. DIG IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"And is this real, or am I Dreaming...?\\"","review":"CRUSH. What a perfect song; the best song ever written in the long history of music. This album is excellent (\\"stay\\"), but Crush just blows it all away. Dave Matthews' lyrics in this song, and the fiddle solo after the second refrain, are just plain amazing. Ask any real Dave Matthews fan, and they will recognize the words \\"Am I rightside up or upside down\\", and \\"Crazy, I'm thinkin' just knowin' that the world is round\\". Awesome musicians, incredible lyrics, and Dave's voice...if there's music in heaven, that's the first thing you'll hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this cd is great, just great!!!","review":"I think that this cd is different than Dave's other cd's but it still saves room for that spark, you know, that thing he does, that when you listen to his music, you just know it's him. Very upbeat cd, especially 'Crush'. and 'Stay'. I would definately recommend this cd to anyone, bc it is different, but still great, and it has something no other cd has!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAAAD","review":"This is a very bad cd. The songs have no rythm and are very boring. You could do soo much better than this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say overrated?","review":"Dave Matthews and his cohorts are the most overrated group of musicians on the planet. They have talent at playing their instruments, but they have absolutely no songwriting skills. Some of their songs are catchy, but most of them are boring, expecially \\"Don't Drink the Water.\\" Some people say that they're original, but using a violin and a Kenny-G-like sax doesn't make up for formulaic songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as earlier albums","review":"This one is way too hard -- too much evil-sounding, downer music. What happened to the honest, eager sound from before? DMB used to be lyrical.

I must say that I am not a big fan of this album. At first, I hated it. Then I started to like it.

I absoulutely love them and think they are great! I can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, Overproduced, Over rated, effort from DMB .","review":"I considered CRASH to be a fine album filled with diverse toe thumping tunes and bone chilling ballads. The problem with BEFORE THESE... is that they try to top themselves with overwrought melodies, multi instrumentation (and then some!) and Dave trying to give himself nodes and a hernia to boot by trying to out sing himself and the music. What the listener gets is jarbled overdone over the top mush. The soulfulness evident on the previous albums has been replaced by a \\"how loud and disassembled can we sound\\" recording. They are simply trying too hard. I realize much of the response has been good on this album, but I cant help but put my opinion out there on this one. This effort by the DMB should be classified as garbage. As for the CD, it makes a good coaster!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Just Isn't As Good As \\"Crash\\" or \\"UTTAD\\"","review":"Certainly the guys score some points for trying to do something different. However, if you're looking for \\"Crash\\" of \\"UTTAD\\", this ain't it.On the plus side you get a few gorgeous tunes such as \\"Rapunzel\\" and the singles \\"Crush\\" and \\"Stay\\".On the other hand, you get several tunes written in jarring chord progressions that abruptly bring the down the tone of the album. Unfortunately this occurs early with the painful \\"The Last Stop\\", followed by \\"Don't Drink the Water\\", one of their least memorable singles.Just when you think things are going to get back on track with \\"Stay\\" a few more clunkers follow. Do NOT let the other reviews trick you into thinking this is even CLOSE to his prior two CD's. Those reviews are likely written by fans who are trying to drum up sales - and they'll likely say this review was unhelpful just to prove my point.A better bet: Get \\"Live at Luther College\\". A far better CD which doesn't try so hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave needs to go back to the drawing board","review":"After two fine efforts Dave and his band of come up with a total lemon. The singles are weak and the rest is worse. I enjoyed Crash and Under... but the songs on this CD are full of mournful wailing and dejected lyrics. The musical interludes carry on for far too long and the \\"Angry Dave\\" section of \\"Don't Drink the Water\\" better reflects the CD as a whole than the flighty \\"Stay\\", the only reasonably enjoyable track. If you want to buy a DMB CD I suggest the previous two chart toppers - Stay Away from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"I love this album! It grows on you. Now its the first CD in the player at work! All of my friends love it too.

I'm consistently please with each and every CD Dave puts out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE FOR ANY DMB FAN NEW OR OLD!!!!!!!!","review":"This by far the best album that dave mattews band has come up with. If you are still not sure wether to buy this album yet well then go and buy one of their other albums(Crash, Under the Table and dreaming, or even their live album from the red rocks amphitheater taped over two days) But this is definitly one album that should be in your music selection very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk fears DMB","review":"Dave does it again. Following \\"Crash\\", I thought that Matthews couldn't get any better than that. I am happy to say that I was wrong. From the upbeat \\"Rapunzel\\" with it's kick @$$ piano tunes to the carefree \\"Wasting Time\\" to the dark, romantic aura of \\"Crush\\", Matthews has outdone himself. I am not ashamed to admit how moved I was at hearing \\"Crush\\" for the first time, from the deep bass intro to the melodic chorus to the unforgettable violin solo. \\"Crush\\" is easily the best song on the CD. \\"Streets\\" represents a variety of music flavors, be it an Egyptian twang in \\"Last Stop\\" or the freakish (but entertaining) \\"Halloween.\\" The deep bass complemented by the banjo in \\"Don't Drink the Water\\" is a perfect blend of mystery and Southern injustice. Overall, the CD is the best Matthews release to date, which, considering the classics \\"Crash\\" and \\"Under the Table and Dreaming\\", that is saying a hell of a lot more than any typed word can."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid","review":"i must admit, i was shocked the first time i heard this album. it doesn't sound much like dmb's previous albums, but much like another one of my fave bands, marillion, dmb has realized that in order to be fully appreciated not only by your fans, but yourself, you must go in different directions once in a while. this is a perfect illustration of that. you have to admire the guy for having the balls to stray from his usual happy and worry free jamming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave couln't get any better...........Or could he?","review":"Before These Crowded Streets was the first I had ever heard of Dave Mathews, and now I can't get enough.

The CD is pittiful compared to the other CDs he has made. Maybe it is just me, but I think everyone should buy GOO GOO DOLLS' CD \\"Superstar Car Wash\\". I recently bought \\"Superstar Car Wash\\" at the same time I bought \\"Before These Crowded Streets\\". I never was really a fan of the Goos, but after hearing Dave's latest CD, I decided to listen to the Goos more often. On Dave's CD, the band was really good, yet Dave was not. His vocals could have been a lot better, like on \\"Crash\\". On the Goo's CD, the vocals were unbelievable. They had harmony and a great beat. Hopefully, Dave will produce a better CD the next time around.

It shows Dave in his darker side which we haven't seen before. Although i love the style of the past albums, this new darker style is interesting. If your not the adventourous type skip over the song halloween, although it did start to grow on me. One dave's best work and a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD represents the talent and diversity of DMB","review":"I was really pleased with this CD once I was able to listen to it the whole way through. The influences are varied, but DMB manages to meld these sounds together to form music that breaks through to the soul. Rapunzel and crush show the usual lyrical talent that has endeared DMB to its faithful listeners for the last 6 CDs and keeps us coming back for more. The musical arrangement on Halloween is new and refreshing. As always these guys manage to jam without losing sight of the song.Usually, I will only buy a CD if I have heard and enjoyed the entire album previously. DMB are the only artists that I know will produce an album that I can listen to in its entirety over and over again. I recommend this CD to anybody who appreciates good music. Take a chance and I promise you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Typical DMB","review":"There is nothing really wrong about this CD. The best songs on it by far are Stay (Wasting Time) and The LAst Stop. But Dave Matthews has changed his style tremendosly. Many of his songs are darker (Halloween, Don't Drink the Water, The last stop). It is a great CD, it just doesn'y sound like Dave Matthews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite culmination of variuos influences","review":"Thoroughly and utterly impressed ! I am happy to note the success of a fellow ex-South African in the international music market . As noted in \\"Guitar\\" magazine , Dave Mathews has personally experienced the pain expressed lyrically on \\" Before these crowded streets \\".He divulges that he is not an entirely competent lyricist , but the above album exudes the intensitry of his own experiences with adequate competence . I am emotionally moved on a recurrent basis.The interesting melange of rock , jazz,folk,traditional African /other new world influences is the source of my fascination . Thank you Dave Mathews Band , for providing the music world with such enrichment !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite as good as Crash, but worth the money","review":"With extensive instrumental portions, this cd focuses less on the singers but beautifully showcases the band. Dave shows a darker side in some of his songs, but start the cd at 7 to avoid that. Alanis Morissette makes a surprisingly good partner and manages to avoid some of her usual angst. Buy it for the hit songs but then discover the rest of the good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW CD! Just got it.. In love with it!","review":"I love this CD.. I just got it for birthday..

You gotta have this CD.. it will grow on you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Matthews has culminated his experiments fabulously!","review":"Even though the purists out there will disagree, I feel that this album is the best. Nowhere on any other album have the band sounded better. They are doing some great new things. Some of the violins on many of the songs are outstanding. Dave's guitar parts are equally amazing. Every album that he comes out with is a little different, and that fact makes it great. But, with every album he has great drums, solid vocals, smashing guitars, and a new sound to keep us all amazed. I wholly recommend \\"Before These Crowded Streets\\" to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total and Extreme Excellency","review":"I have \\"Under the Table and Dreaming \\", \\"Crash \\", and \\"Before these Crowded Streets\\". The reason why BTCS sounds so much different than the others is because they (DMB) wanted to try something different. All of his songs are great, but on this particular album they really come to life. I listen to the cd daily and every time I get into the music. I always find something in it, that I didn't hear before. I love'em. Can't wait for the next album. Good job, guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BTCS is a departure from DMB's usual upbeat love songs.","review":"When listening to songs such as crash, lover lay down, and two step, the listener is moved by lyrics such as \\"Love, you came to me like wine comes to the mouth. Grown tired of water all, you quench my heart...\\"(DMB, Crash, Two Step). The music in Before These Crowded Streets, however, sounds much more morose and chaotic. From songs about the exodise to the plight of the Native Americans to the confusing and angry Halloween, the music is a change from the upbeat popular music of DMB's previous albums. While the songs are stranger and less main stream, there is much more meaning in these recordings, and this album is, in my opinion, the Band's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing change of pace","review":"This was the first of Dave Matthew's albms that I bought and I thought it was great. The band is so incredibly talented and it is such a relief to listen to something different other than today's standard pop tunes. The songs sort of grow on you and I ended up liking every single one. Now I can't take it out of my CD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Masterpiece From America's Greatest Band","review":"While Dave will never be able to capture the greatness of his live shows on tape, this comes very close. He has moved from all happy, bubblegum songs, to a little more serious tone, but without losing the mistique of the DMB. The best song on the album has to be The Last Stop, just a part of Dave's new creative abilities, going middle eastern. Overall a absolute five star album and if you don't get it, I guarentee that you will regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked the different approach to the same kind of music.","review":"I think that this album was well composed. The songs were all very different and unique. When put together, they make a great CD to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"best dmb yet","review":"I have all 3 of their studio recordings, and this is my favorite so far. They seem to improve each time, and are much more musically diverse than they showed on \\"Under the Table and Dreaming\\", which is still a good album. These guys are really talented musicians, even if the lyrics aren't all that great (with the exception of \\"Don't Drink the Water\\" and \\"Last Stop\\" which are really emotional and well-written songs), it's still a good listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave departs from his traditional style and experiments.","review":"I've found that many traditional Dave-head (fans) disliked the new CD thinking that the DMB had departed to far from their traditional style exhibited in \\"Under the Table and Dreaming\\" and \\"Crash.\\" I loved the new CD, happy to hear the DMB experimenting in new styles. I enjoy the bluesy Crush and festive Stay (Wasting Time) while my brother thinks that Rapunzel is the bands best song yet. Added to their usual guitar, bass, drums, electric violin, and sax/flute arsenal are backup singers, the Kronos Quartet, cameos by Bela Fleck and Alanis Morisette (don't worry all those who dislike her, she's actually pretty good) and a bunch of other people. Although \\"Under the Table and Dreaming\\" is still my favorite album, \\"Before these Crowded Streets\\" is still an important part of any Dave-head's collection. -C. Golis"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wild Change That Mostly Works.","review":"Okay, this is a huge departure from the sound of the Dave Matthew's Band's earlier albums. Does every song work? No. But does this album continue to show the complexity, talent, and overall excellence of this band? Yes. Listen to Rapunzel. Any song that smoothly goes from a driving 5/4 meter to a funky 4/4 beat takes a talented group of players. There are at least three distinct musical styles in this song alone. And each one is masterfully played. Stay (Wasting Time) is great fun to listen to. Crush hooks you with an awesome bass line. It's too bad people stayed away from this album because of Don't Drink The Water. While it's subtle sound and lyrics are amazing, the song was too dark and deep for radio audiences. Listen to it along with the rest of the album and you'll appreciate it more. Great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutly fantastic! I love it!!","review":"Before These Crowded Streets is easily among the five best cd's released in the 90's. Dave Matthews is a fanastic song writer! Huja!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave's Masterpiece","review":"In my opinion, DMB's finest release to date (studio or live). Few albums released in the past decade are able to move me like this one. EVERY song is incredible. I wish Dave would return to material of this sort, not stuff like Everyday (I'm sorry, I just don't enjoy it THAT much). Highlights for me; The Stone (possibly my favorite Dave song), Crush (very jazzy, love Stefen's bass line), and Dreaming Tree (which make's me cry every time i hear it). Not to mention, Rapunzel has some crazy time signature changes and Halloween has Dave's best vocal work ever. If you don't already own this album..., just get it. I consider it one of the best albums of the ninety's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Something Worth Obsessing Over","review":"If you like a lot of different kinds of music with the prerequisite that it has soul to it, you will love this one! I am impressed by the variety of sound, the synthesis of seemingly incompatible instruments, and the versatility of Dave's vocals (everything from hard core angst to soulful crooning). My personal favorite is \\"The Stone\\", and don't even get me started on \\"Crush\\" (If these don't put you in the mood, seek help)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"some songs are ok, but it doesnt even come close to earlier cds. the band was doing fine before this. What happened?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Get Better Than This","review":"This CD is just great. Dave Matthews has this incredible voice, filled with such emotion, as you can hear especially in The Last Stop and Halloween, wich are two powerful experimental songs. Crush brings on many musical styles by its own, and The Dreaming Tree, especially with Carter Beauford's beautiful drumming (as always), only gets you in the mood for more. The only problem could be the length of most of the songs, but if like me you don't mind some great instrumental music, it won't be a problem. The album proves the DMB can easily and successfully evolve in their music style, and that it just gets better and better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave Matthews needs to take time off.","review":"Dave Matthews is beginning to sell out. As a long time listener, I remember the days that Dave Matthews concerts weren't filled with wanna-be's. Lately, Dave Matthews has not appealed to me, especially this album, because of the Jackson Browne effect(all the songs are starting to sound the same). As I am putting down DMB, I am wishing to make a point: Dave Matthews needs to take time off for a while, and come up with new music, badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too soft for my taste.","review":"Too many woodwind solos, lyrics in songs are way too political, such as \\"Don't Drink the Water\\". This album is okay, but it is way too soft, and Dave's voice is getting worse as it sounds. I prefer that you get their older stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need to give it a chance...","review":"This album is definitely not their best... Crash and Under... were much better. If you give this cd a chance and listen to it several times over it will grow on you and you'll love it. One of the songs I want to love but can't is STAY, the chorus ruins the whole song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, the CD retains the DMB originality..it's a great CD","review":"Every time I get a new DMB CD I'm a little apprehensive. The sound of the CD is always different, but I think that's what makes DMB such a great band. They do compare to some other great artists of all times mostly because of their original sound (mixing saxes, voilin and upright base with the traditional guitar etc.). Their new CD adheres to their history of good music. They continue to bring a new sound to this era of rap and pop giving an alternative to the 'norm.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall very good","review":"It took a while for me to warm up to this disc, but after listening to it and attending a concert on the recent tour, these songs have grown on me and will probably serve as my summer anthem. This is a very solid CD, but hard to classify."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Think, it is a really good set of licks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I think that Daves previous albums were in fact superior to this on. I think that in order it Goes Under the Table, Remember, Crash, and the Streets, but still, it is superior to the average music of everyother band. It is headed up by the great sounds of Stan, and Don't Drink the Water, but Crush, is perhaps the most emotionally and though provoking sound on the Album, resting mainly on the strength of the time between 4:48 and 6:30. Other good songs that don't get quite as much acclaim as this are the spoon, and the remake of Haloween. Overall, Dave made huge strides with this album, and hopefully he comes out with even better ones in the future. (P.S. True fans are willing to critisize, not just stand their and say, \\"its the greatest ever man\\")"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as his old music","review":"I think dave matthews has sold out with this album. I love their old stuff and esepcially in concert, but i am not into small bands because oi thinkg dave has stooped to an all time low with this cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bluesy, Rock flavor","review":"For some reason I just love the song \\"Don't mow your lawn\\". The combination of the chorus, the humor, the great bass, the clever schitck. Wish I could just buy that song seperately as an MP3."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay if you really like search and find","review":"Personally, I don't like search and find, but it was okay to play once. For each scene, you get a list of items to search for, and then you have to find a certain percent of them to pass the level. Since every level is like this, it seemed pretty repetitive to me.I consider myself to have a pretty good vocabulary, but it's always difficult when you're asked to search for something that you don't even know what it is, as some of the search items were a bit obscure.The plot was also pretty cheesy, as everytime you're searching for something, it's because something awful is going on that will ruin the wedding, and if you win, then you will save the day.After you win, you get to pick different items for the wedding, which I did think was fun. Overall, I thought it was alright to play once, but I wouldn't recommend it and definitely would only play once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Interesting","review":"My thoughts on the Moonjar is for one I have to give it a A+ with the ease of teaching little ones the value of money.

It is cheaply made (made in China by the way), from the plastic belt cover to poor mounting design for the motor. Bolt and screw heads are the soft stuff we so often see from China. Adjust them a time or two and you have the usual head problems.Mine ran roughly and vibrated badly. The chuck continually falls out damaging the work piece and/or the bit. Delta's tech service says to take a hammer and pound it back in place...now isn't that a nice solution to poor engineering.I would advise against buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, works great but only for a short time","review":"I bought my Delta Model 11-990 for occassional project use. While using the handle the cheap brittle metal of the handle disintegrated in my hands. A fine example of taking a well engineered and well designed product but made with cheap materials.

I still haven't ordered the replacement parts for the drill because I'm so mad....considering putting it on craigslist just to be done with this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"really disappointed, but only ($$$)","review":"based on the reviews, there seems to be two completely different schools of thought on this product. My vote goes with \\"junk\\". Everything is very loose, the chuck is not true, so it turns in an eliptical motion (instead of a circle) and while I haven't had problems with the chuck falling off, the method of installation called for in the instructions \\"pound it in with a rubber mallet\\" --seriously!-- makes me certain it is only a matter of time. Also, you have to tighten the chuck with the key extremely hard and the bits still slip nearly every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"You better check your manual","review":"I am impressed with this drill press. I think it operates very well. It is quite and smooth during operation. I agree with one review that the light is a good idea, but it slides and won't stay in place.

Like so many recent reviews of Delta products, the quality just isn't there any more. My biggest grip is the chuck. I followed the direction to the letter and the first time I use it, the chuck fell off. It destroyed the piece of wood I was working with as well as the bit before I could turn the drill off. I had to replace the chuck because it was bound up after. I spent the $$ (...) to buy a good one from another company. This is my last Delta product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the money","review":"I purchased this machine about 3 months ago...I have used the drill press for making holes as well as sanding with various size drums on many types of wood. The machine has worked very well on all occasions and I am very pleaased with its operations.The only two draw backs are 1.) the need to use the chuck to get the bit either tightened or loosened from start to finish, can't use my hand to get most of the way there and do the final tightening with the chuck and 2.) the finish isn't very good. I know the finish does not affect the overall performance, but sends a negative message about the factory's pride in workmanship.All said, I would buy this machine again as I think its cost and performance match up well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rescue Heroes Rock","review":"My son has a whole collection of Rescue Heroes, his favorite by far is Billy Blazes.

While the religion portrayed in the books is close enough to medieval Christianity to be recognized, it is also different enough to be almost heretical. Unfortunately, that seems to be a trait of fantasy -- to mix-up religion or bash it. Since most of the genre does it, I can't blame this author for it. The characters were genuine and the title character's plight intriguing. I also like the fact that someone has written a fantasy in which the king isn't a cold tyrant, but a living, breathing man with emotions close to the surface. Overall, the plot twists can make the book seem long, but there are rewards for slogging through it. I eagerly await even greater rewards at the conclusion of the saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written.

It was definitely dragging in some parts but I thought that it was well worth my time. It has some great characters who aren't flawless and perfect like most stories. Liath, one of the main characters is not 'a damsel in distress' and she does not need to be rescued. This is a good book for girls to read because it shows that you can suceed and do what you want without help. I think that this book was great and I am waiting for the next book. Kate Elliott did a great job in my oppinion and even if people say the book is too realistic I would have to agree. I mean isn't that what the author is trying to get you to do? I mean she wants you to feel like you're a part of the book. I think everybody who likes a really interesting story should read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic !! Could not put it down !!

I really enjoy the fact that the 'hero & heroine' are not an 'item' it makes it a little different from some other fantasy books I have read. I love the way their world is similar to ours.It almost makes me believe I could have lived through this story if I had been born in the Middle Ages. I thoroughly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally unconvincing","review":"Considering the concept and ingredients the story sounded promising. But I'm afraid it was not. The story line was very predictable, no surprises, despite the occasional hinting at deeper hidden meanings. It is an admirable attempt to grasp the reader's attention through hundreds of pages with promises of a deeper layer, but alas so far no more than 2-dimensional, flat, stereotyped characters whom I could not care less about. I mean if you want to change history (religion that is) and put women on top of religious hierarchy, I think the author missed a great opportunity here to actually do something with such a different concept. Wouldn't it have been much more logical that with that in mind religious history would have taken a quite different path? It is just not convincing, and after yet another lesson in biblical paraphrasing you just get bored and toss it aside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aptly named, it's a Dog!","review":"If you like your heroines wimpy and heavy into masochism, this book's for you. Not since the days of the B-westerns and the helpless heroine who never raises her hand to help the hero but only to clasp those hands futilely together, has there been a more helpless, useless heroine as Kate Elliott has drudged up...and I do mean drudged! As for her hero? He's chained to a throne and surrounded by vicious dogs for most of the near endless book, so not much action nor heroics there either. Skip this volume and go directly to the next, you won't have missed anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully story full of twists that i couldn't put down!","review":"A seperate story from the first, which told of the fall of Gent. This tells of the recapture of Gent but yet continues the series in an excellent manner. Elliot uses great elements of literature to make the story seem real and derives another totally believable world into pieces of paper bound together to amuse readers of the world. The characters were totally believable except for how Liath acted when Hugh was around. Besides that I would have to say the best character is Wolfhere, he reminds you of a Sean Connery type in a way, next would be Sanglant. A charater completely changed by his year in captivity by Bloodheart. Yet his character seems a lot more developed now than during his time as the captain of the Kings Dragons. I read it once. Then I read it again after the third came out, which I am in the middle of.

The last two watches I have owned, the major flaw was that at night, I couldn't tell the time because the hands wouldn't illuminate unless I had put my hand directly under a light for 15 minutes!The only reason that I gave it four stars, is because when I ordered it, I was told the watch face was blue. It's more gray than anything, but still worth getting!Oh and the Kenneth Cole Reaction cologne is good too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How did I ever do without it?","review":"After looking at units from Jet, Delta, Grizzly, JDS, and HF to name a few, I decided on the Delta 50-850 because of a good match of price and performance. I can say without a doubt that I was not disappointed.The Delta units comes standard with 5 micron bags, and option that can cost $40 and up on other units. It also comes with clear botom bags for easy disposal and retaining clips to hold the bag in place while you fasten the band clamp.My first impression when I hit the start button was one of pure happiness. I immediately felt a massive amount of suction and proceeded to clean up all the piles of shavings and sawdust I had accumulated in the shop. It sucked everything up in no time, yet I didn't see any hint of dust flying in the air because of particles making it through the bag. Only time will tell as to how long the unit will last, but for now, I'm very happy I decided to buy the Delta."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb collector for the small/medium shop","review":"This is my first true dust collector. It came in a Giant box, but all the parts were there and the assembly was simple enough for one person. Two would help. The entire thing went up in a couple hours and it works great. I also have the extra super fine dust bag with it and it works like a champ. Lots of power, no worries about grabbing all those chips and dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"delta 50-850 dust collector","review":"Very disappointing performance; I purchased this collector as a direct replacement for a Shopsmith collector rated at 330 cfm because I wanted improved performance. It's connected to a 20 foot long 4 inch diameter PVC manifold with long radius taps along its length with only one connected at a time.Because the Delta 50-850 is rated at 1200 cfm I expected better; it doesn't even inflate the upper bag fully. I called Delta Service and was informed that Delta rates their unit as a bare blower only-no intake pipe or bag! Further, I was told that I was foolish to expect good performance unless used with only one woodworking machine (which I do) and with a hose length of 6 feet or less (which I don't). Perhaps I am supposed to be happy with the extra noise it provides rather than better sawdust collection than the Shopsmith 330. I would not recommend my...mistake to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Silent","review":"I bought this dust collector in November. It's now mid-January, and I have not yet used it. When first tested, it promptly blew four 20 amp slow blow fuses in succession, on a circuit that I have used for many, more powerful tools. I took it to a Delta repair shop. After five weeks, I got it back with a new motor, at no cost. It still blows fuses. I called Delta's \\"hot line\\", and was told that a 20 amp circuit is not enough. They recommend 30 amps, or re-wire it for 220 volts. I think I now know why it won't start. The impeller (fan) is a massive thing, rather crudely rivited together from heavy sheet steel. It has so much inertia that the motor can't get up to speed before the fuse blows. Aside from the motor loading, I question the use of steel in a fan that would be expected to handle wood dust and metal particles, due to the potential for creating sparks/explosions."},{"rating":"1","title":"These five stars review sound so phony I could puke!","review":"I have heard on the news that companies often pay people to write glowing reviews of thier products and after reading these reviews I would have to be very suspicious. Nobody would really write this kind of crap. None of these five star reviews seem genuine. Who do they think they are kidding? In this case I am only left with a disgusting feeling of never wanting to buy anything from Delta."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great addition for wood workers...","review":"Pros: Great job of keeping the shop floor clean. I was doing alot of table sawing, routing, drilling, and sanding. Needless to say, my garage was a mess with saw dust everywhere. After I set this dust collector up, the garage was consistently 90-95% cleaner. I should have bought one much sooner.Cons: Doesn't seem to work so well when reducing the 4\\" hose down to 1\\" for my power hand tools (e.g., sander, router, planer, etc.). It may be that the 4-1\\" conversion has to take place closer to the motor; as it is, there's about 10' of 4\\" hose with a 4-1\\" adapter and, finally, about 6' of 1\\" hose that attaches to the power tool.Summary: A very nicely priced dust collector that does the job well."},{"rating":"2","title":"This vacuum sucks, Like a good vacuum should !","review":"This collector works great! I bought it for a table saw thats on the way but wanted to use it so I currantly just have it hooked up to my compound miter saw and my radial arm saw. Both of them just hooked in with a home made 8in. sheet metal box behind the saw and it leaves no mess behind. It seams very quite although I have nothing to compare it to. One thing that was recomended to me was the disposable lower bag instead of having to dump and shake out the reusable ones although these could be reused. Extremly fast shipping I ordered it on Tuesday evening and I recieved it on Friday Fed Ex and it was free! Only complaint was the box it was shipped in looks as if they dragged it under the truck instead of in the truck. But everything was there and only one little ding.

I found the characters stereotypical and the writing somewhat clumsy in parts, especially in the dialogue passages (for example, the New York accents of certain characters just didn't sound real). However, what seemed most preposterous is the idea that a car going south at 90 miles per hour has a difficult time keeping up with a ship traveling down the Hudson River.

Lots of talented musicians have put huge amounts of effort into making masterpieces that will last for eons. This took about as much energy as a flea's fart. Ten years from now, N'Sync will be as forgotten as any of the other candy-coated pop groups of today.

Take 5 young guys...preferably with some looks, and a passable singing voice. No knowledge of music or instruments or songwriting is necessary.2. Teach them a few dance steps.3. Teach them the words to some manufactured songs.4. Record a cd and blast the music on any old radio station, television, malls, anywhere where teens hang out.5. Put out a lot of 'souvenirs'. T-Shirts, mugs, posters...anything to get them recognition.6. Now you are ready to put on a concert. Just watch out for the stampeding screaming teenage girls.7. Watch the money roll in. Guaranteed #1 album, Grammy nomination and instant superstar status. Hey, anyone can do it. It don't take much talent. Even most of the music is made by machines.8.

I'll admit that they 3 radio singles, (I Want You Back, Tearin' Up My Heart, and God Must Have Spent a Little More Time on You) are quality songs, but what dissapoints me most, is that you don't get any more of those quality songs, except for \\"Sailing\\". That song shows their vocal talent, and their ability to harmorzie with each other. Other than those 4 tracks, the CD is a waste of your hard earned money basically because the rest of the tracks sound very similar. I feel that the CD wanted to be a dance CD, but just didn't make it."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I gotta say is--YOU GUYS ROCK!!!","review":"The CD is one of the best that Ive ever heard! Its by a great group of guys that have an amazing amount of talent! They are also one of the necest,most sincere group of guys there is!The cd reflects them in every single way! It rocks!Not to mention--they all look really GOOD!! I think God must have spent a little more time on all of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get over it!","review":"Just what the world needs... another group of mildly talented teenagers who have been manufactured to sell records.

Over-rated. Just when I started to actually LIKE The Backstreet girls, I began to hate every boy band. First there were the stupid Backstreet Girls, then these people, then 98 degrees, then 5ive. Now there's Fresh-step. Golly McMolly! This is only my opinion......."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the greatest","review":"Well, what can I say, not a day goes bye that I do not listen to this C.D. I think *NSync is very talented and They have the videos to prove it. I know they will be around for along time and I look forward to seeing much more of their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising......Surprisingly Good!!!!!","review":"I at first thought of N Sync as an annoying replica of the Backstreet Boys, with few \\"good\\" songs (\\"God Must Have Spent a Little More Time on You\\", \\"Tearin' Up My Heart\\", and \\"I Want You Back\\"). Yet once I listened to their CD, I thought to myself, Wow! This is actually a good 13 tracks from this group! Some of my favorites are tracks 1,3,5,6,8,11,and 13. I definetly reccommend this great CD for anyone looking for a new favorite song (or songS in this case....)"},{"rating":"2","title":"N Sync luv!","review":"What can I say? N Sync is an establishing group. There are a lot of boy bands out toda, but they still know how to work it. I got this cd the day it came out. I really want the next one as well. I love the song \\"Bye Bye Bye\\". It reminds me of my relationship with some of my ex's. Great going N'Sync."},{"rating":"1","title":"cookie cutter 90's teen pop","review":"i want you back and tearing up my heart were guilty pleasures for me back in the day, they were catchy pop songs with beautiful melodies, but their material sounded exactly like the backstreet boys.

No, they still suck...","review":"\\"God Must Have Spent...\\" was written to a child from a mother's point of view. So, why are they singing this? Not only are they torturing the nation with poor, corny tunes, their lyrics (which weren't written by them) are screwed up, too. *N SYNC's songs would not be this way if they actually wrote them."},{"rating":"1","title":"CLONES!!!","review":"i am sure they are nice guys and all, but relly!! i can't tell them apart from the backstreet boys or any of those so called boy bands. if they didn't look the way they did, they would probaly be out of a job."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think it is one of the best CDs I have ever herd","review":"I think I want you back is the best of all the songs on the CD, but all the other songs are okay.The reson I like I want you back so much is the same backround as Backstreet Boys Everybody and I think it is the best beat to any of the songs I have ever herd befor"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing very exciting, but better than the Backstreet Boys.","review":"I give them 2 stars by virtue of the fact that they stand above the Backstreet Boys. I don't hear any very interesting lyrical writing and the music takes few chances, if any. My one compliment of the band is that it appears they do have reasonable voices and do harmonize reasonably well together. In my opinion, in time they will become much better, whether as a unit or individually. The styles and tastes of the times change quickly, it will be difficult for them to keep up, not unlike New Kids On the Block. We will see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Miss!","review":"The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because GOD MUST HAVE SPEANT.... puts my 2 year old neice to slep everytime(what does she know). I can't say ONE good thing about this album. The guys of Nsync basically stink. They don't sing good at all. Live, the sound TERRIBLE. At lease the Backstreet Boy can sing harmonize. Also, they can actually sing live. Not being a big fan of either, I'd choose Backstreet Boys anyday. At lease their is some talent there. Nsync get some voice training & try & have better songs. ONly a little teeny girl would like this album. I've never been so disgusted."},{"rating":"1","title":"I realy don't like how they sing","review":"The CD is so boaring and blaw.

The boppy tunes and weak voices only satisfy the current craze of young girls for more boy band music. In truth, only two of the boys in the group actually sing alone. This cd is a forgettable disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"An Inspiration\\"","review":"I am proud to say N Sync is my favorite group,it is so hard to find quality music these days and with a 3 year old its even harder.God must have spent has to be the most beauitful song and along with the rest of the album the perfect harmonies combined with awesome dance moves N Sync will definately take us well into the next century....Thank You N Sync you guys are the best!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"monkees clones","review":"These guys are as bad as the Monkees, but they don't even pretend they can play instruments. They sould make this music easy for little girls to listen to, that seems like their main audience. Put the songs on one of those baby toys, pull the string and the pre pubecent bleach blonds make noises! Scream over a guy that can at least spend the week to learn and play the guitar. And if you really love pop music, there are better groups, try the Beatles."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN ABSOLUTE POP DISASTER","review":"THIS CD MAKES ME ONE TO BARF!

I mean, if you like rock music or whatever, keep listening to it and don't complain about music some of us enjoy. They also can harmonize very well, and I love their music."},{"rating":"1","title":"20-somethings singing about first love? Come on!","review":"The music is too damn soft.

All of their soft songs sond alike and so do their fast songs. I'm giving them one star for the boring songs that help me sleep, and two for trying. My advice is: money is precious, don't waste it on junk like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Mix","review":"Yes, I am an N Sync fan, yes I do think Justin is hot, but if all they had were looks I wouldn't bother even reviewing this CD. I think it's a nice mixture of pop, ballads and mid-tempo songs...you can do almost any dance to it and it is hard to resist getting up and letting the music move you when you listen to it. In case you've heard the singles like Tearin' Up My Heart and I Want You Back too many times, you'll be glad to know that there are other songs worthy of radio play like For The Girl Who Has Everything and Here We Go. Another underrated song is Sailing, which gives the group a chance to show off their vocal chops. The only song that I'm not too fond of is Giddy Up because...well, it just doesn't make sense. Otherwise, it's a nice CD for fast dancing, slow dancing and everything in between."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silencio! To all of the Critics","review":"I would like to make a comment to all of the critics out there. First of all if your a reviewer of any kind you are supposed to be open minded to all of the things you are reviewing. I find that 70% of reviewers are saying that 'N Sync is just copying the BSB. 'N Sync cut a record deal way before BSB became popular so it's completely unfair to say that 'N Sync was copying. How can you copy someone you haven't heard of yet? I think that these guys have a wonderful talent and through more experience and less discouragement they could really grow to be even better. Thank You."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Backstreet Boys Imitation (2.5 stars)","review":"The first time I listened to this cd, I didn't like it. The lyrics were usually repetitive and often made little sense. Some of the songs were just plain stupid. A few of them were pretty good, but still only mediocre when compared to other groups, such as the Backstreet Boys. They mostly didn't have a very good beat or tune, though I must admit that the guys have good harmony. Of the songs that aren't overplayed on the radio, only two are particularly good, and it's certainly not worth getting the cd for just those."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think the CD is great","review":"I think that *N Sync is doing a great job.. And for those who think that they are another BSB... youre wrong.. they are so much better.. They were all frineds before they got a deal... and that has paid off. But this CD is great!!!!! And i hope they keep up the good work!!! Stay *N Sync!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already!!!","review":"For crying out loud, if this was a group of 500-pound forty year olds no one would know who they were. A few of the cuts were catchy but after hearing them every possible place you can imagine and not being able to escape them they wear off pretty darn quickly!! I think it is about time the \\"music\\" industry realized there are OTHER groups out there besides 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys that people would like to see and teenage girls who are in obsessive love with Justin Timberlake should realize that it's NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN!!!!! I mean jeez, you can't even walk into a bookstore anymore without seeing their \\"angelic\\" faces plastered all over teen magazines, posters, calendars, not to mention all the endless books about them. Good looks do not equal talent. Please, enough is enough!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh yeah! Go *N Sync!","review":"I bought this cd because of my friend's great comments about it. Boy, was she right! Not only are *N Sync's songs catchier, but Justin, JC, Chris, Lance, and Joey can sing much, much better than the Backstreet Boys! They are also much better to look at!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nsync is just a phase.","review":"Nsync has some good songs here but there just a phase. The problem with a lot of artists today is that they are dropping their material too quickly. Lets wait and see how long these guys will last. If you want the true original formula, check out the bsboys!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Ok I'll give N'Sync some credit they have two good songs on their CD I Want You Back and Tearin' Up My Heart the rest is crap. You can tell when a band really tries, and these guys didn't try. They just ripped off the Backstreet Boys' moves, lyrics, and the instrumental parts of the song. I say if a band really wants to be known they'll develope their own style. Obviosly they just wanted to get on the charts and be famous. The Backstreet Boys should be recieving the credit N'Sync is getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"N'sync is the best band in the whole world!!","review":"The first time I saw N'sync, I thought, \\"oh,ok another backstreet boys group\\". But then I heard some of their other songs, and I love them! They have such good meaning. Espically the song,\\"God must have spent a little more time on you\\". That had me in tears.

This debut from Nsync is a teenage brain washer! This kind of music destroyed the brains and the attitude of all the youth in the early 2000's...Just like the backstreet boys, nsync is a fake band created by pop music producers, with catchy disco melodies and a hot guy posture that is completelly ridiculous...All the songs are about mellow feelings with childish monogamic lyrics that only a teenage girl can argue...Oh, God! How i miss the GRUNGE in the early 90's, or even the New Metal on the late 90's...Nsync, Backstreet boys and britney created a plague that destroyed all the good music from the world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pure pop","review":"Nsync first cd is very good and I am sorry it took me this long to get it.

That one is pretty cool too. My fave song from there is 'The Only Gift' because Lance's voice sounds so COOl. I still personally think that the BSB are more mature and better looking than 'N Sync. I love 'N Sync dearly, but they are no match for the BSB. There's no way POSSIBLE that they could outdo the BSB in anything having to do with music."},{"rating":"2","title":"I give this CD 9 stars, not 5!","review":"I love *NSYNC!

Besides, I gave these guys a chance. I listened to their cd, watched their videos, and I have come to a conclusion... They suck. The only reason they are loved by 12 year old girls are because they (well, three of them) are good looking. They have no talent. I mean, come on, even the Backstreet Boys are better than this. Before you buy their cd, try imagining them as ugly and not a popular group or something and then decide if their music is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"N SYNC, ANOTHER FORMULATED MESS.","review":"This CD only has one breakout song \\"Tearin' Up My Heart\\", the rest of the CD just sags, with \\"I Drive Myself Crazy\\", and \\"God Must Have Spent A Little More Time On You\\", ballads geared at the 10 year old girl....Give me Debbie Gibsons \\"Lost In Your Eyes\\" anytime before I have to swallow this garbage. The biggest laugh on this CD is even trying to do a remake of a Christopher Cross pop classic \\"Sailing\\". In 2 years it will be N Sync who?...Remember New Kids on the Block?,or Take That? or how about Rick Astley?

And that group is Nsync. I can't understand how anyone can compare them to the BSB, or any other boy group. Nsync has talent, determination, and skill, which all the other boy groups seem to lack. Try putting on BSB's CD...maybe you'll figure out that they use the same background (and that cursed clap machine) in every song. All they do is slow it down or speed it up. Or 98 degrees, who's vocals are like child's play compared to Nsync. But, to all the people who wrote a review for this CD and put in \\"1\\" star, it's obvious to me you couldn't tell talent apart from a singing monkey. So you can stay away from this music, because they don't need you. As a matter of fact, WE ALL don't need you. \\"A Singing Monkey? That's even better. In fact, toilet flushes are way better too."},{"rating":"1","title":"AUUUGGGHHH! IT'S THE INVASION OF THE BOY BANDS!","review":"Okay. Lets get one thing straight. These guys ARE good-looking. I mean, you gotta be blind or something not to think so. And they can dance extremely well. An idiot could tell you that.However, comma, when you get past the, \\"Oh God, they're so cute; I wouldn't mind if Justin drove me crazy!\\" stage, you realize that they don't really have much musical talent. The lyrics are so cheesy, and they are trying way too hard to sound emotional. They don't write their own songs, they don't play their own instuments, and to top it off, they sound extremely whiny. I don't call that talent! This goes to show the final score for N'Sync: Looks:5, music:0!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For The Girl Who Has Everything,","review":"You just found a good buy. NSYNC has tons of talents, but the thing is all the good songs are so well known that there's no real real reason to even discuss them. My favorites aren't any of the hits at all. Tearin' Up My Heart is good, but I mean, let's face it \\"I Want It That Way\\" is a whole lot better. I Want You back is so overdone, I mean how many times can groups get away with this? God Must Have Spent A Little More Time On You What were they thinking! The writers must have spent a little less time on this is a much better title. For The Girl Who Has Everything is the best song here followed by Drive Myself Crazy. The rest is just- middling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot...","review":"'NSYNC's self-entitled (and first) album is not all it's cracked up to be. The boys can sing, but these tunes and lyrics just don't hit the mark. \\"Here We Go\\" and \\"You Got It\\" are really the only songs that are worth keeping the album for. You'll have to listen to this CD MANY times before you can actually remember the song titles and the order of the tracks. Get this... even 'NSYNC admits that they didn't really like their first album. If you're a die-hard 'NSYNC fan, go ahead and buy the CD. But \\"No Strings Attached\\" will give you much more satisfaction on the first play than the first CD ever will."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best cd in the whole world!!!!!","review":"this cd is so great. i can listen to every song and sing along. JC sings really great, his voice is so beautiful and moving. every time i listen to \\"god must have spent a little more time on you\\" i get teary eyed. it is so romantic and touching. the cd also has very up beat songs too. they just make me want to get up and dance where ever i am. i am going to their concert in a month and i am so excited! anyway this cd is great both romantic and up beat. everyone needs it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If good pop and/or harmony are you're thing, get it.","review":"Normally, I go for a more alternative/grunge sound, but these guys really do have something good. Personally, I think they have a better blend of voices than BSB, which is even more evident on their X-mas album with \\"O Holy Night\\" sung acapella. Still, they only wrote one of the songs (\\"Giddyup\\" -excellent) so they could be a little better, but it gives room to grow. Also, contrary to popular belief, it's not the most clean-cut CD out there (if you're listening to specifics), which gives it a nice edge. I would definitly suggest it if you like pop music, dance music, male voices, excellent harmony, ect. etc. You shouldn't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What music shouldn't be.","review":"This CD is obviously fabricated and contains no musical talent. It is just one mushy love ballad after another. The only people that I can see liking this music are in the 10-12 year old range. This band doesn't even write their own lyrics. How can anyone think that this music shows emotion, when they're singing something that some stuffy middle aged man wrote in his corner office on the 39th floor of X Records Company HQ? It's sad that record companies sacrifice music in the pursuit of money. Spend your money on something else such as hed(pe) or Incubus (Or, if you like softer music, Lenny Kravitz or someone like that.) At least these people show musical talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LUV *NSYNC!!!","review":"*NSYNC is the bomb!

But i was pretty dissapointed after hearing the rest of the album. they should get more of Max Martin songs instead. The songs like Giddy up and i drive myself crazy are very awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know why I'm even commenting on this,","review":"However, I just thought I would express my opnion to add support to those who view and accept Nsync for what it is - a probably short-lived group who can harmonize, but have basically no more musical talent than a church choir. Like many of the other pop groups that are around today, their lyrics are basically meaningless, and their elementary chords and music doesn't do much for me. But if you like them, thats great, they need to make $millions just as much as the next guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT WAS GREAT","review":"I THINK IS WAS THE BEST CD. YOU GUYS ARE GREAT.

There's is no meaning to these songs!! Nothing you can learn from!! Life is always perky, and having trouble with love isn't gonna kill you!

Their CD is fun, not to mention clean (free from bad things like drug use, cursing, etc.) It is obvious that these fab five are havin' fun, and I love it (& I'm in high school.) It's the kind of band your parents won't mind you listening to, and you don't mind listening either. God truly spent a little more time on them.

HELLO? N SYNC HAS NO IDENTITY OF ITS OWN!!! That's right, it doesn't. All they're doing is singing someone else's music, not even PLAYING the music to boot! They're being themselves? Huh? What? Thay would be themselves if they'd write & play their own music. Until then they have no individual identity. Maybe they don't sound exactly like BSB, and their songs may even have their own sound (although i think they sound like all the other 5 pretty boy bands out there) but this is NOT their own identity! It's an identity created for them by other people. Please don't support this type of music by buying this CD. If you have already bought it, take it back for refund like I did... Why?

I know you wouldn't like them at all if they looked like five balding sumo wrestlers. Third, why listen to this crap when there are talented, hard working bands out there like Nirvana, 311, Soundgarden, R.E.M., Cake, etc.?

Sure, there are about 20 million future \\"Mrs. Justin Timberlake\\"s, but how many of them like him for his looks, and not his personality? The CD was pretty good, although \\"Giddy Up\\" and \\"I Need Love\\" get annoying after awhile.

Although it has every aspect that makes a good group, it's a teenybopper thing. You know it's a boy band when you hear \\"I Want You Back\\", but have second thoughts when you hear \\"You Got It\\" and \\"Giddy Up\\". They aren't copying the Backstreet Boys, they have a really unique sound. It's a good album in the long run, stick with Limp Bizkit if you're with the 14-and-over crowd. It's hard being PG in an R-rated world, but 'N Sync's got what it takes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a good dance cd","review":"The cd is really good if you like dance music cause its really upbeat. But they do throw some really romantic songs out there like God must of spent and little more time and drive myself crazy and Jc really sing good on songs like sailin. I would give them 5 stars but i really don't like i need love or the girl who has everything. I really enjoyed the rest of the song though. They are really talented you shouldn't really compare them to the backstreet boys cause you know the backstreet boys did get nomintated for a grammy and nsync didn't. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THE CD IS YOU LIKE DANCE MUSIC. You should really go to their concert cause it was the bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"NSYNC CAN'T SING","review":"I think that these guys dont know how to sing.

Thats there only good song."},{"rating":"1","title":"LADIES. . . .N'SYNC IS AN INDUSTRY PRODUCED GROUP!","review":"Ok I do admit that some of their (N'Sync's) songs get stuck in my head and I'm not here to bash them. BUT. . . these guys were brought together by some rich guy and given voice lesson and taught to dance. Notice in all these BOY BANDS there's usually. . 1)The older one 2)the young baby face 3)two that are related 4)the kinda weird one 5)the HOT one 6)and the bad boyThese bands are prototypes they haven't played together for years AND EARNED their success (like Rolling Stones, Dave Matthews, REM) I just hope that these guys don't go spending all their money because only the BEATLES have made this formula a success.

There was not a single song I liked."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for Tearin' Up My Heart and none for them","review":"I just can't believe that all you people can get so excited over squeaky high-pitched superstar wannabes like the Backstreet Bums and these guys when majority of their music sounds the same, they get their own producers to write songs for them, and then get success for it. Why not try writing some of your own songs, please. Even Andrea Bocelli has co-written a few of his songs, and in any clips of his music videos I've seen he can play the piano, but he's no Stevie Wonder. Still, I just love the man for what he is, not like these clowns and Sarah Brightman in particular (whom I'm starting to get sick of). \\"Tearin' Up My Heart\\" is the only acceptable song on here,\\" but \\"I Want You Back\\" and others sound almost identical to it. So much that it's hard to determine a decent song. And you're all excited about this? Two years later, I STILL don't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Great","review":"This is a great CD but i bet it would be much more better if the boys wrote their own songs. Otherwise, i love J.C. Peace ya'll."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD Ever","review":"I absolutly love this CD. 'N SYNC got off to a great start with this CD. Every song is a hit. In fact I'm listening to this CD right now as I'm writing this review. It's so good you should by it right now. Don't stop to think it over buy it now. Anything 'N SYNC does is great. Also check out their Christmas CD: Home for Christmas. This CD is the best I've ever listened to and I've listened to a lot of CDs and artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative lyrical composure and perfectly performed harmonies","review":"I've heard several people try to compare N'sync with such groups as Backstreet Boys or The New Kids On The Block. There is only one difference that I can tell.....N'Sync is better! Their smooth ballads will make your knees go weak and their snappy dance moves will make your head spin. This is a group of five young men that combine their voices with such synergy that you'll be humming the harmonies and singing the hooks for days. An impressive combination of good looks and talent will turn listeners into fanatics. Check out this CD, and listen for vocal details that make this CD worth the cash. It is obvious that God must've spent a little more time on these boys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This music is for negative nancies","review":"I read somewhere that this would be the cool peppy new sound.

But I am so upset with myself for buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"this album is good for dancing to, not much else","review":"I think this album and this band is extremely shallow and unmusical. The lowest pop music can sink is n'sync. The lyrics basically consist of \\"I love you baby, yeah yeah.\\" If you are looking for an album you enjoy listening to, please don't watse your time on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is crap!","review":"The only reason I give it a 1 is because i cant give it a 0. This is complete crap. They can't even sing. Yea, they can dance, but not sing. Wheres the talent. I cant compare Nsync to anyone else in the music industry, because everyone else is better, even the bad, talentless people. At least Backstreet Boys have some raw talent. They can actually sing good. On the radio & live, which is a lot more than I can say for other artist(nsync ASPECIALLY included). Id put them(Backstreet Boys) in a class with really singers, such as Jodeci & Boys 2 Men. They dance pretty good to. All I can say is nsync is TERRIBLE. They cant sing, & they dont even look that good. At least there are talented people in the industry like Backstreet Boys, K-ci & Jojo, Boys 2 Men, Lauryn Hill, & Steven Tyler to keep good music alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst cd ever!!!!!","review":"This is the worst boy band of them all!Come on they're just a group of guys who get paid for what your doing right now.If you want a good boy band backstreet boys are the band to go with,they're way better."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"IT SEEMS LIKE NOWADAYS ALL A BOY HAS TO DO TO GET A GIRL IS SAY \\"I LOVE YOU\\", ADD SOME BACKGROUND MUSIC OF PEOPLE GOING \\"OOOH YEAH, BABY\\" AND ALL THE TEENAGE GIRLS START SCREAMING.

DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!! Sure, \\"I Want You Back\\" and \\"Tearin' Up My Heart\\" are good, but the rest is horrible. Most of it sounds like crappy eighties rip-offs, and too many of the songs are (or sound like) remakes. If you want a boy band cd, get Backstreet Boys or Five. This is terrible. And the Backstreet Boys are MUCH better looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeech!!!!!!!!!!! ::gag::: ::groan::::","review":"If you think this is the best CD in the world, then you haven't been paying attention in Band or Orchestra have you guys. You haven't really LISTENED to REAL music have ya?N Sync is only selling their looks, and whatever talent they have (which isn't much).Get something real! Like Bach or Hole, Mozart or even Marilyn Manson. They had style, they had grace, they had talent, and they earned it the honest way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um....","review":"All I can say is......WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU FREAKS THINKING WHEN YOU BOUGHT THIS C.D?

This album stinks unlike their 2nd and 3rd. Their 2nd and 3rd album is what is keeping them in the business (besides their looks). Anyway, there are some songs that deserve creditation on this CD: 'Tearin' Up My Heart', 'I Want You Back', 'Here We Go', 'God Must Have Spent A Little More Time on You', and 'I Drive Myself Crazy'. The rest of the songs, they are some-what good but they all sound the same--boring! If you want to buy good albums by NSYNC, buy their 2nd or 3rd albums--skip their first. If I have offended NSYNC fans by this review, sorry. This is my opinion and I'll respect your five stars review if you respect my 1 star review. PEACE OUT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Like Writing A Bad Review But...","review":"I don't like writing bad reviews (especially on first albums) but I can't stand not writing a review for this. NSYNC's first album stinks, their second album...mixed feelings, and their third album rocks! I find that disturbing that it took NSYNC three albums to rock. Sure, they had some hits on their first and second album but too many flaws that 'Tearin' Up My Heart', 'I Want You Back', 'Bye Bye Bye', 'It's Gonna Be Me', 'It Makes Me Ill', and 'This I Promise You' couldn't cover. All I can say is, THANK GOD FOR CD-SINGLES!... For songs you like, get CD-SINGLES. Don't spend your money on this. If I've offended all you NSYNC fans, I'm sorry. Don't take this review personally, it's just my opinion. Everyone has a right to their own opinion so, I'll respect the five star reviews because that's their opinion as long as you respect mine. Okay?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"This is my first Pop album I've bought, and I loved it. I love *NSYNC since the day I heard \\" I want you back\\" on the radio. This cd shows a difference between them and the BSB. THey have more class and has more fun when they sing. And not every song sounds the same on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best Cd i own, by the best group in the world!!!!!","review":"Yere, okay im a complete teenybopper, but surly that means i know what im talking about when it comes to this stuff right?! Well this is the best CD that you can find, sure the best songs are the ones that have been released \\"I want you back\\", \\"God must have spent a little more time on you\\", and my 2 ultimate faves \\"Drive myself crazy\\" and \\"tearin' up my heart\\". The rest of the songs sound rather different from these but they are still very good. Nothing on here is like what you find on \\"No Strings Attached\\" (which too is very good) and i have to say i like the orriginal N Sync best. Even if you are not in to pop I say you should get this anyway because i find it untrue for anyone to not like it! And before i go i have to say N SYNC ARE THE BEST!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How Good Are They","review":"NSYNC made a really good album, as their first album to come out. The songs are very interesting. The songs have a catchy tune and all of their singles are great. Unlike BSB they can dance well, and JC and Justin have really outstanding voices(they were the ones who had most of the solo's in the songs) The rest of the group blends very well and sounds great. BSB dosen't really have that harmony like NSYNC. NSYNC is really good and their next album will be great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sound effects, pretty good","review":"For a debut album, I'd say this one's quite good. The song styles vary from mellow harmonies (\\"God Must Have Spend a Little More Time on You\\") to upbeat rhythms found in such songs as \\"Tearin' Up My Heart\\" and \\"Giddyup.\\" 'N Sync's style would appeal to those who like the Backstreet Boys and other newer, upbeat artists. Their harmonies are very well done, as are the percussions and other instruments. Overall, I'd say that this album is worth getting--but only if you think you'd enjoy the upbeat, kind of \\"teeny-bopper\\" style."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is off da hook!!","review":"'N Sync is the greatest group in the music world!

THEY'RE JUST BSB WANNABES. BSB WERE ALREADY DEBUTING BEFORE ANYONE HEARD OF 'N SYNC. IF YOU ASK ME, ALL YOU GIRLS WHO 'WORSHIP 'N SYNC' OR HAVE 'I LOVE N'SYNC' ALL ACROSS YOUR BODIES ARE VERY STRANGE AND NEED TO GET A LIFE.

The originals were much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, Get up of your knees","review":"How can you stand to listen to this usually teeny bopper stuff. This CD is not for anyone who is mature. All their lyrics consist of Baby Baby, why? They are babies. Especially Justin Timberlake. Please! LIsten to people with talent such as U2, REM and if you like that Teeny Stuff grow UP! The Backstreet Boys are better, but not by much TLC stinks, and all KISS listeners are eight year olds.

I am a more bizkit or rock group fan but, I cant help but realize how much all these boy bands make millions for the same songs as the damn BSB. If you watch TRL on MTV all you see when people write in on the internet are \\" oh justin is so hot, i wouldnt mind he he drove me crazy\\" It so stupid.

N Sync is a group of really talented guys and I hope that they stay around for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"They could have tried harder","review":"I think NSYNC could take some lessons from the Backstreet Boys.

This CD has everything on it - from the ballads to the dance songs. The guys sound really good, and the songs are all great. If you haven't gotten this CD yet, you definitely should. I can't wait till NSA, and stay 'N Sync y'all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its all been done.... and better, too.","review":"This CD is awful. Its the perfect money making fodder for all the little teen-bopper girls. Its almost like nowadays you can put the words \\"love\\", \\"na na na\\" into a song and it will send the little girls screaming! Please! Just listen to track 7 to find out the quality of their songwriting. This is basically the song.... \\"I need love, I need love, I need love, we all need love, need romance, give me a chance, desire, fire\\". Thats the song. I prefer lyrics a lot more meaningful than these. Come on, all this has been done before! Personally, Backstreet Boys does pop a HELLUVA lot better than N'stink-oops, sorry- N'sync. Don't buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great CD!","review":"I am probably too old to be a fan of *NSYNC (let's just say I'm older than everyone in the band except for Chris) but this CD is really good. When I first heard \\"I Want You Back\\" last summer, I thought it was catchy but I wrote them off as a BSB ripoff. Fast forward to January of this year when I saw them on MTV and I was really impressed with them - they all seemed to be down to earth guys. So I went and bought their tape (and the CD!). It rarely leaves my tape player (and I have a 2 hour commute every day). Their harmonies are just amazing. This CD is full of fun, light music and I really enjoy listening to their beautiful voices. People that say they are just like the BSB haven't taken the time to listen to *NSYNC because I think they are much more talented (no offense to the BSB). I am really looking forward to their new CD but until then I would highly recommend this one if you don't have it already."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're driving me crazy too.","review":"I first saw the N'Sync video in Target. That's the only place worth playing that crap. What a joke. Even the Backstreet Boys are better. Even Five is better and who likes Five?! N'Sync comes in last place on my list along with Milli Vanilli and Los Del Rios (or whoever wrote \\"Macarena\\"). Personally, if you want great music, buy Chumbawamba or better yet, Rammstein!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money !","review":"This c-d is the worst you can buy!

NSYNC basically incorporates a bunch of monotous, shallow, cinsistently sappy and relationship-dependent, needy, songs that all sound basicly alike. The only reason I gave it two stars is because a couple of the songs, if listened to once and not accompanied by the others, won't seem half-bad. I would not reccomen this CD to anyone who appreciates good music with meaning, and the only reason they are so popular is efficient advertising and publicity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets old WAY too fast","review":"This cd definitely gets old fast. i can't tell you how annoying this cd can be.

Another BSB wanna be. They'll make it pretty good I'm sure but the songs just don't suit them! They have to go for more R&B or rock. Not for pop! Great try Nsync. Maybe your next album will be better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did this really come out in 1998? It sounds so freaking OLD!","review":"I really doubt that anybody listens to this lousy group anymore. This CD sounds ancient and dated only a few years after its release. Those computerized drum machines and sound effects were trendy and hip in 1998, but now they have an undeniably \\"dated\\" feel to them. So dated in fact, that they wouldn't sound too out of place on an oldies radio station between Elvis Presley and The Beatles. I was born in 1984, which means I was in my early teens when this cr@p came out, and now those memories of thousands of horny 12 year old girls squealing so hard that tears ran down their faces seem so LOOOOOOONNNGG ago now. It really seems like a completely different era. And NSYNC is just an outdated relic of that era.

From a political science perspective, this is a great reminder that theory can't be separated from human behavior. From a human perspective, it's an often day-by-day description of heartbreaking tragedy, made worse by the knowledge that Wugong was one of the model villages with a relatively unified leadersihp, so things were much worse most other places.(A caveat: Edward Freidman is a former undergraduate professor of mine at the University of Wisconsin.

I highly recommend One By One."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely more poppy than Agents tend to be...","review":"This album is a good example of what Agents are now trying not to become. Don't get me wrong; it's a good, lighthearted, poppy album with some fantastic songwriting. But, it's really not what they're about. It's worth buying - the break in Shortchange is epic, and the vocals on Two Bucks In Cash are stunning. But, buy Straightaround and Where'd You Get That Vibe? first (in that order)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great live band, wait for the next disc.","review":"I assume that Agents was trying to sound more mainstream than their fusion-laced, awesome live shows, but their attempts at hard rock here miss the mark.

I like to start at the beginning of the series. This way I feel like I am not missing any important character development. I could have skipped \\"War and Peas\\". I was disappointed in the ending. It didn't come as a surprise (I did think that it was someone else). The ending came out of the blue. Miss Churchill attempted to pull it together but it just didn't work for me. The topic that she chose to tie the book together was out of character from her previous novels. I hope that her next novel takes a different path."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent product, could be a little tougher","review":"I bought this cart for working around the yard/garden, and I am very pleased. It collapses and expands very easily. It is rated to hold up to 350lbs (the most I've ever put in it was 6 8x8x16 cinder blocks and a 50lb bag of manure -- I complained about that far more than it did). The wheels roll very easily even when it is loaded - yet it is stable enough to stay still unless you are on a significant slope.Most importantly, because it has two wheels and two legs, it doesn't tip over like wheelbarrows are prone to do. I do wish that they had used a thicker gauge of aluminum, though. I've managed to ding up the back gate by being a little too enthusiastic with my shoveling. I also wish I had spent the extra money to buy the optional front gate when I first bought it. I'll be adding that soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"flat tire is a drag to fix and keep fixed!","review":"If the tires did not go flat all the time it would be a great cart but my tires go flat and it is a drag takeing the time and MONEY to replace the tube.

My husband and I sat down to watch this DVD, as we are expecting our first child. We were unable to complete even the first section of the film due to the poor quality. To be specific, the production quality was extremely poor and seemed more like someone's home video. The two men who provide the information throughout the video were not remotely comedic, although many, many attempts at humor were made. It was outright cheesy and difficult to watch without wincing. It was a painful viewing experience for us both. If you need a parenting video, I would recommend that you look to something like the Laugh and Learn series, which offer DVDs on childbirth, breastfeeding, and newborn care by a qualified professional and a mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a useful or entertaining film","review":"This feature is labled a comedy, but I thought there might be some good information here to help new dads.

Not to much sex but the right amount, and not too much suspense, but the right amount to keep you on the edge of your seat. Sable and J.D. having sex on a parade float, now that's a new one on me. How they got away with that, I don't know. My favorite character has to be Terri, her no-nonsense-attitude and tough-cop-demeanor, along with her humor, had me laughing until I cried. Especially during her love scene with Cort, \\"You want me to stop?\\" Pulling her spare gun out of the nightstand drawer and pointing at his face. \\"You want to die?\\" That part in particular had me in the floor laughing. For a book that was only 291 pages it sure did pack a huge romantic-suspense punch. I can't wait for Cort and Terri's story to be released."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST OK","review":"Not worth the money in my opinion. Some nice pictures, but not as up-to-date as I expected.

It is impossible to see details on the Kindle screen. When you zoom into them, they are very poor resolution and show less than the silly postage stamp size view. So... it is not a picture book. There has to be a more refined way of translating a picture book into an eBook. I realize that shrinking down the image sizes makes it easier to transmit the book, but this is worthless.Nor is the book valuable for the text. The text reads like it was scanned from a hard copy but never edited to correct OCR errors.

However, it has pretty much everything you would want or need for a first-time player. A better list of included items should be listed in the ad. Example: the tripod stand isn't in the picture or mentioned in the ad.After a few items were tweaked (mainly the tuning), everything was fine. The amp is loud enough to be heard but not so loud as to tick off the neighbors - as might be expected given its size.The worst I can say about it is the cord for the amp was nowhere to be found until it dawned on my to look in the guitar bag pocket (yeah, I assumed it would be packaged with the amp but it is in the bag).For the money I paid, it was well worth it. I have seen similar guitars from lesser names going for the price I paid but without the amp and probably without half the other items in the kit."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"Great product!!!

It stands to reason that if he doesn't even know the meaning of a word in the title then his book probably isn't the best source for intelligent information and analysis.I see though that two people gave this book five star reviews.

The author has done an excellent job of making this potentially dry topic, fun and enjoyable.I particularly enjoyed the chapters on etiquette as it relates to new technology such as; cell phones, call waiting, and e-mail.

Never in the history of the Christian world had there been a time when Christianity and the government were not one so Rev James O'Kelley had no model to follow, he and his fellow ministers had to make it all up as they went alone a fact they do not get enough credit for. These ministers were as important to the founding of the United States as were Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, and Adams because if not for these ministers many of the common people who filled the ranks and shouldered the muskets would not have done so against their King, God's divine representative on the earth.

I grew up listening to such inspiring artists. This is a group that was part of creating a genre that has endured for a long time.Hearing Rosie Rozell's rendition of \\"Oh What A Savior\\" gives you an idea of what a class Southern Gospel song is. A couple of Rusty Goodman's songs are in this collection, i.e., \\"I Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now,\\" and \\"Who Am I?\\". Another great Statesman tune in the set is \\"How Long Has it Been?\\". This is a great addition to anyone's audio library! It's among the best in the genre.The authenticity is captured in this CD. It transports you back to the stage days of Southern Gospels' great singers. The lyric and harmony are awe inspiring. No wonder so many reviewers give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book of trilogy but weak ending","review":"I agree with the other reviewers who have wondered where the ending is in this book. I give it 4 stars because I found it the best read of the three (Balshazzar and Melchoir were both tough hauls setting up the characters in their first halves) it really does feel like there's chapters, even a whole other book, missing at the end. I expected a 'To Be Continued' though I wouldn't really another book in this series.I'm a huge Chalker fan from early on in his writing but this one could have been a large single rather than a trilogy, even though the Three Kings obviously lend themselves to the trilogy format.Much as I admire Jack Chalker this trilogy is a weaker effort and probably only for fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Where's the rest of me\\"","review":"I used to like Jack Chalker's work and on the strength of his earlier books picked up this trilogy at my local library. The first two books were OK and he did generate some interest and tension in them but this last book was a big disappointment. This book should have been where he went for it and released all the tension he tried to generate in books one and two. Instead, he ran out of steam, lost interest in this project, copped out, take your pick. The big finish just dissolved into largely incomprehensible and unsatisfying mush and was about as interesting as limp, three week old celery in the crisper drawer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish it were about 100 pages longer","review":"This is the third in a trilogy which should be read in order. As always, Chalker develops the characters well. He also enlists a couple from the previous two books. I just got the feeling that about 3/4 of the way through, he decided to abridge the remainder of the novel that could have been. Arrival at the three kings is rushed, and all of the answers are spoon fed in the last chapter. It would have been better for me if it was drawn out, but then, now I have to wait for him to write his next book, as I have read all of Chalker's books. He is still my favorite Sci-Fi author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the ending ?","review":"I am a big Jack Chalker fan, but this series hung me out to dry. The first two books are innocuous enough \\"brain candy\\", but Kaspar's box seems like Jack grew tired of writing this series.

In the 70's when Denver was big, he sounded more country than most of the music at the time coming out of Nashville. Charlie Rich threw a fit at the CMAs, but wasn't ole Charlie just as non country as Dever was. \\"Back Home Again, Some Days are Diamonds, I'm Sorry, Thank God I'm A Country Boy\\" are all stone country songs that still to this day are looked down on.This collection is pretty good. As far as I am concerened, you could take any recording John Denver ever made and call it country. And also, any greatest hits or best of collection of John Denver is never complete. This is at least better than those cheesy packaged greatest hits cd's from the 70's and early 80's.This makes a great cd for your car, now collection wise, it is for novice's.

It would be better if this had contained more songs such as \\"Calypso\\", \\"Rocky mountain high\\" and \\"My sweet lady\\", though. Anyway, whenever I listen to this album, I can feel the spirit of John. Beautiful melodies and words... I can easily realize he lived a 'righteous life'. In particular, John is expressing his desire for the 'profound' truth for our lives in the song of \\"Looking for a space\\", which is one of my favorite.This is a must have CD for anyone who loves music and loves nature and \\"purity\\".

I love John Denver's voice and think his song writing is lyrical, poetic, and soothing. I am not a country music fan and think he was unfairly put in that category later in his career because that is where many \\"folk\\" singers had their music placed. When I received this cd on my birthday I cringed at the title as I HATE country music. But after listening, there is very little \\"country\\" music on it as we know. This cd contains the famous songs like Annie's Song and Thank God I'm a Country boy. But there are some gems I have never heard before such as Autograph and Fly Away and Looking For Space which also stand out.It's really ironic how John Denver died in a plane crash. So many of his songs are filled with the theme of flying.I highly recommend this cd for the non-country music lover who likes mellow music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Advanced Book About Metrology","review":"As an experimental physicist by education I picked up this book to brush up my measurement knowledge. I was really surprised to discover that this book is about metrology and not experimental physics measurements. In fact it was very educating for me to read about the many differences between those two closely related trades.Especially I liked the first chapter it has a philosophical depth. Most of it can be read like poetry: enjoying every day a few pages. The deep and thoughtful understanding of the author is stunning.The following chapters are of a strong varying quality: some trivial, some educational. The mathematics can be followed (or looked up) by people with a physics background. It is not always clear to me why at some points the details of the calculations are spelled out and at others not.This book is definitely not a textbook or an introduction to the field.

I lost the rather large shipping charge I had paid, of course, as that was not refundable by the seller and then also had to foot the bill to return it. The Tony-Tail company should be ashamed of making something so junky and poorly made. Must be designed and intended for pin heads, I guess.

It's easy to say in hindsight, that what we did was wrong but, on the other hand when your friends, family and city is raped and mutilated before your very eyes there is no easy solution.

The beautiful, emotional and haunting lyrics is what makes this album shine. Anggun tackles different issues, ranging from Feminism to heartbreak to answering criticism from her home country.\\"Cover\\" is one of Anggun's best songs to date, with deeply emotional lyrics and dramtic music make this song send chills up and down your spine. You can hear the hurt and dejection in her voice as she responds to her critics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of All","review":"I love Anggun so much, she is a adorable woman,her voice such an angel.Because I couldn't wait until the English version came out I bought the CD+DVD bonus at the amozon.fr and when I listened to all the songs, Gosh.... she was amazing,I LOVE THIS ALBUM,it's the best of all...............Even my friends bought the album right away when she saw Anggun on USA TV show ( I couldnt remember what it was)but overall, she is Hot, amazing Indonesian woman!

This watch fills the bill. The watch has a saphire crystal that is usually found on higher priced watches. I am very active with activities that are hard on any jewelry. After a couple of weeks hard use the watch is still like new with no nicks or scratches. A similar watch with a mineral glass scratch resistant crystal was returned after only 2 days of wear due to scratches on the crystal.The latch on the band is not as secure as I would like. It tends to come unlatched much too easily. I was able to make an adjustment that made the latch more secure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great John Stewart CD","review":"Great price for a great CD by the best folk singer/writer alive today.

The sound is crisp, and his voice has never sounded more alive. His performance was outstanding, if you ever thought about purchasing an Elvis album, buy this one today, you won't be disappointed. If you weren't a huge Elvis fan already, after you hear this, you will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Birthday Elvis Presley!","review":"I'm giving this cd 4 stars because the re-recored version of Blue Suede Shoes, Elvis Presley sing it fast and got in done in like 1 minute. But the first time Elvis Presley recored Blue Suede Shoes, he sang it for 2 minutes (about). All the songs was recored on Janurary 14th, while Elvis Presley was giving his Aloha From Hawaii concert.Aslo some of the songs are not in order when Elvis Presley sang them in the concert like Blue Hawaii, Ku-U-I-Po, No More, Hawaiian Wedding Song, Early Morning Rain and Can't Help Falling In Love (just to name a few)"},{"rating":"1","title":"NEW MIX","review":"I honestly don't know what CD you all are listening to because I can't believe you think this new remix is better than the original. You can't even hear the horns hardly on \\"Steamroller Blues\\" where on the original they were much clearer. Don't believe me? Send me a tape and I'll prove it! The only good thing about this new version is it is complete and unedited for the first time. The mix however is terrible. There is way too much bass. Even on some of the spoken parts Elvis sounds like he's in a barrell or something. The whole thing is slightly muffled throughout. I don't know how you can say it's crisp because it's not. One last thing. I'm not some old guy who's against everything but the originals. I just happen to know about audio. I know good audio and bad audio. This is BAD AUDIO!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired","review":"Got to agree with those who say Elvis sounds out of it and tired and those who say the sound quality is terrible - sounds like it (and he) have been to space and back. Still, if 'You gave me a mountain' doesn't make you cry, not much will. 'On Stage' album is a much better bet for potential investors, I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maine Lighthouse Map & Guide","review":"Informative Map & Guide ! Keep up the good work !

From Ali Jinnah to Bhutto to Zia to Benizer and Musharef Pakistan has hosted some very eccentric and interesting leaders. Ali Bhutto was in many ways the descendant of Jinnah. He was worldy, not a fundamentalist and most of all he became the guide for Pakistan's entering the modern world. Unfortunatly he was hung by one of his own generals, setting up the historical drama of his daughters return to power.A very neccesary read that fills the essential gap in Pakistans history, 1967-77."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Effective","review":"The most insightful advice in the book comes on the first page of Chapter 1 - \\"All decisions have three parts: 1) you identify your goals 2) you identify your options; and 3) you choose from among your options\\". The rest of the book goes downhill from there. Nothing much more is offered. The examples used tend to lack demonstration of insights into real-world effective decision-making, which is unexpected considering that he studied the decision-making process of Middle East leaders. The second half of the book I found to be tedious without much actual usefulness. Even the selling points, the 9 main steps to effective decision making, are redundant and can be reduced down to those 3 parts stated earlier. Very boring reading. You can throw out most of the chapters and it wouldn't make much of an impact on the overall book.

The sound quality is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sinatra's \\"Missing\\" Masterpiece--Remastered","review":"This fine CD of Sinatra's celebrated Seattle, Washington concert on June 9, 1957 is a reissue of a limited edition Jazz Hour CD briefly released in 1995, and sadly now long out of print. It is pricey, but well worth the money. The performance itself--featuring impeccable vocals, superb arrangements, and crisp playing from Capitol Records' top studio musicians, who were enlisted for the tour, is a highlight of Sinatra's career. The advantage of this newer release over the 1995 version is that the sound quality, which was always remarkable for its era, is now absolutely stunning. Ever a completist, I own them both--and I would wholeheartedly recommend either one. Since this gold CD is also a limited edition and has already been available for a couple of years, I'd suggest that you pick it up before it becomes as rare as its predecessor. Whether you are a Sinatra fanatic or a casual fan, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"The very best!!","review":"This is the very best 1812 CD you can get. It was recorded in 1958/1960, but used real cannons, live artillery and real church bells. There is also a wonderful commentary explaining how difficult it was to make this recording and how they picked up resonating sound from old metal drums in the woods, and marching sounds of military students at West Point. This is the one to get!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A close second best 1812!!","review":"Outside of an 1812 done by the Dallas Symphony Orchestra in 1996, this massively wonderful 1812 is the best I've heard. The biggest keys for me, are the rifles and cannon on loan from the US Military Academy at West Point, as well as the use of an actual carrilon!All it lacks is a bass-baritone chorus singing \\"God Save the Czar\\" at the end. Since the DSO had almost 40 yrs to think their version over, the magnificence of this version is all the more magnified!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CLASSICAL PERFORMANCE OF ALL TIME","review":"I am not saying that 1812 is the best piece of music ever, but so rarely is a performance so perfect and definitive that it just blows everything else away completely. I can't comprehend why anyone would buy another version: it will never get any better than this. Most conductors/orchestras try to lavish on big, long, blaring sounds in 1812 that end up sounding muddy and messy. Dorati has a perfect synthesis of bombastic power and military precision like none other. I could care less about the rest of this CD, but I would easily pay twice as much for that wonderful 15 minutes. BUY IT NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There Should Be a 6th Star","review":"After listening to many versions of the 1812 overature for over 40 years, this one by far in my opinion, is the most enjoyable. From the inspirational sounds of the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Carrillon to the punctuational blasts of the West Point bronze cannons, these must have been the sounds Tchaikovsky envisaged as wrote this inspiring masterpiece and is brought to life by Antal Dorati and the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra."},{"rating":"1","title":"high praise?","review":"i am completely at a loss for words as to why so many people say this is the best 1812 ever. my band director in high school played this for us as a demonstration on how brass players should not play. at no point does the brass sound good. they are constantly out of tune, out of balance, and out of character. the strings sound like they are using a branch instead of a bow.the canon and bells are extraordinary though. if all you are buying 1812 for is the canon shot, then by all means purchase this disc as it will not disapoint. the commentary is great too, discussing the selection of canon and bells.this CD is in extraordinary contrast to Dorati conducting Stravinsky. those recordings are fantastic and highly recommended. i would suggest purchasing any other version of 1812.0 stars for the performance. 2 stars for the commentary, canon, and bell work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent all around!!!","review":"Its no coincidence that at the same time just about the greatest Pics At An Exhib. was being recorded by RCA Living Stereo team..these guys knew what they were doing.For the moron below who didnt like Deems Taylor narrative: thats why they have skip buttons on most CD players and remotes...You are not forced to listen.

The primary problem that I have had is that the chisel holder tends to slip up the quill and that it takes a LOT of pressure to drill the holes. I eventually fixed part of the slipping problem by putting a hose clamp above the chisel holder on the quill, but then the holder started slipping over the ring that goes between the chisel holder and the quill. Finally, in an effort to tighten it enough, I broke the handle on the chisel holder. All in all I am fairly unhappy and quite disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong size","review":"The overall package seemed very good.

Since it is an inexpensive tool, with the more inexpensive chisels and bits included, I didn't expect it to be a precision tool, but it really does well. I have now used it to make mortises in red oak, white pine, and southern yellow pine, and am glad that I didn't spend more money than I did.

I ordered a box standard 12x24x1 furnace filters, 10 for around $32. When the filters arrived they were of equal or better quality then the Delta filters, HOWEVER, they are just slightly too large! Seems like Delta forces you to use their off-size filter, rather than an industry standard. I assume they see consumables as a high margin business.I suggest you consider another other brand air filter system, like Jet, and determine if they can use standard sized filters. If yes, DO NOT buy the Delta air filter system. In the longrun, you will save a ton of money if you can use a standard filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not receive the merchandise","review":"I ordered a book on the Shroud of Turin and my credit card was billed.

If I pause to check whether the grind is fine enough, the twist-locking lid becomes fouled with grounds and difficult to close without cleaning with a brush all over the counter. Pouring grounds into the maker is difficult without spilling, and so many grinds remain caked inside that I have to brush and pour in again, causing more mess. I spend much more time cleaning the grinder, counter, and our coffee maker (which does not come completely clean) than I can justify.

One day it went nuts and would not turn off without unplugging it.. so it became dangerous and I bought this Krups after all the positive reviews. I would give it two and a half stars if Amazon would let me because it grinds coffee beans really well but :-[1.] its grind collection area is hopeless compared to others..the lip simply does not come up high enough so when you open the top after grinding about four table spoons of beans...grind go everywhere. This is absurd and I am very disappointed at Krups for such a sloppy piece of industrial design.[2.] the entire lid and closure lock mechanism does not work well when it has some grinds in it. Poor design I am afraid.I'll try to keep using it but it looks like it bound for Goodwill and I will get a Bodum Bistro Grinder.I will say that if you grind small amounts then this is a great (4 star) grinder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"Used this product for a month now.

It matches my other kitchen products and works satisfactorily. The grinding bowl is a bit larger than my old Krups so I need to take a bit more time to get the fine grind I prefer. It's a little tricky to use until you get used to the safety feature on the lid. Once you figure out how to turn it and keep everything in alignment it's best to use the grinder by pulsing the grinder off then on, off then on. It keeps the coffee from getting warm and ruining the flavor. I even invert the grinder to redistribute the grinds then grind them a bit more."},{"rating":"1","title":"EVERY single one I bought had to be returned!","review":"I think AMAZON has refurbished products because both the original purchase and the replacement were broken!

It doesn't. Uneven grinding, not catching some of the spices that sit on the bottom, and others spray to the top of the cover where the blades cannot reach, and if you have to use it for longer periods of time it heats up and blanches the flavor out of the spices. The plastic top has cracked and pieces broken off so many times (but continues to partially snap into place) that the spices spray everywhere when used.I do not use this for coffee grinding, therefor I cannot give a review as to it's performance for which it is originally intended. This is only for those who do a lot of spice grinding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"This Krups grinder is pleasing to use, with a fairly heavy feel to it and a smooth yet quiet grind.

The lid is difficult to twist shut. Static electricity builds up in both the bowl and the lid, making it hard to get the coffee into the filter holder without scraping.

In all fairness, it is pretty, and it does grind the coffee. However, you can't get the coffee out of it without making a mess. The lid is too short to hold a batch of ground coffee by turning it upside down.

The plastic cover also somewhat awkard to get on and off.I would not recommend this grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST OK","review":"My goal for this purchase was not to grind coffee beans, but instead to use it to grind flax seed. It does its job very well, but it's very cumbersome to empty out the ground seeds. Instead of taking out the section where the grinding takes place, you must turn the entire item over and shake and shake. The second thing you must do is to find a utensil (a small spoon is a must!) which helps with the first process. And forget about washing! The instructions tell you just to \\"use a damp cloth.\\" In short, it's a very disappointing purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't workl for Coffee....","review":"This is intended to be a coffee grinder however when griding coffee it grinds half superfine and the other half only gets cut in half. It also creates some form of static suction so when you remove the lid it sends the superfine particles everywhere. You then turn the main base upside down to dump it into the coffee maker however the static once again gets in the way, this time preventing the cup from fully emptying into the coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied with this product","review":"It grinds just fine, but when I take the lid off to pour my coffee into the filter, an overwhelming static build up sends the dry coffee grinds flying all over my counter, my hands, the floor and about anywhere else other than the filter into which I am attempting to pour them.

Lawrence for a long time along with other books directly related to him.I have always loved the best of poetry in all of it's forms from all around the world in all different periods of time.I have become a very good poet myself addressing a great many aspects of life resulting from a rather unusual compressed life experience.I really like this book and will keep it with all the others in my library and eventually pass it on to the next generation.This book is timeless in nature as the best of this genre always are."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best surprise is how great it sounds","review":"I'd never heard of Lilith Records--and I knew that Joe Jackson's official web site lists this album as unavailable. When I researched the label (out of Holland), it seemed credible, so I placed the order...I couldn't be more pleased. Though I can't translate a word of it, the liner notes are likely placing this lost soundtrack at the top of Joe Jackson's list. It is a terrific album. And it sounds fantastic here. Bright, clear and warm. The mastering is superb. It's everything I hoped it would be. And well worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"ahead of his time","review":"The breadth of Joe Jackson's talent, with the multifaceted intricacies that ensconce this difficult to classify CD make it an entrancing must have.

There is a LOT of memorization involved with the list of sight words. However, there are a great number of other important reading tools. Further, Nanci Bell is a recognized expert in visual imagery and the importance of this skill to reading.

They play vintage instruments, ancient numbers, or one's Norman wrote that just sound ancient. I have a numerous discs by Norman and Nancy and this is my favorite.

A little goes a long way (i mix up some of the crystals (a tsp) in a cup with warm water & pour in on the accident after i've soaked up the majority of the initial accident - then let it sit for several minutes & soak it up - it doesn't stain). i use it after accidents on the carpet & to clean out their kennels. it definitely gets the smell out & makes it that even my 2 beagles with their excellent noses can't smell the scent on the carpet (so they don't keep marking their territory!). It's much cheaper than the popular Natures Miracle & easier to store.

His phrasing and tune were unique. Antal Dorati contributed with his immense talent and musicality to lead this version tho the glorious Pantheon of the unequal performance of this work.The Mendelssohn sounds OK but there are other superior versions. Szigetti, Stern, Heifetz, Gitlis and Rosand are the best exponents of this concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music; great violin playing","review":"Though Henryk Szeryng never achieved the fame accorded to many other 20th century violinists, he was equal or superior to them all in technical ability and unsurpassed in artistry. All of the performances on this CD are outstanding. If I'm not mistaken, Szeryng's recording of the Schumann concerto was the first ever made, as this concerto was unavailable for decades and only rediscovered in the 20th century. It still equals or surpasses any performance of this concerto subsequently recorded.The four star rating refers to the uneven quality of some of the compositions; Szeryng's performances definitely rate five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy at all","review":"[...]I was suckered by the digital publication date (2005) which appeared next to the link for this document as well as in the body of the document detail, ESPECIALLY in the product details section. It made me angry to realize that the actual publication date was 1993. This was noted, not very obviously, in the citation details. I don't like the implied deception and will not buy one of these articles again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super soul","review":"Cooke, often acknowledged as the definitive soul singer, gets some of his catalog back on CD with this generous single-disc collection. This piece is packed with his Keen and RCA hits up to 1964 but having had 31 charted pop singles up to that point, by necessity some of the lower-charting sides are not here. The major disappointment though, is the lack of any of Cooke's material after 1963. Unfortunately, his catalog for that post-1963 material was in the hands of ABKCO music that, at the time of this production, stubbornly refused to license anything to anyone else.Nevertheless, for as far as it can go, this is an excellent compilation of this magnificent soul singer's recordings. The mastering has been vastly improved over past attempts at this material with many of the tracks in true stereo, the remainder (1-3,5,8) in mono. By far, this represents the best single-disc presentation of this soul icon's musical career to come along so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"Very good price with a great selection of songs.

Neither was it included in the previous \\"Best Of\\" cd (as I discovered belatedly), or in any other Cooke collection, domestic or import (despite track listings at other web sites which erroneously include the song). This would be less annoying were that particular greatest hit (sic transit gloria the english language) available SOMEWHERE... An enterprising compiler could include it on \\"Out-of-print's Greatest Hits\\"? But then it wouldn't be out-of-print any more. . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone too soon!","review":"Love this album.

Best fifteen bucks I ever spent.You can still pick it up used here or on ebay, but you'll pay for the priviledge, but its still well worth the money. Pass this by and get the real deal.
