Thinking that this book would contain valuable information from one of the industry founders I was excited to purchase. From the start the author says he has a love for Garrett detectors and the book is meant to advise and help in genera and not push one brand of detectors. However throughout the book the Garrett detectors are pushed and referenced as the best choice. There is little reference made to any other brand and the book gets very specific as to utilizing Garrett devices. I found the book to be little value as I had not yet purchased a metal detector and really wanted to learn in general about the hobby from one of the greats... While there is some good information concerning general metal detecting I found the majority of the book giving praise to Mr. Garrett and really just a long sales brochure for Garrett detectors.

Rather, it is a tendentious polemic; a synopsis of Keel's own peculiar brand of existentialism and nihilism.What to make of an \\"investigator\\" whose theories regarding strange phenomena are far weirder than the happenings themselves? What to make of this self-annointed pedant who sneers at established belief systems, the most elementary tenets of which he can't even grasp? On page 209, for example, Keel writes: \\"According to tradition, an angel named Gabriel impregnated Mary.\\" Indeed? And what tradition might that be? Keel's ignorant (or is it deliberate?) blasphemy regarding the Annunciation is mind-boggling. As for the rest of the book, it's merely mind-numbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"?Habla en cubano?

Perhaps that is because the arguments in favor of spanking are so shallow: parents should be able to do as they please with their kids, or the Bible says it's OK. Hyman's evidence against spanking is admittedly mostly anecdotal. That's because there is very little else out there. He banks heavily on the common-sense and proven principle that if parents want their kids to treat others well, then parents should treat others well. If a parent tells his kid not to hit others, then hits (spanks) his kid, what is the child to think? To Hyman, and to even the most casual observer of human nature, actions are louder than words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Christian book","review":"Found this book on a Christian website, but it turns out it really isn't.The author connects spanking in childhood to sexual pleasure in adulthood.

I am outraged at this guy, who obviously never even CONSIDERED, the slightest POSSIBILITY that the other side might be right. I hope he knows what he's doing: his kids, and kids that he knew, that he said not to discipline, and that he didn't discipline, may become the adults who shrug and either throw him into the nursing home or go the path of enuthasia.

It gives detailed research results on American/Japanese families living in Japan regarding their children's language acquisition. See the book for details, but did you know that most children growing up in this situation do not become active bilinguals? I was shocked!

However, if you are looking for an author that can actually write suspense novels, I suggest you get into Joan Lowery Nixon, Diane Hoh, or A.Bates. Believe me people, this book is an absolute flop.

In this case, Rob Sheppard's discussion of Camera Raw is totally oriented around getting good photos, period. His author voice is plain and straightforward, yet seems uncannily targeted on the questions that he seems to know you have. I guess that's because these are all issues that he has had to address himself in his own journey into Raw. There's a gem on nearly every page in this book. Great images, too.

There are hundreds of long known ideas like \\"acquaire technology\\" or \\"be open to future possibilities\\". But not the word about the Amazon phenomenon.And what about Amazon? Nothing. The author who even didn't talk to the founder of Amazon? Impossible? Yes, it is possible in this book. So, if you want to know something about Amazon go somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: BORING","review":"This book was dry, and completely empty.

WASTE of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your money","review":"I was very disappointed to read the book. In fact I kept it down after the first chapter. Thankfully I had borowwed it from the library and not bought it. Please save your money for something else. Or give it away to the Salvation army. At least some good might come out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial, repetitive & little new to say","review":"The story of Amazon is fascinating and one we all want to know more about. However you won't find much here. This is the quick and cheap approach to publishing. It is superficial, continually repeats itself, has poor analysis & offers nothing new at all.There is no evidence that the author spoke to anybody who works at Amazon and certainly not Bezos. Reads like she sat down with a pile of press cuttings and bashed out a quick book, knowing the subject matter would sell it. Avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great at all. Too high-level. Too repetitive.","review":"I think that Saunders could have done nature(and the readers) a lot of good by limiting the book to about 10 pages (instead of 200). Reading this book is frustrating because you feel like you are reading the same points over and over and over again. And she never goes into any depth on anything. Either Amazon didn't want to share anything with her or she got lazy with her research."},{"rating":"1","title":"How much money came out of the pockets of Amazon Executives?","review":"It seems like more and more these days books are being written by horrible authors that companies could pick up off the streets and have them write a book entirely about their company, but hide it as being a guide to successful e-commerce. If your looking at e-commerce, you don't just focus on one \\"semi-successful business\\", you focus on the many different e-commerce companies out there and you compare and contrast at their success. This book skims the surface on Amazon...but you are looking for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly well-written, informative and empowering book","review":"I loved it. The book is very thorough and chock full of information on how I can take Mr. Beto's 10 leadership charachteristics and apply them to my own life. The repetative parts of the book are necessary to install the belief that these characteristics can be used by anyone. I know Amazon's story isn't over yet, and I look forward to reading the sequal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very basic work","review":"Very basic book on doing business via the web. This should have been released a generation ago when Amazon.com itself was finding its way. The new enterpreneur exploring online business is more knowledgeble than the informaiton and insight provided here and hence can disappoint reading it. It may be suitable for those who are hearing the name of e-business and trying to set up the business online for the first time in their country to know what happend when Jeff Bezos tried doing so for the first time in the history. Certainly this book is not for those who already heard about e-business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written.","review":"Rebbeca's bs. no contents. how can a person write a book this boring?

And to find out before Chapter ONE she hadn't even spoken with the FOUNDER himself truely disgusted me. The book was EXTREMELY reptitive and didn't offer any new information to those that are following the company. I thought the title was misleading and the little information given prior to purchase was as well. Guess for what some would like to learn we will have to wait until someone can speak to the maker of the site that changed E-commerce with innovation, commitment and creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Business the Amazon.com Way","review":"Having read it, I wonder if I could have my money back!

Any chance?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a high school report drawn from news clippings","review":"Come on. I wasn't going to review this book until I saw it was getting some good reviews. It's a dry dissemination of information. It provides no new insight and captures none of the high-pressure excitement of on-line competition. Save your money and do a search on any internet news magazine for \\"Amazon\\" or \\"Bezos\\" and you'll get the same info."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New Here!","review":"Unfortunately you'll not get any astounding insight into how and why Amazon.Com has reached the level of success it has...or why selling on the web has \\"brick and mortar\\" retailers quaking in their boots from reading this book.

Excellent descriptions of Venice...memorable characters...thoughtful insights into human qualities of honor, honesty, corruption and arrogance. My only criticism is that the ending is tepid and all issues are not fully resolved, in my opinion. Leon is very uneven as a writer. When she's off, she's terrible. When she's on, she's magnificent. In this book she comes off very close to the latter. I would say this is one of her better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little action","review":"The storyline moved along so slowly that I almost put the book down. There isn't a mystery or body until more than 1/3 into the book. By then, I almost didn't care! It is mostly a character study of the main character, but isn't very engrossing.

If you do remember... you were warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a good portrayal of North Dakota people, but a good movie!!","review":"I liked this movie, it was funny and had a good plot.

I really don't have much else to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"a simple sketch","review":"As an artist I see this movie as a simple sketch. A movie with undeveloped characters and script. The photography and color is beautiful and especially accurate of the western USA on the positive side. This movie appears to have taken snips of ideas from more sucessful movies, such as \\"Secondhand Lions.\\" This could have been, as so many movies, a good movie because the actors and acting are top rate, but they didn't have much to work with. Wait until the price comes down. (If you think this is an inadequate review, you will now understand how this movie will make you feel.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great set of small screwdrivers","review":"These are great because the tips are very strong and the handles let you get decent leverage. It's really a drag when you have a small scre that's been over-tightened and you need to get it out, but your mini screwdriver has a thin, smooth plastic handle and a worn-out tip. That is not a problem with these, I love them.I have owned many sets of Klein, Craftsman, Craftsman Pro, and Snap-On screwdrivers over the years, but I always come back to the Kleins. The tips are incredibly durable, the handles are great and they seem to have all the right sizes.The standard Craftsman sets have terrible tips that wear out in no time. Sure I can get a new one free, but who wants to deal with that? The handles on the Craftsman pro models always seem to leave a tacky film on my hands. And the Snap-on ones are good, but what I consider to be the same quality as Klein for considerably more money.These really are the best of all worlds."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must Have\\" reference on the Paranormal","review":"This volume of over 400 pages contains entries on hundreds of paranormal topics from 'afterlife' to 'zombie'.

This one is chock-full of useful info, which is great for gamers (like me and my friends). The backstory and descriptions of the ghosts and ghostlike creatures is great. My only complaint is that the writing is pretty dry. It reads more like a college thesis than a book written for the public.

They should last for years to come - $75 down the drain."},{"rating":"1","title":"This brand of Eastland shoes","review":"I hated these shoes! I was very excited when they arrived because I thought they'd be like my others of the same type. But they were patten leather, no real leather look. Also, the size I had before which fit perfectly was now way too small."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep as a reflecting pool","review":"This film is like a reflecting pool. It looks deep and dark, but it turns out to be about three inches deep.The stunning look of the film belies its shallowness. The deep shadows and brilliant highlights make the case that more movies should be made in black and white. The concepts could have been interesting to explore, but the wooden acting and stilted dialog made it painful to watch, pain which was relieved only when ogling Ms Masterson and Ms Kipleigh.All in all it seemed to me to be a case of a screenwriter/director writing a first draft, then filming it. With a little bit of polish applied to the storyline and script, this film could have been really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"what","review":"I'm not sure where to start just like the movie doesn't know where to start.

Chase Masterson is great, and the film is gripping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate Slanted Content","review":"Oh, I suppose this book could keep some folks married, but only by requiring some women to submit to pretty much any abuse. For example, under a section headed \\"The Difficulty of an Innocent Party\\":1. If the wife has strayed, the man has this call to action: \\"God holds him responsible to cleanse his wife from all impurity by the Word\\". Yeah, straighten out, lady.2. However, if the husband has strayed, the wife is reminded that she must follow Scripture or \\"rejects the ministry and rewards of suffering for righteousness' sake, which God calls every Christian to accept\\". Note that the authors don't see the need to remind the husband of this. So, tough it out lady - God commands that you suffer at the hands of an abusive spouse (?!).The book is replete with this degrading slant - degrading to both partners in a marriage.LilyBelle & David"},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKY","review":"This is like the worse I have ever heard of The Joykiller.

You can tell that she really still loves him but because of some misunderstanding and heartaches she leaves him. Of course the hero was bidding his time waiting for her and gives her conditions on him helping her out again. The relationship is shakey and you can tell that they were on eggshells around each other. The end pays off big time though.

So I purchased two for my labrador's. The package arrives very timely and I open up the box and stated on the package \\"16 ft retractable leash for dogs up to 26 lbs\\". Needless to say this is not what I ordered nor need for my labs.

While I was walking my 10lb Yorkie, the leash broke, snapped clear off near the base of the hook. Anyone who owns a Yorkie knows how fast they are, and as soon as the leash broke she took off causing me and my husband to chase her all over the neighborhood. I relied on this product to protect my dog, and it failed miserably. Fortunately, we caught her before anything serious happened but it was a very terrifying 5 minutes. When I attempted to contact the company regarding the situation, they never got back to me proving that their products and customer service is far from reputable.

Even though it is for 26lb dogs, you really wonder whether this will hold the tension that a hyper dog can have on when they \\"bolt\\". The Collar Snap: this is plastic.

We previously purchased the smaller, shorter version that does not include the nylon strap, but where the cord extends all the way to the clasp. It may sound silly, but this design is far easier for our dogs than the other.Our dogs enjoy the freedom to roam around while we walk, and the locking mechanism is easy to use, keeping them out of trouble (for the most part).There are occasions where I would like a leash that is a bit longer, but 16 feet is about the perfect length, at least for our dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best resource available","review":"Marjorie's writing style is incredibly engaging for a novice just getting started on a spiritual journey.

All of them have strengths which deepens our appreciation of spirituality. Spirituality, however, is to be lived and practiced in the lives of believers. Thus these books fall short in emphasizing spiritual practice. Soul Feast corrects this by inviting the reader to enter the spiritual through the practice of the spiritual disciplines. It is through these disciplines that we can live out a spiritual life. This is a balanced text which thouroughly integrates theory and practice with a greater emphasis on the latter. Protestants, whose background doesn't include the spiritual discipline will be greatful in rediscovering them. Spiritual direction and hospitality are just a few of them discussed in this valuable work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the average reader","review":"While this book was read for a discussion group and did elicit some group discussion, it was a difficult read for many including myself as leader. At times, it felt as though it were written for those seeking to spend time in lengthy spiritual retreat--perhaps in a monastery or convent. Some sections and ideas put forth could easily be applicable to the common lay person seeking a deeper faith relationship with God but there were so many instructions for following the disciplines that it seemed overwhelming and impossible to accomplish. Probably a great read for divinity students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pity about the soprano","review":"This was performed at Rome in January 2005 as a benefit concert. Being touched by the fact that the sale of the DVD proceeds to the victims of the tsunami in December 2004, I didn't hesitate to purchase it, Verdi's Requiem also being my favourite choral work. Under Mehta's baton, the Coro della Fondazione Arturo Toscanini and the Orchestra Filarmonica Arturo Toscanini perform passionately throughout. D'Intino (mezzo), Vargas (tenor) and Siwek (bass) are in really fine voice, but the wobbly decibels of Cedolins (soprano) spoil the whole performance, not to mention her inability to sustain even the shortest of phrases, as well as poor projection (she sings with a half-open mouth).

This album has almost nothing new to offer, considering the quality tracks are only 30 seconds long. That includes \\"Tender Love,\\" \\"Every Little Step,\\" and other potentially great songs. This album was recorded in Chattanooga, Tennessee. It seems as if Usher stalls album time by yelling \\"Ladies!\\" over and over, to fill in time. The overall instrument arrangements and production is incredible, and the vocal talent flows out of Usher more than ever, but the songs are simply too short. The upbeat songs on this album are all flattened by under par rap performances by Usher himself, that were originally recorded by Jermaine Dupri and other rap stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"too soon for a live album and a okay vocalist","review":"you used to have at least release a few records or have been around for a while to put out a live album.the problem with this disc is that Usher is mainly a studio artist.Live he is flat&boring.the songs aren't as good or interesting.overall he comes off like a 2nd tier Bobby Brown clone.and these days that ain't good."},{"rating":"1","title":"USHER HAS DONE BETTER","review":"I LOVE R&B AND RAP.

Bobby Brown did Roni (written by Baby Face in 1988; this is a lackadasical version). Tender Love, Every Little Step, Don't be cruel, etc... are all remakes. If you search some of these songs on the internet, Usher even gets credit for them. It's almost like he did this CD to make money only. He seems to be going through the motions on this CD and doesn't have that great energy he usually shows. It's almost as disappointing as having 3-4 versions of one song (Part 1, Part 2, etc...) and calling each part a song (he does this now). I've seen him live and this CD sucks compared to what he can do. Very disappointing. It was released in 1999 when people forget he wasn't exactly burning up the charts all of the time; which may attribute to the remakes and his lack of energy.

Jeanie Duck has done, and done it beautifully. If you are undergoing change at your workplace I can't recommend this book more strongly. I've already given it to several people I've worked with who have come back to tell me how helpful and meaningful they found it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long on Stories, Short on Content","review":"As an internal consultant to a Fortune 500, part of my job is to assist with change management efforts. Thus, I was excited to see this new title on such a pertinent element of the change process. My anticipation was quickly replaced with disappointment as the book is long on stories but short on content. Aside from expanding Lewin's change model with before and after processes, the author does little to guide the reader in understanding the dynamics of change. Her tactics for dealing with change are so covered in war-stories that they are difficult to find. In all, a disappointment for both the experienced and novice reader of change management processes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Change Monster: The Human Forces....","review":"While this book is a \\"must read\\" for midlevel managers and up it is a gift to the rest of us. For change touches everyone in the business whether we like it or not. Ms. Duck is very clear about this and the steps it takes to be successful. She pares away the jargon, excuses and finger pointing this subject engenders and leaves us with an understandable and inspiring map of the territory. I don't know about you but I like to know where I am at all times and that includes work. With this map I can gauge what is happening there and know whether to stick with my current job or update my resume. In fact, I'm sending a copy to my CEO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Elevator music for the bluegrass-challenged","review":"Unbelievably bad. The solos are repetitive, the arrangements banal.

Optically very sharp over most of its range. Auto focus is very fast, (on Sony A55), and accurate. Color is nice, no noticeable distortion on APS camera.Not an issue with the lens itself but I'm finding I want more range on the short end when used on an APS camera.Lens is very quite when zooming, useful in movie mode where I find I can zoom and not pick up the sound over the built in mic's of the camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"So familiar it fits like an old shoe","review":"To begin with, I will like to point out that some of the songs in this album sound like children's music. Most of the lyrics lack the strong political commentary that appealed to many. Secondly, the use of melodies from his past album makes you feel like he chooses to recycle something that was worth gold over coming up with something new. This said, my favorite song of this album is \\"Hommes\\" which shares the melody with \\"King of Bongo\\". I think, however that the new lyrics are so good and new that it makes me forget of melodies of past albums. It is like listening to the melodies for the first time. I really enjoyed this CD. Songs like Mr. Bobby and Me Gustas Tu have enough of what it takes to make them extraordinary pieces of music which provoke in your soul what good pieces of music are supposed to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Sadly this is not a good album. I was looking forward to it after listening to \\"Clandestino\\". Some of the songs are good, but it's far from the quality of his previous work. Also, he remixes some of his old songs and calls them something else in this album, that really kills the mood. I want to listen to new songs not remakes of the same old songs. The other thing that got to my nerves, was the quantity of sound clips from TV and Radio added to the songs, that's old too. He tried it in Clandestino and it somehow blended well with the album but in this album it seems annoying. I'm very disappointed; this album could have been great, yet it's far from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Happy Vibes","review":"I first picked up this album after I saw Manu in concert in northern Italy. I have to say, it is one of the more heavily listened to albums in my collection. Having not known anything about him before I saw him, this album was an absolute delight. The only thing I can really compare it to is the European version of the band 'Sublime', except with more Latin/Mariachi influence.

Be cautioned though - if you buy it you will probably feel an irresistible urge to move to the Spanish coast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viva la mania de Manu Chao!","review":"I have almost completely forsaken pop-music (as a cloying, bubble-gum toy of happy teens, its greatest value is the indication of \\"our\\" collective mindset), but Manu Chao revives the concept.

For the lady below, Manu's native languages include Spanish and French, and who said everybody has to speak English like a californian WASP?btw, the other language he sings in (Dinia)is not \\"some Caribbeanlanguage\\", it's Arabic and he sings about the Algerian tragedy, folks (hope you don't need to look up Algeria)."},{"rating":"1","title":"New material or rejects?","review":"What a disappointment after the first great album but I have to believe this a record company hoodwink.

It performs this function perfectly. Its light weight and convenient recessed \\"handle\\" allow it to be moved effortlessly from room to room, so it follows us from kitchen to living room in the morning. It is quiet and effective up to several feet away, the oscillating feature letting it cover a wide area. The lighted control panel is bright enough to be seen from several feet away, then goes dark in a few seconds after making a setting change with the remote control, so it's not shining all the time. Our condo is quite modern in design and furnishings, so the design of this heater fits right in. Also doesn't take up much floor space."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice heater!","review":"I bought this heater and have had it for about a month now. It is really good, pretty quiet! I have a fairly cold drafty room so this heater works well. I love the remote feature! It is helpful if I don't want to get out of bed on a cold night. And, Yes, like other people have mentioned about the really bright backlight issue, I see it too, but it isn't too bad! It is rather quiet and the oscilatting movement spreads the heat around. I hear a lot of clicking noises when it initially heats up but I think that it maybe due to the plastic heating up and therefore expanding!Overall, A good buy....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"I use this under my desk to keep me warm in the office. Only problem is that to program it or change settings, I need to pull it out from under desk as the controls are underneath a flip top on the top of the heater. Very quiet!

We contacted SPT the next day and they told us the unit was out of warranty but a technician would contact us to see if a part could be replaced.

Sadly, it stopped working on the 28th exactly, I just didn't have the time to check on this until today. $87 down the potty."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it.","review":"I returned it due to the low-fan speed not working, the fan was always on high speed, even when in low-heat mode. But, I also noticed, when in auto mode, when it came close to the set temp it would switch from high heat to low heat (I noticed by feeling the heat with my hands, as my unit's fan was stuck on high all the time), but it wouldn't cycle off because it didn't reach it's set temp yet, but this made it run alot longer to reach the set temp. If it just stayed in high heat mode until it reaches the set temp then it would cycle off sooner. So, I didn't like the way it worked - plus when it's real cold out, it may never be able to reach the set temp since it goes into low heat mode when it gets close. I think this is a design flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"I purchased the heater for the basement and it works better than I expected. I never thought that it would heat the whole basement but it does. I love it! It has a thermostat that keeps the room at exactly the temp I want.

I am definitely getting another one for upstairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Heater","review":"I like this heater. It heats up my large playroom/office pretty good. The only thing I would change is the blower. It doesn't blow heat very forcefully. You practically have to put your hand right in front of it to feel the heat come out. I guess I was expecting something along the lines of the heater in my SUV, where you can feel it from the back seat. All in all though it's a pretty good heater. I DO like the fact that I can use it all year round - for heat AND air. So I feel like I'm getting my moneys worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"I have found that the electric fan-heaters in general are a weak option for heating needs even in the temperate climate of the Bay Area California. This model in particular has struggled to do any good for me. The oscillation moves much too slow and the fan is just not powerful enough to blow whatever heat the ceramic may create. It is really only useful in a very small room (say a bathroom or equivalent) when you do not want to heat the WHOLE house. However, it may still take around two or more hours to get a room from 50 to 60 degrees. I would recommend using a parabolic or a more powerful fan model if you are not scared of the increased electric bill that ANY of these little heaters will generate."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke after one winter","review":"I bought it from All American and it stopped working after one winter.I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this heater."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD","review":"I purchased this heater for my daugther's new place in Santa Monica California where is very cold this time of year.

Trouble was, one unit was defective immediately - the master switch didn't work. I fixed it myself, because it was less hassle than sending it back, but the second unit has now started squeaking (a defective bearing) loudly. The unit heats up like I expect, but every time I hit the 'off' switch it resets itself so I have to re-enter the temperature when I turn it back on. The ionizer...? I have no idea if it's working or not... maybe it's ionizing a small area around the unit? Bottom line, these heaters are a big disappointment.

I have a large room to heat, with 10 ft ceilings (about 230 sq ft) and although it takes about 30 mins, it heats the room up from 63 to 70 degrees. I love the ocillating feature and I love LOVE the remote. It really helps to be in bed and not have to leave the warmth of my comforter to turn it on. Its easy to move around, light weight, and does not get hot on the outside, despite the instruction manual saying that it does. My only complaint, which is probably something I should have realized when I bought it, is that the heat it produces is a very dry heat, and I have had to get out my humidifyer to balance the dry air output. Otherwise, my cat and I are very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it for 8 hours until it broke.","review":"Setup was very easy and we liked the versatility of being able to use this as a heater or fan, depending on season.

Same story the next night except at some point after we went to bed it made a loud beep and the screen lit up with a bunch of nonsense.

I figured this was damaged or defective and requested an exchange. Amazon was extremely quick about this as I literally received the replacement a day later. Sadly, the second one did the very same thing. Neither of the two generated anything close to a noticeable amount of heat. The ironic part is that my $20 heater that I use at the office works 100X better than this. The only A+ goes to Amazon's awesome service, the product however is awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, convenient size, warms the room well","review":"This is an excellent heater -- it warms up my home office extremely quickly and keeps a consistent temperature when set to automatic.

All in all, couldn't be happier!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SPT Stealing Peoples Trust","review":"I would have rated this less than a full star if able. After just two weeks of operation the product ceased to operate. When we contacted Amazon they informed us that we needed to contact the manufacturer of the product. SPT has not replied to any one of the several e-mails that we have sent regarding this issue. So thanks to SPT there is another useless item going to the recyclers all at my expense. Save your money and time DO NOT BUY THIS HEATER. Or any other product manufactered from this company. Next time I'll use paypal to purchase a product. They have purchase protection that can't be beat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk or just one bad egg of the bunch? You Decide.","review":"I was happy to read how many people like this heater. What worries me now is that some folks just do not care about workmanship or are not telling it like it is. This is not a quality product. The look and feel of it is like a cheap knockoff being sold at a second rate version of Sharper Image (RIP). It had scratches all over it, the shell was made of low grade plastic with a sharper image, ooooh styling. The fan was noisy upon powering up and the plastic cover on top was defective, so the plastic hinge broke off. I have seen better made toys from the PRC than this thing. I am wary of you folks who gave such a good review for a piece of plastic like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"A very nice product at an awesome price.

The tip-over auto turnoff is a little sensitive. This heater warms up my entire studio apartment and is whisper quiet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great area heater","review":"I really love this heater. It is so quiet you'd hardly know its on. Its easy to figure out even without instructions. It takes a while to warm up a living room , but if it is ocilating on you it feels great.

I really like the overall format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to Put Down","review":"I am a psychologist with a tremendous interest in energy medicine and intuitive phenomena. I have read countless books in those areas and I regard Christel Nani's book as a standout. It reads simply, and yet it revealed insights I either had never seen before or which were written in a way that made those insights jump out at me. I also appreciate the author's tone. It was very much in sync with the book's content. In other words, she came across as genuine and sincere not only because of what she said but because of the way she said it. Based on the quality of this book I chose to order her CD and her other book. I have read many of Carolyn Myss's books which carry a similar theme. While the authors speak the same language, I believe devoted readers of Myss will gain something from Christel Nani's book. I'm glad I found it. I hope Christel will offer workshops on the east coast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diary of a Medical Intuitive","review":"We couldn't put this book down!

I knew there was a higher power, but believed I had lost the ability to relate or be helped thereby. Christel's book changed this for me. I learned that it is possible to trust in God without having to have Him filtered through the narrow mindedness of many organized religions.My life and my outlook on life have changed immensely for the better. Using Christel's teachings I am able to live in the present, not dwell on the past or worry about the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sets Big Band Writing On Its Ear","review":"Bob Moses really is one of music's hidden gems, not only is he a brilliant, creative drummer, but also a very original composer/arranger. Combining equal measures of Gil Evan's vast sonic palette, variety of genres at the drop of a hat, off-center humor, deep musicianship and a willingness to take all kinds of risks, Bob created a masterpiece that has never been duplicated or rivaled in any manner. The impressive cast of musicians and vocalists sure doesn't hurt, beautiful recording/production too.

I bought this album the day it came out, and at first it sounded good. But after 2 or 3 listens, the songs all started to blend together. I love the energy and musicianship, but the songs mostly sound the same. The choruses all end up with the singer half chanting/half singing the name of the song ie: Fight till you die!!, Your on a date with destiny!!, Society!!.....you get the point! If you listen to each song individually, there is some quality there, but put back to back on one album, they all run together. Needless to say, this was the last PW album I bought, and from what I have heard they didn't get any better. Still a big fan of the genre, but this album is low on my list of good punk albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fight til you die!","review":"Awesome straight forward punk rock, from the boys in Pennywise.

But even if you didnt pay attention to their lyrics, it all still sounds like gold in your ear, Raw, Fast, Perfect pretty much. Pennywise delivers the goods of true punk, the attitude, the sound, the messege. Buy this cd Full circle! Also the last song is deticated to one of the members who died. Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pennywise- Another Great Album","review":"This album is their best yet, and perhaps the greatest and most upbeat cd ever.

To me, Pennywise is making bad punk! If you liked Pennywise's other CD's, you should buy this one, too. If you like ska or punk, you should rather buy a real big fish, less than jake, hippos or even a nofx CD. This at least is my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"It was horrible!

Their emotions are expressed perfectly in the hidden track of piano playing.The album is a roller-coaster of emotions. From the fast-paced 'Final Day' to the deep and emotional 'Bro Hymn Tribute'.Songs that stand out in this album are 'Society', 'Final Day', 'Nowhere Fast' and 'Bro Hymn Tribute'.This album is a must for all Pennywise fans. The music is not the best they have produced ie. About Time. However, you will not find a Pennywise album to match it's feeling, drive and passion. This album holds a message to all. Let's listen.Adam"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brotherhood's a rule we cannot bend","review":"Full Circle is the perfect title for this Hermosa Beach band. Their debut album was raw and unaffected by commercial markets like About Time was. The band has come full circle after the death of their former bass player and if they decided to never record again, it would be understood. Track's 3 and se7en can be found on the bodyboard video 247 A Joint Venture and while Pennywise is used is almost every surf vid out there, this tape gives the band props.

However, having said that, Emma does have a lovely voice and you hear it most often in her upper registers. The arrangements for the most part sound like they could be from a movie soundtrack at the dramatic conclusion of the film. Emma says she's not an opera singer but I would like to hear her perform one or two Puccini arias. Overall, this is good stuff, but you have to be in the right mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite albums of all time","review":"I purchased this album on the best day of my life, while in Paris! Emma is an increadable talent and this album showcases her to the best of her vocal abalities. Opera not really your thing? Try the Opera Trance version! Great to work out to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A hauntingly beautiful masterpiece that spellbinds","review":"I first heard of Emma Shapplin when a friend of mine recommended her music to me. I became very interested in her and soon purchased 'Etterna'. My mother got me this for Christmas, and it was a complete suprise.This album is a masterpiece. Emma's gorgeous, soaring vocals are supported by Gregorian chants, pop beats, soaring strings, and howling wolves. The lyrics are written in medieval Italian, adding a very romantic feel to the album. I strongly urge all fans of classical crossover to grab this. Emma is one of the best classical crossover artists out there- right up there with Sarah Brightman and Josh Groban. If you are a fan of either of these two or any other similar artists, don't miss this. My vocabulary must be limited because I have trouble finding the right words for this.Also, make sure you grab 'Etterna', Emma's most recent release. You won't be disappointed with either. Both are wonderful masterpieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL","review":"THRILLED WITH THIS ALBUM, HAVE GIVEN MANY AS GIFTS.

Emma, no doubt on her way to being one of the best pop sopranos, is still in need of polishing that powerful instrument she has. There are many segments in several of the songs that if you have an ear for pitch, just make you cringe. Even though the arrangements are wonderful, including the male Gregorian chant and the sweeping melodies that seem to take flight on their own, the CD could have waited for the right voice to give it the height it deserved. If we're lucky it will be remade and made even more a success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blown Away","review":"No music has ever moved me like this. Day and night the songs are either on my earphones or playing in my head. I am glad I can't understand the words. Somehow for me, that makes the experience even more powerful. I hope Emma Shapplin never becomes a \\"real\\" opera singer, but keeps following her own perfect instincts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Emma Shapplin no doubt has a beautiful voice, but here's the \\"but\\". Her stab at combining pop and opera just doesn't cut it. I don't know if it's because her music selections were poor, I am no expert, I just am a HUGE fan of the pop/operatic genre. Her voice and the songs didn't really come together with that powerful dynamic combo that sends chills down the spine. I suggest Sarah Brightman who has pretty much dominated this genre, and also a less well known artist that I love named Laura Turner. I am always searching for new or obscure artists that perform in this category, and when I did discover Emma, I was disappointed. She was anticlimatic from what I was already listenning to. Try these artists instead and don't waste your money on Shapplin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, it does grab your attention","review":"Another reviewer said she heard this CD playing in the background in a shop. I discovered it in a similar way, at breakfast in a guest house in Montreal. After hearing about 10 min. of the music, I HAD to find out what album it was. Bought it that day. That night, we went to see the show \\"From Rock to Opera\\" at the Casino de Montreal - fabulous show by the way - and the opening number was \\"spente le stelle\\", track 2 of the CD. Totally blew me away; got goose bumps! One reviewer, who gave her one star, complained that Shapplin's voice was not of a certain operatic quality. Well, if you're looking for pure opera, then look someplace else.

Things are explained in a way your fertility doctor would (or should) explain them, in a consise and easy-to-follow manner.

I highly recommend this book to those starting out on the road to IVF treatments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated information","review":"I made the mistake of purchasing his older book called The A.R.T. of making babies updated edition. Do not buy unless your doing a research paper. This book was written in 1998 and the information is outdated. Make sure you purchase the 2005 edition. I wish amazon.com would have made this clearer. I did read it anyways and had the book been filled with updated information it could be informative. I found the \\"Couple's guide to In Vitro Fertilization a much better book.

I order the 6 W -- the boot was a little snug when I zipped it up - but no more than 6 steps the zipper split and the boot was stuck on my foot. I have a friend who purchase the same boots and was pleasantly suprised at how narrow the boot was - good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design for remodel installation","review":"This unit is poorly designed for remodel installations which require pulling the can out of the plaster frame and later reinstalling. The can barely clears the ring of the frame. It's a struggle to get the can out and an even bigger struggle to get it in. Lightolier lights are much better in this regard. It's also a bit of struggle to get the frame into the ceiling hole as the junction box barely makes it through. Not an impressive design. New construction installations are probably much easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I purchased this for my 6 year old grandaughter and she loved it.It's the main item that she wanted for Christmas.

I thought it was about the history of zero; once I started reading, I found out the book was about...well...I have no idea! I wasn't able to finish the book and I stopped about half-way. His writing style is too abstruse, and just arrant nonsence. By the time I got to the middle, I still didn't know where zero came from nor did I care.Here is an example of his writing:\\"Any five-year-old will tell you that negative numbers aren't numbers at all, and phylogeny recapitulated ontogeny in taking its time to recognize negatives.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Zero","review":"I abandoned this book after only 50 pages, driven away by the author's relentlessly florid writing style (random sample: \\"It is tempting to borrow some of this linear imagery and say that, like Goethe's Faust, zero came through its dark struggles by cleaving to the one true way. But history walks on human feet.\\") This book is my nominee for the year's Purple Prose Prize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its more fiction than history","review":"A disappointing book. Like many Eurocentric historians who simply have to credit the Greeks with every great invention, regardless if they really are responsible for it or not, this book appears to have been written with an agenda of stealing the discovery (or invention)of Zero away from Indians and somehow thrust it on the Greeks. It appears that the author has worked a great deal more on his conclusions than his arguments. He gives no reliable references from the experts in the field to support the argument and mostly overlooks those who oppose his view. The book does not even care to give a bibliography which is required in any serious research document. Not worth the price if you are looking for an authentic work on the history of zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"minimal interesting mathematics, annoying prose","review":"I must agree with half the others who've reviewed this book here. The author's overly verbose style did not help me to understand any ideas, but instead sent me running to the dictionary. I'll gladly reread a sentence or equation in a math textbook a few times to understand it, but I don't like to read other genres in that way.I found a few interesting mathematical ideas within, but I would have been happiest if someone else had read and summarized this book for me.I was a math major if that adds perspective to my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"pompous bombastic blather","review":"I too was excited to read this book after I read several reviews and heard about it again on NPR. However, the book is unreadable. It is inartful, pompous, bombastic, and condescending in tone. There is little or no logical structure in the strictest sense. Chapters seem to be organized around a principle of free association with in the general subject. The reader is burdened with inapposite references, name dropping and a host of howl provoking rudimentary errors of style. The true purpose is not to inform the reader about anything, but to convince the unfortunate of the erudition of the author. In that sense the title is apt: this book is the nothing that is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, well-written!","review":"Greatly enjoyed learning about the history of zero and loved Kaplan's writing style.

Without the concept of zero, science, as we know, it would be impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointed","review":"Much like the reviews of the previous readers, I too was very disappointed in this book. After hearing several positive reviews of this work on CNN and the radio, I purchased this book without hesitation. How could you go wrong with such an interesting and tempting title? Unfortunately, the author's writing style is so confusing and overbearing, that I simply couldnt read past chapter 4. As an avid and a 'must finish this book' reader, I was thoroughly disappointed that my frustration with the overbearing verbage and poor writing style caused me to call it quits - the only book that has caused me to do so. Honestly, I believe that the book does have some insight. However, if you are a complete genius, yet cannot formulate your thoughts into easy understandable language, your insights are practically worthless. For the record, I hold a BA in Political Economy and an MBA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdone","review":"While I began this book with great expectation after hearing the author on National Public Radio, I was disappointed by his distracting literary style. I also found the book poorly organized, romping from culture to culture and time to time leaving me without a clue as to the connecting thread. I felt like Vonnegut's Billy Pilgrim: Unstuck in time (and place). I can't recommend this book to any but those who desperately wants to know something of the history of the concept and writing of zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much ado about nothing","review":"This book is BRILLIANT. I was scared of maths at school, although I enjoyed the occasional glimpse of the history of ideas that we were given.

I even enjoyed the algebra!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Historical Study","review":"This book is a good read for those who like narrative style and are fairly comfortable with the histories of eastern and western civilization. Kaplan gives some possible morphological etymology sources for the modern use of zero; both in place-holding and actual morphology of the character. If you're not interested in these aspects of historical study, then I would not recommend this text.Kaplan has a meandering writing style and expects the reader to hold several balls in the air while he rounds out his points. The text was fairly informative and I would recommend to anyone who is interested in historical study, not mathematical analysis.People seem to have complained because the book is not written in concise bullet points. However, I would suggest that Kaplan accomplishes his goal. Whether or not you're interested in the HISTORY of zero is the real question."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Biased as usual of many western authors!!","review":"This book should be placed in the science fiction category.

Unfortunately when I first read this book, I had absolutely no historical foundation regarding the development of zero. If you wish to read this book, I suggest reading a basic history of zero before, be it Charles Seife's \\"Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea\\" or an article in an encyclopedia. That said, the book is a treasure worth delving into, for the simple reason that it is rare to see mathematics written about so poetically. How often do you hear a mathematician quote Homer's \\"The Illiad\\" or even Shelly?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"erudite tromp","review":"Zero was a key advance in the history of maths. Kaplan entertains us with an erudite tromp through the ancient world of the Greeks and Indians. He quotes from Hindu and Buddhist texts, that often wax lyrical over zero. There is also a hilarious claim that \\"the style of Indian mathematics was to assert principles rather than prove them\\". I don't know Indian history enough to say if this is accurate. But it's certainly funny. (Though maybe not to Indian readers.)Kaplan even takes up with quantum mechanics. Paul Dirac's successful postulate of a negative energy sea filled with antiparticles gave zero an entirely new physical meaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patton's last battle","review":"Well Mr Whiting , I sure as hell can guess you did'nt like ''Georgie'' there was scarcely a page went by when when you didn't refer to GSP jnr'ssqeaky voice.

(I actually stayed at one of his recommended motels in Benson, Arizona - it was like most other budget hotels in the USA.) The book is also bulky, with the typical small print of the Rough Guide series.However, for all its faults, it appears to be one of the more comprehensive, current travel guides available for the Southwest region. As long as you also refer to other materials and insights, this guide book will serve as a good foundation for your trip across the Southwest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshingly Honest","review":"I like the curmudgeon tone the descriptions sometimes take, for example, in describing the food choices on the small town of Tropic east of Bryce NP (on p.400), it says \\"No one would make a special trip to eat in Tropic's limited array of restaurants, but once you're here it's not worth driving anywhere else either.\\" It's a refreshing change from the usual happy bunny tone of most guidebooks. It also hits on details other guidebooks missed, for example, of the five area guide books I have it is the only one that describes the back door path to Bryce canyon through the small road cutting though tropic. This would be my second choice for a Southern Utah park trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I've just started reading the book and would have to say that I like the layout of the book. The maps are Ho-Hum but accurrate. He is fixated with one budget motel chain and I can't figure out why. I also like that the author likes to call a spade a spade. If the subject is a waste of time or money he points that fact out. Would be a great buy at twice the money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book; somewhat sloppy code","review":"Clear and simple book, goes right to the guts. One minus is sloppy code. It's written by a scientist who is not a programmer. Implementations are slow and sometimes inaccurate. For example, function nays8 counts 0's in one thinning algorithm. Function snays count 0's in another thinnnig algorithm, while nays8 now count 1's!Most of these comes from straightforward implementation of ideas. Sure enough, exactly this makes his code a good starting point in writing more effective programs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guide for Fossil Hunters","review":"This is an excellent booklet on fossil hunting.

The plastic edged glass bottle is cheap looking. Since Bvlgari Blv costs about three times the price of this eau de toilette per ounce, I guess you can call this a bargain, but you get what you pay for, & in this case, that's not much. Save up your money for the original by Bvlgari, which is worth it just for the beauty of the bottle alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This DVD is pretty good,but def. not for beginners.

I personally don't like it for my residents fellows, they buy the Mercer and the Apley's, and for surgical exposures the Hoppenfeld's.

As such, it tries to be a comprehensive introduction to the sport: recurve vs. traditional vs. compound bows, olympic vs. field vs. hunting archery, and so on. However, the end result is that the book is far too broad and hardly scratches the surface in most areas.

But the craftmanship was awful. Needed 3 valances to go across the window. Two of the three had problems. One was not sewn at the top for the rod pocket to create the ruffled edge at the top. The other one was coming un-sewn in the hem, so i clipped the raveling thread to prevent further raveling and tacked the corner for the quick use as we had to have them immediately. then after the event i had to RE-MAKE these curtains at the machine!!! also purchased a pair of the panels for window on the door....and one of the panels was the same way...the rod pocket was not sewn on one of the panels!!!

I've been a Motorheadbanger since 1981, and I've never heard such a disgusting \\"tribute\\" in my life! Some songs don't even have lead guitar! Most songs are for the fans of bands like Death or Boltthrower, but not Motorhead. The only song which I can stand to listen to is Stay Clean, which is done nicely, by a band called Tyrant. Lyrics on the other songs are impossible to make out, imatating the sounds of a barking dog or even a murder being committed. Very little talent, if any, is shown on this cd. Real Motorhead fans, SAVE YOUR MONEY! This cd \\"tribute\\" shows NO CLASS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful for any starship-based traveller campaign","review":"This book is helpful in that it not only gives stats for various ships, but also expanded rules for starship design and combat.

This audio book is a good, inside account of the workings of the U.S. government."},{"rating":"2","title":"Significant, well thought out; an impressive political book","review":"I agree with the others...I wish Daschle talked more about the politics. He makes important observations. It's sad that he won't be back in the Senate, nontheless, hopefully, he will write another book.The book is quite touching, and it clarifies a lot of stuff about homeland security, Iraq, and what not. The best parts: His discussions about Democratic philosophy, his observations of others in government (particularly W), right wing memos, and his observations about American politics in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"As exciting a book as Dachle is a speaker","review":"It is a good read to see how Dachle interprets events.

Was there a price error...what was the reason for cancelling my order??I think from what I have read from others experience in dealing with philosophy's customer service though that they were not greeted in the best customer service way. Someone...Amazon...or philosophy should step up to the plate if they want customers to come back and buy their productsBTW the link in my cancellation notice now takes me to a 2 oz size for 6.00 that is a crazy price for 2 oz of shower gel IMO"},{"rating":"2","title":"YUMMY!!!!!","review":"I love the smell of this stuff, although I would not say it smells like hot choclate. It smells more like choclate cake batter, which is not a bad thing. It reminds me of my mom baking when I was a little girl. The only problem I have with taking wonderful choclate cake batter showers is that it makes me hungry. The shower gel is very conditioning. I don't use extra conditioner on my hair because it is not very dry, yet I do have to on my skin because it is really dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible customer service","review":"I also ordered the 16 oz product, only to have it cancelled without explanation.

The woman told me that you are aware of the error but that you are not canceling orders AND that you are knowingly shipping out the 2oz when you know people are expecting the 16oz. That is very bad business and in my opinion speaks very poorly for you. That is so wrong to ship out another item than what people actually ordered. Sorry, but I think that is pretty dishonest.Wow, I can't believe the conversation I just had with your Customer Service. Any company that knowingly does a bait and switch like this is pretty low."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love chocolate, this is for you!","review":"Yummy! If I could give this 6 stars, I would!

They were sailing stories, and that's about all I could give it. Two or three of the stories were truly great; the rest were real snoozers. I was very disappointed with the book and could barely make myself finish it because I felt deceived by the author/editor's choice of title. A better title would be 'Sailing Stories, the Good and the Boring.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"Don't bother purchasing this book- it's boring and there are very few good stories in it.

Some stories end unexpectedly at a point that makes them more like a movie trailer in print. Other stories appear to be the ramblings of sailors who had no specific adventure stories in their hold at all. I found N.C. Wyeth's \\"Great Stories of the Sea and Ships\\" a far better bang for the buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naturally Brilliant","review":"This is a great CD. In terms of todays music I'd say it was comparable to Vitamin C or Britney Spears but of course Sheena has a far better voice. This was her 8th studio album and it's excellent. The style of the music is dated slightly as it was made in 1991 but if you can get over that it's a great great mixture of R&B and Pop. Highlights are 'Manic Panic', 'First Touch Of Love' and 'What Comes Naturally'. Fans of Sheena's more traditional ballad filled albums should proceed to the checkout with caution but casual 90's pop fans wont be disappointed with 'What Comes Naturally'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheena is stellar in whatever she does!","review":"This is one Sheena Easton's most fun albums to date, which is now 2008. I have truly been a Sheena fan all of her career, but this release was truly a delight from track one to the end. Let's get together and What comes naturally, just seemed to fit the times for me when it was released. Early 90's and a joy for life were fit for the times. I truly would have worn out a vinyl copy of this album, thank god it was released in the era of CD's. Time Bomb is a true testament to our time now of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. I love Sheena and all her works from the past and for the future. Although, this review has dealt with a 1991 release mainly, Sheena has had several releases after this.

But somehow it falls short. It chronicles the love stories of two sisters and their sailor boys. One (Ginger) is resentful towards her former tapping partner (Astaire) who always manages to inadverdantly sabotage her career opportunities. The other sister, is the ugly duckling turned into a swan type, who unfortunately, falls in love with a cad of a sailor. So that love story is a very difficult one to be interested in. There are a lot of tap dance numbers. A scene showing Astaire playing the piano. And an especially lovely ballroom routine towards the end with Ginger and Astaire. Fans of the duo will probably like the movie. But it feels long and just not quite funny enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"And Harriet","review":"Let us not overlook Harriet's divine interpretation of \\"Get Thee Behind Me Satan\\" which nails her as a great singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favourite Musical","review":"Follow the Fleet is my favourite Ginger and Fred movie. The plot maybe thin, but the music and dancing is second to none. Fred in the Navy with Randolph Scott was an interesting idea,so to was an early appearance by Lucille Ball.

The film contains two romantic subplots, one involving Astaire and Rogers and another involving Rogers' sister (Harriet Hilliard) and Astaire's shipmate(Randolph Scott). It's interesting to note that Hilliard is an engaging film prescence years before she became better known as Harriet Nelson of TV's \\"Ozzie and Harriet\\". This is a pleasant enough vehicle for Astaire and Rogers but not great. I would have given it 5 stars if it contained more inspired numbers like the sublime \\"Let's Face the Music and Dance\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Irving Berlin music","review":"Actually, I prefer this one to Top Hat and Swing Time, particularly Swing Time; the plot is less contrived. Of course, one doesn't buy these for their plots, but still, sometimes they're too inane to sit through.As for the Irving Berlin score, \\"I'm putting all my eggs in one basket\\" and \\"Let's face the music and dance,\\" and the dancing that accompanies those, are the highlights for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not the best","review":"Fred and Ginger dance great wonderful, but the story is welllllllllll slow!

If it were possible for King Tut to have gone (by magic, no less!) to late 20th Century America (and suddenly be able to speak English; he even gets to drive a car!), the culture shock would have been so severe that he would have gone catatonic. The Americans back in 18th Dynasty Egypt would have had almost as great a culture shock, plus being exposed to all kinds of diseases.Can you image a police officer's reaction after pulling over a car and being told the passenger is King Tut?As with many modern fiction writers, the author does not understand the ancient spirituality and mystique of kingship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me...","review":"I tried two different segments at 2 different times and both times shut it off after about a minute.

It has much to much of a workout mentality to it and it does the same poses over and over again. When the instructor modifies poses, there is no one to demonstrate the modifications and some of the transitions between poses seem dangerous to me. I do yoga videos a lot and this is not one I like at all. I will not be doing it again. This has none of the soul of yoga.

First off, unless you have never, ever done yoga before, Yoga Basics is a throw-away. It's just a series of sun salutations, almost identical to ones you do in the later sections. Yoga Burn was the only truely enjoyable section, although it didn't fully come through on its claim to raise my heartrate. It did you up a bit, but not enough to burn anything. Yoga for Flexibility was fine, TMS is not really known for their stretch routines. In both of the toning workouts I was distracted by the instructor. Lara is clearly a pilates teachers who quickly learned some yoga postures for this video. This does give me hope for her pilates videos at least.

Can do all 5 segments or - if I've hiked or cycled already that day - just do the segments for abs and for flexibility (often times I start and end with the flexibility segment.) I am a beginner at yoga and like the way Lara explains what to do, offering modifications for those with knee or back problems. She is not too slow or fast paced, so I feel challenged, never losing interest.

I use this (and a couple other 10 Minute Solution DVDs) in addition to Insanity which I do every day, and it's great to have a 10-minute option after 40-60 minutes of \\"insane\\" cardio.My only con is the \\"mood\\" of the DVD. When I think of yoga, I think of low lights, quiet music, and serene ambiance. You definitely don't get that from this DVD.

It doesn't work for me - the pace is too slow, the music is awful and the 10 minute segments are uninspiring. The warm-up is okay, the stretching sequence at the end is very disappointing and everything else is so bland I barely remember the sequence after doing the whole DVD three times.The short segments don't really flow one into another very well, so doing the disc from start to finish doesn't leave me with a feeling that I just completed a wholesome full-body workout.Overall, this DVD almost turned me off yoga altogether.

That price increase far outstrips inflation - by a large number.I have a hard time believing that this is all due to Microsoft corporate greed (if you believe in that sort of thing).

Also, as some other reviewers pointed out, if you don't use Internet Explorer (a smart thing if you care about security), then you can't use this product as it is hard-coded to work with IE making this product useless for non-IE users.

In one such case, they completely cover the Scottish tune Auld Lang Syne with distorted guitar (Old Lang Syne/Tube). I loved Freddit the Mockingbird, a song which sounds Oriental in nature to the melody but it adds warped squeaking sounds and other acoustic instrument sounds to fill the void.They are a somewhat political band (if you see them like that) by including the poem/performance \\"Gold On Mars.\\" They more or less just like good instrumentals more than anything, IMO.

There is actually a 30 second delay before the alarm sounds once motion is detected. To make matters worse, once motion is detected, there is a brief (1/4sec) chirp and a flashing red light that gives away the position of the device. So...effectively, if an intruder can take out the batteries (or stuff it under a pillow) in 30 seconds, your security system is compromised. What were they thinking when they made this? The door chime mode is useful (chimes immediately), but the alarm is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long of a delay","review":"I thank C. Perez for pointing out the length of delay. 30 seconds is way too much, if an intruder gets in while I sleep he/she could get to me before the alarm even sounds.

I had bought this at WM, will return it unopened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little product","review":"Easy to install. Works great.

Its bewitching pop melodies hide a very complex and ambitious musical project, in which many influences are intertwined (folk, new age, atonal music....).

They are an okay compromise if you must bleed brakes yourself and / or don't have a pressurized / vacuum bleeding tool and / or need the convenience for frequent track-side bleeds as I do. The internal check valve does work as promised but several of mine have leaked after many bleeding cycles, so I consider this an eventual wear item. The main reason for my single star rating is that they are more fragile than stock bleeders. There are no directions so during a recent install I torqued them to the factory original specs per my service manual, only to have one snap off, thus ruining my caliper and causing a very expensive repair. Another negative is that the seat angles are not identical to stock, so once installed they gall the seat in such a way that you may not be able to reinstall a stock bleed screw without leaking.

It probably was a book I would have never picked up on my own. But, as I started reading, I was pleasantly surprised. Jackson has a very unique way of writing that is both captivating and engaging. Her creation of the majority of characters is solid, providing enough information to create a skeleton while still allowing room for creativity of the reader. Characters are believable, and the action is well paced. Despite having a wide cast of characters, each becomes a separate entity that the reader can understand and connect with. Rarely am I so wowed by an author that I seek out their other books - but I just ordered Gods in Alabama to follow up this wonderful treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner!","review":"I LOVED Gods in Alabama and couldn't wait to read another book by Jackson.

The novel tells the story of Nonny Frett, trying to manage her unconventional family, and her looming, but uncertain, divorce. All of this happens against the background of the tiny and colorful southern town of Between.The plot of this book moves along at a good pace, and the story is full of colorful characters. The similarities to Gods in Alabama are striking: the unique maternal situation, the overbearing aunt, and the troubled romantic relationship are all here.My main issue with the book was the ending: it was a bit too neat, and definitely a let-down.

It was an easy book to put down after reading a couple of chapters.At first I thought Joshilyn Jackson might be a non-de-pmum for Fanny Flagg, or vice-versa.

More than one decent text has been destroyed by the droning, nasal voice of a proud author who shouldn't have been allowed near a microphone. Happily, Ms. Jackson is a glorious exception to this rule. Her rendition of Between, Georgia is an absolute delight. She created consistent accents for each character that reflected their personalities beautifully. Listening to her is so much like settling into a porch swing with a glass of sweet tea for a chat with a friend, it's easy to overlook how technically well-done it was, really superb. I was completely drawn in by her narration, and I already miss Between's residents like old friends. Well, maybe not Bernise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Love this book!

The War of the Fretts and the Crabtrees is played out by characters that are so well etched that you can almost feel them breathing. Nonny truly is caught in Between, with her love for her blind/deaf adopted mama, the mama's self-mutilating twin sister and domineering sister, the serious wee cousin, and other characters and relatives straight from Faulkner and/or the Dukes of Hazzard.

We didn't adhere to the tour plans since we had about 3 days in the park and the crowds were light. The book does have hotel quality ratings and advice on selecting packages. We, however, opted for the convenience of the DPacific Hotel.

I'm hoping this is just an isolated problem, I'll be able to tell you if it is after I get my a replacement unit.Pros:* Good sound* Nice display colors* Plenty of memory space for your favorite stations* Displays current station + clock at the same time* Good signal reception* It's a Kenwood, and it's cheapCons:* Memory buttons are difficult to differentiate* CD Player will not play (I'll update this later)* Does not have a detachable face"},{"rating":"1","title":"star is for Tristan","review":"Another yummy hero saddled with a totally unlikable heroine. This book has a fantastic cover (NK, my fav!!!) and a story that I thought really had promise, but unfortunately, it has one of the most unlikable heroines ever to grace a romance novel. Siobhan had a terrible childhood, I will grant you, but she was a witch. She wanted to kill Tristan right up till the end. What he ever wanted with her, I will never understand. I failed to see that she had any redeeming qualities.The romance, and I use the term loosely, between the two never took off. I failed to see why he would not just kill her and be done with it, especially after she threatened his little daughter.I like the vampire angle and Simon and Orlando had promise, but Siobhan killed this book for me. What a witch!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too violent for a Romance.....","review":"let me first say that I enjoyed the first novel in this series. Unfortunately, and despite the author's overall good writing skills, the violence, murder, and fanaticism of the heroine killed this book for me.I kept trying to get through this book, wondering how this bloody, \\"Hatfield and McCoy's\\" hated enemies storyline was going to transform into a romance, but when the heroine stabs the hero in the chest, then repeatedly cuts him the final straw was broken and I quit.The heroine was totally unlikable and I almost quit the book earlier when she threatens to kill the heroes four year old child, but silly me, I kept going. Violence does not equal Romance, and who could honestly love someone who threatened to kill your child? I honestly wonder what the author was thinking.Since I enjoyed this author's previous work, I may try her again, but I'd not recommend this particular book.1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading, again","review":"A Man in Christ, is now newly republished and available! This book came highly recommended by Dallas Willard. Chapter two is a bit academic and slow reading but the rest of the book is full of great theology that centers around our union and life in Christ. A Man in Christ used to be required reading for those training for the ministry. For me, however, I found the text to be a fresh collection of thoughts that I have gathered over the years. For a concise yet lucid reading of Pauline theology that is free of higher criticism yet scholastically written, it has few parallels. As you will soon see, it was written by a pastor who was a good theologian. Like me, you'll probably read some things that you don't see eye-to-eye with James Stewart. However, unlike most of the books I have read, I plan to read this one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful game, Nancy!","review":"This game was so much fun!!!!

Nancy on vacation? No way.Bess and George are a little delayed and Nancy finds herself roped into a mystery, and a dangerous one at that. From exploring a Ghost town to baking a cake, there is never a dull moment in this game. The voice actors are really convincing and the characters have a lot of personality. This game is very cheery and happy, so if it is a dark and scary mystery you are going for, try Curse of Blackmoor Manor (I find it kind of funny that I got Blackmoor Manor and this in a double dare set, they couldn't be more different)This game has a lot of Romance, something the other games lack. I really enjoyed that. There were a few tedious tasks we had to complete but nothing too bad.

When I played the other 2 I had so much fun and couldn't wait to get back to them whenever I had to stop playing, this one I just dreaded. I had a hard time figuring out what I was supposed to do next, when I wasn't stuck doing chores. The story was all over the place - I used a walkthrough to get thru it because I want to play all of titles. I hope the next one I play is back to being fun.

It does not deserve the bad reviews. It does go into more detail than the Kaplan and Princeton review books, but it also presents the information in a more interesting, applicable manner.The SAT II Bio I took in October had 5 questions about diseases. Only 1 was covered in the Kaplan book, none were covered in the Princeton Review book, but all 5 were covered in this book.If you plan to do well on the Bio SAT II then you should buy all three of the books. First reading the Princeton (easiest), then the Kaplan's, and then the Barron's for any information not included in the two previous.The practices in this book are harder than the actual test, but better overprepared than under.I got an 800 on the test studying from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"another 5 star review","review":"I looked up this book to recommend to a cousin of mine who's thinking of taking the BioSATII test and I when I saw the one star reviews I was compelled to comment. I agree completely with all the 5 star ratings from high scorers. I scored a 790 on my SATII back in 2003 and used this book to prepare for the AP exam as well (for which I recieved a score of 5). In my opinion, this is the best bio test prep book on the market. It's organized and detailed and it doesn't skimp out on the information it provides. The practice test questions are more similar to real questions than most test books and are generally more difficult than the real thing - meaning that when you actually take the test you will happily score better than on your practice runs."},{"rating":"1","title":"very out of date","review":"This book took so long to come!

First, it is extremely detailed. It goes into so much detail that is useless since none of it shows up on the exam. Second, it is a very boring book.

But how is someone supposeed to get through this book with all of its detail if they fell asleep everytime they opened the book. I fell asleep more than 15 times. Well its good i got another review book for this sat II or else i think i may have failed it.

What else? Oh, you want examples? Ok, for the 13th edition: \\"Dentryfying\\" make you think of teeth? No, I think it should be Denitryfying...anyways.

Maybe that review should be moved?I used this book to study for the SAT II Biology after having taken the AP Biology exam. I found the tests in this book to be quite hard--in fact, harder than the actual AP multiple choice exam, which doesn't seem right. (Aren't SAT II's supposed to be easier than AP's?) I also found a few errors--for example, in the mini-diagnostic test, two of the answer choices for one question were the same. One question, also in the diagnostic test, struck me as too mathematical to be on the real test--it required multiplying by 62, and seeing as calculators aren't allowed on the test, that seems unrealistic.Overall, I found the review sections to be OK and the practice tests to be unclear, unrealistically hard, and overly specific. I would not recommend this book at all..use Cliffs AP instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is absolutely...horrible!","review":"This was the worst prep book I have ever seen in my life.

As in most productions of Turandot and Madame Butterfly in this one it seems to be a complete ignorance about eastern cultures. Puccini's music is also a mock of chinese music, but it is great and, by itself conveys all the magic and action of this opera.

One of the most painfully awful books...","review":"This is one of the most painfully awful books I've had the (dis)pleasure of reading. I speak German and there were many times, while reading this horribly translated book, that I could not even understand the English translation and I had to think about it in German just to understand the English. I didn't have a problem with the British English; I just had a problem with how terribly the translator did this book. It's like he looked up every word in the dictionary and wrote down the first meaning he saw, without making sure that was the *right* meaning. I have to admit that the plot isn't that great itself - it starts strong and then the author tries to add too many new twists and turns, completely eliminating the character development.

I've heard that it is difficult to translate German novels into English and I'd like to believe that to give this one the benefit of the doubt. The pace of events is overly rapid, to say the least. The main character places a personal add stating she is in search of an impotent man. The replies are entertaining. But the relationships she develops in the course of the story are completely unbelievable. One man she meets becomes a person she regards as one of her best friends in a week; her elderly neighbor is a bosom buddy in just a few days; she and the man of her dreams are deeply in love within about 2 days of meeting each other and after 2 weeks look headed for the alter.

Unfortunately, the rest of the book doesn't get much better.The book, disappointingly, takes an unabashedly pro-Communist slant, as exemplified in Chapter XIV page 276:\\"... Much of the American diplomacy after Truman got into office was clumsily based on explicit or implicit threats by the Americans of using the A-bomb. We effectively rejected sharing of the bomb's secrets with our allies, except for limited cooperation with Britain. But Russia, also an ally in World War II, was frozen out - with the consequent festering of paranoia on the part of Stalin. Another lost opportunity for Truman, or whatever power elite was running the country.\\"The author's kidding, right? ... well, no, he's not.I did finish the book but, in hindsight, I should have put it down after reading the introduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written!","review":"Alberta Hawse has a vivid, delightful style, and her story of a young orphan who hopes Jesus will give him the life he wants is captivating...not just in the way it re-tells the events of the crucifiction day, but in revealing the change that happens to a heart that encounters the living God.

Surely this must be a joke. Animals are in no way capable of the things Ms. Meyer gives them credit for. She suggests talking to pets as you would a human.

Let's see her try and reason with a pack of pit bulls that have just mauled a child. \\"now now, Rufus and Yukon, don't bite children ever again, it's not nice\\".Her book is the laughing stock of the scientific community.

I personally believe there could not have been a better author to do the job. I feel Blaine gave good back ground and story flow to the book with good descriptions of Battle that have lacked from some Battletech books (Some of Stackpole's work has lacked in this area lately), without bogging the story down.

Therefore, Toffen is seen as a ripe target by Clan Wolf who sends an entire Cluster to take the world. Now Angela and her green unit must repel the attack of one of Clan Wolf's most skilled and experienced group of warriors.This book is by far the best BattleTech novel I have ever read.

NOT! The book didn't end so much as it just suddenly stopped-like the author realized he was running out of paper and had to rush it to a conclusion. It had a million hanging loose ends, a dumb climax, and [a poor] final scene.

And I like Henze for his independence. But l'Upupa is not one of his best operas,it is as crazy as The Love for Three Oranges without having that opera's irresistible music.

A cozy livng room is ideal for this performance on DVD. You will connect immediately with the sets, costumes, story and special effects. The music might be another matter. The orchestration is more intersting then most of the vocal parts. There isn't a melody or tune you can sink your ears into. I've watched it twice and I just wonder how many times in the future I'm going to take it down from the shelf and watch the entire thing again. That would be a hard call to make.

She looks dazzling on the back cover as well, my co-workers Emily and Nicole think so too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!!","review":"Finally Danielle Steel has written a book that doesn't sound just like all of her others. Sure....same bit of storyline..but much better developed characters and a refreshing twist. Pip is a very sweet 11 yr-old girl who wins the heart of painter Matt. Pip's mother Ophelie was a disturbed mother who had suffered a loss but finds herself again after spending time with Matt. Add Mousse, the dog, and a few other additions and you have the perfect story.

Is Danielle Steel so sacrosanct that her editors are not allowed to edit?I agree with those who have written that this book was an improvement over the last few. Sure, the main character is the same, weak, indecisive, codependent woman but at least this one has a little gumption and actually stands up for herself. I am beginning to think that these characters have to be a reflection of Ms. Steel's own personality. Why else would she continue to create these weak women?Danielle Steel knows the pain of losing a child and offers some good suggestions for dealing with that pain. But as many steps forward as Opehlie takes, she seems to take an equal number of steps back. It is so frustrating. At least she reacted correctly when faced with the \\"ultimate betrayal.\\"With some heavy editing, this book might have been a three for me. As it is, with all the run-on and incomplete sentences and constant repeating of phrases, I can only rate it a two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe Harbour...better than her past 5 novels!","review":"I was hesitant to read Steel's latest novel, because they were all very similar in character type and happy ending stories. Out of habit, and never wanting to miss a Steel book, I read Safe Harbour, and was pleasantly surprised. The characters were likeable, and I enjoyed the pace of the story, and its ending was very moving. My only criticisms are: Ophelie's name, it gets annoying to pronounce names like that, and especially when that person is a main character, it gets distracting after a while. Second, the repetition and run-on sentences were not what I expect from a writer of Steel's caliber. Overall, this was one of her better new releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah, Blah, Blah","review":"Danielle Steel has done it once again. Written a book that must have taken her all of one day. I was really disappointed after Summer in St. Tropez, but thought after a break from her books I'd try again. Sorry I wasted my time. This book is SO repetitive, same phrases are not only repeated chapter after chapter but in the same paragraph. The story line seems to drag on forever. If Steel's goal is to \\"dumb\\" her books down for the masses then she has succeeded. This book is written at about an 11-year-old's level. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried again.....","review":"I gave Danielle Steel another chance because I thought that maybe this book would be better after I read the other reviewers. I was misled. Same old story, same pathetic woman with no back bone. Her books are depressing. This one was not quite as bad as \\"Unanswered Prayers\\", but it was not all that great either.

It's an insult to writing and storytelling. The story itself is thin and lame, the characters have no depth and it is clear that no one edited the book. Danielle Steel's prose is filled with unnecessary commas, paragraphs with sentences that contradict one another and trite sayings and descriptions. My advice is to not waste your time reading this horrible book. Doing anything else, including staring into space, would be a better use of one's time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, Laughter &Tears","review":"This novel has everything friendship,love and betrayal.

The book explains and traces the source code well. On the other hand, most likely, you won't know which source file to look into, how to compile, or how to run ( of course, in few cases, the authors will tell you). If the reader want to learn from book text and code example simultaneously( which I think is the best way to learn ), this book will definitely give you a lot of hard time.

The main character is a spoiled whiny brat, but of course she's gorgeous so she has her choice of any man on the planet and indulges in endless slutty behavior.

Isabelle Huppert is a beautiful actress who convincingly portrays a dislikable character. Emma comes from a wealthy farming background and marries Charles Bovary, a doctor who works very hard, loves his wife, and wants to have children. Yet Emma cannot find her purpose in life and she is dying of ennui. She goes through the motions of having a baby but cannot connect with the child. Bored with her husband she searches endlessly for more exciting relationships and winds up in the depths of despair. The film is able to emphasize the comforts that she is able to afford, each scene showing a her in a more dazzling costume than the last. In the end, like the fisherman's wife, she winds up with nothing, consumed by her own insatiable desires.

About half of the cd is great.

Whoever wrote Eat the Meek should seriously be drug out on the street on shot, that song is so slow and boring, it really puts me to sleep.

This 1997 release is far superior to the elder, however, \\"White Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean\\" is still great. This CD is amazing. It's perfect for skating, displaying more ska than NoFX ever have before. It is fast paced, with cool lyrics, thunderous drums, and Fat Mike's classic bass and vocals. I love the hard edged guitars as well. My favorite songs on here are \\"Monosyllabic Girl\\", \\"Kids of the K-Hole\\", and \\"It's My Job To Keep Punk Rock Elite\\".

The connectors either snapped when you tried to put them together or they wont seat properly in the holes and then you can't get the legs/feet the whole way together.

You could easily spend a fortune on lighting systems, but I found this system to be very convenient and most importantly, affordable. I quickly realized that the single T5 light only gives me about 7 to 8 inches of acceptable light so I was limited to placing 2 trays lengthwise under the light at a time. So if you need more than 2 trays of seedlings I recommend you purchase two. With two lights I was able to use 3 trays to germinate all my tomato, pepper, broccoli, onion, herbs, marigold and vinca seeds at the same time. And there was space left over for individual pots. The rack itself is a little bit flimsy, but it only needs to support the light so I have no concerns. I've had two successful planting seasons growing strong and healthy plants with this system."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fluorescent lamp can grow veggies","review":"So far so good. Nice package ,easy setup and so far is growing, carrots, small onions,baby spinach and. cherry tomatoes.They are still young but seem to be growing very well with the T5 lights.

I have emailed Hydrofarms to see if they can advise as to whether this signals a defective bulb or whether there might be something else wrong. I hope they can help! I will revisit this review after I hear from Hydrofarm.UPDATE: Received reply in one day from Hydrofarm representative saying she wants to help, and asking for my shipping address and a copy of the invoice. I am not sure what her plans are; perhaps she thinks it is the bulb and is planning to replace that. Or maybe she thinks the light fixture is defective. Will update this review as I hear more."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE it!","review":"This is my first year for starting seeds indoors but this product should make the process easier. As far as the product is concerned, I could not be happier. It was easy to put together if you follow the directions and look at the pictures. I was bit confused because the cord was pushed into one of the end receptacles. I had to look at the picture to figure out to pull it out and let it free hang in the center. I know it sounds like a no brainer after the fact, but it was a bit confusing and the picture helped. Perhaps this is why a previous poster had issues with the raising and lowering mechanism. I do wish the power cord was hard wired into one of the legs, it would make the product look better, but I'm sure add to the cost. All in all I think it's a good looking set up and should work just fine for the purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"I love my new Jump Start grow light system.

I can hardly wait until I get all of my planting supplies, so I can watch my grow light work its magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love this! Great for starting seeds at home","review":"This product was easy to assemble and works great. Very sturdy. I am excited for veggies come summer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Durable","review":"I bought this light a bit more than a year and a half ago. I've been using it to grow my plants in the winter and it works well. In regards to some people only getting one bulb or whatnot, I'm not sure why. Maybe they received an \\"updated\\" model? I purchased mine from the manufacturer though. My lamp contained 2 bulbs and used 2 bulbs. I think everyone would agree on the flimsy design, but what I'm more frustrated with is that my lamp unexpectedly died. I'm not sure what went wrong with it, but it is past the warranty and I must look for another. There is no conceivable way to fix it cheaply (I tried changing both bulbs and pulled the lamp apart to see what I could do). There is no starter to be replaced as on many fluorescent lamps. If I had known it would not be a long term investment, I wouldn't have bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not flimsy to me","review":"I just got this last night, so I can't respond to the review that said the ballast had a short life. I can say that it assembled easily and that I have no trouble either adjusting the height of the light or with any leaning or flimsiness. My initial suspicion would be that those complaining of flimsiness did not get the legs fully inserted into the cross piece.Regarding the reviews that complained of merchandise arriving broken, I was unimpressed by the packaging, so I can see how that might happen, but mine (I ordered and received 2) arrived just fine in the Christmas UPS rush, so the packages must be more durable than they appear.Overall, if I needed another light of this size, I would not be afraid to order another one of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just fine","review":"Received this grow light about a little over a week ago.Took about 60 seconds to put together.It is what it is, an entry level grow light.This is our first attempt at starting vegetables indoors.First attempt growing vegetables period.So far I think this light will suit our needs just fine.In a year or two when we really know what we're doing & expand our operation will probably look to upgrade but for now it works just as advertised.UpdateGot tired of running down to the basement to turn the grow light on @ 6am & off again @ 8pm so I bought an inexpensive outlet timer.After a little over a month our tomatoes & peppers are all 2\\" to 3\\" tall & looking real good.Just moved them out to the porch to get ready to plant.The most important observation would be there was no appreciable increase in our electric bill!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy to assemble","review":"This was recommended by someone who's blog I follow, so I bought it. I assembled it last night and the rubber ends do not slide into the metal openings easily. I tried pushing them in, but no luck. I ended up breaking off one half of one of the T stands when trying to push the rubber end into the metal opening and injuring myself in the process. Had to use a hammer to get all the rubber ends into the metal openings, which left dents in the metal.It's not very sturdy either and the one I received does not look like the picture shown. The light fixture portion I received is not green on the outside, it's silver. It looks like the light is hanging from wires in the picture, but mine is hanging from plastic cording. Not happy with this at all and is definitely not worth the cost I paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hydrofarm Jump Start Grow Light","review":"I purchased the Hydrofarm Jump Start Grow light so I could start my pepper plants indoors in my basement. I bought two lights and I am very satisfied with the construction and ease of operation. I did a little modification to the frame leg base so I could get better light concentration on my growing table. I just left out an inner leg base on both sides and joined both light stands together. It actually made the frame more stable and works like a charm. I'm not sure if the Mfg. intended this as a viable modification, but you could conceivably connect as many of these frames together as you wanted.It's a great product and I'm looking forward to the results of my plants."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken upon arrival","review":"I never got to see if this worked because it the light bulb was broken when it arrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"This stopped working after 1 day and now we have to go through the hassle of returning it - complete bs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very displeased!","review":"When my box arrived, both ends of it were ripped open, and it only had to be shipped from PA to NYy.

Pieces were missing so we couldn't even put it together.. if the light worked. The item is very misleading. We are definitely NOT happy about this product and the way that it arrived at our doorstep. BEWARE if you're going to order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good lamp","review":"Love it. It has helped keep some of our plants alive during the winter and start growing others.

(It's not actually as flimsy as I anticipated after reading several other reviews.) However, they say it includes \\"2 agrobrite light tubes\\". It only comes with ONE. And, the light fixture only holds one bulb, so the seedlings I'm growing all tend to bend towards the center reaching for the one bulb. I feel a bit ripped off - there should have at least been a second replacement tube in the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"too narrow for seed starting","review":"While this grow light is advertised with 72-cell seed starting trays, it is much too narrow to work well. The single bulb reflector is only 3 1/2 inches wide so doesn't cover the ten inch width of a 72 cell seed starting tray. The 72 cell tray is six cells wide but the light only adequately covers three cells. The result is that the outside seedlings are leaning over to the center, trying to get enough light. They are spindly as a result. Don't buy this light if using 72 cell trays, but buy a wider light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful product for growing herbs.","review":"I brought this product because I have recently found the wonder of cooking with herbs and wanted to grow them year round in my kitchen. Unfortunately, my kitchen is centered in my house and though very open, has no natural light. I bought this because of the reviews and price. It is wonderful. I was happy to see how easy it was to put together and how bright the grow light is. It love the pulley system as it makes it very easy to start growing the plant from its infancy to full size. My husband also made a comment yesterday on how it even made him feel better which is a pleasant additional effect. It even helps those blues you get in the winter months; not only by having the wonderful smells from the plants and seeing them grow, but also from the added light it brings on those dreary days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grow light","review":"I found it easy to put together.

But, this is a terrific product at a good price and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ordered 2, neither works","review":"Sounds like a great product. The stand is fine, the setup is fine, but it doesn't work. I ordered 1 and the lamp would not turn on. I ordered a second, the light goes on and immediately turns off. I play with the switch, and the plug, I can only get the light to flicker on and immediately go off. I contacted HYDROFARM 3 times, twice by email, once by phone and no one will return my call."},{"rating":"1","title":"crapped out after 5 minutes","review":"this item is nicely designed. sturdy enough for the money. assembled easily. light is bright. turned off light.

There are so many better ways to attach the legs to the frame so I just rigged my own up."},{"rating":"1","title":"bulbs broken","review":"The light came with the bulb cracked on one end. It still worked but you only have so much time to grow vegetable seedlings and i thought the bulb would not work very long so I called amazon about it and they said to order another light and take the bulb out and return the second light.Well the bulb was broken in many pieces in the second light.So I called amazon again and asked just to send me a replacement bulb only. Amazon told me they could not just send a bulb. It was very frustrating.so I sort of just gave up.the light itself seems to work well but when that cracked bulb stops working I am kind of screwed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor excuse for a light garden.","review":"I was very disappointed in this item. The rings which come on the hanging cords in no way fit to the attachments that are clipped to the light fixture. And no directions as to how they were supposed to fit. Was going to work around this problem somehow but when I went to try out the location for my new light fixture, the hanging cord tore off. No way to fix that. This thing is going back. My curiosity is satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"RE-DESIGNED - DEFINITELY NOT FLIMSY","review":"As you can see, most of these reviews are very old. I have one and it is very sturdy and designed quite well. The lifting mechanism works great and is a great improvement over most of the more inexpensive systems that require moving each side separately. I would definitely recommend this system - its a nice dark forest green and the paint job is excellent - you could put it in the living room and it would look just fine. I can't comment on shipping and packing as I bought mine at a retail store but I would have to say the package itself seems pretty well packed so if anything breaks I would say the retailer you bought it from did not protect it well enough in the shipping box. It is, afterall, a lightbulb and should be shipped as such, with plenty of pellets."},{"rating":"2","title":"hydrofarm highly recommended","review":"Very pleased, fast shipment and great product.

The light is bright and the right color for excellent results.I couldn't use the stand that comes with the light due to space limitations, but I purchased some chain at a local hardware store and mounted it from the ceiling. The chain can still be adjusted to raise or lower the light for ideal lighting conditions. I also use a 24-hour timer for 12-14 hours of light.I may purchase another one of these for even more flowers next year! (See my review on the Jiffy Heated Starter Kit for more info.)...they are a great combination!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price!!","review":"I purchased this light hoping that the negative reviews were exaggerated at best. I must say the light is a very simple design and goes together quickly. I had trouble with one screw as it almost stripped trying to get it in but I won. I won't be taking it apart so I neednt worry about it again. The bulbs supply a nice bright light and by the looks of the seeds I started the light works well. I do wish the light had a bigger dome as I could have my trays sideways instead of lenghtways. I will be rigging an aluminum type cover over it next year to capture more light and sow more seeds. But as it is this light is well worth the money and I must say, very stable if assembled properly. Worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice!","review":"My son and I put this up this afternoon. It took us about an hour. (Things take a little longer when you have a 6-year-old \\"helping\\" you.) I find it very sturdy. When I first put it up, it was a little wobbly. But, you have to ensure that the top is completely seated onto the two outer poles. I used a hammer. It's so sturdy that, if necessary, I could attach the clip-on grow lights to the sides for additional lighting."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like it Enough to Buy Another","review":"This product is a very easy to set-up and use.

The socket pegs are attached to the board with small 4mm (if that) plastic pegs and I could tell right away I had to be careful with this thing. When I went to put my first socket on, it was not easy, they didn't just pop on, it required a little more force than I thought it would.

Today I went to the local Staples store and the sales guy told me that he has had a lot of Uniden's returned for exactly this reason. He recommended ATT, VTECH or Panasonic. I didn't buy. I'm looking for range comparison reviews on the web now. On the plus side the built in answering machine other features of the Uniden phones are excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not working","review":"I bought 2 sets but found that the base does not work for both the sets. This is really a bad news."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upgrading from 900Mhz for longer range....NOT!","review":"Sigh....The old 900Mhz had a longer range. I'm thinking of taking the thing apart so that I can get to the attenna line and connect an external one to increase the range, or perhaps I should just accept the loss and buy a more expensive phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars if I could rate it that way","review":"Very noisy, cuts clear out anywhere around a corner or line of sight over 40 feet. What a piece of junk, I want my money back. Advertised as a working phone but does not even come close to the performance touted by Uniden or Amazon as representing. Should be pulled from sale as soon as possible. I may not use AMAZON again, I have been a good customer for a long time but this is jut not right!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this from Amazon","review":"Have heard good feedback on this phone from all over the net. Just a advise to everyone, do not buy this from Amazon. It is more prudent to pay a $ 1.5 extra and get it from Target.I have ordered this phone from Amazon about 3 weeks back and still do have it with me. I am not sure if I will ever get it.

THE ANSWERING MACHINE WORKS FINE BUT THE CORDLESS PHONE IS A JOKE...\\"CAN U HEAR ME?\\".CORDLESS PHONE HAS NOOOOOOO SPKR BUTTON AND, THE ENTIRE FAMILY HATES THIS PHONE, BECAUSE WE CANNOT HEAR THE PERSON ON THE OTHER LINE SO WE HAVE TO TALK THROUGH THE BASE PHONE WHICH IS ALSO LESS THAN GOOD.BY THE WAY NOW I AM IN THE MARKET FOR ANOTHER CORDLESS PHONE. SHAME ON UNIDEN!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"no problems","review":"We bought this phone about a month ago, and have had no problems with the volume of the cordless phone as one reviewer stated.This was the cheapest corded/cordless phone around and we found that the Ni-Cad battery can be replaced with Ni-MH, which we were looking for in a phone since our last phone's battery kept dying fast.We have been impressed with the sound quality and all the extras that this phone has.We like having a corded phone, as well as a cordless, so we always know where one phone is located when we're trying to answer the phone.We think it was a very good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad cordless phone","review":"We bought this phone with the hopes of having one corded phone (in case of power outages) and one cordless phone. The cordless phone works intermittently. It does not matter how close or far you are from the base, sometimes the volume just cuts out. It does not hang up on the person you are talking to, just the volume acts as if it drops down to \\"1\\" and you can't hear what they are saying. We now can only use the corded phone.In the past I have been very happy with Uniden, I will be returning this phone perhaps for a Motorolla."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uniden Service","review":"I bought my new Uniden phone from Amazon and found upon setting it up that it did not ring or go to the answering machine. I called the customer support number in the users manuel and they told me I would have to return it to the address listed. I did that and waited almost a month for a replacement. The replacement was an old, rebuilt dirty unit with nicks and scratches. That's Uniden's replacement for a new phone that doesn't work. Not good customer relations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Like other reviews have stated the cordless is absolutely horrible! Theres a lot of static even when I'm right next to the base, how crazy is that? Theres random clicking noises (is someone tapping my phone line?? no it's just a poorly made unit) and don't think about moving far away from the base, because you wont hear a thing.The corded unit is OK, it has a pretty cool recording feature that lets you record your conversation, but theres an annoying beep you hear every 10 seconds or so and the other person can hear it too.Well I think I'll return this to where I bought it, I thought it would be good since I live in an apartment and don't need much range for a cordless phone, but even standing next to the base it I get horrible static. Pfft buh bye."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little Disappointed","review":"Before I purchased this product I researched Consumer Reports. This phone rating well with CR. I also read some of the reviews on Amazon's site. Well the cordless handset had a little static and the call was not clear. Also, people kept complaining of not being able to hear me on the speaker phone on the base.Needless to say my Uniden 5198 is headed back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Range bad bad bad","review":"What a disappointment. This phone had very low range so tommorow it goes back. I had no problem with the base station but the cordless phone was noisey and I couldn't walk very far before it craped out. It would be a great phone if you wanted to stay in the same room with the base station."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handsets are junk, Never worked from beginning","review":"I purchased this phone at an office supply store. It was on sale and it happened to be the last one they had in stock. My old set was Uniden and I never had a problem before. I charged the handsets for 24hrs, one never worked. I called the 'customer service' (as others have said, I use that term lightly) they told me to do some things to try and fix problem. When nothing worked they said it was a bad handset and I should return it to the store, because they would need me to send them proof of purchase and I WOULD HAVE TO PAY shipping and handling on the replacement!?!! huh!!?? I said I would return it to the store. I went to the office supply web site to find another store that had the item in stock, the closest was almost 20 miles away. I went and they exchanged it for me. I just charged the new set and now 2 of the units are not working. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Answering machine don't work voIP","review":"The answering machine works only part of the time with road runner. outside of that the phone is good. great customer support from office depot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! great phone","review":"This phone is an amazing value for the money. The LCD display on the base is crystal clear, the speakerphone works great, programming and setup couldn't have been easier. I wall mounted the base and it is designed in such a way that even that was easy. I liked that you could tuck the adapter cord up into base so it isn't hanging down. Programming speed dials was easy and the answering machine feature works well. I thought the sound quality on the cordless handset was outstanding. I would highly recomend this phone, it is well constructed and looks like it will last for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"more features adds a frustration factor","review":"I thoroughly researched cordless phones before buying Uniden and was surprised and happy that the replacement had many more features at a price substantially less than our five-year old Uniden: corded base as well as remote cordless handset; digital screens on base and remote for caller ID and speed dial/redial features and a plug for optional headset use, something that helps me a great deal. The negative: speed dial programming. The old Uniden model programming was intuitive, something that took about fifteen seconds. The new speed dial allows for entering a name with the speed dial number and a process that has my owner's manuel dog-eared from use. Press a wrong button and it's start over time. Yowch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uniden review","review":"This is not a great phone. The cordless phone has static and makes some weird clicking sounds. You can't take the cordless too far from the base. I wouldn't buy this phone again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dependable!","review":"With phones these days, you can get a 5.8 with caller id for cheap, but the battery and sound quality are horrible...this phone was reasonable, and I can actually hear the voice without any buzz or fuzziness! It is also dependable...when I want to use it it works! Is that so much to ask for in a phone? I was beginning to think it was. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good Product","review":"This is one of the best phone's that i have used, i bought this for my residence, and am very happy with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Range","review":"the range is not so good. i can only use it at about 15 metersfrom the base before you start getting distortions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jerry FL","review":"I am disappointed in the phone. The display is almost impossible to read except in bright light. The base has no battery back-up, so if you lose power, you lose your greeting and speed-dial numbers. The unit has an \\"in use\\" light, but it only works if you are using the remote, not the base. It should be called \\"remote in use\\". Given the cost of the unit, and it's good rating by Consumer Reports, which why I bought it, I think you can find much better equipment out there at comparable prices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cordless Phone System","review":"We needed to replace a telephone and answering system, due to age of the old system. The Uniden system has proven to be a very suitable replacement. The instructions are very complete and understandable. The ringer is distinctive and quite loud. Sound quality is quite good. The only drawback is the delay between pressing a number key and the tone associated with it. Overall, we are very pleased with the phone system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very noisy","review":"I bought this phone because it had the functions I needed like Answering machine, speakerphone, corded and cordless phones. But like a couple of other reviewers, I was very disappointed with amount of noise specially with the cordless phone, and mostly for the people on the receiving end. I tried two sets of this phone from different stores and I returned them both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Houston, we have a problem","review":"This is a nice compact and easy to use base phone. However, the analog cordless phone that is part of the package is not clear, has static, and cuts off conversations after 5 minutes. I keep it in the charging base, and I don't think it is placed too far away from the base. The base unit is in my kitchen and the cordless is on my desk in my office. I estimate about 40'away in a ranch home. I also purchased a hands-free microphone to wear so I can use my computer while I talk, but the same problem of static and cut-off happens. If Uniden feels the cordless is too far away from the base, then it is basically useless. Why have a cordless if you can walk to the next room to answer the phone? I am going to contact Uniden online and if they have no solution will return the phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"I bought this product based on a recommendation from Consumer Reports magazine. It is easy to figure out and use, and comes with good instructions. I like that you can enter the phone number before you actually dial it - easy to correct mistakes. The digital answering machine is nice, too - no more tapes! A solid unit that has fulfilled all my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cordless is useless","review":"I've had this phone for over a year. I've purchased Uniden in the past and thought quality wouldn't be an issue. However, like many reviewers here, the handset is horrible. I have a small apartment and the cordless either frequently has static or cuts out completely. On a positive note- the answering machine and base work great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk don't buy","review":"Since day 2 the cordless handset has been defective. The customer support is horrendous and each time I call they want me to unplug the main line and charge for 12-15 hours. Stall tactics at best, frustrating always. Each call (4 times) was a minimum of 20 minutes on hold.I finally got them to send a replacement, but it's going to cost me another $10.00 to ship the replacment.Do yourself a favor and buy this some place that actually stands behind their products as trying to return this is impossible once you open it and find it defective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for money","review":"Both the corded and the cordless are impressive. The reception is good and no interference/noise. The speakerphone in the corded has a good range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one I've found","review":"I have tried several cordless phones with answering machines. This is the best one so far. It also includes a wired handset which avoids power-outage problems.

It just celebrates whats popular and mainstream, and most popular/mainstream music is garbage. The Black Eyed Peas, Usher, Evanescence, and numerous other acts shouldent be at the grammies. Why not put on talented bands such as CKY, Malevolent Creation, or Cradle of Filth? You may not think those are the greatest bands ever (although in my opinion they are very good), but at least they have alot of talent. Dont support this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and record off the radio!","review":"For the past several days this week all the local radio stations have been constantly playing all of this year's Grammy nominated songs, especially if they were the songs that won. Almost all the songs on this CD have already been over played on the radio to begin with, so why would you want to spend up to $20 for a CD of songs which are already tired? If you're sort of old school like me, then you remember using blank tapes to record your favorite songs off the radio. Do that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Verdict Is In . . .","review":"YAAAAAAAAWWWWWWNNN! Don't even bother buying and listening to this CD.

Where's Jay-Z's 99 Problems? Or any Kanye West song? Or Velvet Revolver? Those few should have packed punch to this ballad heavy album. But that's the Grammys--they like to play it safe instead of taking chances. Alicia Keys, Brian Wilson, Ray Charles,Gretchen Wilson, Joss Stone, Norah Jones, Josh Groban, Seal and others are some good choices here. But the ballad mode makes the album drag. It's best to have quality, safe songs here, but I'd like some crazy, rocking wild stuff on here too! And that's what makes the album fall short!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction!","review":"McGrath gives an introduction, that inspires you to go on reading theology.

So far it's been very captivating, informative and of course factual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great logical introduction to Christian theology","review":"I haven't finished this book yet but it's great so far. The author starts off by giving a brief history of Christianity which I think is the logical thing to do. The history provides the context that author would use to explain theology. In each historical period, the author also summarizes key theological developments and important figures. They are then discussed in detail later in the book. At the end of each chapter, the author lists books that you can read if you were interested in any topic discussed in the chapter. Great book. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth 44 Cents","review":"I got this book because there were 60 copies available and one cost only 44 cents on Amazon.com. Now I know why.

I have to wonder about the quality of the first one that apparently motivated the author to consider writing part two. Pretty slim pickins here."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Quality Stops Here!","review":"If this is a sequel to a first book written by this author, perhaps he should stop here and start in a new direction. Where does he get the ideas for an Amish boy in a T-bird and Elvis impersonators and Admiral Peary's expeditions? Not only do they not add up together, but they are not relevant. My suggestion is to find a theme like boy meets girl or Good vs. Evil and give it a Charles Dickens onceover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is a sort of pathetic effort.

I'll give it to Kline that he knows how to pick good texts but the music is just stagnant and fails to capture the intensity or drama of succesful minimalism, a school from which he clearly hails. His use of electric instruments makes pop-rock sound avant-garde and the interludes are incredibly tiresome sound-collage affairs.

The book is more short story than novel; don't let the number of pages fool you: the type is large and widely-spaced. It's an afternoon's reading, if that.

Having read his book, I must doubt this claim. I think his neither understands much of knifes nor of knive fighting. Beside some useful hints and stories that you may also find in other books on the subject, the all over impression of this book is disappointing. Trying to sell replicas of antique swords - such as the gladius or the rapier - as modern means of self defense is simply ridiculous. This is the 21st century and not the age of Spartacus or D'Artagnan! Moreover his evaluation criteria for the blades are very inconsistant and vary in the different chapters of the book. The book is full of statements (for example: the western art of fencing is superior to asian traditions) that seem to be subjective judgements. The author would have done well in using scrutinized facts instead. If you are interested in bying a good guide on combat blades you should rather try 'Battle blades' by Greg Walker."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"Seem to be doing good.

Once that happens I will update."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product must have been refurbished","review":"The product itself might have been good. I had a previous set that lasted me forever until I gave it away after I traveled last year. Honestly, I thought the system would have lasted a bit longer. It seems that the item might have been refurbished or repaired by some lousy technicians. Within 45 days or so, I lost the money I spent purchasing that trash. The Sub-woofer completely stopped functioning. I unplugged it immediately thinking it might have been overheated but ever since it never works again. I paid another 15 dollars to get it looked at but it was not worth the repair they told me.I got ripped off. I guess the bad economy explains why cheap items are sold online to to make a quick buck.Be wise, Amazon shoppers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent speaker system for the price","review":"I recently ordered these speakers from amazon and they're a great deal for the price. Using a soundblaster x-fi xtrememusic sounds awesome and it's able to take advantage of all the speakers. My only complaint is that there is no individual volume control for the speakers and the rear speakers seem a little bit quieter than the front speakers.The subwoofer does put out quite a bit of bump even on the lowest volume control.The headphone jack on the right speaker is extremely handy for someone who has to keep the sound level down at night. The only downside of this jack is the volume control knob does not control headphone volume.Overall it's a great entry level 5.1 sound system if you are looking to hear surround sound for games and movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong Bass But Bad Trebble and Muddy Sound","review":"Well, I bought this product because I read the good reviews from other amazon shoppers. I was a bit disappointed by the sound delivered by this system. I use them to listen to MP3 music on the net and that does not work well. The bass is strong and tight at low volume but becomes very loose when it is cranked up. The trebble is never good. I used the MS media player equalizers to adjust but that did not improve the clarity of sound. If you use this system to play video games (which I did not), you may find these speakers do a good job. But using them to listen to online music is whole different story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice system for small office or casual gamer/DVD watcher","review":"This is not a base pounding, blast your ears off speaker system. I paid $50 (delivered) and got a lot of system for my money.The setup was straight forward, with color coded inputs and speaker line ins to the subwoofer box. The sound isn't deep and rich and the power doesn't match the higher-end, more expensive speaker systems or the spacial complexity 7.1 systems. However, for my small office and casual DVD watching and game playing, it fits the $50 bill. It fills the room with decent bass and good surround sound.I wouldn't hesitate again to make this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"While I dont consider myself an audiophile, I do like to think of myself as someone who is not naive about audio. The speakers are really good for the prices you have to pay. Yes, the audio is technically only 2.1 with the the other two satellite speakers are just the front speakers split. But, who cares. 5.1 Satellite speakers only work with 5.1 capable sound cards. And yes, the sound is not as clear unless the speakers are pointed directly at you. But, this is more incentive to establish a well designed surround sound setup. I have used the speakers for music, tv, dvd and video games and can say that the dvd performance was the least impressive. But, on a whole, the speakers performed beyond my expectations for the price so I would recommend these for anyone interested in entering the 5.1 surround sound"},{"rating":"2","title":"best bag for the Buck","review":"I could not be happier with these speakers!!Crisp sound,5.1 audio and under $60.Nothing else in its price range can compete,even at 2x its price range.I like it so much I purchase additional sets for each pc I own (3 in total)Go to a local compusa(where they are more expensive) and listen to them and you will see what I am talking aboutI HIGHLY reccomend"},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech X-530 5.1 5-PieceSystem with Subwoofer Speaker","review":"I think that for the price you cant find a better speaker system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for PC,forget about DVD Player,XBOX, PSP etc.","review":"For budget PC speakers these rock. For most normal Human Beings this PC speaker set should suffice. Clear Sound, excellent Bass.However for DVD Players and XBOX you need to buy an adapter which Logitech claims \\"will convert it to 5.1\\". If you have a look at the instrument and its two Stereo RCA inputs you will realise the converter is Crapware that just gives you the same sound from Front and Rear speakers.

So I wouldn't fully recommend this for laptop users unless you will buy an external sound card. If you have the money, spend the extra 150 to get some Klispch or higher models of logitech. Creative is not bad either. But if you are on a budget, for 55 plus rebate, you CANNOT go wrong. I am fully satisfied, no problems, even delivery was way fast for budget shipping.

It's a conversation maker, sometimes people ask about that odd bulb on the lamp. No glass helps prevent breakage.Downs:Way too dim, the power I save doesn't compensate for the price (or at least not in the near future, maybe my grandchildren will see the break-even point happen?).In general, after reading the other reviews wasn't surprised, the description is somewhat misleading.

It does dim with an X10 LM465 Lamp Module, but it stays on very, very dimly when the module is off (probably due to the LM465's sense current). In summary, this unit is only worth being used as a night light, or possibly in a gooseneck fixture 6 inches from your head pointing directly at whatever you may want to read.

I loved the concept of someone having another life after they go to sleep at night. When I finally saw the movie, I really loved what they did with the storyline. The main character's sleepwalking is real but also a metaphor for his life - his life is out of his control. A series of events happen that \\"wakes\\" him up to the consequences of some of the choices he has made.

Allen Wolf has managed to recapture this spirit perfectly in his new independent film. Solid acting by Philip Winchester in the lead role and from the supporting cast as well makes the storyline engrossing and the characters believable. If you enjoy psychological drama, cerebral thrillers, or haunting suspense, then this film will surely reward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome mix of rock, rap, and hip hop","review":"This is a really excellent CD.

The software is generally very good, but it does have it's limitations in \\"customizability\\" for special accounting/ bookkkeeping requirements. I had hoped that I might also get some helpful workarounds in those areas from this book.

Like a said, a nice treat. This is the first book I've found that gave a CLEAR and interesting explanation of double-entry bookkeeping. (It doesn't make sense to learn QB if you don't pick up at least a **little** accounting rules along the way!)The \\"style\\" of this book is very friendly, and you'll find it is a very fast read; maybe it's because the explanations about WHY QB does things the way it does MAKES SENSE!Keep up the good work, Mr. Nelson, this book is a gem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"I am disappointed with this book. The author does not get to the important points, but distracts the readers with unnecessary details.

But he never did.Unless you have not used a computer for the last few years, you will not learn much from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect Information","review":"There isn't a lot of good, practical information in this book, because the author spends too much time on non-Quickbooks information and wisecracks. However, when I had a problem, the information in this book was wrong.My bank reconciliation didn't work, and I looked up the solution in this book. The picture of the reconciliation window the author used to explain the problem wasn't the same as the window in Quickbooks. The author's \\"solution\\" was to let QuickBooks make a change to my records - which my accountant won't accept. I finally went to a bookstore and found another book, which gave a clear explanation of the problem, how it happened, and how to fix it (it was the QuickBooks Official Guide by Ivens).This book is not only missing important instructions for Quickbooks users, some of the instructions that are in the book are wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Almost half of this book has nothing to do with using Quickbooks, and the half that talks about Quickbooks instructions is shallow and almost useless. Every time something confused me when I tried to decide how to use the Quickbooks features, I looked it up in this book. Half the time there was no information, and the rest of the time the information was less helpful than the instructions that appeared on the Quickbooks screen. I ended up calling my accountant so often, he told me buy a book. When I told him I'd already bought this book, he told me to buy the other bestselling book on Quickbooks , which is the one he used. He was right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap products at ripoff postal rates.............................","review":"If you want a cheap version of a Beatle keychain and want to pay over $4 to have it shipped to you, then this is your place to shop!

His parents called me to tell me thank you and asked where I got it so they could get him more of the kits from the Magic School Bus series. I bought the one of space for my son and he (and I) have equally loved it and learned a lot. I bought this gift almost 6 months ago and when I was at their house about 3 weeks ago, I noticed he had his poster of the human body (which was a lot larger than I expected it to be) hung up on his wall across from his bed. I would highly recommend this (and any Magic School Bus kit) for any budding young scientists."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than I expected!","review":"I teach a small group of home schoolers aged 5-8 based on these kits and this kit was a win! Kids loved doing the lung expansion experiment (although I got water all over the place). I'm not sure if they changed the sizes, but our human body poster with stickers was life-sized. I used 4 kits for 12 kids and they were able to share with few extras being purchased (from the grocery store). I combined it with the \\"The World of Germs\\" kit for the semester. We watched \\"Inside Ralphie\\" which is about germs and the human body to tie it all together.If you choose to bend bones, the thinner ones work best but still have to soak for hours to work. Most of the experiments have immediate results, so even younger kids may enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great supplement for science curriculum","review":"I home school our sons (ages 7 and 10). We co-op with another family with boys the same ages. We used this set to supplement the curriculum we were using on the human body. We were able to use the experiments and outlines the kit provided.

While much of the salary data is out of date, it cites the sources of the data which is usually the key indutry trade group.

I also wanted something that was not bulky, and would not show through if I was wearing light colored clothing.

Although some may complain about the seemingly lack of variety in the jobs showcased (I tend to disagree), the ten steps themselves may be applied to a resume for any job.

The next week the 2nd chair broke the same exact way. The styrofoam must not handle the stress of gamers over any length of time. I suppose if you just sat in them and did not lean back - they might last a full 2 months, better yet don't let anyone sit in them and they'll possibly last until the styrofoam deteriorates.

A good 90 minutes of entertainment, if you like yours disturbing and gritty.A documentary filmmaker witnesses a man's fairly horrific suicide and goes searching for the nature of terror in the old tunnels beneath Tokyo. There, along with a strange homeless man and a (possible) ghost, he finds a young girl. She is naked, mute, and chained to a wall. He does what anyone might do in such a situation, right? He frees her, takes her home, and keeps her like a pet. It seems to be working out all right, until he finds that the girl has a strong preference for drinking human blood.It's a creepy but sometimes sensuous little movie. I liked it mainly because it doesn't try to overplay anything; it sets an effective tone and sticks to it, and never really shows its hand fully. Lots of good mood-setting and a few gory payoff moments as well, an interesting story and good actors. Not bad at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Madness Is Contagious\\"...","review":"MAREBITO concerns a man obsessed w/ the power of terror, and his descent into the abyss.

I also like that this car seat eventually converts to a backless booster that she can keep using as long as legally required in our state. The only drawback is that this is a car seat that requires parents' teaching and limit-setting with those independent kiddos that figure out they can unbuckle by themselves now!

The film was awarded the Palme D'Or at the Cannes film festival in 1982. Yilmaz Guney wrote the script and smuggled it out when he himself was in prison for his Political thoughts and views.So he had a insight into the lifes of these people. The film is of excellent Quality and truely reflects the hardship faced by similar people of the time and place.

So many details that they talked about in the book was not told. and the fact about her dad ... am sorry but after several years of not seeing my father from him passing away and coming back and he is alive, I would of been running to see him!All in all its a good book to read :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"ENJOYABLE AS AN AUDIO---","review":"This series was not one that I enjoyed sitting down to read (didn't consume my attention) but was perfect to listen to while I did something else thanks to the entertaining talent of the narrator, Phil Gigante. I found this particular book better than the previous two (Beyond The Highland Mist/To Tame A Highland Warrior) because it did not have the Constant Bickering between the hero/heroine that weighed the other two down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical!","review":"I had seen previews for \\"The Highlanders' Touch\\" about 2 weeks before it came out and I knew then this would be a great book and I was not disappointed in the least. Circenn's metamorphosis emotionally was well written and thought provoking as was Lisa's. The fae elements in the book were very well written as were the time travel passages. All in all an absolutely wonderful and magnificent book. Kudos to Ms. Moning. A+++++++"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Ending.","review":"Karen Marie Moning is one of my favorite authors, and I loved this book EXCEPT for the ending. I was somewhat disappointed because I felt that the ending ruined my perception of Adam Black (who I fell in love with in Karen's first book \\"Beyond the Highland Mist\\"). The ending was also so unbelievable , it was like she was trying so hard to make the ending super-happy, and it would have been better if she would have kept the story down on the ground with a good dose of reality, instead of up in the clouds. Now, don't get me wrong, I know time-travel isn't exactly what you would call reality either, but that's a good fantasy, and what happeded at the end of this book is not. You'll just have to read the book and see what I'm talking about.Other than that, the first 95 percent of the book was filled with wit and humor and great characters. Time-travel romances are the best, especially Scottish ones, in my opinion. I do recomend this book, even with it's flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but She's written Better","review":"This was the first book I've read by Karen Marie Moning, and I was pleasantly surprised. We read it for book club, and she was an author no one had even heard of, but after reading Highlanders Touch, I went out and read her other two books. Although I liked Highlanders Touch, I really liked Beyond The Highland Mist. I found Lisa to be a pathetic women. Her situation was difficult, but it seemed she allowed it to make her bitter. My favorite character, who I wasn't at first sure of was Adam Black. The super-natural addition was something I don't typically enjoy in books, but did in this one. I would recommend reading this, but I would probably read her other two books first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely rushed fairy tale","review":"After reading all the positive reviewing about Karen Marie Moning Highlander series, I finally decide to read this book. What a disappointment! This is an extremely rushed fairy tale, the drama and suspense is childish and uneven, the love story inadequately rooted and the resolution just a bit pat. An easy read and quickly to forget novel without skills or history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whaaat?","review":"I am astounded that the average rating for this book is so high. The storyline is rushed, and the writing is poor at best. Most grade-school children could write with the degree of complexity that Moning has achieved with this work. If you are looking for quality romance (Diana Gabaldon, Judith McNaught, etc.) I advise you to avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"In love with the Highlander!","review":"I want more!!

I have read the Karen Marie Moning Fever series and loved it. But, this series is way different. Honestly, doesn't even seem like the same author. This book is fantasy to the nth degree. I can't say enough about it. I really enjoyed the story line, the characters, the writing, everything! Just started Kiss of the Highlander and I just know I won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time it took to travel to the bookstore","review":"When I started the book and Lisa was thrown back in time by touching the flask, I was intrigued. Once she gets back and the whole \\"fairy\\" theory gets going, all I can think is \\"unbelievable\\". Really. The hero is hundreds of years old because he's immortal and in order to keep his heroine with him, he has to go into the future and change her past so that she can accept staying in the past with him!? Too hard to believe. Not a good read, in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the first two books in this series..","review":"This book is a fun, entertaining and engaging read, but lacks the 'pop' of the first two books by Karen Marie Moning, \\"Beyond the Highland Mist\\" and \\"To Tame a Highlander\\". The reappearance of the character of fairy \\"fool\\" Adam Black was fun, and there was definitely a twist to his character I hadn't expected, that I also found to be entertaining.Unfortunately, the character of Lisa was just not as likeable a heroine as Adrienne and Jillian were (from the first two books), nor did I understand the mind reading ability that seemed to be 'plunked' into the book. Circenn was as seductively attractive and fascinating as the other heros, but he, too, seemed to pale in comparison to Grimm and Hawk.I truly did enjoy this book on a fun, light hearted level. But I definitely prefered the first two books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Part of a long tradition","review":"There's actually a long tradition of hatchet-job novels written by the spurned lovers of famous writers. Sinclair Lewis and Thomas Wolfe both felt the axe in their day.

The book claims that abusers having low self-esteem is a myth, which much research and a friend of mine who is a therapist disagrees with. (from his personal experiences too) Perhaps the author is only seeing one side of his clients - the front that these people present to the world that hides their insecurities and false beliefs. The book does a good job of classifying the different types of abuse and the different stages of abuse, but appears to miss the core of the problem. The author seems rather biased siding with victims. (Victims need an advocate, but this isn't going to solve their problem.) Yes, an abuser deserves no excuses - but I believe there are core problems/perspectives of people who abuse that are not being covered in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This book is such an important read for every woman. An eye-opening look into the world of abuse and all it encompasses. So worth every penny paid to purchase it and every moment spent reading it. Read it and become aware of the way these types of men think and relate to women. It could easily save your life and most definitely your spirit if you are involved with an angry and controlling man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please read even if you are not sure you are being abused","review":"I read this book because I suspected I had been abused by my ex. I left him very uncertainly and solely on the basis of my gut and his recent intolerable treatment of me. I was sorely tempted to go back to him because he was kind to me at times.Four weeks later, I am vindicated by this book. Also, it has helped me heal because now I understand that it was not my fault, I am not a stupid, narrow minded woman who has no idea how to dress/how to attract men and so on and so forth. I understand that the abusive man is very subtly manipulative and there are really very few things one can do to change him (the author does describe how in the book, though in my case I decided moving on was a better choice). I also know now never to go back to him.Thank you, Dr.Bancroft, for publishing this insightful book. This is one woman you have helped very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and helpful","review":"After leaving an abusive relationship I spent much time pondering what I had done wrong, blaming myself and my inadequacies, and what I should have done to make to prevent the abuse. He was charming and everyone liked him, so I thought it must have been me.This book described my ex-partner in eerie detail, as well as a number of situations I had been in. The information was clear, backed up with appropriate examples, and the author was honest in his perceptions and how they had changed over time.It helped me realise whose problem it really is, why it was never going to get better, how unlikely it was that he was going to change, and how to see through the 'hearts and flowers' stage. And, more importantly, how lucky I am to be free from the abuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lundy Bancroft GETS it","review":"This book is the only one I've read the truly GETS it. It was like the author had met my abuser personally. This book is so validating, and names what abusers do. The book also provides valuable tips on leaving an abuser, on spotting an abuser before you get trapped, and how to help a friend or family member who is in an abusive relationship. This is THE book to read on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life-changing insight","review":"I can't think of much to say that hasn't already been contributed by the fantastic reviewers posting before me, so I'll keep this short.

I've read this 400-page book three times in the last month and have underlined almost every-other line, even though I've never been 'hit' by my spouse.My life is changed, because before reading this book I didn't see all the games, digs and subtle manipulations. I only felt overly-sensitive, depressed, isolated, drained, crazy --- AWFUL. But now I see it and by seeing it, I can act on it. God bless Lundy Bancroft for this book. May its message spread and heal all those ignorantly remaining in relationships patterned by disrespect."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life!","review":"This book helped me to realize that my situation with my husband was really much worse than I had ever let myself believe. I spent the last 16 years making excuses for his bad behavior. But when I looked at it differently I knew I had to get out. I think the book may have saved my life. My husband has such a sense of entitlement - just everything is his way or no way. This book made me see that it just isn't normal or healthy to be controlled, threatened, and intimidated by your partner. It also made me feel that I wasn't alone - that a lot of people go through the same thing. Within less than a week after reading this book my husband and I separated. I haven't felt more at peace and in control of my own life in years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Does He Do That","review":"Great book! Every woman, every teenage young girl,every teenage boy should read this book. This book is so helpful in understanding the victim role.

This book should be required reading for every high school student that wants to graduate."},{"rating":"2","title":"VALIDATED AT LAST","review":"This is a life changing book. I found myself underlining something on almost every page and writing my agreements in the margins. I urge anyone who is in an abusive relationship or has been in one to read this book. It is essential to understanding those type of men who abuse. If I had read this book when I first got married,it would have saved me from 33 years of abuse waiting and hoping he would change. I left 2 years ago but still struggled with my fears and mixed emotions. People think it should be easy to get out but this book explains so well the many reasons it isn't. When I finished reading it, I felt it was finally over. At last, I felt validated and learned that those nagging feelings I had for so many years were right. Now, there's no looking back, I'm free.I haven't found any other book that explains how those men think.A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Share This With Book Everyone I Know!","review":"This is one of those books that is so chocked full of information and common sense advice that you just have to share it with everyone around you. It is a great resource for those who believe they might be in an abusive relationship, know they are or know someone else who is. It helps make it easier to understand why these men do what they do and how you can deal with this issue. This is always a great book to have handy. You never know when you will have a friend, family member, co-worker, etc. that may need your help. This book can help bring logic to what may be a very chaotic and confusing way of life. A great book for therapists and counselors as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally there was light in that dark tunnel that I was trapped in!","review":"This the best material that I have ever read about abusive relationships. Without laying my hands on this book I think I would still have been stuck in that dark tunnel.There must be some information that relates to you if you think you're in an abusive relationship. This book can only do GOOD; there is NO HARM in reading it.My heartfelt thanks to the Writer.* Peaches *"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful!!!","review":"This is an unbelievably powerful, eye-opening must read. What is so amazing about this book is that Lundy has a way of piecing all the confusion apart so that it makes sense. A huge part of abuse is the confusion--the good times I've had with my husband that are enmeshed with all the subtle tactics of control used. I have been confused in the last 22 years, and it helps me to sort out what has caused me so much confusion. Even if you're not sure if you should read this book, you NEED to read this book. Maybe it won't apply to your situation, but if it does, it will completely change your life for the better. You have a lot more at stake to lose if you don't read it.

But I worked hard to make it work. It wasn't until someone close to me expressed their fear about my relationship that I started to question it.

But, by being prepared, you can minimize any effect they'll have on you.If you feel like your relationships problems are your fault, but you're not sure why, buy this book.

It is well-written and understandable. It doesn't get bogged down in technical terminology but cuts straight to the point, which is understanding why angry men act the way they do. The examples given by the author really help you recognize and understand hidden patterns in your relationships with spouses, fathers, co-workers and others who may be controlling you without you fully realizing what is going on. It is also helpful in understanding why women you know stay with these men and what they are really going through. It's hard for these women to see clearly what is happening and muster the strength to leave but it isn't their fault. They are being controlled. If there are angry, controlling men in your life or the life of someone you love, it's worth buying this book for insight and perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best information ever","review":"If you are looking to read about abuse this is the book. I have read many and this is very informative on your abuser and for you. READ IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it to someone you care about","review":"I wish I had read this book in high school or college and been aware of the different tactics of abusive men. As Bancroft writes, \\"\\"When the world catches on to the abuser, his power begins to melt away.\\" Indeed, knowledge of these types of men and their favorite manipulations is POWER. Bancroft outlines them so sharply and clearly that it would be hard not to recognize if you (or someone you love) is with one of them.I believe that a lot of what he writes would also help men who are in a relationship with an abusive woman (I don't know of any book that deals specifically with female-on-male abuse, but I'd love to find one.)I can't recommend this book highly enough, and the problem it describes is so insidious and soul-destroying that it should be required reading for anyone who is or plans to be in a romantic relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book on Abuse!","review":"This is a great, and easily read and understood book on abuse.

Anyone who has ever had a \\"gut feeling\\" that something was wrong or felt wrong in a relationship will gain clarity from reading this book. Being able to see the other side of the coin helped me realize that the ugly treatment I have gotten over the years was not my fault, that men who are controlling and/or abusive have their own agenda, and that some of the coping mechanisms I developed over the years were actually playing into the man's plan for further control and abuse. This book also validated my hurt feelings and gave me alternatives in dealing with abusive men.Best of all, knowing the warning signs and characteristics of angry and/or controlling men will help me avoid future relationships with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light Bulb Moment","review":"I have spent years with a man who is mostly great, but when we fight, verbally and emotionally abusive. We have spent hours, maybe days, trying to figure out why he \\"loses control\\" -- what in his past or history causes that level of anger and hatred to rise up. This book was the break-through. It forced both of us to look at it from a different perspective -- it isn't about a bad history or default emotional reactions, it's about control. Luckily, he is in a place in his life where he wants to change, so he was able to look at this with an open mind. But regardless, for me, this book was life-altering and possibly life-saving."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for Stephanie Meyer fans","review":"I recommend this book all the time for fans of the Twilight series by Stephanie Meyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, even if you have not been physically abused.","review":"This book was recommended to me in a class I attended for women who have experienced abuse of some kind. I was not physically abused, but the book clearly explains that it was written for all forms of abuse, and you can read what applies to your situation. It has given me incredible insight that has helped me understand what was behind abusive behaviors, and my unhealthy reaction to them. Sometimes I was amazed at how closely this book reported my own life experience, and it made me feel better that I was not the only one living with my shame and secrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wife receives Wake-Up Call!!!","review":"I have been married for six years to a man who has become increasingly abusive--emotionally, verbally, financially, and sexually. I fell into a major depression this year, close to a nervous breakdown. I went to counseling for years and sought intervention from numerous people. My husband told me it was all \\"me\\". A social worker told me that he saw warning signs of physical violence in the relationship. I went to the bookstore and discovered Mr. Bancroft's book. It confirmed everything I feared, I am an abused wife! I am a strong, independent, professional, educated woman! How could this happen?! I don't know that yet, but it's done and I'm responding. This book has been an incredible resource for me in answering to the manipulation and control of my husband. I have left him and I am SAFE! I thank God for Lundy Bancroft and his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"For anyone who has tried and tried and tried to either understand, make peace with, or HOPE an angry/controlling man will CHANGE... YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK.... Reading this book has started me on a path to being in charge of my own life for the first time in many years. This book is clear and concise yet its message is very powerful. Angry and Controlling men are very very difficult to live with and almost impossible to change--why should they??--they almost ALWAYS get what they want one way or another. Their sense of entitlemant and almost total lack of empathy makes them very poor choices for a loving and respectful relationshp. The author addresses the dynamics of living with an angry and controlling man in a honest, direct manner borne of a lot of experience. It is easy to read, understand and; unfortunately for some of us, easy to identify with.Reading this book is very affirming and validating to women who live with and endure someone who is angry and controlling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intellectually Dishonest","review":"I just read this book after my wife adopted it as her new bible. She believes she has identified certain parallels in our relationship as described in the book and she now seeks to end our marriage.The pain this has caused me is immeasurable and the book itself is completely void of any counsel as to how couples might work through these problems. It simply taps into the culture of women's empowerment by way of victimization and suspicion--a lucrative market to be sure!Bancroft's folly here is like a sham research project designed to sustain a predetermined outcome. There are many subtle reasons why people behave the way they do and behavioral patterns are not always iron-clad evidence of a single root cause. Bancroft's book is dangerous, intellectually dishonest, and devoid of any professional crediblity or positive insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Why Do I Let Him Do This\\" or \\"Why Do I Put Up With This\\"","review":"At first, it was cool, and I was like I should treat these feezys better......as the reading continued, I thought a more appropriate title would be, \\"Why Do I Let Him Do This\\" or \\"Why Do I Put Up With This\\" *shrugs*The book is basically bull. It could convince any angry woman that her husband is abusive. My mom read this and came up the craziest types of abuse. This guy does not know what he's talking about. It's basically blames men for any little thing that goes wrong. Abuse is wrong but when abuse is defined as any little thing you do wrong in the eyes of your partner, that's where you know this author is full of bull.I say peak at it so you can recognize abusive behaviors in your partner. However, fingers are rarely pointed at self. I could seriously write a book using all the same bulleted points titled \\"Why Are You Still With Me\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard feminazism that ignores women's violence towards men","review":"This is the standard feminist diatribe which offers the (false) presumption that men account for all violence and abuse between the sexes. Martin Fiebert of Cal State Long Beach has published a compendium of research which has found that women batter men as often as the converse. Unfortunately, the domestic violence industry, and other bastions of radical feminism (including the mainstream media) have ignored these findings for over 30 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why does he do that?","review":"I am a marriage counselor, and I give this book to many battered women. It is excellent. I have my wife order them often.

I would recommend it not only for women who are in abusive relationships, but also for all parents. The chapter on myths is very insightful. All those reasons we typically hear about why men abuse women (and/or children) are myths. They do it because their belief system (the one they were taught by their families or society) tells them that they are entitled to be in control in the home and treat others as inferior to them. It becomes clear that this kind of thinking is a problem with not only abusive individuals, but our society as a whole. Those kinds of attitudes that the abusive men have, seem to me very much like \\"the root of all evil\\". It's time for our society to understand and overcome this problem which produces violent and controlling men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative - It helped!","review":"The book was very informative! I bought it after leaving a very controlling man. It helped me to understand the mind of a controlling abusive man, and the tactics they use. It gave me strength through a very difficult time. I highly recommend this book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sobering look at how abusers manipulate","review":"When I left my ex-husband this was the book I was recommended by the domestic violence agency who worked with me. I read this book and it has become my bible of sorts. It touches upon the different types of abusers, how they manipulate, what Batterer's Treatment entails, and that abusers typically do NOT change. For ANYONE healing from a relationship in which they were abused, I recommend this as a must-read. When you're going through the healing process, you have so much on your mind, and this book can help you realize and see what you are dealing with or what you might have missed on."},{"rating":"2","title":"enlightening","review":"An empowering book, the author makes no excuses for abusive men nor does he engage in blaming victims.

I have a daughter going through a two year divorce. I always thought she had an unhappy marriage but until I read this book I did not realize she was an \\"abused woman\\". Lundy Bancroft was right on target with most of his observations. I found this book to be quite helpful in understanding what she has been going through and why he does what he does. This really should be required reading for divorce lawyers. If men take offense, maybe they should step back and question why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!! A MUST READ for people in abusive relationships!!","review":"Why Does He Do That?: Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men by Lundy Bancroft was an amazing find for me. I had been looking for quite sometime for a book to help me through a very difficult long relationship which had ended due to mainly abuse. I found this book to be one of the BEST books I have ever read on the topic of understanding why men abuse women the way they do, what goes through their minds and I found myself checking off exactly what I had been through on each page. It was nice to hear there were more women out there who had been through similar situations or worse and I was not alone. I felt almost a relief upon reading this and the depression had slowly diminished.I highly recommend this book, and HAVE to other people and friends of mine who had gone through bad relationships...I am glad I bought this book! It helped me so much get through such a difficult time in my life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no credentials","review":"For a professional field that values degrees and certifications. Lundy Bancroft has No degree, no certifications, no license, and no research cited in most of his books. Just saying! His writings are trash and do harm to many innocent men. He is a fraud!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feminist View Of Abuse","review":"As a professional counselor I appreciated that the author did not offer excuses for any type of abuse. Much of what he said is very true. However, this book is written from a feminist prospective. To the casual reader any behavior of a male can be misconstrued as abusive.Likewise, he does not discuss the issues of verbal and/or physical female abuse, On page 97 and in chapter 5 he actually implies that if a male claims to be the victim of an abusive female that he probably was (and is) abusive. He also suggest that a man who questions a woman's assertion of abuse is likewise an abuser.This book may help a codependent woman to finally come to her senses and leave an abusive situation. However, it may result in some men getting falsely accused of abuse by a Borderline wife or significant other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Lifesaver!","review":"This book has changed my life forever! It's totally amazing. I liked it so much I bought another copy and gave it to my friend. She in turn has told others and are now asking them to read it.

Thanks Lundy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable","review":"In my search for information to help me understand and recover from my abusive marriage, I found this book. Instead of comforting me and talking about MY feelings, this book helped me to understand how my husband really viewed me. It revealed his thinking, and what role I really played in his life. This information was shocking. In this book, my husband was described with amazing accuracy, his actions, his words... and the thinking behind them. My confusion is gone. My pain is gone. I still have a ways to go before I feel fully recovered, but this book helped me to make huge leaps in that direction. If I had known the warning signs of abuse, which are all listed and explained in this book, I think I would have been spared what my children and I went through. I am grateful to Mr. Bancroft for making this book available to abused women everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource","review":"As a therapist working with women involved in abusive relationships, I found this book to be very helpful to them and recommend it to most of my clients. As a clinician, I think there are many contradictions, but then, it wasn't written for me. Particularly helpful was the chapter on change."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIBLE on abuse","review":"I'm so thankful I read this book. He puts to words, what I never could. He explains what it is like to be in a relationship with an abusive mate. Why they act the way they act, and most importantly that you are NOT crazy. This book has given me so much knowledge and strength."},{"rating":"2","title":"An authoritative and insightful read...unfortunately, a page turner.","review":"Take your time reading this book. There is much to be learned from its practice. An important read, but it's sad that some women, like me, need to be informed in this area. I'm ready for change, although I'm scared.

Geez. It is 2009 and women can divorce a man at the drop of a hat. If you are being abused, leave the relationship. There. I just saved you ten bucks!The worst thing about this book is that it is a self help book with no scientific studies to back up Bancrofts statements,absolutly none. He could have made all this up to get on Oprah's book list, only to be exposed as a fraud.I did an extensive internet search, and there is no information as to his education level. The guy may not even graduated from high school.Unfortunatally for me, I am required to read this in a college class of all places.

At times, the truth hurts while reading, it hits close to home but it a great reminder and helps you to understand and see the light. It's scary to think that I am not the only person that has experienced some of the incidences, but it is also very helpful to see how easily it is to be manipulated. I am more aware now of what to look for. I have read other self-help type books, but none were as detailed as this one. I recommend this book to others, I even showed it to my therapist, she's thrilled I'm reading it. There are a broad range of topices to be covered, this is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help for victims of abusers","review":"An outstanding book cover-to-cover. Very revealing.

It identifies abusive behaviors, why some women won't leave the abuser, what they can do if they are being abuse, how to get out of the abusive situation and what to do if you are a friend or family member of someone being abused.It won't solve your problems and it won't help you change the abusers behavior but it will educate you on what to look for and a little bit about what to do in this type of situation.Good luck to all of you who are needing this book right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Original recordings","review":"My personal crusade continues - I want Amazon to let people know when they are buying a CD that has re-recordings by the original artists. Personally, I hate them. At first, you enjoy the songs, then as you sing along like you used to when you heard them on the radio, suddenly, it is just a bit different. Usually, the vocals are not quite as powerful or energetic. After a while it really starts to annoy you. By the end of the disc, you are ready to toss the disc in the garbage. It's like that with this disc. Plus it annoys me that I was deceived into buying this disc when the original recordings are available.\\"Get Used to It\\" by Roger Voudouris is fairly difficult to come by. I recommend getting the \\"Have a Nice Day - Super Hits of the 70s\\" series by Rhino instead of this disc. Get the Rhino series while they are still readily available and reasonably priced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book is a disgrace to Japanese pop culture.

Since most of the entries feature pop culture from the late 1950s through the early 1990s, though, what I've ended up with is a lot of fun stories which the Japanese 30-somethings around me have never even heard!The result? Everyone thinks I'm that weird foreigner who knows about and likes Pink Lady, who knows how many members there were in SMAP when they first started, and all the different generations of Ultraman.The author lives in Japan, and does know what he's talking about.

All of which I cannot eat. So, this book has only 6 recipes I've earmarked.

As a cook in the service, I was a veteran on many a \\"steamer mission.\\" I was tickled pink (even steamed if you will) to see such a collection devoted to steamers. I would have given it five stars, except that it lacked what I would have considered a requisite discussion of the regional steamers such as the Pennsylvania Steamer or the Mississipi Hotshot.

My book is at home and I'm in the office). With book in hand, I tried to purchase one in Pasadena for something in that range. The best the dealer would do was $360. That will probably be typical of most of the rare pieces. Prices for common pieces are closer to reality. More discussion on relative rarety would have been helpful.

Imagine my shock to find that there were no copies of the book at my local bookstore and several large bookstores! Lisle's beautifully written novel is one that must not be overlooked. Children will be intoxicated by the mystery of the elves and Sara Kate's elf-like presence. But there are other issues at the heart of the book: how are those that are different in our society treated, especially the impoverished? What happens to children with parents who are unable to care for them? There are also several pertinent points on the theme of friendship--what makes a real friend and why one must choose them wisely. One step into Sara Kate's world and you'll be hooked.

Unfortunately, I was wrong.

Even though her snobby parents are clearly uneasy with this new friendship, Hillary comes to see Sara-Kate--and soon discovers a sad, and all too realistic, secret that her friend has been keeping.This is not a fantasy book.

The only thing Sara-Kate will say about her dad is, \\"He's on a Trip.\\" But Sara-Kate's magical garden, soon draws Hillary, a well-liked 4th grader into the magic of the elves.The elves have their own little village, houses, a ferris wheel, and a pool.

The story is terrible-some sort of cross between an attempt and fantasy and mystery and a realistic fiction book. Then the writing style is below expectations, too.

She walks toward the door to find... well you will have to find that out for yourself. Later on in the book Hillary begins to be really good friends with Sara-Kate. They were at a party at Sara-Kate's house when Hillary asked her if she was an elf, but before she could answer there was a knock on the door.

As the friendship grows, Hillary loses her skepticism about the elves, but she wonders about Sara-Kate. Why isn't she allowed to explore Sara-Kate's house? Why hasn't she been introduced to her parents? What is it that the elves see in Sara-Kate's messy yard?

Is there an abiotic portal hiding in one secret location?Gold's big drilling experiment in Sweden's Siljan Ring turned up nothing conclusive; the hydrocarbons could have been from nearby sedimentary seepage or reactions in the drilling mud itself. Skeptical reviews of Gold's work cite no real evidence for his claims. He was no dummy, but many people become crackpots in later years, or try to force pet theories to match reality.Mr. Gold is no longer alive and the whole topic of abiotic oil is speculative at best, with few other modern proponents.

It coroborates what russian petroleum geologists have known and applied for many years where they drill wells up to 13 km deep to tap crude oil nearer its source and far below where any surface biota could have been buried. Gold demonstrates that the theory of a biogenic origin of petroleum is wrong and cannot be sustained in the light of new information that is now available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent thinking outside the box by one of the old masters.","review":"Thomas Gold began his career in the fifties. Along with Herman Bondi and Fred Hoyle he practically invented modern cosmology. They may have missed the mark with their steady-state theory, but they predicted hydrocarbons in space. In this his final work he lays out the case for a deep well of those hydrocarbons having been part of the package when Earth was formed (along with at least ten other bodies in our solar system, several of which have been confirmed by more recent observations). The Deep Hot Biosphere proposes that life on Earth may have been made possible by the slow upward seep of those buried hydrocarbons, rather than the other way around as accepted theories hold. Thomas Gold made a career of turning accepted views upside down, and he was right more often than not. He could well be right on this one too. He lays out a strong case for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific book questioning old paradigms in science","review":"Professor Gold's book should be remembered as the text that caused the turning point in science. Questioning the origins of oil and how the earth operates, Gold explains his theory in full detail with the origins of the biogenic oil theory and how scientists are refusing to rethink the evidence.Gold uses strong references from his Russian colleagues and from his own work in the SIljan Ring oil drill. His theory about diamond formation is also very intriguing.It should be noted that Gold had a significant status as an astrophysicist, and only when he began arguing for the abiogenic theory did his funding and social status seem to get smaller. He makes references to this but it's important about the suppression that real scientists face going against controversial issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite Enough","review":"The book doesn't cover all the topics I had on the exam, and what it does cover it does without much depth.

Perhaps the most shocking aspect of it is to see now how all of that played out, how the economy got worse and worse, the war kept on going, CEOs used $100 million of the bail out money to give themselves a bonus, etc.If you have only seen his movies and never read his books, then you don't know the half of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sad","review":"He is fat; has a weight problem; looks like an over-inflated raft; etc. Is that the best all you cretins and Moore-haters out there can come up with? Please, don't be so petty! Turn off Fox News, then go read this book...Go...NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the book yourself and make your own opinion","review":"I read the book (should said listened to it) and found it very informative. If you actually bother to read the book and not just post negative comments you'll find he has some interesting points, scary facts and fairly good suggestions. I found the book both motivating and patriotic; I wish the \\"Right\\" would realize that democracy means everyone can have an opinion, not just the \\"conservatives\\". Nobody is always right and we all need to get along in this world, care about more than our own selfish needs. That's what this book teaches you. Enjoy. Also, Rightists, quit being so angry, you've got almost everything going your way, find something worthwhile to complain about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bless you, Michael Moore","review":"Great book, gutsy too. I hope he doesn't get wiped out because of it! Michael Moore delves into the powers that be in his unique, quirkish way with humor but also with the cold hard facts and proof to back them up. (just saw him speak at UMASS, Dartmouth, MA and he was wonderful)The book has a great crescendo ending, he is hopeful that we, the people will help his crusade...and there really is no other way out of this mess!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Detail, Lacks Index","review":"Although there is some repetition from \\"Stupid White Men\\" and there is a clearly a hot publishing trend in pushing out \\"liberal left outrage\\" books, the level of detail in this book on specific things that have gone wrong and specific lies and misleading communications from the Bush Administration make this an extraordinary reference work. Michael Moore has done the Democratic's political research for them.Unfortunately, the book suffers from no index. Had the publisher taken one man-week to do a decent index of specific topics and statements that the author has superbly researched and foot-notes, this book could have moved a Nation--as it stands, it will merely incite the already upset.Do buy the book--the details are wonderful and every American needs to understand the degree to which most public statments and most public reports about the Administration's policies are outright deceptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude, I've found several counties for ya.","review":"Dude, you're a Socialist/Communist/Marxists! Anyone of this persuasion has a choice of countries: Cuba, Laos, Libya, North Korea, The People's Republic of China, or Vietnam.

It is humorous. It has a lot of political facts that the mainstream media likes to ignore. However, it is VERY obvious that Michael Moore is a Democrat. Moore would like to place all the blame of American political and intelligence failures squarely at the feet of the Republican party. The sad fact is, BOTH parties have failed America. He states that the Clinton impeachment was \\"just about a stain on a blue dress.\\" Sorry Mr. Moore, but you obviously overlooked \\"Chinagate.\\" Before you blame all Republicans for simply being \\"stupid white men\\" you need to research some of the things your Democrat heroes have done. You will be none too happy.Mr. Moore, you are \\"almost there\\" -- once you realize that there is not a dime's worth of difference between the Republican and Democratic parties (in the words of George Wallace) you will get it right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, Michael Moore","review":"The best thing about the United States is that Michael Moore is free to write and publish a book like this and that we as Americans are free read it. Let's hope that, in the frenzy that the \\"war on terror\\" has become, we do not lose sight of the fact that these freedoms form the basic foundation of this great country, and that we owe it to ourselves and future generations to ensure that they are not abolished. To me, there is no more patriotic act."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bah. This is exactly what we dont need.","review":"How does Mike Moore think that he's \\"contributing to society\\" with this garbage? This kind of shock politics is exactly what shouldnt happen in a bi-partisan system. Michael Moore is a pretentious, overblown windbag like so many other liberals - much worse than the conservatives. He needs to stop touting his remarkable ability to complain, and come up with a few ideas about how to make America better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh boy","review":"In answer to the question \\"Dude, where's my country?\\" she's gone and has been for a while now. Thirty years ago communists were our enemy, now they're our elected officials. Michael Moore is too far out to appeal to any legitimate moderate liberal or conservative. Another example of the most vocal people (on either side) being starved for attention and unable to deal with issues without slinging mud. Sad really. I don't want to know where the country is, but \\"Dudes, where are the grownups?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Face it, you'll never be rich","review":"Yes, that's an actual title of a chapter from the book. By reading this book and believing garbage that is contained within you will live up to the title of that chapter, you'll never be rich. That pretty much wraps up this book, it's a negative book that tells you everything you can't do and why you can't do it. It never offers any real solutions, just gloom and doom.Basically this book will appeal to people who hate America. So if that sounds appealing to you, pick up the book because I'm sure you'll enjoy.However if you have even the slightest amount of hope about your future - run away from this book, run far far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow stupid white man","review":"The liar behind this book is far better than the liar in office. At least the Liar in office doesn't use bad statistics and doctored film to turn you against your neighbor. For every good point brought up in this hard bound piece of trash there is a fib and a half truth backing it up. While is it true that Neolibralism is leading us down the path to failure the steps Michael Moore makes in his logic are short sighted and filed with a terrible blinding bias."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does he want us to give up?","review":"Wow it has been a long time since I read a book that preached so much depression in an attempt to make me give up in life.

In this book, when he wrote in the 1st person as Christ, I found it distracting to the rest of the book and somewhat childish. When he wrote of the amount of money the Saudis have invested in our country, my attention was locked in. Its kinda like when you look at him and see his oafish mannerism and physique--it makes me wonder why this guy can't get himself into better shape so he can initially be taken seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy is out to Kill off any self confidence you may have","review":"Be warned this guy thinks No-one will suceed in this country.

Why do people even bother talking about it? Yeah, yeah, France is so noble in their anti-war stance...Germany too. It has nothing to do with dealings with Saadam does it? No, not at all. They are just smarter and better than us. Germany has a long history of great leaders who make humane decisions. France has always stood up to for what is right, no matter the cost. Liberals good, conservatives bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dude, this book is funny and informative.","review":"I just finished reading this book literally minutes ago and it was absolutely hilarious, insightful, and inspiring. Michael Moore has a way of keeping his writing simple, but at the same time pouring loads of information in to your brain. It is a really easy and fast read. This book is smart, witty, and will definitely be appreciated by people who would like to see some change in our society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats wrong with this book....","review":"Ok. I am an actual democrat. I like Michael Moore as a filmmaker. I usually find his films thought provoking and presented in a well organized manner. So why don't I like this book?Because it's mean and just a mess.I agree with what he is saying and what he is trying to do. However, the points he tries to make turn into a vicious, thoroughly accusatory, and mean. He doesn't use a lot of facts to back it up--he just points the finger and says \\"THEY DID THIS!\\"I like to think Dems have a higher standard and I've largely supported them for NOT sinking to the depths of what the right wing does. This represents pretty much everything I disagree with the right wing for and looking at it just plain as propaganda, its not much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude, your country is in Uranus.","review":"This stupid white guy (his own racist phrase) is laughing all the way to the bank, with this book of bunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow!! What a pile of crap!!!","review":"Shocking and deseptively persuasive, Moore's book is an easy read that should delight all those that have the money to buy it. One thing's for sure, after reading Moore's book, you'll wonder why you wasted the money to buy a new book when (according to Moore) you'll barely have enough money in your miserable life to ever buy anything new again. I am constantly amazed by the defeatist opinions expressed by some rich people.I guess our capitalistic society works for them but not for most of us. Should I be thanking Moore for saving me the trouble I would have endured by trying to obtain MY dreams? Is Moore so much more amazing than all of us that we should all lay down our hopes, aspirations, and guns to have our lives spoon-fed to us by the likes of Moore and his ilk. Simply put, this book is poison. Please do not buy this book. If you do read it, PLEASE take it with a grain of salt. Moore's opinions are NOT truthful nor are they at all helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm smarter than this","review":"I read my uncles copy while visiting him last weekend. Although I am only 12, I can spot a mean spirited person a mile away. Where does he get off that getting rich in this country is impossible and that you might as well give up? I read up on Michael Moore. He's rich. He also doesn't have a very good reputation with former employees, is notoriously cheap, doesn't even tip etc. Just the kind of role model we need for this country. Plus all the 9/11 stuff? Oh brother. I have chosen this book for a book report. The assignment is to find a political themed book, present the contents, summarize and then give an opinion. I cannot give it my recommendation. Its just more inaccurate propaganda from this buy. I am sure many people will buy it and make him richer. What a hypocrite. He reminds me of all those foaming at the mouth conservatives talk show guys. He's just another self promoter getting rich off of movie and book deals. A gas bag. My best friend thinks he's a doofus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this crap...","review":"Save your money or buy a book from Sean Hannity or Bill O'Reilly. This rubbish isn't worth the pages its printed on, unless you want to wipe yourself with it. Maybe this guy should stick to making movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same tired rhetoric","review":"Considering the amount of media coverage Moore gets, I assumed it was worthy. His \\"what, me petty?\\" attitude wore on me, and he lacked insight. He rails against all things corporate, successful, Republican, etc.I don't expect him to tear down his political party of choice, but his absolutist views came across as simpleton ramblings.It seems, ironically, he's in it for the quick cash that mocking people with cash seems to bring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moore delivers again!","review":"In his latest book, Michael Moore investigates the disappearance of his spiritual homeland, The Soviet Union. \\"Dude, Where's My Country\\" lovingly recounts the glory days of the Red Empire and the high standard of living enjoyed by those who experienced it. Moore is especially fond of Stalin, whom he calls \\"the most magnanimous leader of modern times.\\"Of course, Moore can't help but to criticize America's free market economic system as well as the policies of the Bush administration. In doing so, he presents compelling arguments for why America should continue to move toward socialism.A great read for high school students and Bay Area activists!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Judging a book by its cover","review":"Fascinating that after so many reviews this book received an average of four stars. I might be inclined to read it had I not recently seen Mr. Moore's interview on C-SPAN. I particularly enjoyed his rant about the fact that the American Dream is a lie perpetuated by Republicans/conservatives and that we commoners should give up on believing in the Lie. Unless this author was born with a silver spoon in his mouth then I'd say that, based on his indie film success, he's quite the hypocrite for suggesting that we dare not dream of professional success ourselves. Please forgive me if I judge this book by its cover...or author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I Missing Something...","review":"but I didn't find this funny or even on the mark. He makes things up as he goes along and he also seems to be so very mean-spirited.

But I am sure that even then he would find plenty of believers :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude, This Guy is a Loser","review":"...Moore makes many interesting observations in Dude, Where's My Country,...All in all, Moore makes his points, interjecting them with a bitter humor.

They won't like it.-"},{"rating":"1","title":"More lies from Moore","review":"Sometimes I also wonder where my country is when I see that this pack of lies has reached # 1 in the best-sellers list. With unsubstantiated theories, this raving pseudo-socialist idiot has managed to achieve the status of political genius among people even dumber than he is.

He also has a very warped view of history and the intent of our founding fathers when they created this country.If you enjoy a good laugh read this book.Also, if you have no understanding of Repbulicans/Conservatives and the US Constitution, and don't want any further understanding, read this book.If you have more in common with Vladamir Lenin and Karl Marx, than you do with Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda anyone?","review":"Dude, Where's my Country? is presented as an expose of all the evils of George W. Bush, the Republicans, and their corporate co-conspirators. Moore uses his witty conversational style to present multiple conspiracy theories about Bush that Moore feels is neglected by the mainstream media.It is doubtful that this book will actually convince anyone. Those on the left will enjoy Moore's fanning of the flames of Bush hatred, while those of the right will dismiss the entire book because of Moore's blind hatred for Bush and his one-sided presentation of his personal theories as truth.However, this book is not completely without value, it has some interesting theories, but crosses the line into propaganda by presenting a slew of half-truths and outright lies as unquestionable facts. Because of this, after reading Dude, Where's My Country? the intelligent reader will end up asking one main question...Dude, What About the Facts?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary","review":"A friend recommended this as a joke and loaned a copy to me.

I really liked that show... Moore is obviously a smart and very funny guy. But as I got older (I was eleven when TV Nation was on TV) I began to question his methods.

Let us not forget that under Clinton the WTC had an attempted Terrorist attack fail after the bomb didnt explode in the right place, bombed embassies in Africa, bombed the USS Cole but Clinton did nothing in the ways of acting to prevent or correct the situation.

But the fact is we need people like him writing good social commentary. In this book he does a great job exposing the loser who stole the last election from that other loser. Frankly I couldn't stand Al Gore, but Bush stole the election with the help of his brother, and history will record it as a stolen election. History will not be kind to Mr. Bush. Now would Gore have made a better President? I doubt it, but at least he would have been a legally elected President. Moore skewers Bush, and that crook deserves nothing less.

Mike asks some tough questions which we'll probably never get the answers to - at least not if our secret government keeps up its secret plans.Whether you like the guy or not, you should demand to know why Bush let the Bin Ladens leave the country against the FBI's wishes. You should seriously question why our boys are dying in Iraq, and whether we're able to instill our values upon them at a time when those freedoms we claim to cherish above all else are being eroded here at home. You should speak out when the bill of rights is decimated in the name of \\"homeland security\\"Mike does digress into some silly \\"letter from God\\" in the latter half of the book - but the power of the book is not lost even by these shinanigans.Get your hands on this book and then, if you can, back on your rights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another ANTI WAR Book!

The 9-11 terrorist attacks could have been prevented if Clinton had killed Bin Laden in 1998 when he had the opportunity. Instead of risking his popularity, he left the problems for the next president. Bush is not afraid to risk his popularity to do the right thing. Attacking Iraq was necessary and way over-due. Clinton, other liberals, and the UN have ignored the real world problems far too long and someone is finally doing something about it. I wish I didn't even have to give this book one star because it deserves nothing. Moore is completely off-based. I hope he finds Jesus real soon because he needs lots of mercy for writing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inside my Bubble","review":"It is amazing in our country today that we can read, and give credence to one man's internal struggle to reconcile aspects of his life. Where are the statesmen? Thomas Paine who wrote so movingly and credibly in support of the cause of freedom during our Revolutionary War was stating arguments that were eloquent in their passion - and well-reasoned. Michael Moore is nothing more than a guy with a huge grudge - he sees the glass half empty - and yet we listen to him - it's like listening to the most manic guy on campus hold court in the frat house with his energized diatribes - and of course we find this entertaining. But lend credence to this?? Actually believe Moore's delusionary reasoning is evidence of a skilled historian??? what has happened to this country?? Sure, have an opinion - but to publish and give respect to the frat boy's tirades is foolishness on our part - let's grow up."},{"rating":"1","title":"What will it be Michael, humor or facts?","review":"Moore wants his writings to be regarded as facts, but continues to tell critics that they have no case -- since he is writing humor.Do yourself a favor and read this book for humor, and not any factual content (because there isn't any)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude, Where's Your Head???","review":"Michael Moore is funny. He does deserve credit for humor. You can get a good laugh regardless of what your political leanings are. Having said that:I was surprised at the overly simplistic arguments. I was really expecting \\"Moore.\\" Anyone with some background in history and foreign policy over the last 50 years can EASILY sift through the errors in Michael Moore's logic (or lack of). Not much to challenge the concervative mind.After you read this you will be thankful that Michael Moore is a Hollywood actor and NOT an elected official."},{"rating":"1","title":"no no no","review":"Michael Moore is paranoid, narcissistic, selfish, a complete hypocrite, and a liar. He completely manipulates facts, misuses information, and downright lies. If you blindly trust his work you are supporting a man who seeks to satisfy only one agenda -- his own.How many of you, like me at the time, after watching his movie Bowling for Columbine wanted to personally go to Charlton Heston's home and beat him into the ground? Well, if so, you are totally in the wrong. There are bountiful discrepancies in the documentary, so much that it renders the whole thing complete bunk. That is but one in his overall repertoire of totally misleading crap. If you want the real picture of Moore's self-promoting, loaded-with-junk works, read the book Michael Moore Is a Big Fat Stupid White Man by David T. Hardy and Jason Clarke. Take it from me, a former Michael Moore fan . . . he's not worth the paper he wipes with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude, I'm a hypocrite","review":"Moore makes a living out of blasting the very country that has made him a multi-millionare and has given him the luxury to publish books, make films and eat ample amounts of food.

Just like Democrats, Republicans are most often good people but with a different philosophy about government, and any other portrayal of them is simply dishonest. Dems can call Reps \\"Greedy\\" and Reps can call Dems \\"Commies\\" but that does not change the fact they simply disagree on how to do things. I think Michael Moore would have been better off simply sharing his views without having to slam the opposition. By relying so much on the demonization of the other side, it makes his own arguments less effective. If Moore is correct, shouldn't his ideas be able to stand alone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Americanism","review":"To think that this \\"writer\\" continues to clog bookshelves is beyond comprehension. Oh I know, the popular liberal mantra is \\"it's patriotic to slam the (insert here: President, the US, US Business, the Military, and, did I mention the President?).\\" Give me a break. I picked this book up because I wanted to see if his idiotic views would be as base as they are when flashed on the movie screen or uttered in public.They are.If you care about this country, you know, your heart beats a little faster at the sight of the flag and you actually get a tear in your eye when the Start Spangled Banner is played, then do yourself a favor and don't waste your money.

He appears to have developed a Christ complex. Most of this book is gibberish, where ad hominem attacks pass for rational argument.

Michael Moore is so blind to the country he lives in. Liberals need to understand that they are the MINORITY. Unfortunately, they just have the louder voice thanks to the biased media. Liberals don't know it, but by writing books like this, they are alienating the moderates and are giving the election to Bush. May I recommend that you read \\"A National Party No More\\" by Zell Miller.

If you are going to read this I recommend you check it out of your local library and not line this oaf's pockets by purchasing this book.

This shpuld be more appropriately categorized as non-fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy!!","review":"I read this book merely to find out if Michael Moore had learned from the bad reviews from his last book about how to write intelligently. His style is unorganized and cannot separate emotion from logic. Undoubtedly, he has had success in appealing to some of the uneducated masses, which is why he and a mediocre comedian (Al Franken) have recently become the most recognizable spokesmen for the liberal point of view. This book clearly demonstrates why the liberal media has fallen so far behind the conservative media."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a trip out to middle America.........","review":"I find it interesting that so many people are writing negative things about President Bush and his stand to fight terror. Is it possible that the extreme left in the Democratic Party is supporting these authors either directly or by buying large numbers of their books to try and put their agenda up as being the only \\"correct\\" interpertation in America? Enron and the dot com stock market was forstered under the Clinton administration, but it was the Bush administration that finally started to put the illegal dealings out in the open. I live in a big city, but am glad to vacation in the middle of the country where many real Americans live. America is not only Hollywood and New York. Mr. Moore needs to get out more - perhaps \\"Stupid White Men\\" was his autobiography."},{"rating":"1","title":"All you need to know Mike","review":"Here are some things he needs to come to terms with:1. We live in a capitalist society that has a high value on capital (money, wealth). Smart people are better at amassing wealth than uneducated people, thus people with money call the shots.2. There are unethical people in any field of life. Corporations are not to blame.3. Certain bodies hate our country, and have vowed to terrorize it. If Iraq has nothing to do with Al Qaeda, why are they so angry that we are there, and why are they threatening more attacks?4. Osama bin Laden would have your head as zealously as he would have George W. Bush's, so wake up. It's not about consevatives and liberals, it's about AMERICANS.You only make our country look more divided and foolish."},{"rating":"1","title":"He doesn't have anything new to say","review":"If you thought \\"Stupid White Men\\" was a lot of angry, inaccurate and unfunny drivel, wait until you read this one. Same mantras all over again - George W Bush, Enron, Kyoto protocol, how rich rule the world... And anti-capitalists are clapping their hands in ecstasy. Same old story.In fact, I kinda feel sorry for them, because it does not seem to take a lot of effort to amuse those lefties and nearly bring tears of righteous indignation to their eyes. This talentless self-centred sorry excuse for a writer just keeps talking to anyone who would listen.Old-school pinko artists (like Oliver Stone) at least had some talent. Their ideas might have been unacceptable to some but everyone respected their professionalism. Michael Moore just keeps mass-producing trash and making nice money out of it. He is not even a professional, just an incompetent fraud.Liked his first book and Columbine film? Go on, buy this one too. You'll love it: it's more of the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phony Opposition","review":"Michael Moore and Bill O'Reilly are two sides of the same coin. Both are a pair of media circus clowns who take your money by debating a non-existant left-right dicotomy.

There are better books out there, it reminds me of 'For Dummies...' series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain angry","review":"Typical Moore. Make a few points, and ramble about how things are going down the toilet, and of course, it is everyone's fault from the people in positions of power to the people who put them there. Of course, everyone but him and people like him. I tried to make it through the book, but about a third of the way through it, I just could not go one more page. Personally, I hope things keep going the way they are, otherwise this no talent hack will be unemployed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude, Where's my facts","review":"I would give this book five stars if it were in the science fiction section.

It fails to give adequate defense of it's many conjectures. Though, admittedly, some would be difficult to defend even if given adequate attention. Furthermore, it is too agressive and too divisive, hinging on a number of false presuppositions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This book gave me alot to think about. Although I don't agree with every word that Moore says, I disagree with those who say he is an extreme leftist, dripping with ego, anti-American or anti-Christian. I found very little to suggest that he is any of those things in this book. He backs up his arguements with facts, he is not condescending, and he believes in the principles this country stands upon. He makes sense.\\"Dude, Where's My Country\\" is both entertaining and thought provoking. I recommend it to anyone interested in politics, regardless of their party affiliation. If you aren't sure about Moore and don't want to spend the money on his book, check for it at your local library or try to borrow it from someone. You might learn something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic - Makes the case for Bringing down BUSH","review":"Moore does it again. a fantastic book which strikes down all of Bush's reasons to send our young brothers and sisters to die in iraq. The coward Bush who avoided his own trip to vietnam and left the military before a final medical exam to avoid a DRUG TEST is shown to be a complete tool of Big Business and his REICH WING cronies.

Everyone who wants to reclaim the USA from the hardline neocon nutcases who have hijacked the country should read it and tell all their friends about it. Of especial significance is what Moore says about the Bush family link with the Bin Laden family. How many Iraqi hijackers on 9/11? NONE! How many Saudi citizens among them - 15 out of the 19! Who funds Wahhabi based Islamic extremism - the Saudis. Who are in with the Bush family? The Saudis! This is why every patriotic American MUST read this book - patriotism is not a monopoly of the Republican Right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blind rage","review":"I hate Bush and what he is doing to our country but I felt like this was written in a blind rage.

It is a must read for those of you who have a conservative family member, whom you love dearly, yet always seems to ruin thanksgiving dinner. (Moore gives great advice on how to prevent this from happening, by the way, and how you could potentially convert that family member to the \\"other side\\"). If you are looking for a book that will pull you back into reality, away from the media and lies told by others, this is it. It will inspire you to do anything to make change in our government happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rallying cry","review":"No one can read this book and feel nothing. This is a book that demands the reader take action. Dude, Where's My Country is a book that pulls no punches and holds nothing sacred. Michael Moore isn't afraid to deal with the real issues and tell the sometimes painful facts. I recommend this book to everyone, I just wish it was a little longer. However, after reading it I feel a great need to volunteer or help with local elections and it's sad that things have gotten worse *since* he wrote it.The facts are frightening, but he doesn't sugarcoat anything and never shies away from giving the full truth. It's an eye opener, because even though I've been following it all closely, he said things I didn't know at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry ass republican dupes","review":"I always find it amusing that the vast majority of the blinded right wing fools call all liberals criminals citing the Clintons mostly while ignoring probably the greatest criminals in the United States today - Kenneth Lay, who cheated thousands of Americans, Karl Rove, who leaked the identity of a CIA agent which is an act of treason, and now one of the idols of the radical right Rush \\"Where are my drugs?\\" Limbaugh, who also happens to be a fat pig as so many of you like to call Michael Moore.

Are they claiming Moore's information is false? If they grant him accuracy, how can they possibly defend Bush? The well documented evidence is overwhelming that Bush and his buddies have fooled the American People in a horrendous fashion.The reader should suspend prior prejudice--a challenging task--and consider this book with an open mind. Moore lightens the tract with periodic humor, but considering the serious nature of War, deficits, tax policy, etc., it is truly black humor.This is a \\"must read\\" for all Americans who still wonder how we have found ourselves in such serious straits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointment","review":"Sadly what could might been an entertaining read was ultimately subverted -- as were his prior two books and the Bowling for Columbine doculecture -- by his tendency to see America through the filter of ideology.

Many negative reviews of this book resort to name-calling, profanity, and gross over-generalizations ('commie', 'socialist', etc.) - and you have to love someone blasting the book with a review rife with misspellings and grammatical errors (VERY funny after you just finished the book!) PLEASE READ THIS BOOK!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey Dude - You're Lost In The 60's","review":"Moore's book is a regurgitation of 1960's radical left wing liberalism. Moore seems to feel the need to justify his new-found riches before his radical friends by bashing conservatives and moderates with a delight and style reminiscent of 1960's radical \\"thinkers\\" - if we do not have the facts to support our ideas and arguments, we will manufacture them! He thinks he atones for being a rich man now by vomiting up the rhetoric of Jane Fonda, and company and spewing the distasteful bile over the American public. Save yourself $20.00 (I did - I borrowed the book from a woman who really is lost in the 60's - a feminist. LMAO!) Initially, I thought Moore was on track with his seven questions of George Bush. Unfortunately, he did not stay on track with the questions, diverging into the 60's radical political diatribe.

But his total disregard for his audience's intelligence and his endless whining about being booed by the Hollywood amoral Brain Trust spoil any good in this book.Although Mr. Moore is entitled to his opinion and the last time I checked, this is a free country, Mr. Moore is an intellectual coward who got trounced by Bill O'Reilly AND uber-left Vanity Fair critic Christopher Hitchens.

I'm going to follow his advice and become and drug addict, quit my job, and blame everything on the Republicans. That way I don't have to accept resposibility for myself anymore.

As liberal, I'm appalled. How can he say in this book that he doesn't think that Bin Laden could have planned 9/11 and then in Farenheit 9/11 say that he did.I found it ironic that Moore bashes the media for their manipulation of the facts- but all of Moore's research comes from newspapers (the very people he was bashing). I can't believe anything he does, writes, says, films,etc anymore. He used to be cool- then he dumbed things down to reach a wider audience and continued to promote lies.

If you have read any of his writings and enjoyed them then stay away from this drivel by Michael Moore. I suggest watching his movies instead.If you get a chance to peak inside the book, I suggest reading the chapter in which he recounts a dream he has with his great great grandaughter and how little sense this makes in the book.

I don't particularly care for Moore, mainly because, as was said in other reviews, he is inarticulate and looking for a fight.On to my point: to the reviewer who, well, scolded other reviewers who disliked the book, and said that they only disliked it because they were conservatives and asked why such people read the book in the first place... It was perhaps because these conservatives you scold might be openminded and willing to try to see the other side of the issues. You are obviously a liberal and probably see yourself as open-minded, so why is it so bad that someone on the other side of the issues be that way as well?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Facts take a back seat to political hatred.","review":"Q: \\"Dude, Where's my country?\\"A: It collapsed in 1991.http://www.spinsanity.org/columns/20031016.html"},{"rating":"1","title":"More liberal babbling from the King of Ego.","review":"To call Michael Moore a liberal is an understatement. He's almost a socialist leftist - his views on America and conservatives such a George W.

The world is being run by conservatives -- we need more liberals. Yeah, right. The world is being run by liberals enough already -- Hollywood, the news world, everywhere we look. If Bush had been found cheating in office he would have been kicked out of the White House pronto. But because it was Clinton...never mind, I won't bring up past issues.You can recommend this review or disagree strongly with it. It depends on your outlook on political issues.

I am on his side and I still felt like the pages were screeching at me hysterically and yelling at me as if I were stupid, despite the fact that he couldn't maintain a consisten argument even over as short a span as two pages without getting into contradictions. honestly, don't waste your time, there are much better books out there to whet your anger with usefull information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Important Book Of Our Times?

(leading me to give the book 4 stars)In one chapter Moore pretends to be god, (but its obviously Moore, he uses the exact same language). In another he describes a dream, well a dialogue between him and his great granddaughter in the future. These chapters were painful to read, so I just skipped them. There are a few other times when the book goes a bit awry, however generally the book is a very good read..This book is based on the premise that Bush needs to go. Indeed, Moore makes a very good case. The book concludes by urging the reader help dethrone Bush in 2004. A cause which few who read this book would call unworthy.Regardless of politics, I think that this book is a must read for all Americans.

I am grateful for a country that lets his voice be heard, but I am disgraced by a country that silences or disregards so many other voices in the name of greed and capitalism. A democracy is for the people, why did we kill 6000 of Iraq's people in order to install a Democracy (that doesn't sound like we had the Iraqi people in mind).

I simply do not believe this book is a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude, Where's My Country?","review":"Michael Moore is only writing this book to make money. I think he was actually shocked that his previous book did so well. Everything he writes about is fabricated and untrue. The only thing that matters to the man is his own agenda of communism. Has this so called man ever defended his country? No. A crispy cream donut - that I can accept.

Which is great because that would have to make this more of a work of fiction. So rating this book as a work of fiction I would have to give it a star, the characters are not believable and the hero still has 400 unsold copies of his movie at my local Best Buy taking up space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude, Where's my refund?","review":"This is recycled and tired diatribe from a man who seems to have a disturbingly high opinion of himself. Moore is one of the world's most overrated contemporary writers/info-tainers. There is no bibliography to confirm the sources that the author uses to support his claims. As is the case with most radicals, this book's success hinges on the author's dependence on his audience's unconditional support and acceptance of what turns out to be nothing more than conjective guesswork. In the past, Moore has played fast and loose with the facts and he has gotten burned for it. You would think that he would get it right this time around. But alas!Needless to say, despite all of Moore's ranting, he presents absolutely no credible alternatives to the divisive issues that he presents in the book. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factually dishonest","review":"I first must admit to NOT having read this thing. This \\"review\\" is to those that state in their reviews about Mr.Moore's \\"facts\\" presented in his book --- most notably the first from a reader in Centerville, GA. Review this, http://www.spinsanity.org/columns/20031016b.html, and then tell us about \\"facts\\". Moore's \\"Columbine\\" was ripped on factual standing as was \\"Stupid\\". His tactics are no different than those \\"polemist\\" on the right and should receive no greater attention than someone stumbling in the dark and crying for the lights to be extinquished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude, Where's your copy of Mine Kamp","review":"Read this book!It should be a text book for training fascists and communists.Michael wants to point out how evil business, and conservatives are yet again in this book. This is essantially the same bilge he's been spouting since the 70's when he was smart enought to realize he make a very nice living being a capitalist author in liberal clothing.IF you want to think all the crap in this book is accurate. Ask yourself why Michael won't debate his statements any where that disagrees with him. Even Al Sharpton has more courage then that. And he makes some thought provoking aguments.Just because it's in this book doesn't make it true.Lastly here's the substance of the book----Business is evil, and so are the conservatives. So WE, the people who know what's right need to take over the business's and run this country the way gods (Marx, Hitler, Moussalini) want us to.Sound extreme?

I have always had on open mind, but this book is full of inaccuracies and blatant lies. I outlined several of the lies in a word document and sent them, with sources, to my friends who were so excited about this book. Many of them had NO IDEA that Moore had such inaccuracies. Honestly, I can't believe his publisher allowed such lies to be printed. It seems that they would be open to lawsuits from some of the people involved.

He along with these other self proclaimed experts, both conservative and liberal, all have one thing in common. They all are profiteering from the current political environment.Save your money and conduct some personal research with a critical analysis of any and all alleged facts.

They must have some really hysterical get togethers when he meets up with Babs Striesand, Mike Farrel, Bill Maher and all of the other Left-Wing Loonies!Please, spare yourself from this rediculous book. You'll learn more reading about Big Bird and Bob the Builder... :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bush Bashing.","review":"Mr. Moore writes about the issues with the Bush family and the ethics of the US government towards the World before and after 9/11. Most of his points are backed up with research; some points seemed bias especially concerning corporations and the government. I do agree with most of his points although would recommend readers to do their own research beforehand. I thought this book deserved 4-stars, since Mr. Moore kept pushing the same point towards the Bush family and thought he should have expanded more on the other government officials he mentioned in the book.On a side note, I just saw his movie \\"Roger & me\\", which depicts the Flint city falling apart due to GM leaving the city; this movie also shows how Mr. Moore started his journey. It is good for the American society to see a different point of view from the ones we see on public TV and some newspapers. Looking forward to watch his newest movie \\"Fahrenheit 911\\". Keep up the work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love much of Michael Moore's work, yet I found this to be disappointing. I was hoping for more incite into the Bush administration, more detail, more of everything. Michael Moore asks questions of George W. Bush and in my opinion already knows many of the answers (or at least intimates he knows). I found that the information provided did not satisfy my expectations and Michael Moore's humour came up a little short...I also believe that Moore covered many of the same topics in his previous book, which I loved...my recomendation is to buy Stupid White Men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Want to Add one Thing. . .","review":"Well. . .it seems like everyone has a definite opinion on this book (and has written a review on it). So I'm not going to bother to write a complete review. I'll just quote my favorite part of the book:\\"They call it a war on 'Terror.'

I find his language and style annoying, and any potential he has to make himself seem credible is lost in his effort to propagate as much baseless hate towards Mr. Bush as is humanly possible. I am glad it didn't take long to read, because what little amount of time I spent on this diatribe I felt like I wasted. I might not always agree with the politics of this current administration, but this book goes way too far. This is no better than the pundits on the far right Mr. Moore likes to attack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude, Where's my barf bag?","review":"This book is so depressing. When you buy this book pick up some poison or a noose so you can kill yourself after reading it. According to Mikey, you can't make it in America because the odds are so stacked against you. Apparently that doesn't apply to him. But look on the bright side, by buying this book you can help him make his Manhattan penthouse mortgage payments!Corporations are evil unless they are churning in the millions for fat Mikey. Hopefully he will move to a cool Communist country, like North Korea or Cuba. People live really great there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What does Michael believe in?","review":"I Listened on CD and while Mr. Moore does ask some Thought provoking questions he fails to pull the reader in as he trashes everyone as stupid. He mixes polls and survey results to answer his questions the way he wants them to sound (percentage, and 1-in 10000000 chances) He plays on the short memory of people and distorts dates to serve his own intrests. Other than hating George Bush I have no idea what he does believe in. It certianly isnt god, Stock market, capitalism, Democracy, or the working man (he's a millionair)."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Lies By Michael Moore","review":"Picked this one up in the Bookstore. It's just another angry screed from the man who brought you the \\"Documentary\\" that was largely staged and made up, \\"Bowling for Columbine.\\" I saw lots of lies and accusations and no evidence. And the country Michael Moore says he's looking for has nothing in common with the nation that Jefferson, Madison et al founded in the inerest of personal freedom and liberty...the nation Moore says he is looking for sounds more like one of Europe's failing socialist nanny states.

Out run - out last - and watch everyone else get killed. OK - what next? Kind of a let down. It sees that money or power (or speed) were the only reasons that people deserved to be \\"saved\\". If I become rich enough or famous enough (or fast enough) - can I be \\"saved\\" too? The few swear words that were in the movie - could have been left out and it would have been a much better movie.

Cool visuals, decent story at times, but too fantisiful and cliche.","review":"For as long as this movie is it packs a Ton of action, little story and plenty of cliche into it.I stopped counting the 'near miss' deaths of the main characters after like 100.While they use Hollywood cliche life-saving luck for most of the movie amidst the never endingexplosions, there is little script. The script they do have is only ok. No real story...there are some moments that tug at the heart strings, but not hard to do when you tell any storyand put in death or potential death of family (the family you've been acquainted with).Other than the never-ending cliche and poor script, the main character family seems to care littleabout the BILLIONS of people dying around them. Its not even mentioned, and is almost laughable.I'd say its worth the 3.00 rental.. not worth buying or paying 7.00 in the theatres."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice CGI imagery - otherwise waste of time","review":"If you want to marvel at some wonderfully done CGI work, this is a treat, to watch briefly. The story itself is gravely overexaggerated, with poor acting. Countless \\"close calls at the last possible second\\" and just completely unbelievable in all regards. Strange thing is, they ace the CGI, yet one scene where the characters (if you call them that) are in the back of a truck, it looks like a small town studio shot it. No sun, shadows, or wind, just a clean ride with a stormy green-screened backdrop. Maybe worth a dollar to rent, but not worth the 2 hours to expect any sort of enjoyable story. I'm not sure why Danny Glover subjected himself to such a poor film. This is the last John Cusack movie I will bother watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check your brain at the door!!!","review":"When I go to see a movie that I think is going to have a brain in it's head, and then I see this tripe that looks like it was written by 15 year olds, it's very maddening. I would even give it 2 stars if the CGI effects were realistic, but they are not. Very cartoonish. Maybe 10 year olds will be riveted, but even when I was 10 I was watching smarter and more enjoyable movies than this. And Danny Glover as the President of the US?? LOL!

The cast and crew made its propaganda intent predictable,I only watched it for free on satellite to see Amanda Peet, who came out unscathed in all senses, but I hope she avoids the next liberal disaster/propaganda film: which will probably try to scare people to believe that the world will end if OBama is not reelected, when the real disaster is what he has done to our country already."},{"rating":"1","title":"On to The Next One..","review":"Besides special effects, this movie is pretty tragic. For one it drags out to long. The plot just wasn't strong enough to carry this film through almost three hours.

Other than that the acting was a travesty. They wasted their real talent, Thandie Newton, and reduced her to mere eye candy. What a ridiculous waste of money!

It is one of those movies you know Hollywood studios took on for the profits at the box office only and not because of the quality of the story line and acting ability of the performers.

You were blown away by the special effects and when it came time for the dialog you just want to fast-forward it.-The whole \\"Hurry it's right behind us!\\" thing was WAY over done and things got hokey real quick.-It's a sound premise, a descent story...But it went WAY overboard and into the realm of silliness.-Hats off to the special effects artists, yeah some of the more elaborate \\"run away\\" scenes were over the top and stupid...But they were just doing what they were told and did a great job of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"over the top","review":"I didnt get it, it was too hard to believe for me and parts are predictable.

They could call it \\"Die REALLY Hard 2012\\".Incidentally, all the claims about the end of the world happening in 2012 are bogus. Nothing will happen in 2012, I assure you. Except that Barack Obama will be re-elected! That may be the bitter end of the Neo-Cons and the Leo-Cons, but hardly the planet as such.And if we are really lucky, maybe Ronald Emmerich will make a new disaster movie? I'm sure the apocalyptic cults will set a new date when Disaster 2012 fails to materialize. Some illusions, after all, die hard.[This review was actually posted in 2009 on another product page.

How many one line jokes, and quick get aways can you have in a movie? Well, that's all this c-ap is full of. Then the story changes to a highly emotional scene of father son making their peace, or man sacrafices his life for another person.

John Cusack and his family narrowly escape the destruction about 6 times or more in this horrendous pile of garbage. Every single time, it is right on their heels. And the parts where he jumps the limo, and then later jumps the RV. It was embarassing. And then the parts that attempt humor- I just wanted to throw a brick through my TV screen.

But it takes more than that, and I just couldn't even begin to get around the two glaring flaws of this movie: [1] The pure cheesiness of the plot which mines every cliche that Hollywood has ever had; and [2] the completely incredible (literally) ability of the protagonists to survive disaster over and over again.

What these movies all have in common is an incredibly-hard-to-swallow over-the-top Karmic irony which sees bad character punished by random, action-oriented coincidence. Horrific disaster is treated like a sort of wonder-of-nature amazement (drinking game: every time they say something like, \\"you gotta see this!\\"). You can see the special effect coming from a mile away! The dramatic irony isn't subtle or thought-provoking, it's just obnoxious.

The story was extremely weak and yet they felt that they had to stretch it for more than 2 and a half hours. What you would usually think that are the best CGI effects of the world falling apart, it seemed extremely ridiculous that the family running away from the world crumbling all around them, were always just a split second away from falling through the earth themselves.... all the way through the silly film.

And really, you can't do better than John Cusack as a sympathetic leading man.Based on the trailers shown before the film when I saw it, the marketing folks know without a doubt that this movie is going to bring in the lowest-common-denominator suckers to pitch their other by-the-numbers comedy and action films to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swiss Cheese","review":"If the movie's plot was a block of cheese, it would be Swiss.

It is true that our politicians have made amenities for themselves in mountains, etc, but to think they'll let the common folk on an \\"ark\\" and then we can start over, well first of all, they will only attempt to save themselves and secondly, there will be no ark in any case. Well like I said, it's not realistic. If you like fun and sci-fi, I guess this movie is for you.

I can't get enough of seeing LA and NYC getting destroyed. However, even for me that couldn't really offset the lack of plot. The main characters were simply running away from impending doom (always just one step ahead). The plot was too much like Day After Tomorrow, War of the Worlds, or Cloverfield, i.e., thin.

It's worth watching for the laughs, in fact it is going to become one of our groups \\"must see\\" films during our annual Thanksgiving trip to Gatlinburg.

One million times throughout people escape disaster with less than a half second to spare, what the hell is that? At least give us an inkling that this could be realistic please. Apparently film execs take the movie going public to be brainwashed half-assed thrill seekers, and in many cases are quite right, but the oohs and aahs that they think are gold in this pic are more like ooh I am going to puke if you do it again within the next minute.

So tell me how you were going to build such large sophisticated machinery that these arks obviously were supposed to be in a remote area with primitive mountain roads as the only means of hauling large heavy equipment?Watch this movie for the terrific CG graphics and forget the rest of the nonsensical story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Disaster Movie... but what about the subtitles?","review":"I liked it...

Spanish is the second most common language in the US, it holds the world's fifth largest Spanish-speaking population, outnumbered only by Mexico, Spain, Argentina, and Colombia.I like subtitles because it helps me (not always) read in other languages (especially Spanish, French, Italian, German and Portuguese) while watching and listening movies. And I bet some potential buyers would still need those subtitles to watch the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"I don't know why I thought this movie would be good. Typically nowadays disaster films are all about CGI and zero about the character developement and script. It was HORRIBLE, TERRIBLE, LOUSY ACTING AND JUST PLAIN BORING!There's not much else to really say. Danny Glover as the president was moronic and couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. The rest of the totally forgetable characters (I can't even remember any of their names!) were not expanded, developed, or cared about at all.

It is a ridiculous movie with a clich�� a minute. The scene where Calfornia is falling into the sea for instance, is a non-stop montage of narrow cliff-hanging escape among rivers of lava, buckling pavement and exploding skyscrapers all set to a John Williamesque sweeping musical score that is almost laughable. John Cusack's character achieves these feats of rapid fire skin of your teeth escapes while driving a limousine which among other passengers included his two children. Placing children in danger to cheaply raise the viewers feeling of angst is one of the lowest forms of Hollywood moving making. The CGI effects are passable but often very video game-like.

By the third time I saw John Cusack narrowly escape doom by inches while the ground beneath him is literally crumbling, I was thinking \\"here we go again.\\" All the CG was so over the top it eventually becomes a parody of itself, and it got *so* repetitive that it became a bit boring. Most filmmakers know that 100 explosions are not necessarily 10 times better than 10 explosions, a lesson lost of 2012.Then of course add in the stereotyped characters, nonsensical plot, and a pretty good cast wasted. The plot holes are stupendous. At the end I felt like I had lost two hours of my life.

I blame the director, the terribly awful dialogue, and a very poor script for producing a time waster of epic proportions. Cliches are to be expected in this genre of movie but EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS OVERDONE with the possible exception of the special effects which are very badly done considering all that is possible with today's special effects/technology.

If people really talked like they some writers want them to, especially in stressful conditions, we would think of them as clueless, numskull idiots.(3.) Weak story with too many stolen-from-other-movies stereotypes, e.g. Russian fighter; divorced dad trying to entertain kids and ex-wife; female escort with mini-dog; crazy DJ (another bizarre and poor acting by Harrelson); government conspiracies and assassinations; pack the kids to escape the apocalypse; driving cars off of crashing airplanes in snow fields."},{"rating":"1","title":"great special effects but ...","review":"that's about it.

John Cusack is just wasted due to the lousy script. It's nothing but a sequence of chase scenes with highly improbable escapes that are so out there that they aren't even fun. Within a few minutes, you don't even care if anyone survives. I kept watching, waiting for it to get better. It just got worse. CGI effects were OK. I'd rather watch \\"Plan 9 From Outerspace\\" any day instead. I want those 3 hours back with interest added on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darn near the worst movie I've seen","review":"Horrible acting, stupid plot, and disappointing special effects. A better ending would have had all the actors including the kids, as well as everybody behind the scenes who contributed to this shameless production, dying. Getting smashed by a tidal wave or vaporized by molten lava would have been too good an ending for those who helped produce this. Getting eaten by red ants over several hours or better yet days would be more fitting. I'm pissed that I bought this thinking it would be worth a 2nd viewing. It's the type of movie you last through the end because you're thinking the whole time that \\"it's got to get better than this.\\" It never does! Save your money and make better use of your time. This movie is the biggest fraud of late that has been perpetrated on humanity. Why isn't Barack doing a better job policing Hollywood?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie","review":"The movie is absolute crap. The trick to making such a movie is to make the unreal seem real and believable, but this director took another approach entirely.

Grade: F-"},{"rating":"1","title":"What an awful film","review":"This film has perhaps one thing to recommend it and that's some of the visuals. Apart from this aspect, it really is a complete waste of time and money and I deeply regret purchasing it.The story is representative of what appears to be the very worst of Hollywood which appeals to the same sort of base instincts that make people want to stop and look at accidents - it has no intellectual content whatsoever, the story is vacuous, the parts are completely unbelievable and what might have been interesting, an exploration of the predictions by the Mayans and Nostradamus are left out completely. Presumably deemed too challenging for the targeted audience.Don't waste your money, honestly."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Blue Ray Rented - Good video but bad screenplay","review":"I chose 2012 as my first Blu-Ray movie when I got my new HD televisiona and Blu-Ray DVD player. The picture was outstanding and showed on Blu-Ray capibilities to the fullest. But the movie itself was an exercise in over the top movie making with some of the lamest dialogue ever written for the screen. After about an hour I kept looking at my watch wondering when this movie was going to end. Blue-Ray is great but bad movies are bad movies no matter what the format. Still if you need a DVD to amaze your friends this will do the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOM! CRASH! AAAIEEE!! RUN! DUCK! HELP!","review":"Yes, 2012 has some great explosions. Stuff does blow up real good. Big explosions!The plot? Well, it is about the sun heating the Earth with nutrinos causing massive earthquakes, or something, and the government's efforts to survive the disaster.Not enough plot for you? Well, add in John Cusack as a washed up writer/limo driver, who finds out about the government's plans and wades through the devestation with his ex-wife and daughter to a possible safe area on a special map.I was supposed to believe that the world's governments would cooperate like they did in this movie. There was alot of unbelievable stuff in this movie, but that can be overlooked if there was more to this movie than just some big explosions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but outrunning stuff you can't outrun","review":"This movie follows the same gimmic over and over throughout. Basically it involves John Cusak outrunning an earthquake in a car, then outrunning an exploding volcano in an R.V., then that same volcano in a plane, then a big dust cloud in a plane.I enjoy a ridiculous end of the world movie, like Armageddon, but this one just followed the same event sequence 4 or 5 times over a couple hours. Combine that with a lake of any character depth and being indifferent to whether they live or die and you have a rather boring movie despite it being an \\"action packed blockbuster.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"not a movie","review":"1* because this is not a movie - it is more of a computer animation project (or call it as you wish) in which some people (actors) and some story are included just to give it a false sense of being a movie. Everything else but the computer magic is devoid of any meaning and sense. Visually, totally impressive, no doubt, who likes those things will be awed. I stopped watching after 30 or so minutes when it became clear what it is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG, When will it end!","review":"It's long, about an hour longer than it ever should have been. And it filled with CGI, not all of it good by the way. John Cusak's character must have done something really bad in another life, because in the one that he plays in this film he's followed by a never ending earthquake from one side of the planet to the next, and it never lets up! It doesn't matter if he's in a car or a plane, the earthquake stalks him...where are the police to arrest that nasty menace of a quake?!Seriously though, if it had been an hour shorter it would have at least been tolerable. As it was I just kept watching and praying that it would end soon, since I have an inability to not at least see the ending of a film once I've paid my money to watch it. And the worst part is that as an actor I like John Cusak in other films that he's done."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best end of the world movies","review":"This movie is great. Some don't like end of world movies, watch this movie, and then complain about it???? It's entertaining and clean. It keeps your attention. As for end of world movies, this is probably the best one I've seen. If I was a bigger fan of this genre, I probably would have given it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two hours that I won't get back...","review":"I liked the other movies from Roland Emmerich and was hoping to see something exciting with great visual effects.Unfortunately, it was boring, predictable, the actors were really bad and the special effects looked as if they were made 15 years ago. When the ground is initially separating behind somebody running, then behind a car driving, then behind a plane taking off, this is seriously getting old. Some special effects were great, the vast majority so bad though that you immediately thought about the green room these scenes were taken in. Planes that after takeoff do not gain altitude, but drop a few thousand feets, then fly maneuvers that physically would not be possible, the scale of the model used does not match the environment and so on ...For me this was the worst movie I have seen in the last 2-3 years, not worth the money, but maybe for younger kids that do not have a lot of comparison, it might be an O.K. movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This movie should only have gotten one star, but I love John Cusack. I also typically love big-budget, great special effects blockbusters. But, while the all-star cast was doing its best to deliver lame lines, it was just a boring movie with an entirely forgettable plot. What little character development there was felt rushed and surficial so when supporting characters started dying off, you did not feel any sense of great loss like you might in a better film. This is approximately 2 1/2 hours of your life that would be better spent doing pretty much anything else. I'm sorry I paid for the blu-ray two-disc special edition, but would have been even more ticked off if I had wasted time going to the theater. Save your money and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the cheesiest movies ever made","review":"The special effects were fantastic, but the rest of the movie was terrible. The human interactions were maudlin. The story line was ridiculous. We were led to believe that the planet was going to be totally destroyed, only to find out that it was possible to survive this cataclysm in a buch of boats. If this disaster was foreseen, why weren't there more boats? As is usual with disaster movies, we are presented with the private lives of the main characters, their ambitions and their struggles. But it was all so sickening. Even though the special effects were tremendous, they hardly make up for the terrible story line and dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"This movie is nothing but politics. It attempts to make the following points:-All fathers are terrible people-Children should hate their biological fathers and love their stepfathers, regardless of circumstanceDid anybody else notice that the mixed Japanese/Caucasian family was given the meanest death scene?

The setting is at the high school where one of the Parasytes goes on a rampage killing everyone in its path! The suspense and tension is incredible! I recall one sequence where Shin throws a rock from the top of another building and the action looks like it could be easily animated. I am very impressed by the artwork, but out of the entire series this volume is a definite favorite of mine. Still buy the whole series it really is amazing and worth adding to any collection and a lot goes on in the plot. So you will find yourself wanting to pick up the next volume until you reach the end.

It's just sleepy. She just slogs through to the end, making little effort to energize the story. That's a shame, since the reader comes away feeling that Rule has been a bit uninterested in the story herself, and that a more compelling tale could be told by a writer who does not have so many books to her name that she's just coasting her way to a best seller.The writing at times looks like it didn't even go through a first-pass edit.Murderous Liysa is clearly evil on so many levels that any writer who put in the effort to tell the story could have produced something at least marginally readable. \\"Heart Full of Lies\\" is Rule at her laziest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down","review":"I'm reading her books in order.

Told more from this angle than the hard-core crime approach, it builds in \\"can't put it down\\" fashion to the killing, arrest, trial and conviction. Rule recognizes that not everyone agrees with the verdict, but I doubt anyone will disagree that this is a tragic, complex, perplexing case. Give it a read and see what YOU think!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another profile of a sociopath by Ann Rule","review":"I just bought this book Saturday afternoon and could not put it down-- I was finished by Sunday evening! I am a big fan of Ann Rule and all of her books. This story is a profile of a sociopath, Liysa Northon, who managed to fool an awful lot of people into thinking she was an abused wife, when really she was projecting her own rage (and murderous thoughts) onto her husband. The lies she told, and the lengths to which she went to perpetuate her story, were astonishing! This is definitely a good read; not as complicated a story as some of Ann Rule's others (my favorite is \\"Dead by Sunset\\"), but interesting nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've read almost all of Ann Rule's books, but this book is not up to her usual standards. There's not the usual excitement to the story (this crime is hardly worth a book) and the book is heavily padded with repetitive material.

Chris is made out to be this angelic person while Liysa is thought of as a demonic creature not even a person. While i do believe that Liysa was a little on the deranged side, I don't think it is that far off to assume Chris wasn't the perfect person Rule makes him out to be. It's a great story, but i don't think it should be considered a \\"True Story\\" and for that I don't think it should have an overall good rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointed Ann Rule fan","review":"I usually really appreciate Ann Rule's books, so I'm sorry to say that this one is a bust.

Wait for it in paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down!","review":"This is only the second Ann Rule book I have read. I could not put this book down. I had not heard about this murder since I live on the East Coast. It was riveting to read about a woman who was and probably still is delusional. It is actually sad.

It seemed very rushed, compared to some of her \\"classics\\", like The Stranger Beside Me and Small Sacrifices. The principals were not fleshed out and Liysa Northon was just not that interesting of a character. Certainly no one deserves to be a victim of any type of crime, but I did not find myself compelled with Chris Northon's story or his death. There was no mystery as to who killed him and Liysa's eventual plea bargain stopped the court proceedings in the book.I would have to say that this weak story might have been better served in one of Ms. Rule's True Crime files, where it might have gotten less than 50 pages, versus the devotion of an entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite of Ann Rule's books","review":"I have liked Ann Rule's books, but not this one.

When I finally got some response from the machine the scanner, the fax or the two-sided printing wouldn't work. The print rate was disgustingly slow unless you selected draft and grayscale only.

They are my #1 choice in our corporate environment. HP should be embarrassed to put out something of this awful quality. And to put the word \\"Pro\\" in the name is just ridiculous.

Now your purchase as various colors are depleted - they seem to deplete at different times! Black didn't last long and that was the first you have to purchase new. The individual cost of the 4 costs about the same as the two would have cost but you have to spend too much time keeping track of all these cartridges.I have used the fax part of the printer and it worked fine.

I purchased this unit one year ago to replace a Brother Multi-function printer that had died. In a nutshell, this printer has the distinction of being both the most expensive printer I've purchased and the lowest quality printer I've ever purchased.o The black print head failed in less than a year (do a search, you'll find this is a very common problem)o The document feeder fails to properly feed at least 50% of the faxes I try and send.o The printer, on a fairly regular basis, starts printing OK and then garbles the print on the rest of the page.o The scanner will scan a few times and will then stop responding (I have an older USB scanner that works just fine so I am pretty sure it is not my PC)o A minor annoyance is that the printer starts bugging me to change the cartridge when it still has about 1/4 of its ink left.In short, this was a terrible disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks like a winner!","review":"Just bought this printer and so far, so good. The install was very smooth, once the printer finished grinding through its rather lengthy initialization.

Copying works as expected. Scanning is the big surprise. The digital filing function allows you press a button to scan documents from the feeder or glass directly to a network drive without needing to do anything on a connected computer. You can also request a scan from a computer as with most all-in-ones.Print quality is excellent. Speed is ho-hum.

The printer stopped and said that it wouldn't print without a new yellow print cartridge. I went to the store and bought an XL cartridge and installed it. The result was yellow ink in splooged all over inside the printer, which then informed me that there was a problem with the yellow/black printhead. I spent over $100 to have a new printhead sent next-day day from HP. I installed it, and the result is more yellow ink spewed all over, and now the printer is saying both printerheads (including the new one) are shot.

It is a shame because I would rate all the other aspects of the printer very highly. It prints, receives faxes, and copies very well.

It has frequent paper jams no matter how careful you are. These jams are cumbersome to clear as you need easy physical and visual access to the back of the machine. If there is a tiny shred of torn paper in there, good luck trying to find it. The two sided printing function most always ends up in a paper jam so I would consider that function useless. The ink cartridges do not last long and they are very expensive to replace. I rarely use the color printing yet they need frequent replacing. When one goes, you have to replace them all. The scanner function works well. Basically, this is a poorly made machine that is expensive to maintain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst printer I have ever used.","review":"Jams are common. We have to hold the ink chamber closed with tape, or else it falls open, which cancels printings.

I wanted one Receiver and 3 Transmitters making it much more difficult to find. I got a mix of SmarHome and SmartHome Plus from 2 different venders, they weren't compatible.

I found the story very romantic, and every time Anthony and Olivia met, it was in an adventurous and non conventional situation. Maybe there are some points to review which can make this book somehow inverosimil, but I was only looking for a nice story to keep me company.

I was looking forward to see what fate had in store for Olivia. I tried very hard to get into the story, but I couldn't. I wanted so much to like the character of Anthony, but I found him to be very undesireable. He is a villan with almost no redeaming qualities. I did not like Anthony at all, and the ending was not only a disappointment, I was angry with the way the book ended. It's not worth the time it takes to read it.

Though the story captivated me I was disappointed with the ending of this book. The hero and heroine referred several times to living a dream I felt their relationship had no real basis and no commitment!(more a nightmare than a dream) They refuse to get married and they make their living by stealing from others (piracy). The heroine breaks her fathers heart by running off at the end - I was truly disappointed when I closed this book, definetely not a keeper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The least credible romance","review":"Olivia, the daughter of Cato Granville, is woolgathering one day, steps off the edge of a cliff and is knocked unconscious. She is rescued by a pirate ship and, once she recovers, the pirate captain climbs into her bed and just casually has sex with her. Riiiight. Okay. And she decides that she wants to see him again?!So then once he has her taken home, she sneaks out of her father's house to meet him again. And even when she realises that he has to be part of a plot to work against her father's political agenda, she stays quiet and doesn't tell Cato what's going on. Even though she knows that Anthony is a pirate.I'm sorry; I just didn't see any romance in here, and I didn't even like the 'hero'. And as for the ending, what kind of thing is that? I kept waiting for him to renounce his lawless life, but no; he continues to be a pirate, and Cato lets Phoebe go to him instead of having him handed over to the police and hanged. And they don't even get married!Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"I only read the first 2 chapters of this book and then stopped because to me, it was silly.

The story seemed to drag a bit. I was very disappointed in the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the whole series....","review":"Years ago I read The Silver Rose by Jane Feather and hated it. I remember very cruel characters and a weak, downtrodden hero. I saw Feather had just released a new hardcover so I thought I'd give her one more try. Well, of course, I had stumbled upon the conclusion of a trilogy. Still - the book intrigued me and I really liked the characters: Olivia was quirky but likeable and Anthony (with his crooked grin and great sense of romance - didn't you love the beach scene?) was charming and sexy. But then I realized I really needed more background on the villain, Brian, and the other two women, Portia and Phoebe. So I gobbled up the Hostage Bride (loved it!) and the Accidental Bride (so-so) and then finished the Least Likely Bride. Read them in order - they'll make more sense- and I'm sure you'll enjoy the whole series. Jane Feather has redeemed herself in my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical Romance","review":"Too much historical and not enough romance. This was my first Jane Feather read. Anthony did not live up to a pirate's bravery when it came down to Olivia having to face her father whom she betrayed for him (he sat safely and comfortably at the beach drawing pictures of her.) Their relationship was not well developed, Anthony was never even properly introduced to her family and they never even got married. Olivia seem to be making all the sacrifices for their relationship while Anthony makes sacrifices for his friends/family..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely detailed narrative","review":"In war, major battles are filled with lots of little events which make up the big picture. In George Koskimaki's second book on the 101st Airborne Division in World War II, he chronicles the division's actions during Operation Market Garden. The narrative is primarily personal accounts from paratroopers, glider troops and Dutch civilians who were there and witnessed the greatest airborne operation in history.I found the action to be very compelling, although it does bounce around a bit and can be hard to follow chronologically at times. If you've ever watched \\"Band of Brothers\\" or \\"A Bridge Too Far\\", you'll enjoy this book for it's firsthand look at what the 101st went through during their struggle to seize the bridge at Nijmegen and subsequently to hold the stretch of ground known as \\"Hell's Highway.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Readable","review":"While I am extremely grateful to the author for his service, this book was almost unreadable.

Regardless, it goes to the bottom of the pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell's Highway","review":"Well documented, very interesting story on part of the \\"Market Garden \\" operation.

I was born in 1959 and I've seen all of the old war movies. This book brought it all down to a very human level.

It may have been on a shelf for some time, but was unmarked, undamaged, and will be a fine addition to my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great basics","review":"This book is wonderful for anyone interested in RR signaling. It gives a great history of signals and leads the reader to modern line side signal operations.

This book gave me a basic idea (I guess there are too many configurations/railroad) but most of the book covered the early history of signaling. Interesting, but I wanted more of a recent 'field guide' type book. I have 7 signals to look at within a mile bike ride of my house and I still cant figure out 5 of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor and Incorrect Technical Content","review":"This is little more than a photography book. There is little technical content, and some of the diagrams have horrendous errors. You will never learn how a dispatcher knows a block is entered from the north or south, or the dilmenas faced by engineers and dispatchers when cab signaling fails, and why someone would design an electrical relay that is kept spinning like a top. Got a Sprint phone? The connection to Southern Pacific Railroad isn't even mentioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"The standard","review":"When it comes to price guides, Beckett sets the standard and is the standard. For those who are avid collectors like myself, Beckett price guides are your bible. The pleasure I get in collecting sports memorabilia is the nostalgia factor and the fact that unless sports die all together in the future, you're making a great investment for yourself and quite possibly for the entire family. The simple Beckett price guides will not display each card's value, but it will give you the value on the superstars which is what you should be shooting for anyway in your card collection. Beckett does sell larger issues of their price guide to satisfy those who still prize their Joe Peppatone rookie card. For this, we are eternally grateful to Beckett. Plus, as opposed to any other sports-related magazines, Beckett's articles on hobby collecting are quite enjoyable. Also, their tips on safety of your collection is priceless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beckett Baseball Guide","review":"I was very excited about getting my lst issue of the beckett magazine, but was very disappointed when I looked in the back where the price guides are and found the print was too small and blurred for me to read it.

Ms. Roby did not take the time to develope her characters and the use of the designer labels wore me out!

I read this book some time ago, and I think what Mrs. Roby was trying to point out is that, still after all the name brand material things the character had, she still was miserable. That's how I looked at it. In todays society, there are people that are jealous of other peoples because of what they drive, the clothes they wear, etc, etc, but we don't have an idea what they are going through, to get it or to keep it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ FOR ALL","review":"I thought the book was refreshing and beyond entertaining.

Stay strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Trying To Figure Out Where All The Hype Came From","review":"I finally broke down and purchased this book after several episodes of picking it up off of the shelf, scanning the back cover and buying something else. I should have followed my first, second and third instincts and left it in the store. I read it in the space of an afternoon and it didn't live up to even 10% of all the hype it has generated. I don't know which book all of these people who gave it 4-5 stars read but the one I read had boring and materialistic characters, a predictable storyline and an abrupt, boring ending. I hope her new one is better but I can't even waste my time reading it to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A monumental waste of time","review":"This book features(?) cliched characters, implausible plot twists, and a highly unflattering, though probably unintentional, view of middle class African American life. Is there a cliche that wasn't explored here, a brand name that wasn't dropped? The only thing missing was the evil overseer and the trashy white woman. I felt that I was reading a book written by a high school dropout. It's my worst nightmare; someone with enough ability to write a book with no talent. I can't believe I read the whole thing, but it was kind of like watching a car accident: I had to see the whole thing through."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT DEBUT (4.5 STARS)","review":"Well, after reading the different reviews about this book I was very skepital about reading it. But after the first page I realized that I was going to enojoy the book, and that is just what I did.The book is about two friends, Regina and Karen, who are dealing with the problems of marriage. Regina belives that her husband Larry is cheating on her, and Karen cannot stand the fact that her husband,John,is gambling their money away. There are a few surprises in this book, but I have to admit that the ending is predictable. I can relate to this book because there are a lot of us women out there that want to be with our boyfriends/husbands after they have done something unthinkable. I think this book really tells readers that life will go on without the one that you love even though it may hurt. Love and pain is all a part of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good First Novel","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book, it was a nice easy read. It was a very interesting story, and I commend the author on her first novel. I could not give the book 5 stars, however, because there were some things that took away from the book. As one reviewer mentioned, there was just TOO MUCH NAME DROPPING! I understand that the author was trying to convey the financial and material success of the main characters, but the mentioning of name brand clothes, perfumes, and cars was a bit too much. Also, Regina's story was just too predictable! In spite of my criticisms of the book, I did enjoy it and kept in mind that this was the author's first novel. I think she has real talent, and I will read more books by her in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent read","review":"This book is definitely not on my list of favorite books. The author was not very imaginative or expressive. I found that the writing was simple and ridden with cliches. However, the book eventually drew me in, but unfortunately it ended just when I began to appreciate the characters and story line. The lives of other characters seemed interesting as well and I wanted to learn more about them, but was not given that opportunity as a reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"FLAT CHARACTERS, FLAT PLOT, FLAT ENDING","review":"I found this book to be a total waste of time. The characters were undeveloped and suffering from delusions of grandeur. They author thinks having a jeep cherokee and a maxima equal wealth and demonstrate success in the black community? Give me a break, the characters were living paycheck to paycheck. I thought this book was a total waste of time and money, I wish I could get a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"GUESS I MISSED THE BOAT","review":"I couldn't get past the first chapter. I found the writing trite and juvenistic with that name dropping laundry list type of writing aspiring writers have a tendency to use. Surprisingly this did not bother most of the people who placed their comments, but it truly bothered me.Like someone stated she is young and perhaps she will fine tune her skills as she goes along. I hope so. No doubt she feels a need to share her stories, but in that process she must give us something we really will enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too predictable","review":"The storyline was too predictable and full of cliches. More in-depth character development would have helped greatly. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO SERVICE2!","review":"I NEVER RECEIVED THIS BOOK! VERY DISAPPOINTING TO PURCHASE AN ITEM FROM AMAZON AND NOT RECEIVE IT. I HOPE THAT AMAZON CAN CORRECT THIS ERROR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work to eat; eat to live; live to ride; ride to work.","review":"The author (THC) was stuck in what sounds like an impoverished and lonely life before he became a messenger. As a messenger, he found himself a part of a greater community (of messengers) and began to see organic patterns in the previously indecipherable and hostile city. This book is more than just the diary of a twenty-something messenger though. The author has many relevant things to say about our auto-centered culture. Many other reviewers are critical of THC's anti-auto polemic; I wonder how many of them use walking or biking as primary transportation. If you share THC's concern about the state of our transportation infrastructure, I heartily recommend James Howard Kunstler's \\"Nowhere\\" books (Home from Nowhere in particular)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rookie Romanticism","review":"This book exhudes rookiness from every page. Culley seems to be the typical newbie messenger, overly impressed with himself and hyper-romanticizing the profession.Still the book is pretty good. His view of cities and history is realistic, and the description of the courier offices and the seemy side of the business is spot on.157"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying way to hard to sound impressive.","review":"The chapter about watching people in a track stand competition made me laugh out loud. The whole book felt like he was trying really hard and the random childhood flashbacks made no sense to me. It had one or two neat chapters but it didn't save the book. And if some statements i have heard about this book are true then i dislike it more. If you want to read it see if you can borrow it from someone or something. Save your cash for beer or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This was one of the most poorly written books that I have ever started to read. I quit after 20 pages. My suggestion, don't bother with this selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this book","review":"The Immortal Class is a book with endless potential, but Culley let's his bloated ego and misinformed angst get in the way.Culley's book is about his brief stint as a bike messenger in downtown Chicago and his rage against car-crazed America. During the course of the book, Culley tries to preach to choir about a back to basics approach to modern living. And while that sounds like a humble and inoffensive premise for a memoir, Culley gets it all wrong by blaming everyone but himself, for the way things are today. He has endless rants about the evils of money, how corporations are inherently evil, how the city is too loud and has too many buildings. One thing he convinently leaves out is that the bike messenger industry is fueled by, in large part, corporations.I really wanted to like this book, but it's terribly written, incredibly insipid, and unintelligent."},{"rating":"1","title":"just not my type, I guess...","review":"I was so put off by this guy's writing that I couldn't keep reading the book. Too arrogant, too trying-to-be mystical and guru-ish. Seems like other readers either love or hate it, I was the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"immortal class. ok","review":"Here's what you learn from this book: as a class, bicyclists have about the strongest sense of anyone of their own moral superiority despite the fact that they are as incosiderate in public spaces as just about anyone, and, as a class, bicycle messengers are like bicyclists in general but even further convinced of their own cosmic significance and worth, and they are even less considerate of others. You learn that no one on a bike has ever done anything wrong, and that though messengers serve corporate America, they are, through some bizarre twisting of facts in their heads, actually undermining capitalism, saving the poor, and generally spreading enlightnement. You just can't help but wonder whether the words can be found to praise them as highly as they deserve. But don't take my word for it, check out the review from a customer with all the quotes from the book and then decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delusions of grandeur","review":"Maybe, like me, you figured that a bike messenger is basically a kind of freelance corporate errand boy. Not that there's anything wrong with that: somebody has to hustle all that corporate paper around from one office building to the next, lest the wheels of finance begin to slow. Well, imagine my surprise at what I learned from this book: bike messengers are not mere errand boys on wheels after all. Turns out that they are members of a noble aristocracy called \\"The Immortal Class,\\" whose selfless, heroically athletic feats of downtown daring-do are actually all about saving the environment, resisting the dehumanizing forces of capitalism, sticking it to The Man, living free and unencumbered by square values and bourgeois hang-ups, and just generally existing on a higher spiritual plane than the two-legged dullards who do not partake of the \\"Cult of Human Power.\\" Ya learn something every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take the Road!","review":"Despite the quite imperfect quality of the writing itself, the exhilarating narrative and subject matter are the reasons to love this book. The roads out there are unsafe for bicyclists for primarily these two reasons: aggressive drivers and timid cyclists. This book inspires me to claim my right to the road, thereby increasing my own safety and enjoyment while biking. Even though it attempts quite a bit, I think it touches on everything well, while remaining incredibly fun to read. You really won't want to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging memoir which reflects on urban bike messengers","review":"Immortal Class is an engaging memoir which reflects on urban bike messengers and their activities, and blends an autobiography of Culley's work in Chicago as an artist/bike messenger with a reflection of the status and role of the bike messenger as an outsider/observer of American society. An intriguing study evolves."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh my wordy!","review":"though this book gives a glimpse of the overall pace and stress of a bike messenger's work, it is incredibly overwritten. too much sloppy, masturbatory prose. worth a skim if youre intersted in the bike courier lifestyle, but take it with a few grains of salt. it is clear, after a few chapters, that this cat didnt actually live the life himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent within its limited scope.","review":"I used this book to set up a successful small intranet. The authors write more clearly than the vast majority of computer-help book writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very useful","review":"This book attempts to do the impossible by guiding non-technical people through the process of building an NT intranet. It starts with \\"what is a network\\" and transitions quickly to installing IP and installing IIS. The book lacks any technical depth and I found it mostly useless. Windows NT Server 4 Unleashed worked better for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not typical of Audrey Wood","review":"I totally agree with the other reviewer on this book. Audrey Wood is one of my favourite authors but unfortunately she's missed the plot on this one. The little girl in the story is whiney and painful and the illustrations are just not appealing at all. Not at all typical of an Audrey Wood story I don't think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, colorful book","review":"This book is a real winner. The words are different than the usual infant/toddler words and the pictures are accurant and fun to look at. My grand daughter loves the babies that are drawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disagree with most","review":"I disagree with most of the other reviewers...I used this book in my storytimes at my library and the children ALL liked it. It has been my experience that kids like stories about children who aren't perfect. Not all books are sweetness and light. The little girl is a pill, but so are lots of kids and they relate to her. Matthew is sweet...and the good kids can relate to him and since he sort of \\"wins out\\" in the end, there seems to be fulfillment here for some type of value lesson. The age of the listener should be over four. I liked the illustrations as they were detailed enough to allowed a child to sit and ponder, especially after hearing it read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Exercise Book","review":"Pavel again writes a book that is well written.

KB's ( just like all forms of exercise equipment) can be dangerous if you fool around when using it. And some people here have mis quoted Pavel as saying there's no magic inside KB's. The only thing inside KB's are the work ethic of a machine & the pain tolerance of a god.KB's have helped my martial arts greatly. KB's are great for everyone, from old to young and can help melt the fat or build muscle or get stronger. I recommend getting the book first, then the video, watch Pavel preform the drills with good form is a valuable training aid. Also there are many KB clubs starting througout the U.S.KB's are a great training tool and I highly recommend all other Pavel books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"I've enjoyed Pavel's previous works, and find his insights and knowledge refreshing when compared to the mainstream; but sadly I can not recommend this book. The Russian Kettlebell Challenge is 143 pages long and in my opinion, the majority of the book is filler--I counted only 66 pages with valid information on Kettlebell lifting (and that's being generous). There are eleven blank pages (fifteen counting the four section pages) and sixteen pages that were a maximum of half full. The first two sections of the book (32 pages!) were comprised of the history of Kettlebells, and Pavel's reasoning on why they're so great. This book reminded me of one of my college term papers were I had procrastinated until the last minute, and used every possible technique to stretch the length of the paper. At $34.95, this book is definitely not worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beginning...","review":"If you are not familiar with the Russian kettlebell world this is a reasonable introduction to it from a leader in the field. There is a bit too much text and editing could have been tighter. I'm one who prefers shorter, more concise descriptions with higher quality pictures. Perhaps the Russians prefer to write this way so you take it stride to mine the gems from it, and there are several to mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUSSIAN KETTLEBELL CHALLENGE","review":"this book was quite humorous but i thought there would be more how to use it ie more exercise sets,how to start how to finish what should you be aiming for after a month of use etc it was quite poor in this regard as he spent a lot of time waffling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kettlebells deserve a better book than this.","review":"I wish it were easy to return this book. Pages 50-108 and page 112 have content- ten good, well-illustrated exercises and variants. The first fifty pages, though, are lame anecdotes. The last fifty are ads and lists of various programs.It pales in comparison to the Naked Warrior, which deserves twenty stars and is a steal at $20.Kettlebells and the principles espoused by Pavel Tsatsouline can be a life-changing revelation, but this book does not do them justice. If you've seen the exercises on the internet at all, this book won't add to your knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the book, it's worthless, but the DVD...","review":"...is good. I wanted to give kettlebell lifting a try, so I got the book and DVD. The book is garbage for showing how to lift the kb's. I know excercises can be tough to show in a book, but these are REALLY bad. The rest of the book is just telling you that kb's are awesome and they were invented in Russia. The DVD on the other hand is well done and shows you how to perform the lifts. The DVD also contains the only valuable info in the book, how to set up a workout program. Plus, I am annoyed by the poor editing. Fine, so the info is the same, and its the info we pay for blah, blah, blah. To me, it just shows a lack of respect for people who are paying good money to buy your product. He has a new KB book and video out now, \\"enter the kettlebell\\". Don't have it and don't know how good it is, but you now may able to pick this DVD up cheap, used somewhere, since it's no longer sold new. Skip the book unless it's free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pavel's done it again!","review":"Once again, Pavel has written a book that should be read by anyone wanting to improve their conditioning. In this book, Pavel explains why kettlebell lifting is such a great tool in developing strength and burning bodyfat. As the book warns: Be careful, this isn't your spinning or aerobic class. Even the lightest kettlebell (16kg) will give a majority of people a rough time at first. You really want to read and then re-read about proper technique. There are a lot of photos to help with proper form. The sample routines give you a variety of workouts from simple to complex, or you can develop your own workout by following Pavel's guidelines. Once you give kettlebells a try, you probably won't want to go back to your standard workout again because they can be addicting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"still waiting for it","review":"I have not received my order so i cannot rate it.

Anyway, read this book if you are interested in strength endurance and gaining strength without \\"bulking up\\". Perfect for military personnel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quit The Gym","review":"I can highly recommend RKC. The days are over of Monday: Biceps and Triceps,Tuesday: Chest and Shoulders ETC.. It is a total body work out. I first started with dumbells to see if I liked the work out. I purchased RKC the DVD version, watch it several times before starting to lift any weight. I later bougth an actual Kettlebell, although it is the same weight as I was using the KB is more difficult to use. I quit my gym after the first week of starting the RKC. For example I have seen my biceps grow, yet I have not done a bicep curl in two months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unique, but not great.","review":"The subject matter here is unique and the only thing which comes close to justifying the book's high price. As with most of Pavel's books, there is a small bit of information stretched out over many pages. Yes, Pavel has a cult following who would give four stars to a blank piece of paper with his name it, so don't be fooled. If you must have a book on kettlebell lifting, this is your only choice at the time, but don't expect much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wagner's Ring","review":"Enthralling!

Shamelessly greedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","review":"How about releasing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon separately for those of that already own the other two or for people that are only interested in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon? Seems like a ludicrous marketing ploy to me. As much as I want Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, I am not going to buy the set when I already have the other two. By the way, the low rating is not for the films, but it is for the already stated packaging of an unnecessary bundled product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Release CROUCHING TIGER by itself ON THE SAME DATE","review":"We all know CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER and HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS are already on Bluray, and most fans of this genre already own those two titles.

This is the absolute worst litter I have used in 20 yrs. Having purchased several scoopable litters this one more or less just became a piece of mud in the litter pan and never really activated with the urine to clump like most other litters of this type. What I also experienced was urine sitting on top of the litter. Tried this on a whim because of the price, what a waste. TIP: I have recently purchased Meijer's store band scoopable litter and found it to be the best I have ever used, even better than Fresh Step. It clumps into a mass and scoops out easily.

This shot on video movie about a great-looking guy who searches for his (...) in the porn underworld deserves a lot of credit for it's intelligence, but most of all for it's unrelenting intensity. Aside from the pulpy aspects, this film has some incredibly honest moments: the relationship between the two leads rings strong and true; this film also has the most intense \`rape' scene since the one in that French film \\"IRREVERSIBLE\\". Probably not your cup of tea if you like comedies with the word \`wedding' in the title.

So once the good taste snobs and the aesthetic snobs took their whacks at this movie, it didn't have a chance in theaters.It is, however, a really enjoyable classic-style B-movie, like the work of Anthony Mann or DETOUR (which is featured briefly in the film). Director Tim McCann has made a couple of great under-the-radar movies, and this fits snugly in with those. I recommend checking this out, as well as his previous work REVOLUTION #9 (which also has a Beatles title) and DESOLATION ANGELS (which also deals with a man unhinged by a secret dealing with his girlfriend). The acting all around, in the lead and smaller roles, is surprisingly and uniformly brilliant.If you can get over yourself, I think you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"As expected","review":"After about 6 months and 500 prints it is still running.

As one would expect, there are lots of loose strings about the story and many unanswered questions. The purpose of the book is not necessarily to delve into every detail. But the information that IS there rings so true, and it is sad to learn that she has continued to follow the path she was on, and MORE. She had a classy way about her and apparently still does, but there was that devious, calculating underbelly.The remaining chapters are engaging and present information that one would not particularly seek out, but fascinating and eye-opening.Dr. Bass comes across as a genial fellow and practical investigator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Author","review":"Dr. Bass is very knowledgeable about the subject he has studied and taught to others for many years.

Instead we get a flimsy biogrophy of Mr. Bass that deviates from the title of the book. There is also an entire chapter that kisses up to Patricia Cornwell. I found it very watered down compared to other forensic study books. No offense to Mr. Bass and his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found the topic fascinating, but the writing left something to be desired. Forensic cases that he labeled as the \\"most bizarre of his career\\" turned out not be so bizarre after all. In fact, some turn out to be rather mundane. Most of the cases seemed \\"rushed\\" and \\"over-edited\\". Believe it or not, the book turned out to be rather boring, mostly due to the overabundance of personal interludes - like when his wife is diagnosed with stomach cancer - sorry, Mr. Bass, but people are not buying this book to hear about your wife's illness. Especially when discussion of your wife has been limited to one or two sentences in chapter two. Mr. Bass should stick to forensics and leave writing to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is a little bit racist like being a little bit pregnant?","review":"I do not question this Author's intelligence or scientific knowledge.

Many books written in rhyme do not necessarily convey a good story; Peet does a spectacular job of telling a touching story, with much depth, all in rhyme. It is one of my favorite childrens' books, because it keeps you \\"hooked,\\" is entertaining, and relays an important message about how terrible greed can make us feel, and how much better it makes us feel to share with and help someone.

I like that they are made with Scharffen Berger chocolate (which is delicious and extremely high quality), and I love the assortment of flavors that Ganache for lips has to offer. This is a chapstick that both smells and tastes delicious, and it is naturally good for you lips.

This album has very upbeat and danceable salsas and the change of acoustic arrangements is immediately evident in this cd. All the songs encompass beats that were wonderfully mastered to produce salsas rhythms that are unique in sound and tempo. As usual Rey' s voice is outstanding and excels in every song. \\"Destino\\" is a worthy purchase as are all his other productions if you are a fan of Rey Ruiz.

Mr. Bruce can find humour in tragedy and a vein of sadness just below the surface of comedy. These could only have been written by someone who had lived a long life in the role of an outsider, and who understands the uneasy truce that defines the end point in the battle against alcoholism. A truly riveting and unforgettable journey through the soul of a superb storyteller with a wealth of stories to tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ Enjoyment!","review":"Eddie Bruce (sole author of this book, btw) will take you into the lives of totally believable people...they are real! You will laugh and cry and become involved with each story and character.

I consider this a 'must-read' for everyone interested in learning more about people of the world...especially the 'unfortunate' who become the 'fortunate'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern MacBeth above the Rest","review":"Very helpful, affordable, and clear.

He has learning disabilities and this made it so easy and enjoyable for him. Highly recommended to develop an interest in Shakespeare and past literature for those with reading difficulties. Wonderful to have the actual text on the opposite page. So much easier for him to understand the meaning of the original text."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bloody story of witchcraft and betrayal!!!!","review":"I felt that Macbeth was the easiest to understand of all Shakespeare plays. I thought this play was based on betrayal, witchcraft, and murder. Though Macbeth committed many murders, I think his wife influenced him greatly. She poisoned the guards so Macbeth could assassinate Duncan. The witches also had a lot of influence on Macbeth. Every time he visited them they would tell him the future, what murders he would commit, and what thrones he would take. I thought that Macbeth should have prepared for Duncan's sons and friends to come back for revenge. Since he was going insane from hearing the voices and seeing the ghosts he was doomed for death. I was rather disappointed in this play compared to all of the other Shakespeare play that I've read. Although this is an exceptional book compared to \\"Lord of Flies\\". Macbeth is much more exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to Understand","review":"MACBETH, in play form, is a good book although hard to understand.

I was looking for one of those Shakespeare versions that footnoted the words and phrases you didn't understand, so you could piece together the meaning yourself.

These places are usually owned and operated by people who are not native to Maine, and Mainahs generally don't eat in them. They make their money from tourists.

I had two optical cables in my cabinet, this one an a more expensive one. This one stopped working, the other is fine. With a little jiggling, I could get it to go intermittently; now, not at all. Apparently a crack developed because of the moderate bend I had in it. Do not buy unless you have a pretty straight shot out the back of your unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a low cost very effective optical cable.

However, I cannot even set my equipment back in their shelves without the cables popping out.I've been trying to connect these cables to my Yamaha receiver, Sony Blue-Ray player and Samsung TV.

The original product description was visible under the black sharpie that had been used to cover it, with a sticker describing the correct cable below it. Too bad the correct cable wasn't actually in that package. Returning it tomorrow.Also amusing (in a totally non-ironic way I swear) that the cable as listed, less than a week after I ordered it, is half the price I paid for it.

This cable doesn't fit in any of the digital optical ports on either component - I almost damaged my hardware trying to get the connector to click. I tried holding the cable in place on both ports, but still there was no sound.

The picture was to bright and some of the word in the movie were all mumble together so you couldn't understand what they were saying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick without Nora or Asta","review":"This is a delightful film for fans of William Powell and the Thin Man series. In this outing, he is Philo Vance, a different sleuth, but with all of the Nick Charles charm. His leading lady is the stunningly beautiful Mary Astor, of Maltese Falcon fame. This movie has everything fans of 30's movies love: trains, ocean liners, gorgeous gowns and interiors, men in hats. Vance even has a doggie sidekick, a plucky Scottie. The locked-room problem is gotten out of the way fairly early, so it is more matter of determining which moustachioed, hat-wearing character did the deed. Truthfully, the plot of The Kennel Murder Case is more plausible than that of the original Thin Man. Highly enjoyable, and the source print for this DVD was surprisingly good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"Philo Vance is terribly fun and I love this movie. Unfortunately, the DVD's source is very poor quality. The picture is a little fuzzy and the sound is very muffled. I'd love it if someone did a restoration for this amusing movie. In the meantime, if the distributors could just add subtitles, it would be very helpful.I recommend this movie to people who enjoy the first \\"The Thin Man\\" movie. Philo Vance is about as foppish and dandy as Nick and Nora Charles, though not quite as marinated.You do need to have fairly good hearing to catch all the dialog. There are no subtitles. There are no extras."},{"rating":"1","title":"unwatchable","review":"My husband and I sat down to watch this, really looking forward to it because we are big fans of William Powell. Unfortunately the quality of the DVD was so bad that we simply couldn't watch it--whole portions of the screen were white so you couldn't tell one character from another. Fortunately my husband had mistakenly bought me a DVD with four mysteries on it and it included the Kennel Murder Case--we found this DVD, a much cheaper version we thought would be worse, was excellent and we were able to enjoy watching the movie. This is not a great mystery and there are a lot of ends that don't tie up, but it's always fun to watch William Powell--even without Myrna Loy. It doesn't have the sparkle and wit of the Thin Man series though."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken","review":"I was into the movie and right before the climax the tape would not play.

Do yourself a favor and look for a good, remastered version of this movie from someone else and enjoy! The story and plot are well worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Philo Vance Is A Genius","review":"THE KENNEL MURDER CASE is an old-fashioned detective movie complete with a locked room mystery and a case of mistaken identity. The detective work by the hero Philo Vance is brilliant. The film is based on a novel by S.S. Van Dyne. It is a fun movie even though the story takes place during the height of the Great depression in New York City.The role of Vance is played convincingly by William Powell. The strong supporting cast includes Eugene Pallette, Mary Astor, Ralph Morgan, Jack LaRue, Helen Vinson, Etienne Girardot and Paul Cavanaugh.The film's director Michael Curtiz also directed CASABLANCA and YANKEE DOODLE DANDY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake up people. This book is so outdated. Don't waste your $$$","review":"With all the sound scientific research out there about the benefits of chiropractic, it's hard for me to believe that people still adhere to the 1800's quackery myth. Chiropractic is not a cult, a religion, a scam, etc. It is science at its best. If you read this incredibly biased and incomplete book, please take the time to do some scientific research on the subject as well. I did not find this book to be a good resource at all. It's quite paranoid and full of holes to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old Lies","review":"This book is filled with the same old lies that have been peddled before. If Chiropractic is so dangerous, why do they have one of the lowest malpractice insurance payments in the health care industry? Seems to me that if people were get harmed or dieing from chiropractic adjustments, Chiropractors would have to have higher insurance payments to cover all that liability. No doubt there are bad chiropractors, just as there are bad physicians, plumbers, teachers, etc. Every field has its losers and scammers. But most of Long's statistics and information seems out-dated, unsubstantiated, and misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knowledge is Power - Take Control","review":"The Naked Chiropractor by Dr. Preston Long is a must read for anyone, which includes the vast majority of us, who currently suffers or will suffer from back pain. This is a no-nonsense book that gives the reader the power to seek and receive the most effective and appropriate treatment for their back pain. I have suffered with back pain for 30 years and I have seen first-hand many of the practices that Dr. Long writes about that are perpetuated within the chiropractic field. Many of these are not based on scientific evidence, are potentially lethal and (I'll be kind) border on fraud.Protect yourself and your family, read this book before you visit another chiropractor or Alternative Medicine Provider.Take control of your healthcare and learn about the concept of Evidence-Based Medicine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best music for studying!","review":"I was looking for a CD of the punk/alternative/rock genre that didn't have lyrics because music with lyrics is distracting when I'm trying to read or study. I just wanted upbeat background instrumental music. This CD is the best for that purpose. Great songs that will make studying more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Showcases Fugazi's instrumental prowess!","review":"This (mostly) instrumental release really showcases Fugazi's music (which, in my opinion, has always been Fugazi's real strength). This is highly recommended for fans of bands like Slint and Sonic Youth. Despite one absolutely awful throwaway tune (in which Fugazi unsuccessfully attempts to show the world that they have a sense of humor), Instrument is a welcome addition to Fugazi's catalog (especially if you're a fan but have grown a little tired of the often too-PC, too-abstract lyrics of other titles)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get this last","review":"I just find it hard to get into a CD that is primarily a bunch of unreleased demos and live tracks. Unlike other bands like Pavement, Fugazi's best songs always made it onto the albums. There are no gems here, just raw versions of songs that sound much better in their final incarnations. You are much better off getting all of the other studio releases first. If that is not enough Fugazi for you, buy the video and watch that. If you really like it, then come back and buy this. You will probably really enjoy it. This should be the absolute last thing in the Fugazi catalog you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic, melodramatic, gothic novel","review":"I love the genre, so I am a little biased. It was fast, enjoyable read that I couldn't put down. I loved the setting and the plot ideas. True, it wasn't believable, but that is the nature of the gothic novel. I enjoyed the dramatic dialogue and I really like the ghosts.But, I do have a couple of complaints. The plot was way to predictable. I kept turning the pages waiting for the twist, but I already knew all the secrets pretty much from the first third of the book. This didn't stop me from enjoying it though.And the female character, Kate, really wasn't all that loveable.To sum it up, if you love gothic ghost stories, it is a must read, but it is not the very best I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best dessert cookbook you could ever purchase!","review":"Those who know Claudia and have had the pleasure of sampling her desserts know they're in for a treat when they purchase this cookbook. Not only is the book beautiful, it is very user-friendly and magnificently creative. I truly feel like an all-star chef when I make one of her creations. Although I think the book is worth spending the extra money on, $800 is ludicrous. I purchased it directly from Fleming's current restaurant in Southold, NY called The North Fork Table & Inn.

Too bad the recipes didn't deliver as promised.I tried four recipes in here one weekend (trying to pick one for Thanksgiving) and every single one turned out really badly.-The white chocolate espresso tart: Crust was impossibly dry and crumbly. White chocolate cream was too thick to drain through a cheesecloth as the directions asked.-Apple tart tatin: The caramel hardened into a hard candy shell on the bottom of the dish that was too difficult to break through.-Sour cherry and pear crisp: The wine that the cherries soaked in overpowered the dish, turning everything into a pink mass.-Citrus tuiles: These were just disastrous. They burned around the edges and stuck to the pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Recipes I Can't Wait to Use Again","review":"I don't usually write reviews but I have to in this case because Fleming's book has exceeded my expectations. I got it as a Christmas gift, and have since made about half a dozen of the recipes for a dessert party I had for my birthday last month. They were all superb, and while some were a little more complicated than others, all were definitely worth it. The party was a huge success, mostly due to Fleming's desserts, which disappeared before any of the others I made. From this book I made the panna cottas (almost too easy), chocolate caramel tarts (they were a lot of work but such a hit), caremelized pineapple (easy), maple flan (turned out perfect), chocolate brownie cookies (a cinch), and goat cheesecake with candied kumquats (very easy, gorgeous).

We both use the dumbells to accomplish a number of upper body exercises in the pool. Some dumbells that other people use in the pool fill with water or the end caps come off.

For me that was the single biggest factor that drove me to go analog.Pros:- The sound has a volume adjustment, which is great since I can turn it down to barely audible and concentrate on my music.- The dial is easy to change speeds - can do quickly in the middle of a sing if needed.

Hmmm, I wonder how many of them there are really measuring up to those standards???"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Police from a real cop.","review":"How often do you read a book where the writer describes drinking a cup of coffee while sitting across a restaurant booth from a corpse writing a death report and waiting for the medical examiners to arrive. David Ziskin brings his 20 years of street cop experience into his book with incisive wit and compassion. He also offers provocative ideas on the state of modern policing. A fine book. Lowen Clausen"},{"rating":"1","title":"the real police","review":"centers more around the history of police than the real effects of police staying on the \\"beat\\". I think the book rambles in different areas and does not center on the idea of policemen staying in \\"patrol\\" so that they can become familiar with thier beats. The premise is that the citizenry will comunicate better with a beat cop they know than just some uniform that shows up on call. Sorry it missed the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy Lancaster!!!","review":"I bought a Lancaster for my husband... The clasp on the strap kept coming undone and the crystal face cracked almost immediately. All that would be one thing, but the Lancaster accredited repair affiliate has had this watch for 4 months and cannot get hold of the parts from Lancaster!

Not only is this a wonderful text to supplement the lectures but will help you aced the physiology section of the USMLE 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great physio book","review":"This physio book is great. It easily and effortlessly breaks down the physiology that occurs in the human body without getting too technical or clinical. It delivers the basics and little fluff. Great book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great supplemental text","review":"This book served as a great introduction to new material. Prior to reading the accompanying section of my real textbook, I would study this one. It always provided a strong foundation and gave context to the more in depth material. With this book, I never lost sight of the \\"big picture\\". Is it adequate as a stand-alone text? No. But, it isn't billed as such. It's more of a review book than anything else...and it's a fine one at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"very concise and clearly written, essential reading for any in the field or those curious about the bodies' amazing complexity and how everything works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gr8 aid in my summer class!!!","review":"This book is very easy to understand. It is in outline format and is very concise. Does not give you all this xtra information that you may run into with a standard Physiology text book... It summarizes and gives you the most important features of each topic or atleast the most pertinent to you. I like this book and will keep it to add to my own personally science library because who knows when you will need it next time? maybe to cram for an exam?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Text!","review":"What a relief to have a physio text which gets right to the point without leaving the details behind. This book is a perfect balance between too little and too much. Towards the end of the course many of the students in my class had discovered this text and it was a \\"hot\\" commodity around school. Don't wait till the course is winding up, this is a great text to keep and keep as a reference. Totallt straight forward and EASY to read. I'm selling my Boron online!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"All throughout undergrad, I always used textbooks as reference material to use if I had unanswered questions from lecture. If that's what you're looking for, stay away from this book. If you're a student who's reading for comprehension rather than learning just the basics, this will be a disappointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I learned so much from this book","review":"Henry and Richard present a very Scriptural, balanced approach to this subject. This book helps us develop the kind of relationship with God where we know, recognize, and respond to His voice. While it's not some mystical, super-spiritual stuff, it does take time as we develop that kind of walk with God.Whether you don't feel you know God at all, or just want to know Him better, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good and practical","review":"What I liked the most about this book is it's practical application.

Not difficult to read, but difficult to accept. Hard to imagine that one of baseball's most loved and storied legends had such a difficult life. A well written and well researched book. Kept me interested from beginning to end. When I finally closed the book, I could not help but sigh. A sigh of such sadness will overcome you. Truly a sad outcome for such a gifted pitcher."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book!","review":"This novel is a great look into how money corrupts and confuses. The characters are real, just as confused as any of us about how the tax system works. The love element of the novel is real and moving. Love between a painter and woman who is strictly buisness is tough, and the book shows it. Worth the read (Plus, I'd like to give a shout out to my aunt!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor recording quality","review":"The songs were great but the CD recording quality was very poor. The cuts sounded overdriven and distorted on every player I tried it on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your library deserves better","review":"This must be about the 15th reissue of this recording, this time for RCA's 'library' series. Some people like this performance, because it is so 'full of profound feeling'. I don't. There's nothing wrong with showing empathy with the music, but Horowitz sometimes resembles a Tyrannosaurus Rex crying for help--I doubt there's a more histrionic performance available. Apart from that, the deluge of missed notes, a piano that sounds like a nail on a blackboard, a lot of crude piano banging and an uninspired support from Ormandy's NYPhO, make for a performance that is plainly dreadful. Also included: a sonata that sounds more like a Horowitz encore than Rachmaninov. Try Ashkenazy/Fistoulari, Andsnes/Berglund, Weissenberg/Pretre, Gieseking/Mengelberg (with even more wrong notes, but such excitement!) or of course one of Horowitz' earlier performances of the Rachmaninov 3rd."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"Almost useless for someone just starting out, a real disappointment, skip it and find help somewhere else. A waste of money. Believe me. Features detailed descriptions of what each tool does, too heavy on the audio. Sample projects would have been much more useful. Common mistakes, common glitches, common blunders, traps, that kind of thing. This is not the book to buy. Actually the slim booklet that came with the Vegas 4.0 is better, and there are many useful on-line reviews that have helped me much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written. Lacks depth","review":"This is a poorly written book. The exercises supposedly on the CD are not there. The book gives a flavour of the app. but concentrates too much on the audio aspects of Vegas. There is better information avaialble online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Doctoral Dissertation","review":"This is a flawed and boring dissertation comparing how armies learn. This institutional view uses the Malaysian Emergency and the British Army in comparison to the Vietnam War and the US Army. This is a well-researched thesis by a rising star in our Army, but he draws the wrong conclusions from Malaya and terms Vietnam a defeat. He seems to believe that our army did not adapt its tactics in Vietnam. That is incorrect.The real question is why do we forget our lessons so quickly? Why do our leaders cling to major weapons systems when this type of conflict is one of dismounted infantry, civil affairs and psyops troops?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vietnam Post Mortem","review":"This scholarly comparison of Britain's source of success in the Malayan insurgency and America's source of failure in Vietnam is justifiably regarded as a textbook for a new military facing new worldwide challenges. Much of the book is given over to index and reference and the writing style is complex, consisting of sometimes confusing compound sentences. However, the lessons to be learned and the shocking revelations of the inability of the U.S. Army's leadership to adjust to the realities and challenges of guerrilla warfare in Vietnam make for some chilling reading. Strongly recommended to students of modern military history and tactics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Very cool book for operators (armed forces and civilian) and regular people. It shows us what we should be trying to do in the whole world. Make people safer, and they'll help you find the really bad guys (not the everyday ones).

Being a singer in a band, and having a guitarist as a hubster, I feel I must share with you how I feel about Eric Sardinas. One day I just happened upon this CD and I was LUCKY! He is all I listen to. His voice is rough and raunchy and fits the cutting slide hard-core blues he plays. This CD Treat Me Right is with me all the time. It's in my truck AND my home! I have introduced this CD to many people who have never heard of Eric and they are amazed and agree with me about how talented he is. He kicks bu-double-T!!!!!!!!

Most of this book is just common sense, but sometimes it's nice to see what someone else has to say! This book has more substance than some others on the market, and the authors have included some (not much) information from sociologists. If you're (like me) almost 30 and trying to figure out who you are, where you're going, and what you might want to be when you maybe decide to grow up, this book can give you some inspiration and interesting insights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"My suggestion to other readers is do not waste your time or money on this book. I saw the two authors on several talk shows when this book was first published. They seemed likable and very much like people whom I could relate. So when the big 3-0 began to approach I ordered it from Amazon. I couldn't wait to tear into it. Unfortunately, I was very, very dissapointed. The best part of this book is the cover, and that's no lie. I ordered this book thinking I would get good information. Instead all I learned was that you can string together pages and pages of quotes from other people who were published years - even decades before you, and if you are lucky enough to get it published you can make alot of money and appear on several talk shows. With the constant quoting and paraphrasing this book reads like a college term paper. A bad college term paper"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Map!!!!","review":"fantastic well-written and researched map of Bangkok by people who really know the city inside out. The listings ands tips and advice as well as the Top ten are spot on and I found that I followed the map like a dream.

We used it on two trips and it stopped working halfway through the second one. I contacted the company via email and they told me for $80.00 I could send it to them and they would fix it or send a refurbished one. I paid over $200.00 for this piece of junk and I am not paying them more. There should be a warranty for at least a year. We have only had it since July of last year. I am very unhappy with this product and company. I will not be buying any more of their products and I suggest that you don't either!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasted 18 months","review":"I bought this in December of 2005, and it broke last month. I took great care with it: it was only in the car for trips, stored in the included case, kept in the house when it wasn't in use, etc.However, it broke last month. The dvd player itself still works if you connect it to a regular TV, but neither LCD display works at all.Even when it did work, it skipped a lot in the car, no matter where it was positioned or how much padding was under it. It worked best when riding down very smooth highways. Otherwise, it skipped quite a bit.I'm very disappointed in the quality of this device, given that I paid $280 for it at Target."},{"rating":"2","title":"We really liked this, for the time it worked!","review":"We have had this product for probably 3 years.

I've tried all the ideas from the website and handbook on how to fix this problem, and it's still not helping. I guess we got our money out of it. I just wish things would last longer than a few years! And we only use it about 3-4 times a year!! If I could find it again available for sale, I would probably purchase this. The other ones on Amazon seem to be SUPER dissapointing, so I'm not sure what we will do now for a portable DVD player!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY!!!","review":"This product didn't last very long for the money we spent on it two years ago ($250). Within the 90 day warranty period, one screen failed to work. I determined that the problem is with the #2 input on the DVD player - it's not the cords or the monitors, but the DVD player. For the kind of money we spent on this thing, I would expect better performance. When buying a portable DVD player, buy a service protection plan. From what I'm reading on them, most of them seem to die within a few months of purchase (generally after the not-so-generous 90 day warranty period. Go figure.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed for the price","review":"I purchased this DVD player at Target. It has been used 2 or 3 times.

Absolutely NO help available. I called the service number on the Kawasaki product, and no help available because the number on my product didn't match any number they had. Target employee couldn't find the number they were looking for either. I'm stalemated, with a piece of junk and no one interested in making good on it.

My complaint isn't with the novel, but with the edition itself. This isn't a \\"real\\" book with binding, but that's okay; the price is right. The problem, though, is that the print is very, very light. I've bought four of Marryat's novels from this same publisher, and every copy is the same -- the type is so light that it's almost illegible. So do read Marryat, by all means, but I'd strongly suggest buying a different edition. I'd have returned these except that they're quite large -- 8/12 x 11 -- and so it would have cost more to return than the refund.

First was the transition from the Union Army fighting Confederates to the U.S. Army fighting Indians.Utley documents how that work was made much harder by the cheapness of the War Department and Congress. Downsizing the Army drastically to save money wasn't enough. Congress stuck most the infantry with leftover muzzleloaders rather than repeaters, meaning that their Indian foes usually (Winchester-armed themselves) could bring superior firepower to bear.Meanwhile, the frontier Army had to go through the twists and turns of War Department, or Interior Department, twists and turns on Indian dealings, and in different high-level officers having different approaches not just to Indian fighting but to Indian truce and treaty negotiations.Meanwhile, the grunt work, as typical, was to be done by the infantryman, not the cavalryman.Read the whole story of his struggle to do his job in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Stuff!!!","review":"Mr. Niles certainly does a good job of making me hate the villains in this story.

Even during the day, the night light will still trigger. I want it to come on only when its pitch black. The only time it doesnt come on is when it is super bright in a room.

One stopped working after a day. I pulled it apart and the board trace was lifted and the LED was cold soldered on both leads. I resoldered it as best I could, plugged it in and - still dead. On the other hand, the other one still works, so it's a 50/50 chance yours will too.Note that these do not have light sensors, so they go on ALL the time when there is motion. Not terribly bright, but good enough for a night light. The diffuser on the bulb gives a harsh pattern on your floor/wall - they could have done a better job there. Also, you are going to end up plugging it in at the standard 12\\" off the floor - so pets walking by will constantly trigger this light.

They kick on at night as I walk past and the motion sensor is less reactive during the day but that depends on where you place them.

Originally ordered 2 and came back to order 6 more. Personally these are the way to go moving forward because leaving night lights running 24/7 was yesterday.

The Transdock is a great product for listening to music in the car. You can tune in on any frequency between 88.1 and 107.9 FM -- especially useful in large towns where there are a lot of FM stations and clear transmission isn't so easy to come by; its easy operation doesn't distract you from driving. Setup couldn't be simpler: connect the Transdock to the cigarette lighter or 12V plug, then the cable to the Transdock and to the Zen Vision. Turn on, tune and you're ready to go. The Transdock can also work like a recharger for any device that has a USB cable, such as a cell phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"FM Transmitters just aren't that great, but this one is not half bad! It is hard to find elsewhere on the web, so this may be a good way to go if it is compatible with your mp3 player. Not a bad deal, either, compared to lower performig ones sold in stores. If you really want to go with an FM Transmitter, this is a good way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Transmitter","review":"It's a great product for a Zen's user with one exception. After 3 month's of use when your battery is half charged or less and you use it to transmit and charge it will overheat and the thermal sensor turns it on and off every 10 seconds or so. But I haven't found anything better and there are ways to get around that problem as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"This is a terrible product.

I was able to locate an unused radio frequency in the Washington, DC, area and it works very nicely all over the city. The power adapter is a very tight fit - much tighter than my cell phone charger - in the power outlet. I did hear some static at one point, but it seems that the cable connecting the Zen with the TransDock functions like an antenna and, once the MP3 player was repositioned, the static went away.

And while I like country albums and Keith Urban this one just doesn't do it for me. I think it lacks a punch and a production that later albums possess.

In the doldrums of summer, they've played Clue, Hullaballo, Sorry, Mancala, checkers and the like. I thought with all the gold stickers on the box for awards and such that this game would be the game to end all games. Um, no. There doesn't really seems to be a point to having the board and tokens other than an attempt to differentiate itself from plain old charades. The whole game was just kind of weird and a bit painful to play (or maybe we're just cranky?). Some of the cards had cute ideas to act out and I did like the fact that my 4 year old could play (with sisters who can read the cards for her), but our reaction just goes to show you can't force laughs.

Game doesn't have a strategy and a lot of the cards are not fun to act out, there needs to be a purpose to the game not just read the card and do what it says and then off to the next person.

They have a unique colony world; their civilization is as old as Earth's, since Sirgol is the only planet known where time-travel can happen, and the first colonists dropped back thousands of years. Now the berserker machines have found them, and almost beaten them by scouring off the surface of their world, but the Sirgolians still have a chance as they fight the machines through the loops and bends of their planet's earthlike history. And on Sirgol, you can really go back and make it not happen. Saberhagen's berserkers are always a scary concept, but here they have a different side. It's a question critical to my own survival: how complicated can a machine be before it can be said to be 'alive?'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Assassin lacks killer punch","review":"Just as one expects from Fred Saberhagen, Brother Assassin is a quick, unstressful read. Assassin makes up for a glaring defect in its predecessor by focusing on one planet and having one character tie each story together; on the other hand, the Berserkers themselves leave little impression with the reader, the sense of menace from the first book is absent. While there is little negative to be said about the book (except, as another reviewer has noted, a blatent and disappointing chauvinistic remark near the end), there is little positive, either. It is competently written and holds the attention, but it is not likely to bring one hurrying back for a second read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are These Seconds?","review":"I've placed 2 separate orders for these bowls.

It starts brilliantly, and deteriorates only slightly as it descends to the various romances of the family's children. The setting and the characters are charming, a littlelighter that Rosamund Pilcher's books, but very much in that vein, with servants and family retainers taken for granted. I can't wait to readother books by D.E. Stevenson, and would love a list of her work with a suggested order for reading them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Retelling of Austen's Mansfield Park","review":"I read this many times over the years, and greatly enjoyed the Dunnes, but since I watched all the BBC Jane Austen novels recently, I realized this is a take on Mansfield Park - the charity girl in love with the boy of the house, who considers her a sister; the immoral brother and sister who deceive the family; the wedding of the oldest daughter disturbed by the play the young people want to put on, etc. But for all that, it is a good read, and stands on its own. The sequel is Listening Valley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle Romance","review":"My first D.E. Stevenson book, but I plan to find and read many more, and wish they were in print or available used more cheaply. The Scots borderland setting in the early years of the 20th century (concluding in the 40's) is the best part of the book; a privileged but not ostentatious family living on a beautiful estate. The romances of the younger generation were less fascinating, although still charming. I think anyone who enjoys Rosamund Pilcher would find this quite enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying and depressing.","review":"I had to read this book for school and I HATED IT. Redemption is \\"apparently\\" won at the end of the novel; but I am too shallow and materialistic to see it as that. Why does life have to be so miserable?

This film is not just about Muslim punk rockers going around the country in a beat up bus, or getting in trouble at the ISNA conference; but to me, it was about identity. Identity: both in the form of religious identity and the struggle it can create within a person, but also the identity that is associated with generation.Although I am not Muslim, I continually saw issues that I could connect to with my own religious journey and my life. I understood the struggles, trying to find a balance in what seems to be two completely different worlds.This is a great film to watch if you are interested in punk rock, Islam, diversity, or identity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Punk At All","review":"This was such a waste of time and money. A bunch of directionless young fools, trying to act intellectual. There's no identity, just a thorough lack of creativity and originality.

Definitely!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Realitybites","review":"Save your money and time and just skip this documentary on a bunch of rich young muslim men from rich families who drive around in a nice bus that their parents purchase for them.

The 3 figures could have been made a little bigger though. Track layout ideas are given on the back of the box. Since we had only the starter set to expand, there were no ideas given. We designed our own, just as I hope others will do with the bigger sets. Additional track can be found at other online merchants or Ebay. Remember that this locomotive takes a C battery and not AA like Thomas. Well worth the money for making your set bigger and more playful with the accessories. I do recommend starting with the medium set or larger and skip the starter set. It's too basic.

One day this wallpaper decides it's not good enough for the house anymore and gets in touch with an interior decorator, played by Marlon Brando in a convincing turn as Jabba the Hut sans special effects, who eventually sets this strip of wallpaper on fire in a fit of sadistic glee. But you literally have to watch the wallpaper glue dry for an hour or so before you go from the old batch to the new batch. You never even actually see the new wallpaper gracing the walls; perhaps our evil home decorator skips town without ever installing it. But isn't that just like life? And I'm sure that's what Depp was trying to tell us with this coma-inducing treat. So buckle up and move on to the next review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"Black Swan, White Raven is an excellent anthology of new fairy tales based on the traditional stories.

I live overseas where the familiar tastes of home become that much more valuable. Gravy is simply unheard of where I am stationed. I was heartbroken that I has only purchased one package when the light bulb went off that maybe this is available on Amazon.

Not only does it include many of the songs that I grew up with and recall fondly to this day, but they are arranged in what I'd consider an almost perfect balance to both the lyrics and to Anne's presentation, complementing but not overpowering her singing.

I'll admit it.","review":"I haven't seen this DVD itself, but have all eight of the \\"Session\\" Discs. I honestly don't see how something like this can be a good thing. Cowboy Bebop is a single, coherent story. Each episode, no matter how random it may seem, contains a reference, scene, or something so small as a gesture that builds the series as a whole. Each episode relies heavily upon the viewer having seen the previous ones. When the series is broken down into \\"Best Of\\" segments, it loses that quality, in effect becoming snippets of a greater whole. Yes, these snippets may be good, but they cannot possibly convey the flow of the story in the manner of the full series. I would suggest saving your money and purchasing \\"Cowboy Bebop: The Complete Sessions.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"And the point of this would be?","review":"This selection is at my local video store, for people who want to sample some of the most popular Cowboy Bebop episodes. But when it comes to buying this, I can't imagine why someone would go to purchase only a fraction of the series when the entire thing is available (more than twice as many episodes) for around ten more dollars. (see: The Perfect Sessions Complete Series, but be careful buying a used copy because sellers have sent incomplete versions).The product itself is fine and the episodes are great, but it jumps around the series based on ratings and fails to show more than the highlights. It might very well be the best of the season, but it's only so good without the rest of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT-repeat-NOT the \\"Best Sessions\\"","review":"I rented this some time ago with the belief that it contained the \\"Best Sessions\\" of the series, which it's title implies. Upon watching it I found out that it actually only contains one, or maybe two, of the best episodes from the Cowboy Bebop series. One being the first episode: Asteroid Blues. The rest were on the lower or middle end of the spectrum. This doesn't even have Pierrot le Fou on it. Which is THE. BEST. episode in the Cowboy Bebop series. My advice to you: Don't even rent this. watch Cowboy Bebop on cartoon network. It's practically free (cable bill) and actually worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the pictures!","review":"Keep in mind that although the pictures show the front row, you only get back row floor mats .. like the title says.

Red dot is strong even during the brightest of days.I Have no problems hitting my target at 50 yards. I made no adjustments, use it setright where it was when it arrived. Since this is a .22LR pistol there is no kick orrecoil, so I didn't have to use loctite or anything. I just check to make sure it'sgood and tight before I use it. The balance on Ruger MKIII is perfect with this scopemounted on it.

This scope worked great for that. The mounting screws and plates are a little difficult to get tight to the rail, but with a little muscle, the scope mounts straight and secure. The dot itself is very easy to see from intensity #1 for low light situations to intensity #11 for very bright conditions, which is what really sets this one apart, since most red dot scopes go to 10, and this one goes to 11."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I got it for my son.

I don't doubt them, however I don't have much money to drop and I figured I'd give this Tasco a go. So far, I'm very pleased. The dot is bright enough for me to see in bright daylight, even shooting out in the winter with lots of white all around. The scope feels well built too, and looks good, at least to a novice like myself.Only thing I wish was included in this was mounted dust covers that would flip up like more expensive optics, I know I'll end up losing the two that came with this as they just sit free in a bag or on a table while I'm using the scope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't stay zero'd","review":"This product states it is for guns up to 357 Magnum. I have this mounted to a Ruger GP100 and the dot drifts from shot to shot, primarily down and right (causing POI to go up and left). This happens even with mild 38 loads. As a test I used a bore laser sight and set it, then bumped the scope with my hand like it might during firing. The scope is solid on the mount, but sure enough the dot moves from zero. Maybe I got a bad one, but fortunately its only $30 wasted. Its too bad, it seems like a decent scope if it worked. Maybe on an airgun or 22 it would be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"The parallax correction on this sight is pretty awful.

It installed easily and was fairly simple, albeit tedious, to calibrate. It feels very solid to use, and durable. The calibration is done using little screwheads underneath plastic caps; you'll need a penny or something to adjust them, not just your fingers.My only wishes: it would be nice if the lens covers could pop up instead of just being removed--I'm sure one day I'll completely lose the caps--and the dot is slightly large at longer distances, which can be partially remedied by adjusting the brightness. At the full brightness of 11, it's easily visible in bright light. At 1, you need almost a completely dark room to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasco Red Dot Works","review":"I have the Tasco Red Dot mounted on my GSG-5 .22 cal rifle. Within 50 yards once I have it sighted in it is a consistently accurate sight. It holds its aimpoint, is easy to view in all light conditions including high-altitude Colorado. Beyond 50 yards accuracy degrades because the dot overwhelms the aimpoint. For the money this sight is worth every penny and has enhanced my afternoons of plinking at the range. Pick one up - you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"Not to say others might be better, but my sight was defective from the box it seemed.

Nothing as cheesy like this new one.I received my new one it wrapped in cardboard without any packing. I went to mount it on my AK and the hardware was tweaked. The mounting system for it is pretty flimsy and stripped out easily. I couldn't get it tight enough on the rail without the retainer nuts giving out. You get what you pay for and with this, it will be crap. I tried the UTG Red/green dot, but it couldn't take the recoil of the rifle and give it up after only 50 rounds. The dot was intermittent after that....back to searching for something better.

That pan is in the sink and this one is now on the stove and NOTHING STICKS TO IT. This is the second one I've owned (had to leave my first one behind when I moved.)

Like most non-stick pans, the surface on this one is really great right when its new. However, what I did not expect was how easily the pan would lose its shape. I always wait until my pans have cooled to room temperature before washing them to avoid warping them. I was surprised that after just 2 weeks of use, this pan is no longer flat and circular. I expected the pan to be more durable than it has proven to be. The pan is still usable, but I have purchased others for the same price that have held up better.

To clear up this discrepancy, I checked with Cook's Illustrated and also with T-Fal. It turns out that after re-testing, T-Fal has changed the ovensafe rating to 450F but has failed to do so on their Website and on their packaging, although they have planned to do it.Cook's tested the higher temperature by making frittatas and finishing them under the broiler. They did wrap the handles in heavy-duty foil to protect them from the direct heat and the pans did well.Consequently, I've upped my rating from 3 to 4 stars.I need a skillet with a lid; according to other reviewers, standard lids do not fit this pan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Ceramic Cooktops - Warps","review":"I tried this pan based on the reviews.While the non-stick coating seems very good, the pan itself is not. If you use a ceramic cooktop, you already know that many thin pans will warp or dome up/down when heated thereby reducing the surface are in contact with the cooktop. The T-Fal pan is too thin even with the plate on the bottom, and warps upward when heated.This effect causes the pan to be less than useful because the outer edges are the only part touching the stove. Thankfully, unlike other pans I've tried, the dome forms up and not down, so the pan doesn't rock on the stove.My old Farberware Millenium pan has a much thicker plate on the bottom which does not warp under heat.

There was none left in the middle in which to fry anything. The pan was obviously defective with the \\"hump\\" others have described. I am such an optomist, I was sure the pan I would receive would be just perfect. Wrong!!! This is such a disappointment.

I wish we had a cover big enough to fit it. If I could do it again I might get a slightly smaller one. This one is bigger than the size of a large dinner plate, which can make it hard to turn certain dishes out for serving."},{"rating":"1","title":"hotspots","review":"I had bought some nonstick frying pans based on recommendations from Cook's Illustrated or America's Kitchen, and they were good but not long lasting. so I had high hopes for this pan. IT'S TERRIBLE. Very obvious hot center, at least on an electric stove. Terrible. Fine for a saute, really terrible for something like quesadillas or pancakes.FOLLOW-UP - I've had this a few months now, and it has WARPED so that the inside isn't flat. When you add some oil (because you will need to sooner than later), it runs to the outer edges. But the heat is strongest in the center, where there is no oil, and everything will burn and stick. I HATE THIS PAN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best nonstick I've ever used...","review":"Maybe it's because I'm taking better care of this nonstick pan than I have it's predecessors, but I'm impressed with its nonstick properties and its durability. I've used it two to three times a day for the last month and see no dulling of the finish or decrease in the amazing way in which food, including scrambled egg substitute, slides out so easily. Avoiding the dishwasher is not a big chore because it really needs no more than a quick wipe to clean. I cook on a gas stove so flatness is not a super-critical issue for me, but I can say that I have not noticed any dome or warp that causes any liquid to disperse unevenly. When this one finally does give out, I intend to replace it with the same item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this pan.","review":"I bought this pan because it was recommended by America's Test Kitchen / Cook's Illustrated.The center of the pan rises up.

It was heavy duty, and as advertised, \\"non-stick\\". Now, after a few months of light use, the pan has warped, and the middle of the pan is no longer flat, but has risen about 1/8th of an inch. Food no longer cooks evenly, and any liquid/oil pools to the edge of the pan, leaving the center dry. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non Stick Cooking","review":"So far, so good. It is a handsome and pretty lightweight pan. it does not come with a lid, but other lids for 10\\" pans fit fine. I am a little put off by a slight odor when it is heated, but nothing terrible, but it does make me wonder what is coated with. It takes NO oil of any kind to cook eggs. Pretty amazing. I am not sure about it for browning anything. The cooking surface of the pan is quite small--7.5 inches. I would have liked to know that before buying it. The steeply sloping sides account for the difference. I had first ordered a 12\\" but was afraid that it would be too big! I am used to using a 10-inch surface, so the latter would have been fine..Next time I would buy the 12\\" pan to get a bigger surface.This is not to say I am not happy with it.

One morning my husband made scrambled eggs and we forgot to clean the skillet until the next morning. I put it under water and it just wiped clean. Awesome--no sticking at all even overnight! I haven't used it in the oven yet so I can't comment on it's performance there.

I loved the skillet but it was very pricey and I was looking for a more budget-friendly alternative. Saw the review from America's test kitchen and figured I couldn't go wrong for the price.I love this skillet! It is weighty but not cumbersome, cooks evenly, nothing sticks to it, and it's dishwasher safe and oven safe to (according to the package insert) 450 degrees. Plus, for the price, I could afford to replace this every few months - but I anticipate it will last much longer than that from the reviews I read.My one wish is that it had a fitted lid, however, I just saved the lid from my 12\\" Calphalon and it fits pretty well.I enthusiastically recommend this product to those looking for a good nonstick skillet. I might even have to get another one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"two week review","review":"Been using this daily for omletts for 2 weeks, and the eggs slide out consistantly.

Have been using it a few times for a couple of weeks. It is well constructed, well balanced, not too heavy, not too light. Since it is new, I would expect the nonstick ability to be flawless, and it is. Won't be able to comment on the durability yet, of course. So far I'm very happy with this skillet price and quality-wise. The only \\"iffy\\" thing is that on the packaging, 2 different places say that the silicone handle is oven-safe to 450 degrees but 1 other place says that it is only oven-safe to 350 degrees. I went to T-Fal website and somewhere in the FAQ, silicone handle is listed as safe up to 350. But I sent an email asking them to clarify anyway and that was 2 weeks ago; no response yet. So, product is excellent, customer service, eh... not so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALREADY GREAT PAN AND NOW WITH IMPROVED HANDLE","review":"Having used the T-fal Pro 8 inch and the 12 inch pans for the past month. I have found nothing that sticks in this pan. The 12 inch pan is perfect for frying up a pound of sausage. Some of the past reviewers said the handle was the one weak part of these pans.The handle was made from plastic, but now the improved handle made from silcon. The handle has a great non slip feel.The Pan itself is a non-stick wonder. When you first get this pan it is to be seasoned,just use a little veg oil wipe the inside and again after every 10th wash.They say you can use metal utensils, but I cannot bring myself to use them.

They are certainly worth the twenty dollars Amazon was offering, however they were in my cart when Amazon went out of stock and were replaced by a reseller offering them for three times the price (more than MSRP!!). If it was not so much hassle, I would have returned them. They cannot compare to Calphalons.

It should be fine.Professors state that if the non-stick surface is broken that the pan is no good and should be thrown away.Something in the pan itself caused rain water to mold up in bumps that didn't wash away.It had never been used.This is sure a waste of my money for something I need to throw away - never used.DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SAFIRE AT HER BEST!","review":"Beautiful voice, slammin salsa beats - Safire's debut salsa album really did impress me.

A group of experienced business guru's, dedicated to improve the world by changing the way business work. Unlike self-help management books, this book is deep. It has a new theory to report (the U-process), but the focus is the journey the authors are going through, rather than their elevator pitch.The book merges east and west, and offers a unique message: businesses are the new organism in our world, and they hold the decentralized power to change the world. But businesses are a complex, living system, and should be managed as one. Not as a giant clockwork mechanism.The authors interviewed many successful people from different organizations (Shell, Gap, Visa to name a few), and came with the U-process theory, based on the common themes from those interviews.A must-read for open-minded people who care about the state of the world, but look for long term, practical principles rather than quick fixes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part of the \\"how\\"","review":"I really like \\"Presence\\" because it is part of the \\"how\\" of doing leadership differently.

Animals are the main characters, but the flaws are all human in nature. Many provokingly dark snapshots from a sensitive & well meant, but highly comical perspective.

Also, it is very average quality-wise (video, direction) but I give it a midrange rating as it shows nowhere else available (in my knowledge) footage of \\"Chessie\\" (the Chesapeake Bay Monster.

I bought the book because I plan to launch into a reading of the Koran and was hoping to find a detailed guide.The authors' love of Islam and the Koran pervade the book and it is the most endearing part. Unfortunately they deal too much in generalities. And they don't provide some basics. For example the Koran's suras (chapters) are printed in order by descending length. The authors didn't think to provide a more useful order to read the Koran. This is something routinely provided for people studying the Bible.As others have mentioned, the book spends too much time defending Islam. The authors lapse into lengthy defenses of the Koran's sections that permit wife-beating and amputating the hands of thieves."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmmm","review":"It's not an overview and introduction to the Qur'an.

It's like reading a document from a lawyer that is presenting a defense for the Koran. A good example is the chapter on Women and the Family where the author maintains that the Koran is an egalitarian spirtual document, especially as it referes to women. Nothing could be further from the truth.My suggestion to anyone wanting to learn more about the Koran is to get a good translation of the work and read it for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Southern bashing book","review":"I am getting tired of these liberal authors writing books about southern characters. I knew from page one I wouldn't like this book. It's like a bad southern joke that never ends. The way the girl speaks is completely unreal. She talks like a backwoods hick from the 1930s. It's not common for 16 yr olds today in any part of the country to get married and leave high school. I'm sure it happens, but it's not something that's common in the south. The girl acts like a mental retarded 8 yr old. I am extremely angry that this author portrays a southern girl in this way as if it's typical.

You'll find yourself chanting in no time."},{"rating":"2","title":"We The People - Needs Wider Distribution","review":"I first heard it in a corporate motivation session. The music was energizing and uplifting. I went right to a local seller of native American music and bought it.Why does this music not play on a variety of FM stations? Some would do nicely on easy listening, some on mix, and some on modern pop music stations. If you are a program director or a risk-taking DJ, play this music on the air, then get ready for the calls. The difference, the freshness, the newness will attract, and the feeling of goodness will hold. The listener WON'T reach for her/his next preset button while it is playing. True, it doesn't have the African heartbeat drum, but neither does Sheryl Crow.If it is time for the Native American to be heard on the pop stations, then this should be the leader. Program directors, with very little research, will find a wealth of other artists to follow Brule's lead, but this CD should lead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fusion That Should Have Never Been Tried","review":"The liner notes are great--the story of Paul Laroche is compelling. This, in addition to the reviews I had read only heightened my anticipation. Imagine my surprise when, after a few seconds, the sound turned pure pop!I'm sure Mr. Laroche is a fine musician, but how can you tell when everything is backed (obscured) by a mindless electronic rhythm section? If I wanted to hear this kind of stuff, I could turn on any modern pop station. One cut is downright techno. Quite frankly, I can't see how Native American chant was expected to blend with the rest of this nonsense. Not that I'm against mixing musical styles, its just that this particular fusion is far less successful musically (trendy rather than quality)than many others available today.The only reason it gets two stars is that some cuts kin of work and this disc is actually better than Brule's others."},{"rating":"2","title":"It just kinda gets \\"into\\" you...","review":"My favorite track is Buffalo Moon--the first time I heard it on Sky.fm, my head popped over the top of the book I was reading like a gopher.

The noises are a poor substitute for suspense, as all modern movies do. It's like bracing yourself for the next unexpected smashing of frying pans behind your ears.

It seemed like it was incredibly long, and in the end it tries to shock you with a surprise but you really don't even care enough to notice. The characters were weak (unlike the original) and the plot was too reliant on traditional \\"suspense\\" moments of the horror genre. This movie could have been a lot better I think, especially when it's focused on the (fictional) spot where Lucifer fell from Heaven. The few moments of demonic possession did hold true to the original, which I give the director some credit for, though not much. Skip this one unless you really love the Exorcist franchise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor excuse","review":"I loved the original movie, however, this one is a far cry from the religous and psychological terror that you were given in the orignal movie. In this one you will get tons of Hollywood effects and a horrible plotline that pretty much states that it is to cash in on the original's success. Although, this movie does have its moments it never truely gets out of the gutter on the horror genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY DID THEY BOTHER?","review":"This movie was amazingly bad.

The original is still the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Exorcist 3000","review":"My hopes were not very high when I rented this movie; it actually turned out to be much worst then I had expected. The special effects were way over the top and it was just a down right boring film. A disgustingly offensive waste of time. Avoid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Unsettling Film of the Year!","review":"I really, honestly have no idea why this movie was bashed. From the very beginning I was curled up in my theater seat, knees to my head. I was petrified. Just when i thought it was safe to put my feet down, I put them back up in horror. Also, the film was downright disturbing. The scene with the butterflies on the wall and the supposed \\"exorcism\\" scene with the bent back fingers had me cringing and my cousin, who was sitting right next to me, screaming her head off. She's scared very easily, but my other cousin and I were both petrified and we find it extremely hard to be scared. Why the critics and audiences bashed this, I'll never know. I personally thought it was a lot more straight-forward scary than the original 'Exorcist' film. Definititely not as disturbing, but it delivers a lot more thrills that are needed now-a-days to scare the desensitized modern audience. It certainly worked, and I don't think critics realize that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Exorcist IV: We Will Scare You To Death If You Watch Another Sequel","review":"Chad had earlier given another great synopsis of this last entry into the world of Pazuzu. You might want to read any of his reviews just to get a good understanding of what went on in the movies he's reviewed.I do not disagree with him on this one as far as the quality of the film. This film is a mess. I always wanted to know what the previous meeting between Father Merrin and Pazuzu was like based off of the hints given us in the original Exorcist film, but this shallow film did little for me. I think Kat's review is on the money with this flick. If it wasn't for the good performance Stellan Skarsgard, playing Father Merrin, I would give this film a zero. I wonder what the author of the original story thinks (or would think if he's dead) how this prequel was handled. Only in his mind would we really know how Father Merrin really battled Pazuzu."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exorcist: The Beginning (...And Hopefully The End).","review":"Enough already! THE EXORCIST is one of the greatest horror flicks ever made and all of these sequels, prequels... they will always come up short in comparison.I don't know what to make of EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING. I didn't hate it but I didn't particularly like it either.Is it a mystery-thriller? Is it a \\"sand & desert\\" action-adventure flick, with British troops pitted against African natives? Or perhaps it's an old fashioned story of love from a distance? I don't know. But it's certainly not a horror flick.On the plus side, Stellan Skarsgard gives a great performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably BORING movie!!!","review":"Let's get one this straight...the original \\"Exorcist\\" is one of the best horror films of all time.

I can't remember the last time I was so bored at the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXCORCIST-the beginning: Hopefully the end!","review":"I liked some parts of the movie-but the ending was sooo stupid and corny. In fact it ruined the entire movie. I had the feeling that the last parts of the movie was written within a half hour without much thought. It totally ruined the entire movie. The excorcism was totally corn right off the cob. I thought how utterly rediculous.It had some gore here and there-a dead baby born with maggots all over it, and there was a kid that got ripped apart by these wild canines.My gawd it was a bad movie because of the ending. If I would have paid money to watch this in the movie theatre, I would have been extremely angry to have wasted my money and time. I rented the DVD and was entirely disappointed. I felt I lost a few dollars and wasted my time watching this lame movie. If you plan to buy it - well, you were warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe These Sequels Are Cursed....","review":"Everything about this movie screams: HACK JOB. Elements and details from THE EXORCIST are scattered throughout this mess, leaving any fan of the original with something to do in the second half (the St. Christopher's medal is introduced but nothing becomes of it). The sudden re-conversion of Father Merrin in time for the climactic \\"battle\\" is obligatory and unconvincing.Isabella Scorupco, a Bond girl from 1995's GOLDENEYE, looks great in the female lead. That's really about the only good thing I can say about it.This movie appears to be made by someone who's entire concept of good and evil runs about as deep as a WW Smackdown.The only curiosity that remains is what Paul Shrader's version plays like.And if there ever will be a decent EXORCIST sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waist your time or money!!!","review":"The This might possibly be, the worst sequel (or prequel) ever made. Well actually that title could also go to AVP and Jason X.This movie does nothing to follow the story implied in the original movie or novel. The fact that William Peter Blatty had no involvement in the script or the movie at all should have been a warning to viewers everywhere. The original exorcism was suppose to center around an African boy that was possessed. But no, we have the horrible actress that we all remember from Reign of Fire playing a woman possessed. Linda Blair did a much better job as a child.Trust me folks and stay away. This movie is made from the same crap that has dominated the field of good cinema for the last thirteen years. Lock your doors, and bold your windows. If you see this movie, bring a gun so you can shoot yourself before it gets too bad. This is Renny Harlin's worst film ever. This movie is bull s*#t spare yourself the horror of viewing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"This is the place where the Church thinks Satan fall\\"...","review":"....I can't believe tt a character in the movie said that.This is so lame it hurts.This movie confirms tt Hollywood has ran out of ideas.The acting is poor, the story is terrible, and the demon at the end of the movie....come on...(he only appears for 15 minutes).Movies like these should be forbbiden.Even a review of this crap is a waste of time.Don't see it. Trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give it 0 stars...","review":"Exorcist: The Beginning is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't see how anyone could possibly enjoy this movie. The original Exorcist is a very terrible film too. I was so dissapointed when I saw it for the first time. I was expecting a 4 star horror film, but all I got was a new, quick way to fall asleep. I haven't seen II or III, but I definetly don't recommend The Exorcist or Exorcist: the Beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can I rate a movie I haven't seen?","review":"From what I've read this is a prequel to the original movie. The storyline deals with Max Von Sydow's character and his first encounter with the demon that possessed Linda Blair in the orginal film; the story takes place in the Middle East in the 1940's. Having been a huge fan of the first Exorcist, and having been completely disappointed by the sequels, I'm curious but cautious of what will come of this prequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The power of the original compels you!","review":"Gotta see it! Although, after seeing the remakes of dawn of the dead and texas chainsaw massacre (obvious landmark classics) and wondering what the writers and directors were smoking, im not going into this prequel expecting too much. But of course (and hollywood knows this) every SERIOUS horror fan is absolutely obligated to see the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The devil never made me laugh so much","review":"I went into this movie knowing it wasn't going to be that good and i left feeling the same way. It wasn't scary, except one or two moments when your caugh off guard. To me this was more like a mystery than a horror flick. The sound effects were silly and at times the dialogue was absurd. The female doctor was very attractive so that was at least one bonus, ofcourse she didn't look so hot when she was possessed by the devil. Maybe if i was really drunk i might consider, nah, probably not. Anyways if you wanna kill two hours be my guest but don't go into the movie house with great expectations because you will be pissed off for wasting your money. Oh, the animals that attack people were not realistic at all. You could clearly see they were computer produced, even their physical movements were unnatural."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, Boring and Stupid","review":"I'm thankful I only wasted $4.00 to rent this movie rather than more money to see it at the theatre or buy it. The pace was SO SLOW - I thought the movie would never end. Very dull. Characters not well developed - I didn't find myself caring what happened to any of them. Granted, I may have missed a little something as I fast-forwarded through the last 45 minutes (didn't want to completely waste my money - I at least wanted to be able to feel like I tried), but from what I saw, it was highly disappointing and just a poorly revamped version of many other better movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow, with a handful of good spots","review":"There was a few very cool horror scenes in this, like the crosses, the guy strung up for the birds, and the ending. Other than that, It is very slow, and no sequel or prequel will ever touch the original's luster. This is a dead series that really could use some new writers. It's a shame because some really good sequels could have been made to this very awesome movie/concept. The original was based on actual events that happened to a boy in the early 1900's. Why don't they just do another movie based on a real story?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get thee behind me, awful movie.","review":"The original Exorcist scared the crap out of me, but this movie just bored me. Skarsgard is a pleasure to watch, as always, and the movie is competently filmed, but it is just terrible overall. The dialogue was ridiculous, the plot was stupid, the special effects were lame, and the horror was completely non-existent. I'm not going to devote one more thought to this very poor effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exorstink","review":"I wouldn't say I had high hopes for this but I at least expected it to be decent. It wasn't. I was falling asleep for the last 20 minutes and absolutely couldn't wait for it to end it was so dull. I like watching scary/horror movies in the dark in my basement near Halloween and that's twice now that Exorcist sequels completely disappointed me. Very heavy handed, it was almost like watching one of those horrible \\"Friday The Thirteenth\\" movies where the music is used to make you think something is going to happen which of course you know it's not. This was pathetic. I'd never sit through it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Satan, get thee down. . .","review":". . . and take this stinking movie with you. I should have known better, but I'd heard that this was the first movie filmed in high definition, so I wanted to see how it looked. WELL, IT LOOKED LIKE CRAP! AND IT SOUNDED LIKE CRAP! BECAUSE IT IS CRAP! The DVD doesn't even have any menu extras - that's how bad this movie is. Not that a spoof reel would have saved the film, but at least it would have been appropriate. This is without a doubt the worst presmell of all time. If you value your soul, as well as your wallet, then stay away. Far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous Violence and Overkill....Pun intentended!","review":"First off, you would think that after 30 years, they would try different makeup technique.This movie was a major dissapointment. There was so much effort made in making people jump out of their seats every 5 seconds, that the story, which could potentially have been good, was lost.At best the story was underdeveloped and there were too many unanswered questions.The violence and typical scary movie character stupidity was almost insulting. I found that I was only one of an audience full of people who were growning in disgust at the utter ridiculousness of some of the scenes.Giving this movie one star is being generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bunch of crap","review":"Saturday I lost an hour and a half of my life I wish I could take back.

This movie is really good. The story is basically the same as the others, but the budgets are bigger, as are the grandness of CGI. A nice touch was the 'possessed one' crawling all over a cave just like Schmegal LOL I don't startle easily, and I did a couple times during this flick.In the words of Lavar Burton:I really enjoyed it and I highly recommend it on a rainy day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a good movie","review":"I think that just like all sequels, this one will inevitably be compared with the original Exorcist. Frankly, I think it's actually a pretty good movie. Skaarsgard does make a pretty convincing younger version of Father Merrin, some 25 years before the events in the first Exorcist, and like Father Karras, has his own crisis of faith from his WWII days as a priest in Nazi Europe. As mentioned by others, some of the CGI effects could be better (the hyeanas, the sandstorm), but overall I did enjoy this movie and would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT MOVIE- IT ISN'T","review":"When I first heard about this film I thought great. I'm a huge fan of the original Exorcist. Think about the possibilities here. With the amazing original story by William Peter Blatty, a prequel could have been written to make the original proud.Instead what we have is a horrible story about a priest who left his faith. He goes to Africa as an archeologist that has been paid to find the statue of satan. Gee, think he finds his faith again? The movie looks and sounds good. That's where it ends. I couldn't wait for it to be over. There aren't even chapter stops, coming attractions, or even an original trailer on this DVD. It was obviously rushed out to make back what ever they can. Warner Brothers took a big bath on this one. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demon woman vs FatherJones","review":"After getting excited about this film I was completely disappointed. While there are the standard scares here and there, in the end its just plain ridiculous. I was laughing through the entire last scene between the possessed and the priest. Maybe if they had a couple of lightsabers it would have added to the excitement. This is nothing more then trying to make a fast buck on the word \\"Exorcist.\\" Yes the first was good but I wouldn't say the greatest. It hit at a time when the world was much more gullable. One has to wonder if the \\"The Exorcist\\" was to be released today if it would become the legend it is. Fear not; rumor has it a re-make may be in the works. Uhg!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good vs. Evil .. A good story .. for the soul & mind","review":"From all I read this was to be a real bad movie, well no, it's not a bad movie.

Yes a begining to what is to been \\"The Exorcist\\" the horror movie classic of all horror movies well done. But it not \\"The Exorcist\\" but, yet it's still a start to the horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly another Hollywood formula flick","review":"As a fan of the series, I must say I'm very disappointed in this movie. It's overblown, overproduced and like Catwoman, I found the special effects fell short. The computer animated hyenas were very fake looking and thus spoiled much of the movie for me. The hero in this movie is the same old Hollywood tough guy you see in every movie... I found myself rolling my eyes.Upside down crosses and crucifixions were a nice touch and a welcome addition to the Exorcist franchise's satanic repertoire. However, the inverted cross thing becomes very repetitive and gimmicky shortly into the movie. The first two thirds of the movie is boring and more concerned with cinematography than good storytelling.I think this is Hollywood'd response to The Passion. They realize that there's a big market for movies that deal with religious subject matter. Like most Hollywood movies, it's OK for some mindless entertainment or for making out with a date... but it's a real stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"READY FOR A GOOD SCARE DONT GO SEE THIS","review":"ALL I CAN SAY IS I GUESS THE CHURCH NEEDS A SUPER HERO TO TAKE OUT EVIL DOERS TOO.

I had expected a cross bewteen Chuckie and Carrie. So as the plot became more involved in suspense instead of gore, I was pulled into the movie.While all of the characters were convincing and well acted, Piper Watts stole the movie for me. She is a natural. Her reactions to the scene and dialogue seemed to be real and believable. A talent that comes naturally. I really dont think you can learn it, I think you just have to sense it and let it come naturally. Nonverbal cues says a lot.

This DeWalt is twice as fast as my 3/8th inch drill, twice as powerful as the hammer drill that I wore out, and the variable speed trigger works well, too. That means I no longer have to carry 2 drills in order to always have the right tool for the job.My shopping expeditions generally found imported junk that felt like it would break in about a week, or big, heavy, 22 inch long, \\"professional\\" drills, with 2 speed transmissions, for way more than I wanted to spend. I have seen a battery operated hammer drill do the kind of work I do, so knew I didn't need the expensive drills, but I don't like the price of batteries which fail in a year or two.

I need to drill 4 more holes. I hope it makes it. It seems to be a design flaw. I'm not thrilled with the chuck, either. I have to tighten the blazes out of it, or the hammer action loosens the chuck's grip on the bit. Not impressed. It's great when it works.

I was given the recommendation to read this book from someone I see weekly and this book couldn't of came at a better time. The Purpose Driven Life, is a book every one should read, it offers scripture to go along with each day, so one can look in there Bible for further help. During the Christian walk one is going to have many challenges, questions, and I believe that this book is one that can help answer a lot of the questions along with the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I've EVER read","review":"I've read all of Dr. Warren's other books (Answers To Life's Difficult Questions, The Power To Change Your Life, Personal Bible Study Methods, The Purpose Driven Church, etc) but he outdid himself with this one. WOW! So much wisdom, biblical insight, and meat on every page. I will be re-reading this book at least once a year, and I'm going to give it to all my friends for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for anyone","review":"My husband and I read this book together, and I have to tell you, it changed our marriage. It teaches trying to find your purpose in life by recognizing and using the gifts God gave you. We all have a purpose, talents, and gifts that we have been given, and if you go outside of your talents and purpose life can be a struggle. You could possibly be left doing something that is difficult or unfullfilling.I would like to note that The Purpose Driven Life was not written on a third and or fourth grade level. I have a BA in English, and I will tell you that if I read this to my nine year old daughter she would not be able to grasp it. I would recomend this book to anyone that was searching for a bleif system or that was trying to find their way in life. It helped me tremendously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! Not of the Holy Spirit.","review":"By the time I was half way through chapter one of this book I felt funny about it. By the time I was finished (I did not do the 40 day thing.), I was certain that this book was not inspired by, directed by, or done in conjunction with the Holy Spirit. I would not recomment this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real stinker","review":"I can't believe that again and again Christians can get so easily swept up in hype and trendiness. Every church around me just held their nose and swollowed this stuff.Purpose is so much simplier and does not require book after book being written about it.Did we all forget about the Bible? Last time I checked it was not that hard to understand and it is even written in English!My point is that this is written by a man, and people are just gobbling it up like a Big Mac and french fries.People, you are the victims of a huge media blitz, not true grassroots spread. Kinda like someone following you around asking you to eat a big candy bar, after a while it sounds good and you really do not have any choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"No substitute for good mental health","review":"If you are suffering from a personal crisis which has affected you emotionally or 'spiritually' seek the help of a qualified mental health professional and skip everything else. Don't prolong your suffering. A friend has been reading this book, watching the author's T.V. programs and wrangling with 'the meaning of life' following a series of personal misfortunes. Unfortunately this has lead to my friend finding fault with the lives of all those nearest and dearest, while fueling my friend's delusions of grandeur and creating more confusion over his 'life's purpose.' My friend is no more happier nor wiser."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is the beef?","review":"Warren does offer much sound advice in The Purpose Driven Church and The Purpose Driven Life. Commendably, he attempts to support most points with \\"nearly a thousand quotations from Scripture\\" (Life, p. 325). But the \\"scriptures\\" he quotes are speculative paraphrases such as The Message (see TBC Q&A Oct. '95) by Eugene H. Peterson (NavPress). The Purpose Driven Life never presents the biblical gospel, which alone saves. Readers are told to \\"learn to love and trust God's Son, Jesusthis is a watered down Gospel and surely not the Gospel of our Lord and Savior. Tragically Rick Warren is a graduate of Schuller's Institute and it shows in liberalizing of the Gospel which has become \\"another Gospel\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book has been extremely helpful. It's easy to follow and the explanations and examples are good. The thought for the day really gets you to think about how to apply the principles he spells out on each day. I found what the author has to say makes sense and was very applicable for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"The Purpose Driven Life by Pastor Rick Warren is not only a spiritual journey filled with wonderful wisdom and biblical references, but it is also a blueprint for living. This book emphasizes the Book of James which calls us to action and teaches us that faith without works is futile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money and time.","review":"Readers should consider the author prior to reading this book. Rick Warren is the pastor of one of the largest churches in the United States. Pastor Warren has one focus in every sermon and every event at his church... how much money can you give us? He is far more concerned about having church members turn over their paychecks to the church (and I'm not kidding about that) to build a multi-million dollar church administration building than he is about living a purpose driven life. As a former member I can say that the tax avoiding (he doesn't pay taxes even though he is supposed to) Pastor Warren does not live the life he writes about in his book. He lives in an expensive house, drives very expensive cars and uses each sermon to beg for more money. Don't waste your time on anything he produces."},{"rating":"1","title":"...What Would Jesus Say?","review":"This book is a product of our overly secular, culturally accomodated, highly materialisitc consumer mega-church movement in America.Business professionals will like it and those who do not believe that Gospel actually confronts the American Dream will like it, but it does not get at the narrative that unfolds in the Gospels. As a result it misses the mark by a long-shot.Jesus did not make the gospel easy to hear. Perhaps we have neutered the gospel in our attempts to market it and sell it?This is gospel-lite at its best, which is really no gospel. You are better off reading the actually canonical gospels and start asking questions about what is going on in God's world and where is God's reign and rule breaking in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be afraid.... Be very afraid....","review":"I was given this book as a Christmas present, and though I do believe in faith and consider myself to be a spiritual person, I couldn't make it thru the first few chapters of this book. I found many parts of it offensive. Particularly passages suggesting that ambition and goals are selfish, unless they're focused 100% on God. I do believe in keepin' the faith and leading a rewarding life. I don't believe that wanting to do my best in my career and sharing good times with friends and wanting a comfortable life is sinful or a betrayal or attack on God. I was tempted to skip to the end to see if there was a recipe for the famous Jim Jones cynide kool-aid, or a detailed map to the Koresh compound in Waco."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree for everyone","review":"This is a really good book and helps just about everyone. I just finished another book that is kind of a twist for a spiritual book because it is about Money. The author is very spiritual etc. See the Intersection of Joy and Money."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Life is not about you\\" - just stop there......you've nailed it.","review":"I only made it to Chapter 2. If the author would have stopped with \\"Life is not about you\\" and expanded on this theme it would have been a great book. When the book began to rely on Noah's Ark and other bible stories as a guide to life, I had to put it down. Nothing against Noah, I think it is a nice story about having faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my poor God","review":"This is not inclusive. This is divisive. It's one more huge crack in religion as the Western World understands it. I agree with the last reviewer. When will we ever stop thinking about God as Big Daddy? I hope when I have kids they won't get this kind of thing stuffed down their poor little throats. What am I saying? Of course they won't. Not if I have anything to say about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rejoice! There is no purpose in life","review":"This entire book is maddness and I read it clinching my teeth all the way.I guess I have to admit that I'm not a xtian by a long shot and the idea of there being some innate purpose to the chaos of life goes against the grain of the entorpic forces within me.That said it does create a good argument for there being some purpose in life (an argument with which I don't agree).A better recommendation? Pick of Nietzsche and read it or maybe \\"Power Persuasion\\" by Kaus and Barron. As you sit back look at how we battle the natural forces of entropy by deluding ourselves at the vision of a \\"great design\\" take heart in that the only purpose in life is the one you create for it.You have a choise.This book will appeal to many people, Nietzschians, nihilists and Discordians not being amoung them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've heard it all before....yada, yada, yada...","review":"I've heard it all before. God loves you, you are here to serve God; the only way to serve God and have an eternity in heaven is through Jesus Christ; the Bible (in it's many versions and translations)is the word of God....yada, yada, yada....All this as a prelude to spend an eternity with God. No thank you. I find the thought of living blissfully happy and praisng God for E T E R N I T Y eternally and blissfully boring. Don't forget that quite a few of those blissfully happy angels and Watchers rebelled against this eternal bliss and abandoned the blissfully happy \\"Eternity\\" ship.This book will be helpful for those who \\"believe\\" and have \\"faith\\" in this Bible story and for those who are afraid of dealing with the wrath and smiting of this loving and forgiving God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use this","review":"I hope everyone looking to better them selves, and get closer to the Lord uses this book. It will help!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellently done","review":"A great way to hear or rehear the Purpose Driven LIfe on your iPod or in your car, if you don't have the time or inclination to read the book. The recording is very well done, with just the right touches of music. The author reads the book himself which helps a lot. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - A must for those who want to redirect their life","review":"Rick Warren in his book and tapes has done what God intended him to do. This is a well written book from someone who is spiritually enlightened. It is a must for those who would like to redirect their lives and live a happy fulfilling life as God intended to be. It uplifts, encourages and puts you on the right track. God bless Rick"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Book","review":"What an inspiring book! This book deals with important issues that we all have in the back of our minds in easy-to-understand ways. I highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preaching and Not Living in Truth","review":"This book is scary. It preaches, judges and steers people away from their own connection to God. What's more is that it contributes more to the fear people have if they don't follow.If you want a couple of books that will help you get more connected to God try Conversations with God by Neale Donald Walsh, and If God Was Like Man by Barbara Rose. There's a lot of spiritual information, and connection to God without the fear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purpose Driven Life","review":"\\"Purpose Driven Life\\" should be appealing to the many who may question why they are where they are there. Such as well meaning cultural Christians who practice \\"religion\\" out of habit, but have not yet established a one on one personal relationship with Jesus Christ and thus experience an emptiness in their lives.However I also recommend reading this book with a bible at your side. It is a simple and profound book. Easy to read, passionately written, gives insight into how a man like Rick Warren could build such a powerful faith organization.The Purpose Driven Life gives sound advice and spiritual guidance for anyone at any time in their lives. Whether you are a man or woman, old or young, married, single, or divorced, you can find comfort and teaching in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian Commercialism at its best","review":"Trying to horn in on the \\"self-help\\" books of the 80s & 90s, Warren has created the ideal polyester Christian book. He does not have a congregation of 15,000, he has a brain-washed mass that also believes that Dr. Phil \\"really, really likes\\" them and that Jerry Springer is the anti-Christ (but listen to him secretly). His idea of scholarship is simply copying from a dozen different Bible translations to spew forth his \\"new-and-improved\\" (extremely vague) ideology of \\"Follow me and be saved.\\" This is tent-revival preaching for the computer age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Bible","review":"Read the source, read the Bible. God holds us each responsible for what we do and believe. Don't trust someone else to explain it to you. Warren twists it to his own opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A, B, C ... 1,2,3 ... stuff ...","review":"This book falls squarely into the 'a,b,c or 1,2,3 steps to whatever' category that seems to have invaded evangelical christianity for decades. No wonder outsiders see evangelicals as stupid - the material is always narrowed down to three easy steps ... in this case five easy steps to a purpose driven life. You can't do that - life is too complex.Jesus never taught like that ... his teaching was always probing the heart, searching deep within us and allowing us to eventually see the mistakes and, allowing each human being the time it took to correct them.The reason this book has sold so well is that churches are 'doing this' en masse. They buy them by the hundreds, even thousands ... wow. To his credit, Rick Warren has donated theprofits to charity - the decent thing to do.The five points themselves ? ... not bad, but certainly no guide to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to attain a level of baby food!","review":"This book might be mistaken as a Christian book that would help you grow in Christ, but I doubt it. If you are interested in becoming mature in the faith, try reading: This Church is not Appearing Glorious & it doesn't seem to be Purpose Driven, by Meyers, or Holiness Truth and the Presence of God, by Frangipane, or Why Revival Tarries, by Ravenhill. These are landmarks. Save the Purpose driven series for you bird cage. God is serious, and He has higher expectations of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"What purpose?","review":"After reading this book, I had had a strong urge to find another religion. Something has got to be wrong with that. The contents of this book were the sort of thing that drove me away from organized religion. The main purpose is for persons like myself, by this author, to give away 10% of my income before taxes and abandon all thoughts for myself. This is not valid by scripture. Retirement planning? Who needs them when you will die anyway! Very irresponsible.If you need religious inspiration, I suggest Joel Osteen or Charles Stanley instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"purpose driven life","review":"I am sorry, I bought this book and it was never delivered to the recipient. can someone explain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"inspiring book","review":"this book is a wonderful read. i have enjoyed having it as my morning read. I hope you will find it as helpful as i have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone needs to read this!","review":"This book will give your life new meaning as you learn why you are here on this earth! God has a purpose for each one of us, and until we all recognize this on a daily basis, life will seem empty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saddleback: The Money Driven Church","review":"As a longtime member of Saddleback Church, I must speak out. Saddleback Church had the potential to do GREAT things to honor God's word. As a member, I also met many, many wonderful people who were not your \\"Sunday morning Christians.\\" While Rick Warren's message is usually enlightening, it seldom scratches the surface and is intended to transfer the \\"good-all-over\\" feeling to attendees - just like his book, \\"Purpose Driven Life.\\" Unfortunately, the buck stops there (in the most literal sense). Rick Warren's church is designed for one thing and one thing only - to make a buck. (Remember, I'm saying this as a member....well, former member who attended Saddleback for many, many years.)Read this poorly written book with caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is your purpose in life? Why are you here?","review":"This book helps to answer these questions. Fans of rah-rah feel good type books may not like this book. People who have forgotten about God, definitely will not like this book.I bumped into a gentlmen the other day who gave me a great scientific explanation how this universe came to be and it wasn't because of God. I also found out that this guy is behind on his bills, has been going from job to job and driving a 20 year old beaten up piece of junk that cost him more to repair that what it's worth.We were all put on this planet for a reason. Discovering that reason is what will take you from where you are now to where you want to be.The Purpose-Driven Life by Rick Warren is a great book and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modernistic, New-Agey claptrap","review":"Okay, in all honesty, there are a few good points made, but too many important facts are missing, and Pastor Warren seems to utilize some questionable methods. First, there is really NO real covering of the issue of \\"How to Get Saved\\"-without that first being established, the rest is useless self-righteousness, which are as filthy rags in the eyes of God. Also, in Chapter 11, it is suggested to use \\"breath prayers\\", short words or phrases, repeated over and over again, to \\"practice the presence of God\\". That's identical to the vain repitions used by various eastern cults when in meditation, and very similar to the positive affirmations used in pop-psycology and the New Age. Then, there is the issue of accepting worldliness and disposing of biblical, Christian separation from apostates, along with more, ad nauseum, all adds up to a pretty poor excuse for a Christian book. I recommend trying some good \\"Sword of the Lord\\" literature, instead. Or just, uh, the Bible?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Run don't walk","review":"Any \\"pastor\\" who would use the Message as a \\"bible\\" should be carefully examined in the first place. Warren's teachings are pure humanism. \\"Say aren't you great? I know I am.\\"Sin? Repentance? Why would I bring that up in a sermon? My marketing staff tells me that makes people go away and not come back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book Didn't Like All the Paraphrases","review":"It's a good book but I didn't like all of the paraphrases that it uses. I would have preferred for it to use more dynamic equivalence or literal Bible translations. The Message is a particularly poor \\"translation\\" in my opinion. Also, it would have been nice if the verse markers were in the text rather than at the back of the book. It would have been nice to know what verse was being quoted while it was being read.Now for the good side. I think I learned a lot from reading this book and do recommend it to just about anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Purpose Driven Life - Camouflage Edition","review":"This book is great for anyone who is trying to find faith - or maintain it - but doesn't know where to start. The author, Rick Warren, writes from his heart and reminds me of a modern-day C.S. Lewis. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Is Important In Life?","review":"I'm not a devout Christian, but I did enjoy how this book attempts to help you focus on what is important in life, even though it tries a little too hard to make it a formula that can be applied to any person in any family situation. But getting people to stop and think about what's important is so valuable in our overburdened lives. Also, as a mom of five children who also works part-time, I also feel that \\"I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets,\\" by Bruce Stockler, is the most inspiring book about the joys of parenthood I have read. Not a bestseller like this book, but very real, sweet, funny, passionate, worth a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's changed my life!","review":"Ricks book has been a real eye opener for me and my wife of 14 years, we found so much insite and wisdom in it that we're now reading it over for the second time to take notes and put some of the principals into action.Thank God for this Man!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Christians need to be Christ centered not church centered.","review":"I agree with the author that our purpose is in God and when we find Christ we find our purpose. However, in later chapters the author turns our attention to the importance of finding our place in and upholding 'the church'. This directs the attention to an institution and away from Jesus, some say it is the same thing but I beg to differ. (No doubt pastors love this book because it secures their positions more firmly but many pastors should not be elevated.) Teach Christians to follow Christ - not men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid book","review":"Seems a manipulative effort for a very surface study. NOT a thinking person's book. Can't imagine why it sold so well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"False teachings","review":"Stay clear of the false teachings of this book. If your church wants to have a Bible study with this book, its time to leave your church and find one with more wisdom and discernment. This book mixesthe Bible with New Age thinking and says nothing about REPENTANCE! How can you share the Gospel with out that simple little yet IMPORTANT word in the New Testament?"},{"rating":"2","title":"the purposeful driven life","review":"Back of book says not for resale and front has sticker goop on it, so I would say this was more like a like-new book then new. But book is still unmarked on the inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time with this; read the BIBLE instead","review":"I had really high hopes for this audio-book, but it simply doesn't live up to all the hype. Go over to the reviews for the paperback version and you'll see 200+ folks who agree with me and also give it just 1-star. While some of the information in this book is great, it's also fairly cliche and pretty much is common sense. The problem is that if you take it as \\"the answer,\\" you may be misled. I suggest that you have your Bible handy and double-check his scripture references, as I found some (if not all) of his translations seem to use very WIDE interpretations. So check his biblical references and decide for yourself. Better yet, just read the Bible instead, and interpret it for yourself. That's what I'll be going back and doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Great to Good","review":"This is an excellent book to stimulate thinking about God's purpose for our life.

But I will say that its' an active read...the sections are brief, but meaningful and the questions that one is asked to consider are definitely a playground for thought and reflection that have shown themselves quite useful to Christian and non-Christian alike. Even though every question has a connection to God within them, the questions have so far struck me as being just as much about a life reevaluation questions like what motivates and drives a person throughout their earthly lives. Within a few moments of reflection, I looked upon myself and realized how superficial my notions of success through wealth and property have been. If this book can provide someone like me with such moments of sobering clarity then it can probably help other people too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great message!","review":"As a Believer, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. One has to be foolish to think we have no purpose other than self-gratification. We were created to serve our Creator. It reminds us of how important our personal relationship with Christ is. It also reminds us of the importance of fellowship with other Believers. We are to correct, encourage, pray with one another, etc. His book reminded me that God does have a purpose for me, even if I don't know what it is, if I'll dispense with my human pride. I think the message is simple, yet effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete garbage","review":"This lunacy should be restricted to the children's fiction section of the library. Warren writes like he's leading a Sunday school class, sentences rife with exclamation points and gushingly excited wording so that it reads like a charlie the choo choo train kids story, complete with all the faux excitement children would expect. This is a book written by a sheepherder, designed specifically to keep his flock neat, happy and blind as a bat. It has literally no value in the real world and in fact does more damage than good, as it does little more than bring religion closer to the reader and make it that much more difficult to separate from the world we live in, which is secular by word of the Constitution. Not worth reading unless you've been lobotomized and need something to drool on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sure way to increase sin","review":"Wow. This is bad. This book is extremely legalistic and will only strengthen sin in a person's life (2 Cor 15:56). It makes people feel good about themselves b/c it plays to our sense of self-effort and self-righteousness. It has the appearance of working for a time but is incapable of producing the power of God that permanently changes a person. At best, the reader will read this, try it, exhaust it, come to the end of themselves and give up.

I have hated all those self-help books out there who say if you just do xyz, your life will change. There is a new one out every other week, and most of it is just nonsense. I want something real. I want the TRUTH. Give me the real deal.But this book is different. Rick Warren says it is not all about YOU. Your life is about God. We were created by God and for God, and as soon as we realize that, our lives will be changed forever.I have been a Christian my entire life, and I still was able to learn a lot from this book. It grounds me. It gives me purpose. Faith gives us purpose and peace, and those who walk in faith, will continue to walk in the light.

I was hoping for more insightful and inspired discussion about the ways Christ's teachings can change our lives. What we get is simplistic and superficial. The underlying logic is often contradictory. Also, it seems that every other paragraph has a sentence that starts \\"The Bible says.....\\". Then these biblical passages are ruined by the use of a variety of new age tranlations that try oh-so-hard to sound \\"hip\\" and relevant to our times. And the author even admits he takes artistic liberty with THESE translations to get his point across. No substance. Son of Oprah. Then the last part of the book is him trying to sell you stuff. I'm all for wanting to see Christian books succeed, but if a non-Christian would pick up this book out of curiosity, he would walk away thinking \\"they're non-thinking lemmings\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read - hard to put down!","review":"I have just begun my Christian life.

I was pretty excited to read it after reading the introduction, and even the first day. But as my 40 days wore on, i got tired of the way Rick Warren repeats himself, refers constantly to his church (Because they do everything RIGHT, obviously) and the way he is always plugging his other products (the Purpose Driven Life Journal, The Purpose Driven Church, etc.)Soon after i started reading the book, my church started doing the 40 days of purpose campaign... complete with videos featuring Rick Warren himself who actually prays on the videos.Overall, I really didn't like the book. I got a little bit out of it, but not really anything new that i couldn't have gotten straight from the Bible itself... and by that I mean a TRANSLATION of the Bible, not a Paraphrase (the message) which Rick Warren is SO fond of using."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"I read a third of this book.

Warren quotes several hundred Bible verses (either in the neighborhood of 400 or 700, I forget) and provides little to NO exposition or exegesis.Christians should honestly review the nature of what Warren is trying to do by offering this Jack van Impe style of rapid fire scripture quotation. Hopefully many readers will be inspired to use this only as a supplement for reading and studying to see if the scripture Warren uses are hermeneutically sound, but they probably won't, as I'm sure many of the quotations are used as blind support verses, as opposed to true exegetical argumentation.All in all, I'm sure the Lord will use this book to bring hundreds if not thousands of believers and nonbelievers closer to himself. But it will happen in spite of this carelessly written book, not because of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another formula","review":"I cannot imagine a book more thoroughly repulsive than one that trivializes the human spirit and something as precious as a relationship to God. This book almost does that but does have some good to it. Basically though, it offers a method, a simple little plan for using God as a means to an end. Spiritually thus reduced is just another bit of gawdy consumerism. This book might be a first step in the right direction, but serious seekers and followers of Jesus will find little here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I Have Ever Read","review":"One chapter a day is all you need, they are short and so positive.I wish every politician would read this book, we would have a different country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Study for Small Groups","review":"What a wonderful book!

The book is designed to be read over a course of 40 days, which I did in my first reading, but in my second reading I completed it in a few days. The Purpose Driven Life answers life's most important question: What on earth am I here for? If you don't know the answer, reading Warren's book will provide you the answer in a way that is easy to understand. Even if you are a Christian, this book provides some wise counsel that can help you live life for the glory of God. Unfortunately there are some major elements lacking in this book. Vital doctrines that are missing include man's sinfulness and our need for a Savior, the substitute sacrifice of the sinless Christ who bore our sin on the cross. For a serious critique of Rick Warren's Purpose Drive Life (from a reformed perspective), I highly recommend visiting Tim Challies' blog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Direct and Accurate","review":"This book has the path to the answers about life.Each chapter is full of easy-to-grasp, catchy statements that turn my life around.

Biblical quotes are from paraphrases, and often the book simply mentions \\"the Bible says\\". Furthermore, there is no justification or explanation as to why the Bible may be an authoritative source.As a Christian this book greatly disappointed me.

This clamoring over this book tells me there are a lot of people with a big spiritual hole. One of the reviewers suggested we check out the Purpose Driven Life Website. So I did. In their store, they don't even sell the Bible. And the tab called The Book...well it's not the Bible. You see more PDL on that site than you do Christ's name.

Bad things DO happen to good people but God's grace is always there wherever we go, even unto death. I see book's message as a way of seeing our personal God-shaped mission: (1) to take God with us; (2) enjoy the journey; and, (3) take as many people as we can with us.

The first week is dynamite, and grabs your attention. Why am I here? How should I live my years on earth, and for what purpose? It's all very simple. Rick Warren writes in a style for the masses (that doesn't seem to appeal to many intellectual snobs) - which in my mind is perfect. The only negative comment I have is the use of so many different Bible translations. I would often open my KJV or NIV, and read a verse differently than the meaning Rick Warren was getting out of a different version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can have a positive impact.","review":"This is one of the best books I have read.

It's like one of those sickening Robert Kinkade paintings (the painter of light) in a book...just too much sugar. I felt like I was reading a little desk-top calendar chock full of happy little platitudes designed to be some manner of a Christian DayTimer. It was just...laughable.Basically, it thinks it's The Diving Conspiracy, by Dallas Willard. That's graduate level Christian material. Defenite required reading. Purpose Driven Life?

Besides, you aren't going to serve God by playing church. You are going to serve him by studying his word (the bible)which shows him your sincerity of wanting to be a servant and also by helping those in need.This book is nothing more than a ratchet-jaw celebrity pastors hot-air diatribe of how to serve the church (hopefully his church).

My church participated in the 40-day campaign, complete with videos and journals. While some people felt they discovered a purpose for their lives at the time, I was surprised at how fleeting the effect of this book was.The text of this book is very repetitive, and it appears as though Warren searches every conceivable translation of the Bible until he finds words that say what he wishes them to. Failing that, he paraphrases the Scripture. At one point, Warren asserts that he has CEOs at his church whose God-given purpose is to earn large sums of money (so they can write checks to charity, I suppose). The tone of this book is somewhat arrogant (it assumes that no reader is plugged in to God's will), and Warren isn't hesistant to market his other products within the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading description","review":"Book was listed as \\"new\\" and gently written in.

It is poorly written and even on many occasions cites Biblical references incorrectly. I read the book thoroughly, looking up every reference in three different versions of the Bible, and Mr. Warren must have sprained his thinking muscles several times with the leaps he took in using the references to back up the \\"truths\\" in the text.

So, logically, I could say, my parent give me life so my life is to serve my parent. That is absolutely not true!I have to say, I don't like it and I found it is a little affending to me.

Boy was I wrong! No book can tell you your purpose in life. Only God knows the true extent of your purpose and He has it all planned out. What you need to do is seek Him and ask Him to help you see what that purpose is. This book gives you guidance in understanding why.This is not a book that you can just read through once and \\"get it\\". There were many chapters that I read again (and a few that I read 3 or 4 times!).

However at community level, impossible. Impossible as the church requires to be on the same wavelength.All churches have charismatic invasion, making it impossible for God-ordained purposes to flourish as intended.

It is written by Rick Warren who really helps give a focal point to start your positive questioning and thinking about how earth is not our final home we were created for something much better. It is a well written book, easy read with lots of information. I could not put it down. The author actually guides you through a 40 day journey to help you understand why you are alive and to learn what God's plan is for you here on earth and for eternity. Rick Warren focuses on above and not within. You will feel good as you read and after you finish. It leaves you feeling very positive and with a purpose for every step.

I have to say it more or less fits a fundamental approach, but some areas of the Christain advanced walk are explored. However there is real need for balance in the book of our humanity and spirituality with each other as well as our focus on divine guidance. I believe it is a huge and critical problem that we do not have more books that equalize our walk with each other and God, these books only confine our eyes and spirit to the creator and not to each other who we need to live with in our purpose.

If you believe in the dogma of the Bible, I guess you would like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unscriptural \\"Purpose\\"","review":"This book is not scripturally sound, as is especially evidenced by the fact that Rick Warren relies mainly on a paraphrased version of scripture to make his points, which is very different from what a literal translation states. In addition, most of his advice is based on human ideas instead of biblical wisdom and human ideas are generally wrong while God is always right.It's a shame that so many Christians are gravitating toward this book looking for some magical \\"40 day\\" formula instead of seeking the truths found only in the scriptures. I cannot recommend this book under any circumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"How could this book live up to the hype? The author has apparently done his research and has pulled in interesting Bible quotes, but his 40 day transformation is too simplistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"self-righteous crap","review":"Anyone who would consider buying this would be well advised to read Sren Kierkegaard's \\"How to Be a Christian\\", Jean-Paul Sartre's essay \\"Existentialism is a Humanism\\" and Friedrich Nietzsche's \\"Thus Spake Zarathustra\\". If you need a book to tell you your purpose in life then those are infinitely more capable of doing so than this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Christian content","review":"This interesting self-help book is unfortunately marred by an over-reliance on Christian teachings.Christians claim that the founder of their religion was the incarnation of God, and insist that anyone who dares to say otherwise will suffer eternal punishment in hell. This tends to undermine anything beneficial in what they can teach us. If the purpose of life is to discover and accept that their religious guru was God - that's not much of a purpose, is it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"very dangerous","review":"i'm a born again christian that is filled with God's holy spirit and i've heard so much about this \\"emergent church\\" movement and rick warren, so i decided to read a few sentences of the book while i was in a book store and let me tell you!!! i just started getting a huge migrane headache which is very odd..... something about this book just doesnt sit well with me and i would strongly receommend against getting this book.....

Don't like it","review":"This book is pretty surface level stuff. It doesn't go in depth on single point. Although I don't disagree with most of what Rick wrote, I also think this isn't a good book for anyone but an unbeliever or a new believer. I can't understand how this book became such a phenomenon. It seems most churches are doing the Purpose Driven Life study together and while it's good for a church to do studies together, why have they chosen one without substance and meat. Something to dwell and meditate on? My suggestion for the believer who knows the basics of the Christian life and what it's about -- Don't waste your money. To the unbeliever and new believer -- You may find something in this book to start off your Christian life on the right foot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy, waste of time.","review":"Another book telling people how to live and what to do with no real answers, \\"what on earth am I here for\\" was not answered in this book at all. More self help mumbo jumbo that left me feeling more judged by Christianity then encouraged. Warren's book left me with more questions then answers, and did not give me any more information on why I am here. I will sell it back to Amazon rather then keep it in my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad stuff, I would not recommend my friends to read it.","review":"1, \`ebhedh in Hebrew (OT orignal language) always mean \\"slave\\" or \\"servant\\" and can NEVER be translated to \\"friend\\". But the author intentionally uses wrong translation of Bible to establish his theory on \\"friendship\\" with God. The author intentionally misleads readers to follow his wrong theological stand.2, It took Moses 40 years to find his purpose of life, but the author guarantees you find your purpose of life in 40 days? Many people buy/like the book because they are already enslaved by the fast-food culture.3. Christians, especially young believers, are encouraged to read good books, for example \\"Celebration of Discipline\\" by R.J. Foster, \\"The Fight\\" by John White, \\"Sacrifice\\" by Howard Guiness, \\"Spiritual Leadership\\" by Sanders, and etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed....very elementary","review":"This book came highly recommended from a friend.I was very disappointed though.As many reviewers have stated, it would be an excellent introduction to Christianity or as a book to any4th or 5th grader.Theres really not much substance in it to the knowledge seeker.A few rehashed ideas, mixed with his opinions (largelyfundamental protestant). I know he is a pastor, but the writing style is very poor. Dont get me wrong, there are a few bright points such as expounding on ways to worship and anenlightening passage on meditation/prayer techniques.Just overall I was disappointed.He built up to this nugget of wisdom about midway through :\\"Almighty God wants to be your friend\\".ugghhh. Hope he is able to use all the proceeds in a positive way though."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Purpose Driven Life","review":"It is disturbing to me that this book is being so widely read and acclaimed. I am particular concerned with the fact that Warren takes scripture out of context just to make a point. Much like his first book he has a case he wants to make and then attributes the source as scripture. This book is teaching Christians some terrible habits when it comes to how scripture is to be treated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I have been reading the book and writing in my journal through day 8. I noticed that some of the things that are written are strictly opinion. The book had mentioned that we are to glorify God by loving other \\"believers.\\" I don't believe that; I thought people of God were to love all people regardless if we/they are believers or not. I also disagreed with some of the worship ideas; I agree that we go to church to glorify God and to worship him; but I do believe worship is ultimately for God and for God's people; it mentioned that worship is not meant for the people. I do agree with the premise that our lives should revolve and be centered around God & that we are on Earth a short period of time versus eternity. But overall, the more I read, the more disappointed I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"This is just a repackaged edition of the same book. I read it 10 years ago and was not impressed with its religious overtones. That aside, where does Rick Warren come off calling this non-fiction? These writings are his opinion and nothing more. No thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"No substance","review":"Rick Warren makes many good points but fails to provide substance to back them up. He makes statements that are claiming certain things, but doesn't back them up with actually explanation and research. This book would be much better if it didn't focus on so many different things. There is no depth because there is too much content.My other main issue with this book is the focus on works. This book is all about doing and doesn't leave room for the grace of God. I would predict that many people would read this book and be left feeling guilty or overwhelmed by all the things Christians need to do. Don't get me wrong, I believe that if we truly love God we will act on that love, but that doesn't seem to be the point in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and belittling","review":"I tried with this book. I got the journal and made it through 10 days before I finally gave up. Between the self-righteousness of the tone and the mixed Biblical references, I very much felt that Warren developed his thesis and then went looking for the references, rather than the other way around.When he reaches back into the Old Testament for references as to what would please Christ, he really is mixing messages. For example, \\"The Bible says, Figure out what will please Christ, and then do it.\\" Fortunately, the Bible gives us a clear example of a life that gives pleasure to God. The man's name was Noah.\\" (p. 69)Although Jesus came from the Jewish tradition, he challenged it as well. His great commandments speak of love. He drew on the Old Testament teachings but created a new way of looking at it.I didn't find my purpose in life from this book and I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do you expect...parent co. publishes Satanic bible.","review":"I've read part of the book and some of the reviews on here. There's a lot of fluff in this book and its basically one of Zondervan's (publisher) and Warren's schemes to fill their pockets with cash. Loose scripture references are not surprising since Zondervan is the publisher of the controversial TNIV bible. Then again, I don't know why anyone is surprised that this book has major flaws when Zondervan's parent company, Harper Collins publishes the Satanic bible. Christians beware - use discernment when purchasing Zondervan products."},{"rating":"1","title":"atrocious book","review":"the introduction of the book was well organized. but the author kept on repeating the same ideas in each chapter. the book could be reduced to a 100-booklet at most. Then in his chapter of fellowship, he criticized the hermits by saying this is not the way u could feel GOD in ur life. By that, he proved again that he is against the catholic and orthodox churches. what about the thousands of hermits still living today in Greece (in the holy mountain) and everywhere else? he didn't consider those hermits who quit the sinful life to live for GOD. The life is so sinful that we r committed to satan in a way or another on a daily/regular basis. So we have to respect those hermits who sacrificed their lives for GOD and christ. It is so sad that a guy (warren) who believes himself he is living for GOD to talk like this about the SAINTS.GOD bless"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"This book by Rick Warren is very good, because it tells us how to follow God's word. He tells us that God should be the driving force behind our lives, and that we are living on Earth because God lets us live here temporarily. It also describes how we were put on this Earth for a purpose--and that is to fulfill God's wishes. This book is very helpful, and very truthful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Book!

However, it became merely a rote recitation of platitudes (true nonetheless) that God created me and I exist to worship and praise him in all that I do - or, a reworking over a few hundred pages of the first line from the Baltimore Catechism.

His book \\"The Purpose Driven Life\\" has virtually re-written the bible, with fifteen different translations such as 'The Message' which often remove his vision of the bible from all reality. He urges his readers not to attend another bible study (p. 231), and then, later, to do personal Bible study (p. 307) I advise readers to get a reliable standard bible version, and study it rather than this man's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Witness Tool","review":"It was hard for me to get past the first chapter. After that, I found I was purpose-driven to finish the book ahead of my Sunday School class. While reading through the book at several places, I was put in the position to quote from it pertaining to what was going on in my household. I was able to clarify the word \\"zealous\\" as also purpose-driven to my husband when he was faced with replying to an e-mail to his boss. I had been ministrying to a 22 yr. old woman who wanted to know why she had a thought and then committed the sin. I had read the answer to the question the night before. I have something highlighted on every page. Rick's story about his Dad touched close to my heart because of my Dad's passing.

Yes,andso is Warren because he sits on the fence between free will androbotic controll from above.I found the book to be depressing,because it leads to nowhere and the arguement goes around in circles.Another troubling thing about the book isthe feeling that you are the center of the universe and all other people bounce off of you so you can have your experience.Sounds new age almost.To make a long story short Warrencomes across as someone who uses subjective fluffy 'feel good'thinking and tries to make it an objective reality for all people,just doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed Opportunity","review":"What a disappointment. May I suggest the lessons Jesus taught in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew: 5) as a guide for a life of purpose.

I have a whole new outlook on life now. This is a book that I will read over and over. It helps you to accept things in your life and helps you to understand life in general and focus on God. I HIGHLY recommend this book for ANYONE going through a rough time. As Scott Peck starts his book, \\"Life is Difficult\\". That statement is 100% accurate.

A new appendix explaining why different translations of scripture quotations are used, and video instructions for each of 42 chapters with access to online community fully utilizing social media trend of the past few years. This new edition is a timely release on the Election day when America's focus is drifted away from spiritual awakening. Rick Warren is as relevant and fresh as any time for the past thirty years addressing a new generation ready to be transformed by truth. For me it was fresher than the first edition's read a few years back. Rick Warren is fulfilling his purpose and stands the test of time. A hard act to follow.

The Book is not a self help book, but a self awareness, life altering experience. It actually allows the reader to discover that our individual purpose in life is not for ourselves. It is a journey that creates a sort of comfort and understanding about our individual existance, it allows the reader to transend traditional miopic conciousness. It is not about us.If you are lost, confused, and just don't get why in the world you are here, please read Purpose Driven Life. The journey is difficult, and it does require that you discuss ideas and thoughts daily, but it is well worth it. Have discussion parties, join a discussion group at Google Groups if you must. But do something!!! You realize that your individual purpose drives you and inspires you.

But these struggles are reasons that we need to seek comfort. BUT WHERE? AND HOW? The Purpose Driven Life has the answer.

Here the author hasn't done any justice in emphasizing about the most important factor which is 'GRACE'. He just brushes past it and has not done any justice on that topic. Let the Holy Bible be our reference from which we understand God. One book I will recommend after the Holy Bible is the book by Dr. James Richards called \\" Grace: the power to change\\". It will help us in seeing how we are still trying to cling on to our own abilities and how we still fail. Must read for saved Christians.The Holy Spirit will definitely reveal to our hearts the truth if you read the Bible submitting yourself to Christ and not to your own abilities. We should always remember one thing, we are no longer under law but under grace.Amazed by his Grace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous resource for those desiring to grow spiritually","review":"THE PURPOSE DRIVEN LIFE is the best book I have ever read on developing a mature Christian walk and growing closer to God. I've been looking for a book like this for a long time. Since it is divided into short chapters with a scripture verse and a challenging question at the end of each chapter, I used it as a daily devotional. The author doesn't just give his opinion--he uses many, many scripture references from a variety of different versions of the Bible. The writing is so clear and sensible and RELEVANT, yet takes the reader on a deep spiritual journey. I plan to buy copies to share with other members of my family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Understand the Intent but","review":"I think I understand the intent behind what he was wanting to do, but this is not something I would recommend for anyone. This seems more of a self help light book instead of helping individuals understand who God is and what there response should be to Him.The Bible needs to be the supreme authority within every Christians life. It is not a self help book, but the inspired Word of God that reveals who He is and who were are in comparison. Wanting to glorify God in this life is great and will look different from person to person but it needs to be driven and grounded on the truth of Scripture. Scripture reveals that our purpose is through the penal substitutionary sacrifice of Jesus Christ, and Warren doesn't have that as the foundation of this book.It's not heretical but just not a solid book to spend time reading. There are other books that I would suggest picking over this one up. One is \\"Don't Waste your Life\\" - John Piper or \\"A Quest For More\\" - Paul David Tripp"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thousands of trees died needlessly to print this book","review":"A well-intentioned friend gave me this book, and I obligingly began reading it.

I pass no judgement on the author's motives. Its not that I found Warren's book to be offensive, but rather that I found it devoid of meaningful content.

The Gospel was NEVER a popularroute for the world or the worldly.Many preachers and cheerleaders seem to have forgottenthat fact.

We talked about each chapter every day.I learned a great deal about myself and my relationship with God. The only problem that I had with this book was the chapters had so much great information, it was hard to focus on individual parts. It was difficult sometimes to read the whole chapter and \\"get\\" everything. It helped to read this with someone because she noticed things that I did not and vice versa. We read this as a way to strengthen our relationship and to grow with God in our relationship. Not really what it was designed for.

I think it could be especially valuable for new Christians. Like The Prayer of Jabez, it's been incredibly hyped and it's not quite as good as advertised, but no book could be as good as PDL is purported to be.I typically read a chapter a day during my devotional time and I could see myself going through the book many times that way.If you look hard enough you will find something that you will not agree with. Looking at some of the reviews I've read, lots of people have looked very hard and have gotten themselves all worked up over just these type of picayune details. But what you'll remember out of this book is the five purposes, and it's impossible to quarrel with those on doctrinal grounds.The pastor of our Bible-believing church is encouraging all of us to read this book, and I'm glad he has.

Either you love, love, love it and consider it to be the greatest book since the Bible or you hated it. I, alas, belong to the second group. I didn't want to hate it but there's so little substance here, it's shocking.The book is dull, repetitive, and comes off like a slick piece of marketing. It also seems to have been written for people possesing only 8th grade reading skills. I resented being constantly urged in every other chapter to read (buy) Rick Warren's other books. Purpose Driven Life looks impressive at first glance but when you read it, it's just another self help book. Whether it sticks around on the Christian market as a perpetual favorite or whether it becomes the new Prayer of Jabez (a fad) remains to be seen but it certainly doesn't live up to the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"What on earth is Rick Warren teaching?","review":"The Purpose Driven Life is a sad reflection of the current state of American Christianity. It has little in common with traditional Protestantism of either the mainline or evangelical variety.This is light reading. Basically it is a self-help book that uses Christian vocabulary to communicate a 40-day program of personal self-improvement. At best it is harmless. At worst people may mistake it for true Christianity.If you must read this book, then at least balance it with a thoughtful critique, such as \\"More Than a Purpose\\" by Marshall Davis or \\"Reinventing Christianity\\" by Bob DeWaay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the value minded","review":"People without values will find no use for this book.

Many of the negative reviews I've read on this book were by readers who appear not to accept the very first sentence of The Purpose Driven Life -- \\"It's not about you.\\" That is hard to accept in the culture we live in today, but Rick Warren understands that and makes great sense of it all with an easy writing style.

It gives the reader a more confident starting point to turn their life around and incorporate values that God has laid before us. Rick Warren's undeniable faith is an illuminating source of God's will that inspires oneself to take that leap of faith and place your salvation in the Hands of God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful When Understood","review":"Rick Warren hit on a lot of great ways to get people focused on reaching their highest potential. In many ways it is similar to the writings in The Spoken Words of Spirit: Lessons From The Other Side. I was intrigued by Rick's perception of God and the workings of Spirit. IF people follow his plan, at the very least they will learn to be more determined to add a positive force as a driving force for their future."},{"rating":"1","title":"The decline and fall of the church","review":"This book is for pastors who only are interested in money, power, large congregations and big tithes. Insipid pop rock Christian music and watered down gospel messages is what this book is about. Avoid at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much fear and dogma, not enough soul and reality","review":"This book seeks to create more of a follower, rather than someone that can connect to God in their own personal way, without a church attached to it.It doesn't help people with everyday challenges, but preaches. It doesn't address the problems of Christian women beaten by their husbands, and what to do if there is incest in a family. If anything it brings more fear upon a person that might want to leave, but be afraid to break vows they made before an alter.It's great to worship the Lord, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. It just doesn't do much to help people find their own personal connection, and that is what's needed most."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a travesty - its not the gospel","review":"A Church of 15,000 people is an oxymoron. The writer speaks about an extremely self centered view of the gospel. Although he says in the beginning its not about you he goes on to tell how you will go to heaven how you will find all kinds of good stuff in the Church to make you feel good. Where is sacrafice or did Jesus not die a sacraficial death. It is sad that this has become a best seller but then that was its purpose to make money for its author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author's an idiot, probably never open a book before","review":"I have not read the book. I judge a book by its cover. Just a bunch of idiocity from one writer. Pick up a better book. Writer should take my writing class. I should know. I have the most writing articles published and one book out on trekking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even worse than the bible.","review":"Gosh what can you say. This book is even worse than the bible. (You have read the bible haven't you?)The premises is that you only exist to satisfy the ego of Jehovah. That no good deed you do for your fellow man is worth while. No good works are. This is the worst of new testament christian ideas boiled down to only dredges.If only there were a way to rate this book with negative stars. If given it, throw it away and get out in the real world and help your fellow person. There can be no better purpose.Robert G Ingersoll said it well.Happiness is the only good. The time to be happy is now. The place to be happy is here. The way to be happy is to make others so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right Question - Wrong/Vugue Answer!","review":"The book has asked the right question. It is true why the intelligent human being in on earth... what for...Eat... reproduce and die...Life is too short as compared to the life of universe..Life has should have purpose...Am I born to grow... get loan from bank for the necessity of life and rest of life is dedicated to return the money...This is not fair...Where is the answer?Let me say not . only Christianity... Why not see other religion... I find more convincing answer in other religion such as Islam..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feeling a little threatened are we???","review":"After reading some of the negative reviews from the obvious ultra liberal anti-Christian readers I began to see what was happening. You all wanted to see what all the fuss was about and the message hit home a little too hard. Keep on doing your yoga and meditate to your Enya albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haves and Have Nots","review":"I haven't read the book yet but know the principles behind it. But I wonder why an egotistical jerk like Donald Trump can be given so much while others have so little. Where's the justice? Still, any book that provokes people to get closer to God has to help our society become more civilized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless ear candles","review":"I have been using candles bought at a local healthstore for some time, with good results every time. However, using these candles I would have thought that there was no wax in my ears at all. I even interspersed using these candles with the ones from the local healthstore...each time TC Natural's candles produced nothing, but the others did.In a nutshell, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dried mango","review":"Yuck, very dry and stick to your teeth, taste a little stale. I'll try them in recipes and see it that's any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard to be edible","review":"I like the idea that it is organic. However, this is too hard. When they say dried, they mean dried out. The flavor is not that great either, although I can deal with that alot better than it being cooked too long. I tried giving these things away. Everyone ends up throwing them away. For me, it was not worth the sale price that I paid for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"The ingredients list: \\"ORGANIC MANGOS\\". That's it! If you are expecting sugared fruit, then you will be disappointed, but if you are expecting a healthier snack, then you'll most likely be pleased. For what these are, I think they are worth 4 stars. They are pretty good tasting and being organic and without chemicals, preservatives and added sugar, they're definitely good enough for 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Snack for the Kids!!!","review":"I love this brand. It is great!!! It is also nice that they are organic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the lot","review":"I love Bare Fruits dried cherries, my favorite snack. Full of love and hope, I ordered the dried mangoes and was sorely disappointed. They are foul to the taste, and smell like froo-froo soap chips. I regret buying a whole box, but fortunately now have Xmas gifts for people I don't like."},{"rating":"1","title":"These mangoes taste awful and smell even worse","review":"I opened the first package all excited. It tasted awful. And then I got a whiff of it - it smells even worse. I am returning this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money on dried mango","review":"Taste terrible, like cardboard paper.There is No Refund on it.After trying one ,i donated the rest of it to food bank(23 bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT","review":"If you like the taste of sweet stale cardboard, this is for you. If you like the aroma of 'fake' mangos, this is for you.The pieces in every bag are all less than the size of a corn flake (like the cereal). Each bag has about 100 pieces in it (not counting the dust at the bottom of the bag...). You end up chewing one piece for several minutes before you just give up and spit it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did I not see these reviews before puchasing?!!","review":"I have to agree with several of the other reviewers. This stuff is junk. I love dried Mango...to the point I can't buy keep enough in the house. This stuff isn't impossible to eat; though, I can see this stuff sitting around for a long time! The product looks like Cheese It's crumbs. They are tiny and hard. As if that isn't unappetizing enough...there are little tracks from whatever machine was used to turn a once delicious mango into this dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT","review":"this was the worst tasting dried mangos i have ever ate. they were so dry that it hurts my teeth trying to bite through them. it seems like they packaged the worst part of the mango pieces (like the skin or pieces near the core/seed). in each pack, only 10% of the mango pieces were actually good, all the rest i had to throw away because i just couldn't eat them. now i still have about a full case with no one wanting to eat them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty!","review":"I have tried many unsweetened, unsulphured mangoes, along with sweetened. The \\"mangoes\\" in these packages are just terrible. They are these little tiny pieces about the size of a scrabble piece, and are very thin - there is not a hint of moisture in them, and they have some type of scoring pattern on one side. I felt like I was eating a paper product. I do not recommend these to anyone! There are many many better options than this type - if you've ever tried the ones from Trader Joe's or Whole Foods Market....go back there! These are not even from the same family. If I can say one good thing, it is that they are organic. I thought the price was good, but the quality tells me why!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bare Fruit is Barely Edible","review":"I've tried LOTS of dried mangos - this has to be the worst. Tastes like slightly flavored cardboard. Definitely not an older child or adult snack.Since I purchased an entire case (stupid me) I'm going to try adding the mango pieces to various recipies. Maybe a mango chutney. Otherwise this was a total waste of money and is going in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid Native American Piano Music","review":"Despite not normally associating the piano with Native American music, this CD works really well. The melodies are some of the most beautiful I have heard, and the quality of sound is of the highest order.The music is highly accessible. The piano is the prominent instrument, with occasional light chanting.In a collection of over 300 CDs, this is right at the top of my favourites pile.This CD is short (about 38 minutes in length), but if you believe, like me, that quality is more important than quantity, then you won't be disappointed.I cannot recommend this CD highly enough. Put simply, it is beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow, this cd is Great.","review":"I discovered Brule by accident. I was at Zion National Park and bought \\"We the People\\" by mistake. Sometimes mistakes are good. Lakota Piano is the last Brule cd I needed to complete my collection. I think its their best work. Yes it is short, but so what. It's a great 38 minutes. Now that I have all of Brule's cd, I'm hoping they make a few more. They are great for making one relax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lakota Piano","review":"I have tried to listen to Lakota Piano but it would not open for me on line in the listening review. I enjoyed Nicoles Passion Spirit and would like to hear more of the same type of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"great looking fake tin ceiling tiles","review":"my husband has wanted a tin ceiling for years - when we can afford it... we can afford these now for our victorian remodel.These are thin plastic flexible sheets molded with the same shape as the real metal ones. They look like the metal ones on our ceiling! I love the way you can hardly tell plastic imitations from antique wood/metal these days. They did not include any adhesive so we bought sticky squares from the hardware store to mount them."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"This is not what I expected....expected some new direction, all I got was\\"pop\\" cliches alla Andrew Lloyd Weber....if you love show tunes, you'll love thisnew Liturgical worship music...."},{"rating":"2","title":"This will Grow On You.","review":"I first heard this on \\"So you Think You Can Dance\\" They were playing Requiem: Dies Irae which when I first heard it could not believe how powerful it was. I was lucky because they always show the title of the music at the beginning. I saw that it was Karl Jenkins and went to I- tunes and saw all of the music that he had and started listening to samples and got hooked. This particular album was an example of a great master at work. Listen to Sanctus and Palladio (1st Movement). Can you guess where you have heard Palladio. (hint: very rich) You will love both tracks. Also check out You-Tube under Karl Jenkins to see what he has. I bet you will buy his albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"No cross references, etc.","review":"Have to disagree with most of the previous reviewers. In my opinion, the quality of versions of the NASB has been going down. In this one... no cross references, Jesus words not in red, and other issues. I love the NASB, but I miss the 1985 Cambridge Study Edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overall value","review":"I use the NASB for scripture memory and study so I picked this bible up when it was on sale a couple of years ago. Excellent value. I think that having a place to make notes as the Holy Spirit reveals them has truely transformed my understanding of the scriptures. The only drawback is that this bible does not have Christ's words in red, which I prefer. It also doesn't have cross-references, which is ok for me. Do yourself a favor and get the leather version. I admit that I'm hard on my bibles but I've had this hardback one for a few years and I can see that it's not going to last for the next 10 years (not a problem since I paid less than $20). I'm getting ready to spend some real $ on a new bible that will last. Why not. It's worth it, right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great format but the binding is very bad","review":"After looking around for a good note taking bible in NASB, I came across this one. The reviews looked good so I ordered the hardcover version. Amazon did their thing well and the bible looked great. The margins are just right at 1.5 inches. There are even some very nice full color maps in the back.UNFORTUNATELY, after 3 months of using the bible during studies and transferring some of my notes from other bibles, the binding started to fall apart. Last Sunday I had about 15 pages from the map section fall out under the pew.Since I have done so much transferring of notes, I am looking into have it rebound.After reading all the reviews again, it looks like both the leather and hardcovers have bad bindings. You might want to look at products. NASB is hard to find in wide margin! Good hunting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hefty bible but lots of writing space","review":"I view this bible as a bible and journal wrapped up in one so the size is ok. The only thing is that within 3-4 days of using this bible the maps in the back began to come loose and now, a week or two later are completely out. The binding on the bible pages looks pretty secure. Hopefully it stays that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Notetaker's Bible","review":"Make sure and buy an XL Bible cover for this wonderful edition of the NASB. While I still refer to my cross reference Bible, this edition by Zondervan allows me all the \\"elbow room\\" I could ever want, germinating notes fit for a good Bible study. Also, this is one of the few Bibles that have not printed Jesus' words in distracting red ink! A must for pastors who still like to preach and teach the word, and not predigested, prepackaged \\"sermons\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for taking notes!","review":"I highly recommend this Bible for those of you who like to take notes. The font looks nice and is easy to read. Each verse begins on its own line and their are no footnotes cluttering the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wide Margin Bible Review","review":"The margins were just what I wanted. They provide the space for me to make my own notes. The page paper is a bit thin but I knew that before making the purchase.Within the first month of owning and using the Bible the maps in the back fell out. The binding failed as to them. I was trying to take excellent care of the book and binding from the beginning so this was very disappointing. I did not store papers in the book, broke in the binding as directed and even put a protective cover on the book. The binding is just not sufficient for the size and weight of the book. This is disappointing.Due the binding problem I would not repurchase this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sorcery Club","review":"I did not find this book interesting. I only read the first chapter and I was bored and confused. This is not a book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced is an UNDERSTATEMENT!","review":"I should have paid better attention to the previous reveiwers!!! Thirty cents a peg is outrageous!!! I was in a hurry and since a Lite Brite was one of the three things on my Grandsons Christmas list I was sucked in. The reveiws for the Lite Brite said there were not enough pegs to complete some of the pictures, so it seemed these were a must have. Initially I was not going to purchase the Lite Brite because of the poor reveiws it received, however when the Grandson told EVERYONE he came in contact with that a Lite Brite, a green football and a spiderman shaving kit was all he wanted for Christmas, I went against my better judgement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me..","review":"My older grandchildren passed down an older version of the LIte Brite to their younger cousins. I ordered these pegs as well as some refill pages. The pegs did not fit in the holes properly and were continuously falling out. It was misery. Also--FYI--with any Lite Brite--you need tons of pegs--there weren't enough of these to even finish 1 small picture--had to use alternate colors. Will need to find some \\"old\\" pegs."},{"rating":"1","title":"the peg refills do not fit old lite bright models","review":"I ordered the peg refills thinking they had not changed over the years. My lite brite is an older model. I have absolutely no older pegs, they were lost in a move. Now I have oodles of activity sheets and still no pegs. Any help?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are you charging so much??????","review":"If any of you have a toysrus near you they sell this exact same packets for $5.99!!!!!!!!!!! I cannot believe no one knows how to shop around before buying. I would never spend more money on pegs when the cube doesn't even cost this much! Geez!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like it used to be made!","review":"I bought a Lite Brite for my 6 yr old daughter. I had a lite brite growing up and remember playing with it a lot. Times have changed the make of this product greatly and not for the better. First the light in it hardly lights up the pegs, the pegs are very hard to push in and pull back out (so much so that my daughter gets very frustrated with it), the lite brite itself is half the size they used to be, and the peg holder on the bottom does not open and close very easily. My daughter doesn't seem overly interested in playing with the lite brite much. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive!","review":"The seller really should have made sure they said this was a book from the 70s. What good does this book do me? NONE! Christ almighty, it was SO irrelevant and instantly became paper for the burn barrel. LABEL BOOKS PROPERLY SELLERS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When Words Collide","review":"I ordered two copies of this used book on Amazon. I found one in the $35 range and one for one cent. I received the one cent book, which included a blank workbook, and it was a very good buy. However, the $35 book, which I sent to my son, only included the workbook, which had been used (answers were written in it). I contacted the seller, asking for the accompanying book, and the seller wrote back that he was selling it for $35 (I don't remember the exact price).I am quite happy with the purchase I made for one cent, but I am not satisfied with the $30 purchase, and I will probably try to get a refund. The workbook is absolutely of no use without the accompanying grammar book, as one must read the chapter in order to complete the workbook questions. I would think that the seller could have just sent me the grammar book, as a price of around $70 seems exorbitant for a bundle that includes a used workbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than worth the \\"add-on\\" price!","review":"Purchased this paper weight for our office gift exchange party and the ladies fought over it! The diamond is very large, hefty, and very good quality. The only complaint I had was the logo had a scratch or indent going through it like a sharp edge ran across it. Not that big of a deal, but makes me think the logo will not hold up if it's handled too much. Other than that, the price was great when Amazon had this as an \\"add-on\\" item. Would love to see this come back as an add-on item again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Designed to assist the reader in coming to terms","review":"I Wasn't Ready To Say Goodbye is a fact-filled resource and a consumable, self-help oriented, interactive companion workbook designed to assist the reader in coming to terms with the sudden death of a loved one. From getting through the first few weeks; to helping children cope; to special challenges that sudden and unexpected widowhood can bring; to the support groups and resources to be found locally, regionally, and nationally; to getting past grief blocks, and more, I Wasn't Ready To Say Goodbye is very highly recommended reading and can prove essential to successfully facilitating the grieving process and eventually moving on with our lives after the death of a loved one."},{"rating":"2","title":";KVBGMG","review":"JNTGIJ OITUGJOIG TG EOITUGR HLKCGJBFV DOIKJG DO DIDOI BOD O OIWFO DOBODODODB DO OD IGODIODOB OD BDO O O DFOB F O O FO ROGO G F TOG ITGIJTGIJU GF OIOT ITJGITGT GIG I GT IT GI"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction to Spain in all its variety","review":"No praise is too high for this book, which is exceptionally entertaining as well as informative.

Particularly interesting on the modern Spanish Catholic church and on youth culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well organized dissemination of information","review":"I have traveled to Spain twice in recent years and am very curious about the country and its people. I have found this book to be a valuable resource to my understanding of Spanish history, its people and culture. The amount of information in this 400+ page book would be overwhelming if it weren't so well organized. Hooper gives us useful chapter divisions and chapters that are just the right length. This is particularly helpful if you are looking for information on a specific aspect of life in Spain. I have purchased a few other books on Spain and this one is the most useful and enjoyable, by far. My one quible would be the relative scarcity of visual graphics, photos and illustrations.
