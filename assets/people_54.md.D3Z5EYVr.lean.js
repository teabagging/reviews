This movie is alot better than the original for many reasons. First of all, i am only 15, so i am going to think that the special effects are better right off the bat. I loved the original, but this one is so much better. I have read the book, and this one follows the book pretty much to the t. For instance, in the shower scene, they weren't supposed to yell \\"PLUG IT UP!\\", but rather \\"period\\" over and over. Also, the way the mother dies follows the book rather than the original. This is the way the movie was meant to be, and this version should've been made in 76, rather than the original. It would've worked just as good, had the original cast been in this version...These stars are just as good though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angela Bettis Makes The Movie Good!","review":"For anyone who didn't like Angela Bettis as Carrie, I would say that's a shame. For anyone who thought May was a bad movie, I'm left speechless. Anyway, I do like the modern twist of the movie and the best part of the movie is when Carrie wreaks havoc on everyone. She is very scary! Anyway, although this \\"Carrie\\" will always be compared to the original movie and book, I think it was well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY TOO OLD","review":"This is high school. Both the Carrie and Tommy characters are way too old for these parts and it shows. In true life the Carrie character (Angela Bettis) who is supposed to be 18 is 29 and Tommy (Tobias Mehler) is 26. Would of been a stretch for college seniors but high school - get real. Some actors can pull it off - Sissy Spacek was about the same age as Angela when she played it - but not these two. If you want to watch Carrie watch the Sissy Spacek version. This one is a poor TV copy cat version."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE CHEMISTRY AS THE FIRST ONE","review":"I avoided this movie ever since it came out,because i thought the original Carrie was perfect ,and i was right. I finally rented the newer version of Carrie,i thought the new cast just didn't have that chemistry like the original. I don't understand why they would take a strong film and make a weak film. I didn't like any of the cast members. I mean Sissy Spacek is Carrie no one can top her performance, and Piper Laurie as Margret White just blew me away in the original and also Betty Buckley and Nancy Allen were terrific. I know they went more by the book, i would have rather seen the original updated with the deleted seens,like were carrie was little and was talking to the teenage girl next door about her dirty pillows but other than that the original movie was perfect,no need for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different ending is why I like the new version better","review":"Despite the 1976 film being more skillfully directed by Brian DePalma, and despite its star-making performance by Sissy Spacek, its over-the-top hellfire and damnation ending completely lost me. It seemed to validate the mother's religious fanaticism, and I do not believe it was what Carrie, as a character, deserved. The 2002 remake reinforces my view on this, since it shows more clearly than did the 1976 film that Carrie's rage-driven power, when it reaches its full-blown form, is involuntary. One can argue that leaving the remake open-ended for a planned TV series, which never got off the ground, was a mistake that leaves it unsatisfying, but I still prefer this more humane take on the story to the religious cheap shots in the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"groovy","review":"As i find the orginal the best and the rage: carrie 2 dumb the tv movie of carrie is nearly as good as the real carrie.What make it good is that this one is more to the book story line they have done a good job with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's neither scary nor suspenseful at all.","review":"It's neither scary nor suspenseful at all. The acting is stiff. The movie is boring. There are only 2 scenes with good special effects. The last one is where the truck was wrapped around a pole.So far, my only favorite movie adapted from Stephen King's novel is The Mist (2008)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A couple of good performances; nothing else to recommend","review":"Patricia Clarkson is always good, and she is great here as Carrie's religious nut of a mother. Emilie de Ravin (sp?) is good at getting us to hate her character, Carrie's main tormenter.All Angela Bettis does as Carrie is tremble and perspire a lot whenever she's about to do some telekinetic thing, while Kandyse McClure is merely competent.The fireballs that come down on the Whites' house when Carrie is a kid are just goofy and cheesy, not scary at all.Adapted or not, this one just doesn't make it. The Sissy Spacek version is the all-time classic. See that one instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"throwing rotten tomatoes","review":"This was absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen. The original Carrie is a great movie. The remake of it is laughable at best. I wish I could get that wasted 2 hours and 12 minutes back. Since I can't I will settle for warning those who read this review. It was a pointless remake there was nothing spectacular about the effects and considering the remake is in a different century from the original I expected more but got much, much less. Be warned not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfunctory at Best","review":"This film's production is perfunctory at best. Once more the viewer is confronted with yet another go around of what was not that brilliant of an original film in the first place. One can only sigh."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Remakes of a Clasic","review":"While I am not usually a fan of remakes of movies especially when it is a reamake of a clasic like Carrie, but this remake actually really good. While Sissy Spacek is pretty much what I think of when I think Carrie, Angela Bettis's version of Carrie almost as good as Sissy in the role of the outcast with psychic powers. One of the things that I really liked abou this moive was the fact that they had parts in this movie from the book that weren't in the original movie, like the part where Carrie as a little girl makes rocks fall from the sky and hit her house. If you are a fan of Carrie, you should at least give this movie a chance, you might actually find yourself enjoying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carrie - it's a remake - buyer beware","review":"Title of review says it all.

It is not just the incredibly poor budget, but the entire content is based on interviews with scholars. These supposed \\"scholars\\" are christian bible scholars and the whole documentary gives only one view. The agenda is obvious from the beginning. It is not even historically accurate, nor is it intellectually stimulating. It assumes stupidity in it's viewers. Do yourself a favor and do not rent or buy this horrible piece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alright for the price","review":"If you're really into Tori Amos this DVD pretty good. You get the full lenght video for \\"A Sorta Fairytale\\", but the more interesting part is the making of/interview. It's really cool to get a behind the scenes look at the shooting of a video (especially one with such weird effects like heads on hands or legs) and the Tori commentary is...well...Tori commentary. Anyone who's seen her interviews will understand, it's not always easily interpreted, but still interesting to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"ears with feet! or hand?","review":"The video for Tori's song A Sorta Fairytale is a surreal fantasy piece co-starring Adrien Brody, apropriately of of The Pianist fame. The idea is that the two of them are \\"incomplete\\" people who find each other, kiss, and become Whole, and that is sorta like a fairytale. You will understand if you see it. The Making Of and Interview featurettes are worthwhile for Tori fans, or Ears With Feet. Interestingly, Tori herself is Ears With Foot to Adrien's Easrs With Hand. A worthwhile addition to any Tori collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic DVD Single","review":"If you are a die hard Tori fan, you must now own all her records and singles. And to continue your collection, this DVD Single is a great item, you got the \\"oficial\\" video, the making of..., and an interview, wow, Tori looks beautiful, and she looks happy, calm, gorgeous. Tori must be one of the best female singers right now.The DVD packgage is in the standard case, but the yellow color looks good. By the way, I mean \\"oficial\\" because if you own the Limited Edition Scarlet's Walk CD, in the DVD, you'll find another version for this song, IMHO, I like more the CD version than the DVD single. But, this single, the idea of the video is great, and is funny to look Tori over her foot, and Adrien Brody over his arm. Good Idea.Finally, as I wrote, no collection of Tori is complete without this Single, so, buy now, you won't regreat this decision. Greetings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"After watching all of Tori's music videos on The Complete Videos 1990-1998, I was greatly anticipating this video. What a let down! The whole video she and Adrian Brody are only legs (until the very end). I understand where she was going with this, but I thought it was stupid to have the whole entire video consist of this. It is such a beautiful song and I think the video should have been as spectacular."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG disappointment","review":"I am a big Tori Amos fan and was greatly disappointed when I watched this.

I recommend it highly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short, too simple and nothing I didn't know already.","review":"This extremely short book was something I picked up 2 weeks after my husband confessed to his infidelity. I was still on the ups and downs of the emotional roller coaster and had decided to stay with him and work it out. This book seemed to talk in third grader language and stated the most obvious things - feeling anger, feeling sadness, and offered almost no solutions. If you really want to work through infidelity and betrayal than you are going to need more than 25 pages of lists about how some people feel. There are a lot of other books out there that offer real solutions to forgiveness and anger release and how to get over the depression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight Talk About Betrayal A Self Help Guide For Couples","review":"This book was great.

Moments of epiphany and exaltation are consumed by momentous revulsion. It's a rare encounter, breathing an adjectival power and acute memory, as compelling as it is painful. His life-altering bike accident is related in such a way that the act of writing, the detailed reach of his vocabularly, enacts part of his recovery, the stable point of a dramatically oscillating, and untrustworthy world. An abiding image is that of his despair with his doctor, upon who he seems almost paranoically dependant. When the doctor shifts to another village, semingly out of reach, you can feel the pounding in the pages of Denton's heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasurable","review":"This text is an entirely different experience than most. Although a the novel is categorized as fiction, the author tells it in autobiographical form. Further, he is so revealing and true to self that he paints an unforgettable picture of himself.The novel does not follow the average conflict->rising action->climax->falling action format, but is rather a communal approach, with Welch playing only one character. The sense of movement of the novel is more of a sense of sharing information and in this sense does not pique interest as some other novels would.Welch is a brilliant writer, however. His imagery, his metaphors, his use of direct language all put him in a category all his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A third way of seeing the lives of Dian and Digit","review":"Georgianne Nianaber's dreamlike book is an adjunct to Dian Fossey's work. Although fictional in nature - Georgianne's story from the perspective of the murdered Gorilla named 'Digit\\" has empathy and opens a dialogue with the wild world that Dian alluded to - in her book Gorillas in the mist.Georgianne's ability to move into a third way of seeing and sharing the lives of Dian and Digit opened a view only good literature does. I was taken not only to the place they inhabit in the forest but deep into their relationship to each other. This story is from the outer limit of the shrinking madding / modern world. The carefully, surgically excluded feeling from Dian's own writing has a voice at last - her abiding love for and with the last our great Cousins.Well worth a read, suspend belief and it will touch you and haunt you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you serious?","review":"I find it appalling in the 20th century there are book still writting about racial generalization.

As a previous reviewer stated, the editing is horrible. Many of the sentences make no sense and go back and forth through past and present tense.The system that the authors built and describe in the book is not a Jabber solution.

But be sure to read its predecessors first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read about four \\"brothers\\", their struggles, searching for truth and faithfulness to family were captivating.","review":"A friend loaned me the first two of the series, and I just had to read the third to complete the family story. The saga of the brothers, their struggles, finding the truth and their faithfulness to family were captivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing","review":"This book held my interest..I didnt want to stop reading it and I loved the setting..You wont be disappointed with this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing read","review":"This was the 3rd in a series and once you get into the 1st book, you're left wanting to know the rest of the story. Each book tends to concentrate on one of the brothers but the stories are all inter-related so you have to finish the trilogy to see how each brother's story unfolds. The storyline is fairly predictable but enjoyable nonetheless. The romance scenes are well written and creative. I mean, really, how many ways can you tell a love scene? But this is a very nice family story of relationships between each main character well developed. The book doesn't have terribly many characters to keep track of for those who have trouble keeping everyone straight. Would recommend this series as a nice read to end the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A satisfying end to a great trilogy!","review":"Once again, Nora Roberts has given us a great trio of stories. \\"Inner Harbor\\" was not the best story of the three-but it did wrap up all the loose ends in a way that suited the characters. My favorite of this trilogy was the second, but each book made me laugh and cry and I loved each one. Thanks again, Nora!"},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR NARRATION ON AUDIO VERSION","review":"Considering Nora Roberts' reputation and clout, you would think she'd insist on only the best as a narrator. To begin with, this is the third book, but the first two were narrated by someone else, so there's no consistency. The narrator of the first two books, David Stuart, was ok, but this person, Guy Lemonier, STINKS! He seems to be merely reading the story out loud. There is no differentiation between characters, making dialogue hard to follow, and considering he's narrating on behalf of a character, Phillip, who is supposedly the son of a doctor, I find it ludicrous that he doesn't know how to pronounce words like Imitrex (a medication). Also, all three books are abridged to the extent that many of the funnier moments are omitted, and all the dialogue with Ray and Stella as ghosts is not included. Don't waste your money on the CD version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better and Better","review":"A personal favorite of the Quinn Trilogy. Ethan Quinn, the quiet and passionate seaman is portrayed wonderfully by Roberts, as is the location and atmosphere in which this book takes place. Nora Roberts keeps getting better and better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inner Harbor Nora Roberts","review":"A must read. Make sure you read Sea Swept and Rising Tides first. This one will make you cry, then make you cheer. Makes a beautiful picture from an ugly story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have not been disappointed by Nora yet.","review":"Now it is Phillip Quinn's turn for Fate to play with. He meets his match in a high class woman who analyzes everything from people's behavior to how their surroundings effects them and then puts them into books. With two books in her background she is independently and financially secure. A city woman with modern gadgets. Phillip falls for her hard and fast.Phillip's other two brothers are now married. With them and their wives, they continue to care for Seth. Seth's mother is trying to blackmail more money out of the Quinn families. In this last book of the trilogy we finally learn the truth about Ray, Seth, and the abusive woman who raised Seth. Suddenly, Phillip's new lady friend turns out to have secrets of her own. Secrets which can destroy them all.***A fitting end to the trilogy! I knew Phillip's story would be the best of the three. In my opinion, I was right.***"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ending to the trilogy","review":"I have really enjoyed the earlier two books, and this was a good wrap up of the trilogy. Philip is a good hero, though I liked both Cam and Ethan more. But, he's a good guy, and the heroine is tough and funny. Another good one from Nora Roberts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the other two first","review":"I wouldn't recommend anyone read Inner Harbor without first reading Sea Swept and Rising Tides as they all tie in together. While the trilogy is about three brothers (Cameron, Ethan & Phillip) Seth, the youngest brother's story begins in Sea Swept and ends in Inner Harbor. Reading only the first or second book of this series will leave many questions unanswered. I found I enjoyed Inner Harbor the most. Not only because everything is settled in this book but because I found the chemistry between Phillip and Sybill outstanding. Even when his brothers (mostly Cameron) were angry with her, he gave her the benefit of the doubt to hear her out. To me, although she wasn't what she portrayed to be in the beginning, she unselfishly wanted only the best for Seth. I have also read the \\"Born In..\\" and the \\"Dream..\\" series by Nora Roberts but I think she outdid herself with this one. I've read the last couple pages of Inner Harbor over and over because I loved the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Nora Roberts","review":"I love Nora Roberts and would recommend her books to anybody who likes romance.

She completes the triology of the Quinn brothers very nicely and thriugh out the book helps to build your concern for the youngest and understanding for the other brothers.

It is a must have for any fan of Claymation, mark twain, or just great movies!It's a great movie for the whole family, but I'd watch it first before showing it to small children, because the \\"mysterious stranger\\" scene may be a little scary for some kids.Other than that, it's a wonderful movie and I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A jewel is released for Christmas","review":"I have seen this movie twice on TV and each time it is entertaining as \\"heck\\".

Of course, children watch movies 100 times which make them great bargains, but this one is exceptional and Mark Twain's humor is every bit as much for adults as the claymation is for children.

Sadly, the book sat gathering dust on my shelf for a couple of years, until I finally threw it out--but now I've become more advanced in my cooking skills and I need to buy it again! It really has everything--appetizing recipes from every part of Asia, including India, and provides a very thorough grounding in the techniques and ingredients of that part of the world. I regret throwing my copy away! Even before I could attempt any of the recipes, I used to page hungrily through the book dreaming about making the fantastic-looking dishes contained within.

It truly is the \\"Joy of Cooking\\" of Asian cuisine.I'd give it five stars, but the ingredients are all listed from scratch (Curry power includes more than just curry spice), which can make shopping difficult on occasion, especially when pre-mixed sauces and spices are readily available in most stores and some guess work matching to the recipes can be in order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great.

If you like action anime movies then steer clear of this one, it doesn't have too much action, except towards the end.

It doesn't make you feel sticky and you can't tell it by your skin after you dry off. I really LOVE the scent - not at all strong or overbearing, just quite pleasant.

It is quite long as well. Every social issue is covered; interracial relationships, AIDS, homosexuality, hip hop, dead beat dads, domestic violence, infidelity, infertility, education, discipline ...etc. and it starts to drag. Some of the humor was very funny and it was at times very dramatic and well directed. With more money and tighter editing and direction this film could have been great.

The front thumb button makes web pages go back, and the rear thumb button makes web pages go forward. Kind of a messed up way to get people to use your software. The software is ram intensive as well. For a program that only reprograms buttons on a mouse (simple reg changes) it seems a bit excessive. These changes are supposed to take place in the registry, and be permanent. But if you turn off the software it changes the registry entries back to the default (backwards). It is also bulky for its limited function. It only has 5 buttons, and when I dissected the mouse (to try and correct the button problem) It was mostly hollow. They could have focused on the ergonomics of this mouse, and had plenty of space to play with, but they didn't. Though the rubber buttons are comfortable! That's about it!

Too bad that Kensington is falsely marketing it as a \\"5 programmable button\\" mouse. The software included with the product explictly states that it does not support Vista.How can this be? Vista shipped almost three years ago. It's really hard to believe that Kensington still does not support the most commonly used operating system. I guess they don't really care about their customers.Their software does claim to work on XP and Mac OSX, but if you're on Vista be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but with issues","review":"I bought this mouse in 2005, and used it for about a year with no problems. The programmable buttons were great for light games, and had other usefull features in Windows. Then Vista came out.Even though they claim it is \\"Vista Compatible\\" on the box and website, that is a lie. Kensington has never released a version of thier software that works with Vista. Even 4 years later, they have not done so. So if you are a Vista user, this is just a regular 2 button scroll mouse. And with Windows 7 just around the corner, this mouse will be even more obsolete.I suggest sticking with a good Logitech mouse. And if you are a gamer, get a G5. I replaced my Ci20 with a G5 and have not regretted it at all. I gave this thing away to a friend that still uses XP."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth it","review":"My favorite mouse ever.

One, it just feels much better under my hand than a smaller, smoother mouse. Some of the surface areas have a texture that I like. Two, it is ergonomic in that it is slanted on the top, which reduces stress on the wrist and arm. I also like the buttons on the side, which I mainly use for \\"Back\\" in the browser.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that sometimes it seems that my aim is a little off.

Anyone that have seen all of these classics knows, they were masterpieces of their time and treasures of today.Some people like me, regards these movies as collectible treasures and this DVD case is not suitable for a collectible movie.

Using the media converter is a bit of a hassle to add photos and videos, but still more user friendly than iPod/iTunes combo.Few nits to pick: availability of accessories are slim as Sansa never came close to being the iPod Nano killer. There aren't enough protective skins available in the market. The \\"new\\" non Liquidmetal back case isn't as elegant as original Liquidmetal case.

Searching in the internet I found out that I am not the only one having problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"sandisk e280","review":"several problems with this product. problems with charging the battery. the player locks and i have to wait until the battery is completely depleted to re-charge. the viewer remains on with nothing but a white light. problem with the sound. i have used several different earphones and the problem presists. i have had to reformat the player and reload all files. very disappointed in the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Scroll Wheel","review":"I been waiting to get my hands on the e280 since it was announced. I finally got mine today and have been less then impressed. For one, even though the unit feels solid, the buttons and especially the scroll wheel feel very cheap. The scroll wheel isn't smooth and locks up at times, not too bad but enough to be annoying. Every time you add or removed media, the sansa reboots and does an \\"inventory\\". I had about 4 GB of songs and it takes well over a minute to boot up, I'm sure it'll take much longer with 6 or 8 GB. Don't be me wrong, for the price it does have some nice features that the nano doesn't like FM tuner and video, but I ended up returning mine and will probably look at the nano or creative mp3 players. If sandisk would make a smoother scroll wheel and easier to manage media, this would be a nano-killer, but as it stands - not yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Ipod","review":"After being frustrated by Ipod, I switched to the Sansa e280 MP3 player. Did I mention you can watch videos on it? That cuts down on the tedium of those family car trips. MP3 means it works better with PCs than Macs. It features an interactive menu and colorful backlighting for use as a flashlight in the dark. Ovewrall I am very satisfied with my purchase of this MP3 player which integrates quite well with Real Networks Rhapsody 25."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to play .wav files on this unit","review":"Many will buy into the Sansa E series because of the FM recording feature, which works very well, if the recording is less than 2 hours. Sansa stores these FM (and also voice) recordings in uncompressed .wav format.Some listeners, like me, despise compression because they can hear the difference and believe that compressed audio further dumbs down an already compromised audience who have lost touch with the sound of live music. Sermon over.Anyhoo, you CAN play uncompressed .wav music files, but not if you put the music files into the MUSIC folder. The MUSIC folder only supports the compressed audio codecs MP3 and WMA.You have to drag-and-drop into the RECORD/FM or RECORD/VOICE folder. Sounds pretty dumb, eh? Sansa could have enabled WAV in the MUSIC folder, but in their finite wisdom, refuse to do so.It's a swell unit, and if you want to hear all the music that was actually recorded, use this workaround and you'll be happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"So far... not so good.","review":"So far... not so good. Bought 4g for my wife and it worked very well. Bought 8g for myself to replace a 4g m-series I had and suffice to say, I've had troubles. First It appears from the packaging that I got a refurbished model. An instruction booklet that appeared to be photocopied and no advanced instruction disc as my wife had in hers.I don't recall reading anything in fine print that said this was refurbished. Don't know if this is an Amazon problem or Sansa problem. Secondly and most importantly, After I initially added my playlists, now when I add a new one...I loose 2 or 3, the Go list pops up in the place of the missing playlist...very frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sansa e280","review":"The first unit I received from Amazon proved defective after just one day: it would not turn on. But Amazon turned it around pdq, sending a new unit before I sent the old one back.The SanDisk player looks and sounds great. With its iPod like scroll wheel, the player is easy to navigate and easy to like. Switching from one mode to another -- music, say, to FM radio -- takes some playing around or reading the Acrobat format manual. But once you get the hang of these operations, you'll be flying.So far, so good. The charge, via the USB port, seems to last the 12-15 hours promised, and the unit delivers wonderful sound.SanDisk should include an armband w the product, for those of us who like to use the unit while exercising. I bought instead the Griffin armband, and while it works well (see my review) it's ugly and bulky, unlike the Sansa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes Forever To Boot Up","review":"When this unit is loaded at, or near capacity, it takes about 5 minutes (not exaggerating) to power up. This is true each time the unit is powered up, regardles of whether any changes have been made to the content on the unit. I called customer support, and was told that this is expected behaving because \\"8 GB is a lot of storage and it takes a long time to go through it.\\" I got the same answer from tech 1 and tech 2.Once the machine finally powers up, it has a pretty good interface and decent sound quality, and I like being able to see the device as an external hard drive in windows. I would keep it if it wasn't so slow powering up.I'm going to give the Zen V Plus a chance when it's 8 GB unit ships in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"easy to figure out. easy to use, although I haven't used the video function yet, the radio works greats and the songs sound really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I was going to buy an I Pod ...

The 8G of memory sold this player to me as I have way more mp3 files than it can hold, but did not want a hard drive type player. My only problems with the unit are that I don't like the headphones, and windows media player does not always want to auto sync right with it once the memory is full, unless I manually delete files first. I bought koss portapro headphones for it and the sound quality I now get amazes me compared to the old walkman type players I have had. I didn't buy the ipod simply because of it's much higher price and now I am glad I saved the money. I would have given a 5 star rating if I considered the headphones even usable."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERRRRYYYY Upsetting!","review":"At first i was extremely happy with this product, but now it SUCKS!

Even though the likes of Napster, Rhapsody and Yahoo Music declare that any of the e200 series players work with their services, it does not. This defeats the very reason why I picked the e280, to hold a lot of subscription music for my trips to the gym.The player seems to work okay for your own MP3 music, but don't even consider this lemon for holding anything more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor software","review":"This product works only with Microsoft Media Player which is a very poor software, nothing for the real music fan.I have tested the sansa e280 in my office when it came and it worked despite all the problems with windows media player. But then I wanted to connect to my computer at home and it was blocked absolutely. I tried everything (uninstall and install again), but without success. Today I went to a computer expert of our lab, but after some trials he gave up. So the Sansa e280 seems to be rather useless because of its close connections to Microsoft.The update of the firmware solved this problem, but the software for upload is still very poor: let the Chinese do it ! Used the Media Monkey which is much better than the Microsoft Mediaplayer, but still not logical enough.The memory size is too small for a music freak, 32 Gb would be more appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT mac compatible","review":"I knew the sync software wouldn't work on a mac, but i had expected to be able to drag-n-drop my music and video onto it in data mode. But this won't show up at all, not even as a drive or storage device.Probably works great, but if you have a mac, it doesn't work at all so i had to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I-pod it aint...","review":"I am a guy with 3 Ipods in the house. I wanted to be the one hold out against the wife and kids Stepford devotion to the Ipod. I had hoped this Sansa would have been the fly in their ointment, but after a month with this monstrosity I have to admit, the Ipod would have been money better spent. I am a PC guy to the core and I really want to love anything not mac, but really this Sansa e280 is just badly done. Menu navigation is horrendous. If they want to save this thing, they should copy the Ipod format~NOW. The nano 8 gb model was $50 more than this e280 at the time I bought it. Considering that the Sansa accesories are so badly done, hard to find and expensive I regret not buying the Ipod nano. The first purchase of accesories offsets any savings with the base player. Throw in the nightmare menus and it is clear the Ipod is money better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY-SCREEN WILL BREAK!!","review":"I had the e 280 for 5 weeks. I made the mistake of putting it in a backpack (in its case). The inner screen broke, the warranty does not cover physical damage and San Disk won't repair it!

Needed something to take to the climbing gym. It had to sound good, hold a decent number of files, and have good battery life. This unit cannot compete with the Nano for sleekness and sex appeal, but it's a nice looking unit on its own terms. The front is plastic and the back metal. it has good heft to it, but it's still light. The display is fantastic, and the player is easy to operate. Still haven't cracked the manual and doing just fine, thank you. It sounds really good. My tastes vary from Motorhead, to Flaming Lips, to Chopin, Sublime, and Astrud Gilberto. The player sounds good on all of them.So, in the end I have this to say to all of you shopping for a flash MP3: Don't be and iDiot and rush for the iPod w/o giving this contender a try. It's cheaper, looks good, and holds more music/$."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing I've bought in a long time","review":"I've owned mine for about a year now.

But I'm getting \\"old\\" so maybe it's just me!?I use mine mostly in my truck. The sound quality is pretty good. It gets used frequently and not charged often. It sits in there all day and over night. I have a hard case for it because if you read any of my other reveiws I'm not the most carefull guy. So yes I droped it a couple of times, in the case. I think I've had this almost 8 months or so, it still works well. It's a good value. So I would recomend a sansa product to soemone that didn't want to spen the big bucks on Ipod.

I agree with the other reviewers saying it's slow to boot up, load playlists, navigate around, and the interface could use some work, but overall it wasn't that bad. Then last week all of a sudden, the headphone jack wasn't working properly. When I pushed the headphone plug in halfway, the left plays but not the right, and when I pushed the headphone plug in all the way, the right plays but not the left. So, I guess depending on whichever ear is your favorite, you plug in the cord accordingly. How annoying.It's really irritating because I bought a Sansa thinking that it would for sure outlast an iPod, and it didn't. 'Tis a sad day..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Con-Fuzed and Ticked Off","review":"I pre-ordered the 8GB Sansa Fuze and didn't receive any promotional microSD. But that's the least of my concerns. I find the product -- which doesn't ship with any media converter software -- is throwing all types of general fault errors when trying to remove tracks. What's worse is I can't even register the player on Sansa's web site, making support an issue. Perhaps Sansa should build support around a new product before releasing it.

My player is working fine for now but my son's player has gone into \\"white screen\\" mode and I have not been able to find a solution on the SanDisk site or on the Internet. When I contacted Amazon customer service by email they refused to accept the defective unit back because it is beyond \\"the 30 day\\" limit. A call to the Amazon service rep was a bit more helpful. The rep was very pleasant and connected me via conference call to a SanDisk technician. The technician could not solve the problem of the \\"white screen\\" either. He told me to email my Amazon invoice to SanDisk Support. I am still waiting for a reply. Hopefully, this story will have a happy ending. In the meantime, my recommendation would be to find another player until SanDisk can fix this problem and the problems related by other owners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had in mind","review":"The SanDisk Sansa may be fine for some people but I was disappointed in three things: 1) The FM radio reception was so poor that it would not even pick up stations that come in loud and clear on my car radio. It would pick up a few local stations that I had no interest in. 2) The transfer of MP3 files to the device was unnecessary complicated. I succeeded (evidently) in transferring 2 GB of MP3 files to the device but none of them showed up on the Sansa screen nor in Windows Explorer. The various preloaded folders are a real annoyance and cannot be deleted. Why not just allow one to drag and drop MP3 files the way one does with a flash drive? 3) JPEG images have to go through some sort of processing that vastly reduces their resolution.

I've now owned my sansa for 6 months and can't describe to you how frustrating it has been. The settings reset themselves. It started out that way, which wasn't a huge deal. But then it started charging instead of connecting. Then I would get a blank screen instead of startup and have to revert to factory settings. Then Rhapsody (which I subcribe to) stopped recognizing it as connected. Now I can't get any computer to recognize it. Tech support has been anything but helpful, they just keep repeating the same script. The solutions found online have not worked for me.My advice: do a search for Sansa trouble shooting, or sansa e280 help. You might think twice before spending money on this garbage.

The only drawback I could find to reasonably critique is the on/off and navigation buttons all are a bit too small for my fingers. I press stop/pause now by pressing on the screen near the button. Sometimes when in my car and disconnecting the Sansa from the Griffin FM Transmitter, I turn the Sansa off with the tip of my car key.Other than the navigation buttons and the on/off button, I find the Sansa far more desirable than the iPods and I've been looking at them ever since the big show started.I also purchased an 8GB storage card from SanDisk for my digital camera.

It honestly is a pretty decent mp3 player, small and nice. the screen got a little dusty but i'm sure i can fix that, i just have to get around to doing that...the negative, I actually had to use tech support b/c all of my music somehow disappeared even though there was 500 songs on there, and this was within the week that i received it. I should check if i still have that problem. maybe it was just mine but overall i still think it's a pretty good mp3 player, practical, compact, classy looking (i like blue and black) and it's easy to use... oh and the price is excellent"},{"rating":"2","title":"Total satisfaction","review":"I shopped many places, locally and online to try to find the best deal possible. Through Amazon.com is where i found my SanDisk e280. at only 64.98 Including shipping it truly is a great deal. The ease of use, sound qaulity (provided your downloads are top qaulity, I edit all my music)and all the options makes it a great deal. The battery life is awsome, true to 18hrs also the loading of music couldn't be easier, click and drag. I initially loaded 175 songs and the transfer time was about 1 minute. Plug and play, my car stereo never sounded better. only 2 drawbacks, get the protector case cause the screen does scratch easily and a rare freeze up of the unit no big deal power down and up and your right back where you left off. I highly recommend this unit...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, bad software","review":"This little MP3 player offers good sound, but after a year or two, the software gets corrupted and it becomes difficult to navigate the menus.

Even if it offers superior sound, what good is it if you can't access your music/content?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The refurbished e280 just did not work","review":"The ffirst problem was that it said it was full after 81 songs (which it's supposed to hold around 2000) and then it got corrupted and wouldn't even turn on. All of these problems occurred within the first 8 hours of owning it. I then had to pay for shipping to get the item replaced, and I'm still waiting...I've spent almost as much as a brand new one at this point, and am not sure I will ever have a working product. I would not recommend a refurbished sansa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of trash","review":"This product worked ok for a few months. Then I started having problems with connecting to the computer with both XP and Vista on different PCs. Error message: USB device not recognized. This was with updated firmware. Search on Google revealed many complaints with this issue with no real solution other than the product or wire is defective.Also it had trouble renewing download rights with Rhapsody when it was able to connect to the computer, it often took 3 or more tries to get that to work properly.Then the earphone jack stopped working correctly, there were crackling noises and one of the head phones would not work unless the jack were twisted just the right way.Oh and let's not forget that the crystal glass surface developed scratches after a few months of nominal use.I am now back to Ipod and will never purchase another Sandisk product again. I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked it so much we bought 2","review":"My wife wanted a music player but not an iPod. A friend recommended the SanDisk and an Internet search reinforced it. She has been very happy with it...clear sound, good bass, easy to use, holds plenty of music, durable so far.

It holds all my music (8 gigs) and is very user friendly. I was happily surprised that it has an fm radio on it and you can record from the radio. Also it has a voice recorder. I looked at several models and didn't find one that had so many options and was so easy to use as well as priced so unexpensive for what you get. I saw someone elses review where they complained that it took a long time to turn on (5min). Mine turns on in 5 seconds.

So far, this unit has been a fun little player.I like the radio feature and how you can autofill your presets.I plan to expand the capacity via a microSD card when I get the chance.The only things I'd suggest are to buy a cover to protect the screen, which scratches easily, and to remember to charge the unit BEFORE you use it, per the instructions.I like just about every feature of this player has to offer, except for the way SanDisk handles playlists. Adding and deleting music via WMP is a breeze and the included utility makes it simple to add pictures and movies...Would I buy this player again? Heck Yea!Peace,JW"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always at my side!!!","review":"I bought this little guy last February and it has seldom left my side. It works great with Rhapsody music service.

It would be nice if you could drag and drop other playlist formats on to the Sansa (Realplayer, MusicMatch etc.)without having to do Sync.- The blue control wheel is has a little flimsy feel. I have 1750 songs on my player and it takes a lot of spins of the wheel to get to a song in the mid alphabet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sold my iPod, Bought this, Love It","review":"Here are the pros and cons of this player:Pros+ works with Rhapsody subscription service (iPod doesn't) --- huge improvement over the time it takes to download \\"free\\" tunes from Limewire, etc ...+ awesome battery life -- can't believe I put up with the weak battery on my nano+ lightweight, easy to handle, great screen+ includes FM radio+ price is well worth it compared to ipodCons- flywheel / user interface not as smooth as iPod, but still goodI'll try to update this review as I continue to work with this device but overall, I'm a fan, especially when it's paired with a subscription music service. no idea why apple doesn't have a subscription service, but they just lost a customer here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best MP3 yet...","review":"I've owned about a half dozen players so far. I was toting around a Zen Vision M but found that I did not need all that much space and it is heavy. When I saw the Sansa 8GB I figured I would give it a shot. I mostly listen to podcasts and some music and rarely movies. The first thing I did was add a 2 gig SD but found that the player needs to refresh every time it is turned off if a card is inserted. My solution was to load the 8 gigs with music and podcasts and add some movies to the SD card which I do not leave in the player. Battery life is excellent especially if you stick with audio. GUI is very intuitive. I always toss the included ear buds in favor of some good Sony's so I can not comment on those. When I saw I could get the player for $115 I ordered and am very pleased with it, in fact I have not touched the Zen since this arrived a month ago. The only thing I miss about the Zen is it's ability to progressively speed up when fast forwarding through long audio files."},{"rating":"2","title":"BETTER THAN THE ipod","review":"work great i owned another one but I need bigger memory so I got this one love it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it to me","review":"When I first got this product I thought it was very good but now that I've had 2 of them fall apart on me I've changed my mind. I didn't realize how bad it really was until I bought a different brand. It freezes if you skip more than a few songs, It doesn't shuffle well at all, the wheel became difficult to turn on both of them, and if you don't pause it before you turn it off it will not go back to the same song that you last played. These are just a few of the issues that I can think of at the moment.The only reason I took a chance on buying a second one is because I was under the impression that Sansa worked the best with Rhapsody. Eventually someone advised me that the new Sony Walkman works well with it so I gave it a try and I love it. I will never purchase another Sansa product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"first it was ok","review":"its a nice mp3 player, but the description fails to mention that it has to \\"refresh\\" data each time you unplug it. and even though it can hold 2000 songs i could never get above 500. now it doesnt want to have ANY songs playing on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birthday Present","review":"Received this present in time even though Hurricane Ike was imminent.

The earphones were defective. One side didn't work. Two calls to SanDisk were fruitless. They said the earphones were an accessory and not covered under warranty. But if they could find some they would send them. That was 7 weeks ago and no response despite another call getting the same response. The earphones came with the player, had Sansa name on them and are needed to use the player. So I bought another set of earphones.

Everyone who sees it wants one. Even people who own iPods have said they prefer my e280. The thumbwheel makes it very fast and easy to access menus and adjust volume.

It was alright but it's just a cheap copy of an ipod with less features, performance and space. Not only that the click wheel is complete crap for those of you that are used to the awesomeness and accuracy of the IPOD wheel. This thing also crashed alot with only half the drive full of music and 1 music video on it. I would not buy one of these again it's IPOD all the way from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dislike the Sansa e280","review":"The graphics and equalizer function on this unit is very good. However, the system is not user friendly. The installation CD would not run. The player cannot be recognized by my system. The connections are not compatible to most other devices; i.e., camera, and cannot download pictures other than those already downloaded to your computer. There is no AC adapter; the buttons surrounding the SanDisk Sansa e280's scrollwheel is difficult to press; photos and video must go through conversion with bundled software; the expansion slot can be used with music only, not photos or other media or data; and recordings are made only in WAV. For an advanced type of player (as advertised \\"advanced MP3\\") previus models have more to offer. I am disappointed in this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST CHUCK IT UP AS ANOTHER MP3 JUNK!","review":"I purchased this Sansa MP3 player on May 14 2007 and unlike the Creative and Philips that I had and returned them.

(And my mom, sister, and boyfriend have also all bought one now based on my recommendation!)But what has really impressed me was, I recently I bought a new computer, and the computer wouldn't \\"see\\" my Sansa. I sent an e-mail to Sandisk customer service, and within an hour I had a reply from a REAL PERSON (this was not a form e-mail that picked 2 keywords out of my question and responded with worthless canned information), and the rep even asked me to respond to let her know if what she told me to do had worked.

You can use media player to organize your music or just drag and drop. I uploaded pictures and a movie onto it just to test and while you have to use their converting software it really was not a big deal. I recommend getting better earbuds. While these are not that bad I think the sound would be much better with higher quality ones. I also recommend getting the travel kit and use the plastic screen saver & leather holder. It cushions falls and protects the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money","review":"I have avoided the i-pod because of the battery issues. With a user replaceable battery, the Sansa was a lot more attractive to me. I have had mine for over a year and a half, and the battery still keeps over 18 hours of charge - not so of the i-pod.The only reason I haven't given the e-280 a five star rating is because of the voice record feature. It is way too easy to activate while I am holding it and navigating through menus (the button is on the side where you hold the mp3 player).I purchased a charging unit that uses 4 AA batteries and an FM modulator that also charges the player. Although neither are made by Sansa, they have work very well with the player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Love It!!!! Couldn't be better.","review":"Absolutely love it!! Great features -- just make sure that you read the instructions first, especially on download format.

Worth every penny I spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Product Has Limited Functionality","review":"There are two versions of the e280 - v1 and v2. v2 is NOT an upgrade but is in fact a downgrade and one that is not pointed out to the consumer. You are no longer permitted to switch your USB mode from MTP to MSC mode meaning your device no longer doubles as a USB drive! You are also locked into using Windows Media Player and DRM only mp3s. What an upgrade!Aside from the rant, the product is a phenomenal piece of technology. I only wish I wasn't deceived into buying a newer, lower version of a fantastic product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Little Device","review":"I compared the sansa with I-Pod and it was close when it came to options/function. However, the Sansa won hands down when it came to flexibility. I've loaded it with videos and it works flawlessly. I've sync'd it with Rhapsody and have over 2000 songs and several music channels that I've picked loaded on this device. The music channels update automatically everytime I open Rhaphsody. I love this online service and this device. The two are a perfect combo. Battery life is terrific. You won't be sorry if you choose this over the I-Pod.Good Luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost 5 stars...","review":"I absolutely love this player. I only use it for mp3s, so I can't comment on the FM tuner. This is really a 5 star item, except for one thing. The Sandisk Media Converter program is TERRIBLE! I tried to load some video, but got an error msg about it needing to be converted. There was a link to download the SMC, so I did. I made sure to get the latest version that was compatible for my unit. Great. I then tried to convert an .avi file. It started, and made it all the way to 50%, then it hung. I tried a .wmv file. Same thing. Tried a .mov file. Same thing. In fact, every file I tried did the same thing. When I contacted Sandisk, they recommended that I should re-download/reinstall the SMC. I did, and you guessed it. Same thing. grrrr. So, if you want to use it for mp3s only, it can't be beat. If you wanna do any video, you'd better try another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sansa","review":"I am enjoying my new Sansa. It is lightweight, easy to operate.

I've owned the SanDisk 2 GB mp3 player for about a year and a half. I wanted to upgrade to a larger GB capacity and decided to go with SanDisk once again. The menus are extremely easy to navigate through and I find that transferring music onto the device to be a breeze. The FM tuner comes in great, its small and built hardy. The LSD screen is very nice looking and displays pictures and movies perfectly. Even though this unit is identical to my 2 GB version, I was more than happy to invest another 150.00 to SanDisk and keep an old friend around.

Yet the focus remains true to what a reader would expect.As for the picture quality, it's as good as any other commercial video. A reviewer did make negative comments about it, and I did find that to be the case a few years ago when I inadvertantly bought an illegal copy from a major retailer.

I ended up doing my honors thesis on Vietnam War Poetry, using this book as a standard by which I judged others. Most war poetry is very boring because it represents a heroic look back in attempt to glorify war. This book is nothing like that it is an incredible adventure into the realities of war and its effects on the psyche. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK AND ANYTHING ELSE BY KOMUNYAKAA.

A young Adolph Hitler, juts out of the trenches, struggles to find himself through art and politics. Just when he finally seems to have found himself a break as an artist, other factors/coincidences come into play to eventually disuade him from painting.The relationship between the cocky Rothmann, who really tries to help Hitler succeed, and the angry, insecure Hitler was done extremely well. This is almost a five star film, but Cusack's acting seemed plastic, which detracted from the overall potentially powerful impact that this film should have on its viewers. Still, it's one of those that will no doubt linger on in my mind for some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Art plus politics equals power. Right on.

Coming from New Zealand, it wasn't that often you saw many by this fabulous Swedish duo.The only thing that I would've liked from this release, in order to make me give it 5 stars instead of 4, is the fact that the video came out before the release of the other singles from the greatest hits album. \\"You Don't Understand Me\\" is an excellent video (one of my top 5, actually), but I still would've liked to had seen \\"June Afternoon\\" and \\"She Doesn't Live Here Anymore\\" on it as well.It still rates highly on my you-must-have-this list.

The conversations between what are supposed to be elected officials sounded like two street corner hoods talking about a fight on Pay Per View. The characters were not brought that much to life as much as their circumstances and situations. I believe that the effort of the THREE different authors should be applauded, but even for \\"Ghetto Fiction\\" this work lacks what is needed to keep the reader enthralled.

What is the point of the book. A fun story is legitimate. Maybe some interesting technology. Colorful characters. Better if there is philosophical or moral dilemmas, or some sort of analogy.

I am a HUGE fan of the 7 part manga series and expected this to be the same. However, I was wrong. While this DVD has an interesting plotline and the same three main characters: Subaru, Seishiro, and Hokuto, it chops up the original story from the manga and distorts it in a weird way.Now, I did like some of the elements of it (example: the relationship between Mirai and the older man.

I watched both movies and was amazed. It was so awesome! The animation wasn't as good as X, but that's because these movies are older than X (Movie 1 1992; Movie 2 1994). I agree with what people have said about Subaru-kun's voice, to wimpy. And Subaru-kun is not a wimp. I have downloaded the first 5 volumes of the TB manga so the movies do seem to make a little more sense, dealing with Subaru-kun and Seishiro. I suggest any X fan buy this DVD, it is very awesome. I just wish it was longer *sigh*. Tokyo Babylon is now my 2nd favorite anime (X being no. 1) I love CLAMP and all of their works.

Oh well, there is the Japanese track with subtitles, right? Not quite. The Japanese voice acting seem decent enough but the subtitles are outrageous. The timing is wrong half the time (the text appears before someone speaks or long after they finish speaking) and even with my minimal knowledge of Japanese I can tell they left a lot that was said unsubtitled or partly subtitled. Worse than that- they sometimes added dialogue that was not in the Japanese script. What makes the makers of this DVD think they know better than the script writers of the OVA? Their job is to translate, not rewrite the script.The video and audio quality is also unimpressive- not what you would expect to see on a DVD.Overall- quite bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"What about tha eye?","review":"I really loved this show.

Do you make music or do you make videos? I doubt very strongly we would even be talking about this \\"album\\" if it weren't for her steamy bodacious video, in which Shakira, like Mariah Carey and Gwen Stephani, looks directly at the camera while writhing sensuously in 30-weight motor oil (Yuck!). Okay, she has an interesting voice and if she were serious about it, she might be a stylish artist with hit songs. But she wants to be TOO SEXY FOR HER SHIRT, and she just ends up being another flash in the pan video vixen. She even comments that she \\"wants to win an Oscar\\". Not a Grammy, a freaking Oscar! I especially HATE the part of the video where she \\"acts\\" like she's playing the guitar solo, which is offensive to every musician who practices hours upon hours to get good.

I really love Shakira since her first on stage performance of Donde Estas on Siempre en Domingo with Raul Velasco, but she has really changed a lot. She was this really shy-talented woman that produced songs that would have you standing up dancing. Oral Fixation vol.2 is soooo mellow and sad that it's depressing to know that she went from pop/dance/arabic to early 80's American rock. Shakira, you are columbian, please stop trying to be somebody your not. Your songs will not change who you are inside, maybe just your 'appearance' but thats it.

I listened it to it twice. Normally I can love an album on first listen, very rarely will I get bored of it on a second listen. Nope, not with this one.

Add that to the songs already recorded in OF2 and you get an awesome record. OF2 was good as it was, but I always felt something was missing. I know now what was it: Shakiras unique latino flavour! Hips dont lie adds a whole new dimension to this record. This isnt Mimi's effort to get more money out of her fans.

Those two songs were the reason I bought this CD for my wife. It wasn't until 30 days later after receiving the CD that my wife mentioned those 2 tracks were not on the CD; therefore I cannot return or exchange this CD for the correct version anymore.

If you've watched Shakira grow since day one, then you probably won't enjoy this album, because this doesn't even compare to the old Shakira.If you're a non-Spanish speaking American Kelly Clarkson, Avril Lavigne, Madonna fan, then you'll probably enjoy this album. I mean, with all due respect, I only like one song on ths album (Don't Bother), and that's because it reminds me of \\"Si Te Vas,\\" a song featured on Donde Estan los Ladrones.

No, a book about stereotypes.","review":"When I found this book in the library searching for information for a paper on transvestites, I thought that this would be the perfect book, based on the title. I was terribly wrong and disappointed. The book analyzes cross-dressers and defines the sub-categories as if it were decribing a species of animals! \\"This means this\\" and \\"by this age the cross-dresser will have realized that.\\" I was disgusted by it!It seems to me that the author had no true interest in what he was writing about, he was just doing a scientific study. Looking at the subjects of his other books, I found no pattern whatsoever, which leads me to believe this was merely another piece of research he was getting paid for. It was not about a group of individuals, it was about a clan or herd; a \\"type\\" of people. Not at all a good source of information.Not every crossdresser follows the patterns that Talamini sets for them. They are individuals; people, not a species."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for Northwest Maritime enthusiasts","review":"Jim Gibbs is simply the guru of Northwest maritime history.

I have yet to find an instructor that cues better than Karen Voight. I love that the energy sprints (7 total) get progressively longer, rather than shorter, as you go through the workout. Plus, the lower body toning section is at the very beginning, which makes this video even more challenging. She offers different variations of the exercises so that you may choose to stay low impact, or as you become more fit, start adding in more difficult moves. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"this is by far the best work out video i have done. it gives you a complete workout and you can see visible changes in your body like the next day.

She'll cue you as she's doing the new movement, so she's already switched by the time she gets around to cueing you. Very frustrating.On the plus side, it's a decent aerobic workout, if you can deal with the awkwardness and the cueing deficiencies.For better instructors, Gin Miller, Gay Gasper, Kathy Smith, Keli Roberts, Christi Taylor (if you're an advanced stepper, Christi Taylor is the best!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like that it works your whole body","review":"I have a few Karen Voight Dvds and she's a good trainer. She works your body from head to toe in this one. You can do the moves with a step or just on the floor. The sprints are challenging. I wouldn't call the weight section challenging to me, but I do most of my weight sculpting with Jari Love and this isn't even in the same range as Jari. The weight section is okay. The ab workout is good as are all the ab portions of Karen Voights workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mother Gift","review":"I got this for my mom for Christmas and i cant wait till she sees it.

She played the sound game. She always got the answer correct, but 60-70% of the time the bear still said it was incorrect. The rest of the family tried it and it did the same thing. Therefore, this is not a learning toy and it is no fun.

I took the thing back to the store and got a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea, bad toy","review":"I have to agree with the first two comments. We went to check it out after my 4 year old saw it on TV and liked it because the bear had glasses just like him. The product seemed decent in the store, so we bought it.

I bought this for my son last Christmas. At the time he was 5. His little heart was broken when he tried to talk to it and it would not respond properly. I exchanged it for another Koby, and it had the same problem! The only way we were able to get him to respond properly was to have no background noise, and to speak into his microphone around his collar. But even then it worked 50% if the time save your money... it's not worth buying.

They follow the instructions, wait for him to stop talking, but he still doesn't seem to work properly...and try getting him to be quiet! Supposedly you can tell him \\"Good night Koby\\" and he'll yawn and go to sleep.

I know it had to rhyme and whatnot, but this whole poem/song/story is icky to me. there is a line in it about loving you no matter how much you squirm or something equally blech. even where it isn't sort of inappropriate, it is sickningly shmaltzy and when my child takes this golden book from the bookcase, i have to hold back the bile, while trying to make up new words for the charachters to say. and the illustrations are nasty. the people look like marionettes, there isn't much about this book I can recommend.

Its about a fathers story of his daughters life and how he sees it. It starts off when she comes home from the hospital and ends at her wedding.

I was contacted by Publishing Co Nelson and told I did not win the contest but if I would give more details to my story I would be considered for a new book they were puting out. If my story was picked they would contact me. Well my story is in here, (word for word) under a fake name. I was never told it even made it into the book.

Now I wish I had spent the extra money for a better chair. The other reviews failed to mention that it creaks everytime you rock. If you aren't in just the right, usually uncomfortable, position, the creaking will wake up the baby.

You really NEED the ottoman to feel balanced-especially when holding a squirming little munchkin. Otherwise, it's great and well worth the money.

I am about to have my second child and looking to replace all the cushions. I really only used the chair for breast feeding for the first year with my first child and the cushions looked so bad(sagging/flat) after that I didn't want to make it apart of my regular living room/den furniture. The ottoman- I tended to put my feet in the same area each time I used it and now the indention is permanent and no longer comfortable to use. Same with the seat cushion it's no longer comfortable. After looking at prices to replace the cushions (around $200) I think it would be a better investment to spend the money on a chair with better cushions. Instead I am looking into making my own replacement cushions. Just make note that if you buy this chair to intend to use for more than a few months the cushions will no longer cushion after ONLY A FEW SHORT MONTHS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing & Heartbreaking","review":"This powerful, superb book is peopled with a sampling of the great and graceful artists who have been swept into eternity by AIDS.

Lon Chaney does a performance that is beyond words. In all the other versions (Claude Rains, and Herbert Lom) the story is scrambled and changed. This one is the REAL story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lon Chaney's Finest Hour","review":"Despite a history of production troubles and extensive re-editing, \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" (1925) has survived as a landmark of the silent era - thanks largely to Lon Chaney's classic performance in the title role. It's a stylish melodrama with serial-style thrills and some genuinely horrific moments. The DVD \\"ultimate edition\\" features plenty of extras and a memorable Carl Davis score. Remakes come and go, but the original reigns supreme."},{"rating":"1","title":"how to ruin a great movie","review":"The Phantom of the Opera is a great movie. My only bone to pick is the horrendous score in the alpha video edition. TPotO is a dark tale, it's a horror story for crying out loud and the score is happy, repetitive, and inappropriate. It sounds as if someone took a greatest classical hits cd and slapped on the movie. I can't complain too much because of the price, but still someone could have put a little thought and effort into it. The picture is amazing though. I enjoy the fullscreen version and the original black and white with the color masquerade scene.bottom line: great movie, but find the best version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robbed From The Image DVD","review":"Whoever put this out has NO shame. It is a direct rip of the Dave Shepard/Kino/Blackhawk Films/Image DVD including the copyrighted music score! Which means the picture quality is the same but you get no extras. Support the people who actually do the work and get either the Image or Image/Milestone DVD and avoid these sleazy rip-offs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply priced for a good reason","review":"This 1980s GOODTIMES videotape of the widely available Lon Chaney silent classic \\"Phantom\\" is dubbed from an unrestored b&w; print (no color flourishes here) in the LP mode-- a problematic speed on many VCRs. Audio track is linear only. NOT HiFi.If a fine quality VHS is your goal, recommended is the KINO edition ofPHANTOM OF THE OPERA(1925). Restoration includes original color footage (in spots) and an excellent music score."},{"rating":"1","title":"repulsive musical score","review":"It seems the other reviewers have no respect for the silent screen. The rock atrocity that accompanies this version of the film should be locked away in the sewers of Paris and never heard again. It is total garbage and utterly ruined a classic film. I turned the sound completely off after only a few minutes. Am going to purchase another version of \\"Phantom\\" that doesn't have a score that is so pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good DVD transfer","review":"This title is a good buy for all fans. The correction of adapting to the origianl frame rate of 20fps helps the film not look so \\"comical\\" or \\"Keystone Cops\\" like. The movment of characters onscreen actually looks 'natural' for the first time since the film was probably made (although there still are some speeded-up sequences here and there). The score, while not fabulous, works overall and does not distract the viewer at all. This version is color tinted throughout and the ballroom scene has been fully colorized. But you can always switch your DVD player to black and white mode if it bugs you too much. Don't expect any transfer miracles in picture-quality, but it's an improvment over all VHS versions that I've seen. There's a nice \\"making-of\\" story on the jacket and some behind the scenes images on disk, but no other extras. A commentary would have been nice. But for 1925, this film really holds-up well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silent is golden","review":"Silent horror movies are probobly some of the scariest movies of all time. This movie is really cool, its got the master of horror Lon Chaney in his finest role. This film is very eerie, its filmed in stark black and white, and features some very scary scenes. The only problem that I have is that every copy of the movie that I got has absolutly no music at all, the phantom would be alot more menecing with a chilling music score. Its very hard to watch a totally silent movie. So, if you decide to get this movie... or any silent movie at that, be shure it has some kind of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very very Nostalgic","review":"I saw this movie at the Symphony. Utah Symphony was playing... if i remember correctly... the score from the broadway production while they projected the film onto a huge screen at the front. I loved it! but!!!

I warn you do not waste your money on it. Unles you like these types of movies. The newest version is a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL! THE AUDIO IS ALL WRONG!","review":"Be careful! This DVD is a cheap reproduction of the original. The audio is alllll messed up. During the creepy and spooky moments which truly make the Phantom of the Opera a masterpiece, cheerful classical music DESTROYS the tone. This is not the version for anybody who appreciates the musical effect in movies, or for anybody who even has a t.v. with sound for that matter. Find another copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Phantom on the market","review":"The Phantom of the Opera - The Ultimate Edition (1925 Original Version and 1929 Restored Version) by Milestone and sold by Amazon is the best restoration of the movie on the market, even superior to the faulted Blu -Ray. The 1929 Restored version features the Carl Davis orchestral score (prepared for British television), which is not to be missed. Unfortunately there is some \\"ghosting\\" on the print but the color (yes it's tinted) and sound is excellent, and looks great on a big screen Hi-Def tv. Hoping someone will issue a Blu-Ray with the Carl Davis score. I wonder why Universal has not issued a version?I took one star off the rating for the \\"ghosting\\" problem, but silents don't get much better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Cheap Rip Off!!!","review":"This Delta disc is nothing but a bad rip of the old Lumivision laserdisc. Which means the picture won't be as clean as either of the Image DVD versions now available. I love the movie poster that comes with it, but it is a crying shame about how they just flat out STOLE their video source from another company. This might be part of the reason this edition is not available anymore....."},{"rating":"2","title":"FILM PlAYS BETTER WITH MUSIC ADDED","review":"I have seen the silent Phantom of The Opera version many times over the years and i much prefer it with an added musical score. I swear the sets we see for tHe Paris opera house are the same as the ones later used in Tod Browning's Dracula (starring Bela Lugosi). As for the plot very well crafted. acting is very good (though the pretty lady who screams when she first sees the Phantom unmasked is a little too expressive). Superb makeup job by Chaney on Chaney."},{"rating":"2","title":"The original Phantom of the Opera","review":"Perhaps the most famous horror movie of all time, and still eerie enough today to give you goose-bumps, Julian's \\"Phantom\\" stars legendary spook Lon Chaney as the titular musical maniac. Not only did the film reinforce Chaney's huge celebrity status, it virtually solidified Universal Studios' reputation as purveyors of bone-chilling horror fare. Just watch the infamous unmasking of Chaney as he sits at the organ in the film's climax and you'll see why this creepy tale has inspired so many remakes, spoofs, and rip-offs, not to mention Weber's long-running musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest movies of all time","review":"The phantom of the opera with Lon Chaney is one of the greatest films ever made. Although not scary by todays standards the movie is riveting and has a great storyline. I would recommend watching this movie late at night before bed with the lights turned out as it would add to the enhancement that the movie produces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too bad it's out of print","review":"I've been collecting little Golden Guides since I was a young child. I've had 2 copies of this excellent book, both of which were stolen. I look at this book from an anthropological viewpoint.

Lance keeps the techno-babble terms understandable without seeming too blase. While this is definately a futuristic thriller, some of the technologies he mentions or uses seem as if he has had personal experience with them. I can not help but wonder how much of the conspiracy he mentions is real and how far away we are from the commercial use of some of these 'Toys'.

I am in the 10th grade, the same age Moshe was when he began writing, so I could really relate to some of the problems he faced.

Scy fy makes lots of very low budget movies that I find tolerable and ok but this one is hard to watch. I disagree about vanessa angel and the rest of the cast , the did a fine job actually with what they had, but the effects for this era are very poor. If this was a 1980's cgi effort , then you'd say it was fine but this is really poor. If you want to see some awesome sabertooth cgi then check out 'walking with prehistoric beasts' or the sci fi show 'primeval'."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a good movie","review":"I dunno why everybody is saying this wasn't that great of a movie.

Typical monster movie schlock.

I would rather be sick than try to watch Vanessa Angel try to emote. Most of the plot is a by product of only slightly better horror movies. This is the case of \\"its so bad, its horrible.\\" And I really mean its horrible. The plot is horrible, the acting sub-par, and the sabertooth would look better if I substituted my fat house cat. I really mean that. But, Sabertooth can be fun at times, like when they finally kill the sabertooth.

Also there is another group of people around the area in which the sabertooth roams around. Bad to the extreme....the pits...this movie has crap written all over it from the word go. My only interest in this movie is actor Josh Holloway (Cold Heart) who plays Trent....Holloway in one of his pre-ABC'S LOST moments....he's bad in this but hey man, he needed the money. Also starrying Jonathan Rhys-Davies in another crappy sci-fi movie....man this guy needs to pick better stuff.The special effect for the sabertooth tiger is hilarious and the acting along with dialouge delivery is really bad and hurts the eardrums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Jurassic Park or Ice Age instead","review":"Jurassic Park is a good movie in which prehistoric predators are cloned, Ice Age is a good movie with CGI sabertooths. This is why SciFi should never have canceled MST3K. Basically its just another disgrace to horror/monster/scifi movies. The characters are about as bright as slasher victims are, the plot takes stupid twists, the killer animal eats way too many people for it to believably have actually killed. Bloody gory deaths, only a few characters live, the dumb blond scientist who cloned the big mean kitty goes crazy and for some reason thinks her monster will obey her and she is corrected the hard way ,blah, blah, blah blah, ( I also loved how the nerdy guy was freaking out because a cougar showed up and despite all the noise he was making, the cougar was laying down on the ground with what looked for all the world like a relaxed smile on its face)You get what I'm saying.

Detail is provided about where they come from, what the environment there is like, and general information about the temperment of that family of fish.Unfortunately there isn't always details about each individual fish.The book provides a color picture of most fish, although the quaility is sometimes lacking.

The first meeting of the hero and heroine (where he kisses her the 1st time) is just so stupid and badly executed. On top of it all, the story is boring.

If I put my baby on the pillow with the toys overhead, she is constantly wiggling until she is off the pillow and no longer under the toys. She needs to lay flat to learn to roll over. Another problem is that everytime I have to nurse her, I have to unhook the overhead gym from the pillow. I wish I would have purchased the plain boppy pillow and a different playmat for my baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully versitile toy","review":"The Boppy 5 in 1 was well worth the money I spent on it. This is the most versatile baby gym that I have ever seen. I got it for my 4th child and he loves it. He will play for 30-40 mins at 6 months that is forever! when he gets bored with a toy all we have to do is take it off and replace it with a new one. Any toy will work with this as long as you can get a ring around it. It comes with 3 toys and we added 3 more by purchasing additional links (rings). I highly recommend this as a baby gym.For a feeding pillow there is nothing like it. I bottle fed but this allowed me to have him next to me and saved my arms."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea, bad for baby","review":"i thought this was the best thing since sliced bread... boy was i wrong! the only two things this is good for is 1)the boppy pillow by itself to help support baby to sit up and 2)the toys to play with (not attached). to use this item as a play gym is not a good idea for baby... they can't move anywhere or learn to roll over. they are stuck in the pillow and always in an upright position. i actually disasembled this and only use the pillow and toys and went and bought the fisher price basic play gym (much cheeper) that is better for baby to use. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine didn't like it","review":"The boppy part is great for nursing when little, and sitting up when bigger, but the gym part was a total bust. My baby was never into it, even if he was mildly interested in the toys when I took them off. Not worth the money. Buy a plain boppy and a more interesting activity mat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I got this as a shower gift, and I do not like it as a play gym because my 3 month old son slides out of it within seconds. I tried using blankets tucked around him to hold him up into the pillow but he always would wiggle his way onto the floor with his head in between the two \\"arms\\" of the pillow. I ended up buying another playgym where he could lie safely on the floor and kick as much as he wants."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK product","review":"Just an OK product. I have a few regular boppy pillows, which I love. I didn't find a use for this. It would be way too much work to use this in place of a regular boppy and clip and unclip the top part (they're not easy to use). We do like the toys which come with it though. Don't waste your money on this product, nice idea though."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOPPY LESS","review":"Very pretty design, looks great but it's not really practical. Skip the boppy on your registry and get \\"MY BREST FRIEND\\" (nursing pillow)which can be found on the internet if you plan on nursing your baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"The tabs aren't strong enough to hold the arch","review":"Two of the fabric tabs attached to this Boppy pulled off, making it impossible to use the arch. Just get a regular Boppy and an activity mat with an arch, you'll be better off."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it, nor did baby","review":"I did not find the boppy pillow to be at all useful as a nursing pillow. We were having latch on trouble and I really needed the support. Baby would slide between me and the pillow. I ended up getting the harder to find 'my brest friend' nursing pillow, which I could not have done without. THAT pillow is awesome (it is flat and form fitting with a velcro belt). Also as a toy for baby the boppy is too awkward to lay baby in. I ended up attaching the top part to a blanket so she can lie under it. That works okay. I gave it 2 stars instead of one bcuz she ADORES the cloth blue dog rattle that came in the set. And I love it because it's washable. But that is one expensive rattle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the price","review":"I first purchased this pillow for assisting with nursing, but it was too bulky and full for the small baby. We then tried it as a pillow to prop the growing baby up and again it was so high up and bulky that my baby kept slipping off of it and crinking his neck. Needless to say we spent over $.. for something that remains in the garage now. The only use of the boppy were the toys that were dangling off of it, except the toys were better when apart from the overhang. You are better off with just a plain, large and puffy pillow for nursing and propping the baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best gift I've received!!!","review":"My son who is 6 wks old does not like laying in his portable crib. I received this as a gift and my son absolutely loves it. He will lay there for hours in his boppy pillow, sometimes he sleeps sometimes he just looks around. We haven't used the gym yet, but I'm sure we will. For the $, I think it's wise to purchase the boppy 5 in 1, than to buy just the pillow. You'll get more use out of it. I think the boppy pillow surrounds him and makes him feel comfortable. I've used it for nursing and it helped me. My arms didn't feel like they were going to fall off. My husband always asks for it when he spends time with him. This surely has been a pleaser all the way around in our family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boppies are a must for breastfeeding mothers!","review":"I love my boppy! It made breastfeeding my children so much easier, and so much more comfortable. We got the 5 in 1 thinking it would be great alternative to the playmat, but it wasn't. It's a pain to always convert the boppy into the play gym, and it's really not ideal until baby is older because the baby look so uncomfortable propped up rather than lying down. What we did was take the toys from the gym and added it to our baby's gymini. They toys are great...they are Sassy, and our baby loves them! The Boppy is also a great alternative as a support pillow when baby is learning to sit up on his/her own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this product!","review":"My baby loves this.. she will lay there and look all day if I let her! She is most attracted to the white/black side bars. The boppy pillow is a great fit for her to lay on. This isn't a 'must have' but it sure is nice and also fun to watch your little one 'ohh and goo' over it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for breastfeeding","review":"I dont breastfeed but I was going to and this worked great for the week I did. But for bottle feeding its too much hassle. And I still havent put him in the play gym part. I keep a cover on it and I think they should put vinyl or something on the back of the cover so it wont go thru to the pillow.. Once you wash the pillow it is basically ruined. And the covers should have a space for the hooks for the play bar to pull through so u dont have to take off a cover everytime your baby wants to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"looked like a good idea but....","review":"This looked like a great idea and was well reviewed. Now that my baby's had it for 3 months (baby is 4.5 months old), he has used it a total of 6-12 hours of his life.He really enjoyed it in the beginning, but tired of it quickly (in the space of 30 minutes over 3 days), and because he eats a lot and the toy-supporting arches hit me in the face when I undo them, the nursing aspect of the toy isn't really exploitable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both of us love the Boppy","review":"I love the Boppy because I find it positions my baby just right for nursing and it fits me perfectly. The baby loves the Boppy because of its zebra stripes and interesting toys and rings. He seems quite content and comfortable when sitting in it gazing at each toy in turn, and he really lights up when I shake the bars a little. He is working on reaching for objects, and I can see that he finds the boppy very inspirational. The only complaint I have is that taking the bars on and off is too annoying to make it a truly dual purpose item. At this point (5 weeks) only the baby uses the Boppy. I am considering buying another Boppy for feeding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toy bars didn't stay up","review":"It looked great ~ boppy and toys hanging overhead but the toy bars always folded forward almost to the floor. I thought maybe the toys attached to the bar were too heavy but it still collaped even with lighter toys. Bottom line ~ buy a boppy and a separate toy with hanging rattles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a regular Boppy and a separate playmat","review":"The Boppy pillow is wonderful for breastfeeding and provides good support for babies in sitting, but I hardly used the hanging toys. It was just too inconvenient to hook the arches on for only about 5 to 10 minutes of play. Then, when it was time to nurse, my Boppy wasn't readily available because I hadn't had the time to remove the arches. I'll be buying a separate playmat for my next child!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The boppy part's great,","review":"I got this before I had my daughter and it's been wonderful. I haven't used the arches too much but that's because it's too much of a pain to take them off when it's time to feed.I do use the toys from the arches all the time though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just buy the Boppy itself, and invest in a better gym","review":"I loved the Boppy pillow -- it was invaluable for the first 12 weeks or so that I nursed. After that, I didn't need the pillow so much anymore and set it up with the playgym attached. My little girl would just cry every time I tried to lay her in it though. I finally switched the toys that came with this Boppy for some different ones, and she liked it better, but she's constantly sliding off the pillow and hitting her head on the floor. Also, the links that come with this gym are terrible! It's impossible to get toys on and off of them because they're not at all flexible like other links I've tried.Do yourself a favor and buy the plain Boppy pillow but a different playgym. We have the Carter's butterfly gym and my daughter loves it. I know that the various gyms by Tiny Love are good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"good investment","review":"I received the Boppy Nursing Pillow as a gift, but found it just did not work for me. My son kept rolling toward one side or the other and the pillow kept scooting off my lap. The pockets are a nice feature though. I exchanged it for the Boppy 5 in 1 gym, which is actually useful, although I don't use it for nursing either since I've had the same problems with it. At 8 weeks old, my son stares at the 'zebra' patterned bars and bats at the 'dragon' and brightly coloured hoop. He also watches his Baby Einstein DVDs from it. The only flaws I find are 1) that it is too high and he tends to scoot down and get uncomfortable if he's active and 2) I'm having trouble finding other Sassy toys to use with it. This boppy is a much better value than the Nursing Boppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Than Meets the Eye","review":"I have purchased this as a shower gift and thought it a great idea, until I tried it myself. I was not able to use it for nursing, as it would not fit around my waist - the fact that I has recently been 9 months pregnant may have been a factor. The colors are very stimulating for baby and I thought she would like looking at it. However, one of the hard plastic toys clunked her on the head and since then she screams whenever I put her near it. I returned it and bought a regular play gym with soft, squishy toys. The Boston pillow is much better for nursing regardless of your size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't live without this pillow!","review":"I could not nurse without my Bobby. I've been using it since the day I got home. Even with a C-section, it was comfortable. I wish I had taken it to the hospital. My son is now 5 months and we can't go anywhere without it. It's been washed several times and holds up beautifully. If I had to do it again, I would get the one with the removable cover. I only gave this particular product 4 stars because the arch is not very useful. We use the pillow so much for nursing, and the arch can't be used without the pillow. Get a playmat with an arch that sits on top of it instead. But by all means get the Boppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for my little one.","review":"I received this item as a shower gift, and am not happy with it. The pillow itself is great for nursing, but my daughter hates laying in the pillow to use the toy bar, it is very uncomfortable for her and makes her cry. So her grandma sewed loops on a little quilt, and atttached the toy bar to it. Now my daughter loves playing with the toys. She is 3 1/2 months old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Advertised but a Poor Product","review":"I tried to use the Boppy as both a nursing cushion and a toy for my baby who is now 4 months old. As a nursing cushion it is not firm enough and is difficult to get in a comfortable position. I ended up buying the \\"My Best Friends\\" cushion through the hospital's lactation department and that works VERY well by offering good comfortable support for both me and the baby....You will not want to keep messing with removing the cushion from the toy. And, your baby will slump down and fall off the cushion which will just make him frustrated and unable to get at the toys.The Boppy's only saving grace is that it does come with some nice Sassy rattles which are expensive when bought individually and you can use the cushion to put your baby on his tummy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took off the toys","review":"and used it as a regular boppy.When my daughter was small enough to lay still in the boppy she couldnt reach the toys. Now that shes bigger she gets bored with them too easily and its useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tons of Fun","review":"I recently purchased a Boppy 5-in-1 fun pillow and I absolutley love having it for my baby.

I would recommend this to all. Great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT IF SHE DID NOT CRY SO MUCH!","review":"MY DAUGHTER REALLY LIKES THIS GYM-BUT THEN SHE ROLLS OUT OF IT AND SHE CRIES.

I have a smallish wrist, and the big chronographs are just to much for me. I saw this titanium watch and love the light weight and reasonably sized face. I've had it for about 2 1/2 months so far and had no problems. It keeps time as well as my old one, is super comfortable to wear and looks great (for me that's jeans and T-shirts, but it would look good with dress clothes as well). It would be nice if the hands glowed in the dark, but I knew that going in. Also, my 48 year old eyes have a bit of trouble reading the date, but that's no big deal either. Two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Titanium Band Watch","review":"This extremely light watch is quite classy and fits most occasions. It makes an extremely good gift to anyone looking for a high quality watch without paying a steep price. I've had mine for a year, and it's been worth every penny. I have always detested wearing a heavy watch, and this is my answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this watch.","review":"I have worn this watch everyday for almost 3 years. It keeps time (until time changes) to the second. The greatest feature of this watch is not mentioned in the specs. It weighs 2 ounces. Want feel the weight before you buy? Hold 10 nickels and 2 pennies in your hand, that's how much the watch weighs. Sometimes I have to feel to see if it's even on my arm. Everyone that holds it is amazed at how light it is. The weight is not an indication of low quality. This watch is a tankI'd give this watch 6 stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and attractive","review":"Light as can be. Easy on the wrists. Very nice to look at. This was an excellent choice and one of the few watches I tried that was a keeper. I hardly know I'm wearing it.Update: Several days of use have confirmed this watch is a good choice. The face isn't the largest visually, so those who want a large presentation may want to look at other options. But this watch is \\"feather light\\" -- both the watch and the band -- which means I barely notice I'm wearing it. And for me, the lightness was my #1 goal. I'm comfortable wearing this all of the time. It has stood up to water so far no problem. I tried 4 different watches including a few of the Skagens and this was the winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wont look nice after normal wear","review":"I enjoy the simple styling and feel that it has solid craftsmanship. The watch works as a watch should.Semi-false Advertising: One thing that was unexpected is that the watch must have steel internals, because it sets off metal detectors. One of the main reasons i bought this model was to avoid having to take off my watch when i go through the metal detector at work. Titanium is a non-ferrous metal that does not get picked up by metal detectors.Con: One bad thing about the watch is that within the first 24 hours of ownership i noticed that the matte finish on the band was wearing down where it touched my desk at work. This causes shiny spots in the matte finish on the band. I now have relatively low expectations for how nice the watch will look in the future after normal wear. After a week of ownership 6 of the 13 links show significant wear of the finish.I'd still recommend the watch, but with some reservations due to the poor resistance to wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this watch","review":"I have owned several of these through the years, and with everyone, it winds up getting water in the watch when it defiantly should not have. It seems to happen after the battery needs to be replaced, which leads me to believe that they do not seal properly once they have been opened.(using multiple jewelers) Seiko, will not correct, nor fix this issue with out charging in excess of $100. After hundreds of dollars spent and multiple issues I have finally given up and will spend the money on a watch that the manufacture will stand behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dependable and Good looking Watch","review":"I've had this watch for 2 years now, using for working at a railroad yard. It still looks good, the crystal has no scratches. The titanium bracelet is covered with fine scratches, but really just gives it character. Still makes for a nice dress watch.The band has held up well, and the hasp does not come loose like the Tag Heuer watches I've used in the past.The only flaw I see with this model is that the luminescent hands do not glow at all in darkness; you need some type of light source to read the hands. This really is no big deal to me as there is always at least a faint light source nearby when I need to know what time it is.A fantastic deal for a solid watch that I hope will last me several more years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perpetual Calendar doesn't work after 3 years","review":"Just be aware that the perpetual calendar may not be so perpetual after all. After 3 years the calendar in my watch didn't increment the date a couple of days. So I was off by a few days. Then it incremented the date by more than one count.The perpetual just lasted 3 years.It seems that as long as the watch is under warranty the perpetual calendar works, after that its gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"a nice wear all the time watch","review":"I could not get the stars to be selected. I would give the watch a 4/5 stars with lack of luminiscent hands as main problem.I was looking for a replacement for my inexpensive watch that i lost recently. I wanted a watch that was water resistant, light weight and reliable. I have an old sieko kinetic watch that I decided to not repair and bought this watch instead. It is a good looking watch, with a locking titanium bracelet band which is light weight and attractive. I wear the watch even in the shower every morning and appreciate its water resistant quality. my one compaint is not having luminescent hands to see the time in the dark. the band is very comfortable and nice looking and it does not pull on arm hairs etc. I am hoping the locking fold over clasp will hold up over time but since i dont take the watch off much, I expect it will. van"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great watch but the band falls apart","review":"I've had this watch for a few years now, and for the most part I love it. It's lightweight but durable, and feels very sturdy on my wrist. It goes with a suit or flannel and anything in between.The problem: every couple of months or so a pin just falls out of the band, and the watch just falls off! It's kind of irritating to pony up for a titanium watch and then have it fall apart due to poor assembly or poorly designed pins. If I knew that Seiko got their act together and figured out how to make this watch in a way that it stays in one piece, I'd recommend it whole-heartedly. Until then, however, I'd say keep looking. If you lose a pin in the wrong place you could wind up losing the whole watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very beautiful, but can be too small","review":"I do not own this watch but tried it on at a Macy's store and just wanted to help a fellow watch shopper here.

The bracelet is particularly remarkable, with that fine, just-complex-enough pattern. They looked, however, disappointingly small on my hand! (I am a 6'1\\" male). So, just something to consider.

Terrible considering there is such good trance being made both in North America and Europe.For those who like progressive trance with little or no melody, then maybe you can get something out of this set.

It is organized to give a wonderful tour that includes snippets from ancient and indigenous to very much contemporary ways of inner knowing; and also a post-modern socio-historical reckoning with \\"how we got here\\" vis a vis these fields of inquiry. Carl Jung talking about the phenomenon of the I Ching! Isabella Allende talking about how she taps her inner knowing as a writer! Excellent essay by Richard Tarnas called \\"the Passion of the Western Mind\\". It's really got a vast breadth. If you're looking for entire essays, you might be disappointed, because most are excerpted from longer works. But what is offered is a terrific package, whetting the appetite while providing a grounding in the above fields."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid framework for organizational knowledge","review":"After reading a number of trendy books on knowledge management, this is the second one with a good theoretical framework. It is not a HOW TO..book (the subtitle is not very informative). It is the fruit of solid analytical thinking. Boisot uses the information space, built from the variables 'codification, abstraction and diffusion'. With this framework he gives an original insight into many organizational aspects, like organizational learning, competences, information technology and organizational culture. I have choosen the book for the course I teach at the University of Amsterdam (Culture and Competences in Changing Organizations), after reading it with red ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious and non-trendy","review":"This is not a book by a management consultant capitalising on the tredy topic of knowledge management.The author is a social scientist with a business school background. He has thought hard about what knowledge is how it can be categorised in different dimensions, and implications for firms and nations. Anyone in academia (economics, sociolgy, management) interested in knowledge ought to read this book. The book is full of deep thinking and many of the ideas can be built upon and elaborated if you are a researcher. If you are not a researcher I don't think you will find this book valuable, unless you are a practitioner that are used to read good academic work. With good I mean relevant, accessible and rigorous. If you like to read that kind of material, get hold of this book.The author also has an earlier book called \\"Information space\\".

It's good, probably because she put her heart into it, and tried to show the seamier side of the business, where both good and evil intermix. In this alone she resembles the early Le Carre, before he went all polemic, and tried to proselytize for this or that point of view. But I do wish she tried to learn some more of the writer's fieldcraft-- the How, not just the What. For example, a scene must have a conflict. You don't give info until it is needed as ammo in the scene. And others such. Nevertheless, this first book of hers was fresh enough to stand out. Her later ones, unhappily work less well for me. Four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"good debut","review":"It isn't easy to write a decent spy thriller.

His attempts at \\"humor\\" -- which show themselves immediately in the introduction -- are absolutely lunatic.I was simultaneously disturbed and insulted when I first read this book as a 12-year-old Pokemon player.

The first is the very great completeness of this text. It's very helpful if you are already quite familiar with HVAC and need a chapter to bring you up to speed on a new aspect of your field. The second is that the author really needed an editor to help with flow of the language. The book can get a little awkwardly worded at times. The last is unfortunately my greatest quibble and that is that for some totally unknown reason, the author has chosen to use antiquated imperial/standard units all over the text. SI units are often given in parentheses, which helps but adds to the clutter, but the psychrometric charts and gas properties are listed in exclusively imperial units in the appendix.

It's just that there is a whole lot of nothing going on in this book until about the last 60 or 70 pages, and at that point it's as if a set of different characters had entered the story to take the place of the previous characters.

A whole cottage industry for sports writers has sprung up inventing way too clever stuff and putting it in Yogi's mouth.Unfortunately, it may be too late to correct the record. How can Yogi disown such gems as \\"It's deja vu all over again\\" when everybody WANTS to believe he said it?In the early 1980's I read an interview with Berra in which a journalist walked him through the fifty best known Berraisms, and Yogi disowned about half of them. Included in the spurious Berraisms was the world-renowned \\"It's deja vu all over again.\\"Sorry to be a spoilsport, but let's have a little truth here. Does anyone seriously believe that during his playing days this guy, who had such a shaky command of basic English, had the French expession \\"deja vu\\" in his word stock to draw upon when needed?"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice light read","review":"this was very enjoyable. not very long, but YB's profundities are unique and stand the test of time.Reviewed by: The Conservative Economist.

It's sleek, beautiful, AND functional.It works very well with my Mr. Coffee ECM21 Espresso/Coffeemaker Combo. It makes perfectly frothed/steamed milk every time. It is very comfortable to use, and the spout pours the milk out smooth, clean, and easy every time. I read that frothers with a pointy spout pour the milk and froth out more accurately than ones with a wider spout like this one, but I don't see how it could be any better than this. I never even have to spoon out any froth.Overall, I am perfectly satisfied with this frother.

That album had not one bad track!!! This one, with the exception of HOW COULD YOU, CANDY, 8-3-1, WISH ON ME and BOYFRIEND, is just not up to her usually stellar songwriting and delivery!!

However there was nothing earth shattering about this cd.Most of the songs were typical Lisa (You Can Do That, 8-3-1 and I've Got Something Better) and some were experiments gone in the wrong direction (Boyfriend-infidelity & Candy-too silly).However Lisa's voice is as powerful as it ever was but held back. She did not provide us with the powerful vocals from, what I consider her best work, her Sophomore cd \\"Real Love\\".Ultimately the two songs that stand out with her signature sound are 8-3-1 and the title song Face Up.If you are a Lisa fan-this is something to have.

It conjures up a lot of films but it isn't quite Wayne's World; Harold & Kumar or School of Rock - it's bits and pieces of all these films and has more of an extended Saturday Night Live feel to it.Jack Black plays the frustrated rocker (aka Jack Black) and there are nice cameos (the best part actually) from Ben Stiller - and Tim Robbins. Kyle Glass is pretty good.The music is ok, but something about Tenacious D is more lame than what it needs to be: Wicked. Definitely a cult film - but not wicked enough for me.

I bought it because there is so little stuff out there on the Germanic branch of Heathenry and because I felt intriqued by Irminism, but what I found was a bunch of dubious information with strong Folkish/borderline racialist overtones.

Of course, Mr Watson can sing whatever he likes, but, to me at least, such substandard fare doesn't deserve to be released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely HORRIBLE","review":"I don't know what Russell Watson and Decca Records was THINKING! Compared to his first album, Encore is certainly a GREAT disappointment! Russell showed promise with his first album, but he should have stopped there.His management team is leading him on the road to ruin! What are they doing?Don't waste your money on this album PLEASE it's a disgrace - Andrea Boccelli's album is miles better than this peice of rubbish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Artistically dishonest","review":"This recording is ghastly. Just listen to what the record producers do for Mr Watson at the end of \\"Celeste Aida\\"! True opera singers will execute a diminuedo all by themselves. Obviously, Mr Watson cannot do the same, and the record producers have artificially \\"pulled away\\" his voice to achieve the effect. This is just terrible and artistically dishonest! Such a kind of electronic tampering of the voice should be condemned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing all the way","review":"This album, the 2nd by Russell Watson, can be said to be disappointing all the way. Instead of an improvement in artistry and vocal technique, the singer has actually done even worse here than in his debut album. I do hope that the singer can, instead of making all sorts of claims (that he is bringing classical music to the people), brush up his vocal technique and that his record company, instead of focussing on ways to increase sales, can discuss with the singer on the way to proceed, for the way this 2nd album is produced has shown great disregard to standards as well as record purchasers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory","review":"This cd is really unsatisfactory. The singing is technically substandard and the singer has not bothered in invest any emotion into the music. It's bland and uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A recording with little appeal","review":"No, this recording has so little appeal that I cannot recommend it to anyone. Thus, just one star. The singing here is lousy, musically careless, tonally abrasive and stylistically charmless. The recording is over-blown and the musical arrangement over-done. Other than the posh jacket design, which doesn't really count, there isn't anything to recommend in this poorly produced album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened, Mr. Watson?","review":"After being totally enamored with Russell Watson's first album, \\"The Voice\\", I have to say I am sorely disappointed by his latest offering. There are too many \\"pop\\" songs, and the opera selections here are plodding and dull. After such a nice selection of songs on his first album, I was hoping for something similar here. Unfortunately, this album did not live up to my expectations. I still like his voice, but I think he should more carefully consider his choice of songs for his next album.However, I loved the first track, \\"Va Pensiero.\\" That's the only reason I gave this album two stars instead of just one. Too bad that song wasn't released on its own as a single..."},{"rating":"1","title":"outrageous","review":"How come such poor performances be released on CD at full price? I think I could have given it a higher rating had it been released at super-budget price! This is outrageous! I regret having bought such a poor-quality CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"This won't do","review":"This simply won't do! In this kind of cross-over album, I'd expect a pleasant voice used imaginatively, and that there should be joy in the singing. Nothing like these can I find on this CD. Instead, we're treated to a voice pushed and pulled to distortion (both by the singer himself and the record engineers) and singing that is both joyless and technically clumsy. No, this simply won't do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst","review":"This is one of the worst CD that I've ever come across irrespective of category. The singer featured here has little voice and an absolutely terrible technique. Musicianship is almost inexistent. What a bad recording this is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Further deteriotation in the voice","review":"The singing here is quite atrocious. Russell Watson, with his narrow vocal and dynamic range, just cannot do justice to the music, even though he has probably realised his own severe shortcomings as revealed in his debut recording and has thus chosen much easier songs to sing. However, his approach is still far from emotionally engaging, and his voice actually sounds even more strident and unsteady. probably the result of some unwise exploitation of the voice, which is not of the best quality when he started out. Such a decline is only to be expected. This recording cannot therefore be recommended for such poor singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a tenor","review":"I found it strange that some people keep calling Russell Watson a \\"tenor\\" and praising his \\"high notes\\". Well, if he really is a tenor, he won't need to sing with the aid of the microphone. If his high notes are really impressive, he won't need to transpose some of the music down! Such claims are all groundless and are very misleading. The truth is - Russell Watson is no tenor and does not have secure high notes. He is just an ordinary singer who is embarrassing himself in such music and misleading other people into thinking that he is capable of singing the music by covering up his own inadequacies through marketing strategy. I found the whole phenomenon to be nothing but a farce."},{"rating":"1","title":"A further deterioration","review":"Sad to write that there's a further deterioration in Russell Watson's singing in this latest album. In his debut album, \\"The Voice\\", while the singer shows little technique and musicianship, he at least does have some voice. Unfortunately, the voice here has become very strained and poorly produced. I just wonder why. As a result, this CD is hugely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"'The Voice' just gets better","review":"There is a noticeable improvement in Russell's voice between this and his debut album. There is also an emotion to his voice on this album which seemed lacking on 'The Voice'. With a variety of song styles including some beautiful Arias, this album is a must for anyone who even slightly appreciates the crossover genre.If you are reading this having enjoyed Russell's first album I would not hesitate in ordering it. You won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"No rival to Bocelli and Safina","review":"Russell Watson is no rival to Bocelli and Safina in the cross-over word. His recordings of the operatic arias are probably the worst ever committed to disc. His recordings of cross-over songs lack charm and style. A gross parody of the human voice and a recording without any merit at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than The Voice","review":"While Russell Watson's 1st album, The Voice, is quite good, this latest album is disappointing. Not only is the choice of music less interesting, the singing shows a marked deterioration from that in The Voice. Why is this so?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing again","review":"Russell Watson's first album is a disappointment. However, listeners would expect a better attempt for the 2nd album. Unfortunately, Watson has disappointed again. In fact, his singing her is worse than in his debut album, which is both strange and maddening. If the debut album is worth 2 stars, this new one can only get 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst","review":"It would be uncharitable to say that this cd by Russell Watson is the worst that I've ever heard. But it's no exaggeration in saying that it is the worst cd I've heard in the last 2 years. And I've bought over 200 cds of all kinds over this period.It is really bad - the voice, which is of ordinary quality, has been poorly employed. What on earth do record companies give us such substandard and boring stuff these days?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Singing that appalls","review":"Russell Watson sings quite appallingly in his 2nd recording. The producers have actually done a better job this time compared with the singer's debut cd, as the music here is on the whole easier to perform. Unfortunately, the performance of Watson is still far from satisfactory.When can Mr Watson learn to sing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"From bad to worse","review":"Judging from \\"The Voice\\" and \\"Encore\\", the singing of Russell Watson has gone from bad to worse. His voice in \\"Encore\\" has lost its shine and there is no improvement in the singing skills. I just don't understand why Watson's recording company can release such substandard stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"This can't do","review":"I respect artistic freedom, and people should be encouraged to try out different style. Yets, this should only be attempted, especially for those who're making money out of the venture, by people who have something special to deliver and also the means to do the project justice. Unfortunately, Russell Watson or his singing here has neither of these qualities. As a result, this CD falls flat and is not entertaining at all. What a missed chance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic man, Fantastic Voice!!","review":"Hard to believe Russell Watson could top his last CD (The Voice) but he has. Each song is performed in a truly magnificent voice.Opera, Pop -- whatever Russell sings he manages to do it beautifully. He is a man of many talents.Buy this CD now -- you don't know what you are missing!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique","review":"Why do self-proclaimed experts presume to know everything about vocal expression and then insist on pidgeon-holing every artist that breaks onto the music scene. Russell Watson is, as many artists are, unique. He obviously appeals to a wide audience as is evident by his record-breaking album sales. Let him be himself, do his own thing, and if you don't like it.....don't listen!! I object to these so-called \\"experts\\" trying to convince everyone of what they SHOULD or SHOULD NOT listen to. It's an individual's choice, and if it doesn't sit well with you, then tough!! Russell oozes personality and I'd rather watch and listen to him sing than some of the \\"Prima Donna\\" opera soloists that 'grace' our auditoriums. I really enjoy the contrasts that Russell offers on both his albums, between his breathy, sexy pop voice and his still in training operatic voice....give the 'bloke' a chance will you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Second CD","review":"Watson here proves every bit as fascinating as on his first CD, \\"The Voice\\". Again he gives us a mix of classical/operatic and pop and it is quite irresistible. The first offering, Va Pensiero, is really stunning, beginning with the soft \\"pop\\" voice and then suddenly soaring into the beautiful, powerful tenor that is so unusual. I particularly like the operatic arias such as Che Gelida Manina but the duets with Lulu and Lionel Ritchie are also beautiful. Every number is lovely in its own way and this CD can be played over and over without becoming tiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope people didn't actually spend money on this","review":"Listening to this, I just wish some of those composers (Verdi, Puccini, etc.) were alive today, so they could take a club and beat Russell Watson with it.To say that Watson is the worst opera singer in the world would be unfair. After all, he's not an opera singer. And calling him the world's worst singer would be unfair too, because he's not a singer. He's a welder. And I just hope his welding wasn't as bad as his singing, otherwise cars all over Britain would be having their fenders fall off and so on.I think anyone who considers Watson to have a 'beautiful voice'must have been spending the last twenty years in a cave on Mars with their fingers in their ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had ordered...","review":"I had ordered this CD but canceled my order when I heard a copy at a local music store. I had wanted it because of the \\"Enterprise\\" theme but it just wasn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lacklustre encore","review":"After a good debut in The Voice, Encore is acutely disappointing. The choice of music is uninspiring and, above all, the singing has less finesse. Maybe Watson is too complacent with his commercial success that he no longer devotes much thought into interpretation. I hope that Watson is an artist of integrity rather than a person who's only keen on making money. This is a lacklustre encore and, as a consumer, I'm not pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unsatisfactory","review":"I haven't listened to Russell Watson's 1st CD. But ENCORE is really unsatisfactory. This \\"singer\\" doesn't even know how to sing! The standard of performance here is appalling. Buy at your risk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like karaoke","review":"I wonder how many people realise that the singing here is of merely karaoke standard. In fact, I've heard many people at the karaoke who sings better than Russell Watson. Why then spend money on things which are of such ordinary quality. I've heard this CD twice from beginning to end and I found it unpalatable. I don't think I'll listen to this kind of substandard fare again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The singer can't do anything","review":"This album contains a wide range of music. Unfortunately, the singer, Russell Watson, does not succeed in any of the music types. I think Mr Watson should do some vocal studies first and then find out which kind of music he can do best before proceeding to parade his vocal flaws in public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enterprise theme","review":"I'm not rating this album, just looking for the theme from the new Star Trek series, \\"Enterprise\\". The credits say Russell Watson sings it. Is this the same artist and if so, what album is it on? Anyone know?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I thought","review":"This DVD was not what I thought. It is not the TLC show \\"Clean Sweep\\". It is a movie made in Turkey about gambling, guns, etc. I cannot tell - the writing is all in a different alphabet altogether, and I did not watch it - I returned it. I'm writing this 'review' just to let any other unsuspecting person know a little something about this DVD. Since there is no image available, and there was no information to let buyers know what it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intuitive, valuable guide through any chronic illness.","review":"This book is inspiring.

Quality design and workmanship, all the way, for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wasn't disappointed","review":"I loved the Defnders of the Earth when I was a kid. I remember rushing home to see it every day after school. I've been looking for it for the past twenty years, convinced that I was the only one that still remembered the series with any fondness. Yes, the animation is terrible (not bad for the time though) and the stories are sometimes a little hacknied but I still love it.The extra features on the DVD are a little disappointing. The one commentary track is great and I wish they'd done another. They tended to repeat a lot of what they said in the commentary in the interviews. It's also missing the advertised Flash Gordon animated episode. Not a great loss, IMHO, but it makes the set look unfinished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Memories","review":"I'm a big fan of this series, as soon as a I get it I started to watch it, great memories!! nothing like those 80's cartoons, you must have this, great price for all first season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"One of my favorite cartoons as a child. This cartoons brings back so many memories. My children even love it. Thank you for the condition of it and the delivery time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many anecdotes... it wasn't what I was looking for","review":"I was really frustrated with this book. Based on all the glowing reviews, I had really high expectations. The Complete Communicator is broken down into five categories: Person to Person, Writing (which goes into editing and getting published), Giving Speeches (accents, stage fright), Listening, and Media (guesting on TV, cultivating relationships, letters to the editor). I didn't need pages and pages of anecdotes to understand the author's points. I feel the Complete Communicator was far too broad in focus and did not concentrate enough on one-on-one communication. I think Communicate or Die and Talk Less Say More offered more of what I was looking for. I'm not saying this book doesn't have value to others. It was just a bit too general for my taste. The glowing reviews led me to buy this one, and I wish I hadn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"How-To\\" of \\"How-To\\" Communication Books","review":"It's been almost three years since I first read \\"The Complete Communicator\\". Largely as a result of this remarkable little book I started, and have almost completed, writing my second book. Over the past several months I have frequently referred back to \\"The Complete Communicator\\". It's like having a writing coach available whenever I'm stuck (And, boy, do I get stuck!)This book is not just about putting words on paper. It's about writing in the context of overall excellent communications (I guess it has a rather appropriate title...). Thanks, William E. Lampton - you done good. (I don't think he would approve of that last line!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good advice for writers","review":"\\"Writing for the Soul\\" is at the same time an autobiography and an advise for aspiring writers. Jenkins describes how he has balanced his writing profession with his private life, and here, he finds a balance between autobiographical anecdotes and advice, on topics such as style, discipline to write, contacting publishers.Jenkins's writing career has been shaped by his love for sports and his Christian faith, and he talks about both in this book. But the book is first and foremost aimed at writers. Being neither a sports fan or a Christian, I still found the book very interesting and inspiring, and often funny. Recommended to Jenkins fans, fans of Christian fiction, and most of all to aspiring writers, Christian or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book of its kind on the market.","review":"Without exception, this is the best personal book out there for the aspiring writer.

A critic once wrote that Joan Sutherland without high-flying coloratura is like a sad child who lost their balloon. Parlor songs like these are written for the middle register of the voice, which was always Joan's major weakness, even in the earliest part of her career. Still, when she did sing them in the late fifties / early sixties, at least the voice was lighter and fresher. By the time of Serate Musicali, Joan's voice had thickened considerably, exaggerating the aforementioned flaw.If you want a reasonable document of Joan singing this reperatoire, buy The Art of Joan Sutherland on DVD, which includes a a televised recital from the mid-sixties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for Warmth--Cannot wash!!","review":"I bought these for my husband last winter.

Where you once had Motley Crueish songs like The Whip and Twisted Sisterish metal anthems like Fight For The Rock , you've now got songs like Tonight He Grins Again and the introspective Believe . This is a great album , musically and lyrically . Jon Oliva's voice is one of the best in hard rock/ metal , it's sort of an Alice Cooper like scowl .

The sheer emotional impact of this disc is incredible. The first time I heard \\"Believe\\", I was moved to tears. 5 years later, I still am.

This is truly an epic album, and if you let it, it will have an impact on you. Savatage is fabulous as usual - and the roller coaster pace of the album really conveys the feelings of a drug addict (or so I suppose). Up with Jesus Saves, down with St. Patricks, wallowing in sorrow and pity in Tonight He Grins Again, and my favorite - If I Go Away. To this day I cannot listen to that song without becoming emotional.Queensryche is a great band, and Operation: Mindcrime is phenomenal, but Streets is about something else entirely - heart and soul.

When I first heard this band, I thought \\"Wow. Queen with metal guitars.\\" Some of you may remember my review of this album about a few months ago. Well, let me say this..These guys do not rock! Every song is a ballad or 80's thrash metal, which should've died a long time ago. Criss Oliva is a great guitarist, however, but the rest of the band isn't. Jon Oliva sounds like Meat Loaf with an astma attack, Johhny Lee Middleton plays about 3 notes in a song, and the drummer's drums are OVERPRODUCED! I used to think Believe was a sad story, but now it's just epic nerd rock. If Criss left the band and did his solo stuff, I would've listened to it. I'm sorry, people. I can't listen to this anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"A (very) poor man's Queensryche","review":"Savatage always seemed to be one of those bands that I heard of, but never actually heard. I bought this based on word of mouth from someone whose opinion (up until that time) I respected, listened to it once, and immediately [got rid of it]. I have heard other Savatage albums as well, including \\"Gutter Ballet\\" and \\"Hall Of The Mountain King,\\" both hailed as classics by fans of the 'Tage. Sorry, people, I'm not getting it. The musicianship and songwriting are pedestrian at best--they sound a lot like King Diamond with a barely on-key tenor singer. The person who recommended \\"Streets\\" to me told me that since I liked Queensryche, I would love this album. Queensryche should not be flattered by the comparison. For those of you who truly believe \\"Streets\\" to be a great concept album, I strongly suggest that you give a listen to \\"Operation: mindcrime,\\" then listen to \\"Streets.\\" I think you'll change your mind pretty quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointed","review":"I rate Brenda Hampton's \\"Slick\\" with five stars because it is truly a good book.

I had already purchased \\"My Best Friend's Man\\" in 2004 so when I purchased \\"Slick\\" a week ago, it was like dejavu because I knew I had read that story before. I went to my collection of her books and went through them and that's when I discovered that I already had the book...just under a different title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's Face It, Slick'S GOT IT GOING ON!","review":"Five stars again for my favorite author who seems to very well have it going on. I do agree that this book being a republished edition of her previous book was confusing, but I do question those who wrote bad reviews and call themselves fans too. I hope that there's a way for Amazon to inform readers about these changes too because it would help those who do not read the book description. Either way, I enjoy reading Ms. Hampton's novels and she will always be a five star author through my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slick, Not Really!","review":"As I started reading \\"Slick\\", I found the story line to be all too familiar. So I went to my bookshelf and picked up \\"My Best Friend's Man\\", and low and behold it's the exact same book.

I'v got the same complaint as some of the other parents as far as the height of the tray. My son is also very tall and the tray was at his shoulders. He's almost 6 months old and looked teeny tiny in that highchair and not very comfy because of it. PLUS, the tray was very difficult for me to take on and off, it was like the one I got was not made right....and actually one of the plastic peices where the tray slides on popped off a few times. This chair was definitely not worth 99.99! I should have gone with my first instinct and got the Fisher Price Aquarium high chair, way cooler chair. We ended up taking back this baby trend the next day and getting the fisher price aquarium and he sits way better in it, and it's really easy to put the tray on...and it has toys! I dont know why I got the baby trend....I felt way better spending $100 on the fisher price Aquarium high chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Type A Couple Finds Highchair Excellent!","review":"My wife and I (mostly my wife) spent weeks searching for the right highchair. After physically taking our daughter to half a dozen stores and propping her up in close to a dozen chairs, we are very satisfied with this model. It rolls from room to room, and doubles as a easy chair where our daughter plays for hours a day. It's good looking, too, and comes with a simple one-color cover, if you don't like the patterned cushion. The only complaint is that it could be a few inches higher so we don't need to lean over so far to feed her. By the way, we started using it when our daughter was just five and a half months old and 16 pounds. She fits in it very securely; doesn't get lost in it like she did in most others. We are not yet using the tray, but expect to within a month or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Chair!","review":"We initially looked at high chairs prior to our daughter's birth, but none seemed to meet our expectations. But recently we looked again and were pleasantly surprised to find this high chair in the Malawi pattern that we did her room in. Not only did the high chair match our needs in being sturdy and compact (it folds up), it also had two extra trays, adjustable height, adjustable recline and as a bonus, it matched her room.The chair itself was very comfortable for her and she played in it even after finishing her meal. All the adjustments were easily made and the lockable wheels made it easy to move around.

My 6 month old is very comfortable in it. This chair gives the plush, armchair type dining experience for our baby. We put the cotton cover on top of the vinyl so it's extra padded and comfy. She can reach the tray when properly strapped in the 5 point harness, it is very sturdy and i like that i can use the cotton cover for her now and maybe switch to vinyl later when she is older.The other important factor in favor of this chair is that the underside of the tray is a smooth surface unlike other chairs with ridgy trays. we felt that our baby's legs [kicking endlessly against the chair] could get hurt by a non-smooth surface. I also like that it is in upright position when placed in the least recline position [unlike evenflo chairs which can never be placed upright] and comfortably reclines for a small baby to relax when not eating.The only con i have is that the tray is too heavy to handle and is not a one hand insertion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth","review":"recently bought this item on sale for 9$.

It explains the different grades and types of tea, along with some helpful recipes.Not only does it simply cover tea, it covers herbs that are often included in tea blends! I was very impressed. The only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 was it could have used a few actual pictures of the tea instead of just the illustrations to help us see some of the color differences in tea types it so eloquently explained.Over all, a very good book for someone wanting to learn more about this delectable and ancient beverage.

As for the series itself...this was a show that actually bothered to draw out human emotional complexity, showing both sides of the problem, and tried to find the \\"perfect answer\\" - remember when television tried to \\"teach\\" us how to be better human beings rather than exploit our flaws? Ah, takes you back, right? If you want something that might actually provoke a thought or stir a real emotion, and just maybe, teach something in passing, this is a highly recommended series.

The DVD version comes in at 130 minutes - while I don't remember the exact running time of the tv series, it was probably in the neighborhood of 270 minutes given that it aired on three nights.So as you can see, about 1/2 the footage was cut taking out significant character and plot development. The final product is an odd collection of edits not doing justice to either the true story or original version.If you're looking for some of Benicio Del Toro's earlier work, this foots the bill though certainly not in a manner it could have with the unedited version.All in all, a rather disappointing product from editing to special features (virtually none)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor","review":"When I first saw this mini-series I was impressed by it's depth and it's message. A group of policemen fighting against all odds, corruption and politics. It could even be stereotyped as a plot of good against evil. That was the original series. What they have done on the DVD was to condense it so much that the message, the rhythm, all the meaning is if not lost, very hard to find. Critical scenes were cut and the plot doesn't make sense any more. If you have never seen the original, this might entertain you, but if you saw it, you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's missing about 230 minutes","review":"As with many other reviews I was truly disappointed.

The VHS version is on one tape, and this DVD lacks any special bonus features to warrant a 'mono layered' disc.They did the same thing to the great'Goodfells' movie, so try to read DVD specs on the back of any Warner Brothers case.They have a habit of making lackuster DVDs!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"History that needs to be known.","review":"I liked it because it was based on a true story but any racial discrimation is hard to deal with."},{"rating":"2","title":"...in the words of Martin Luther King","review":"Rosewood being something that actually happened shows what happens when people make pre-judged decisions.

At the begining of the film a lie is told and that lie was the beginning of the end for the town of Rosewood, Fla. but also towards the end there was a change in the character of only three of the people in the film.

I was truly disappointed that my husband was unable to finish the movie due to the manufacturer's inability to deliver a whole copy.

Not so.I found this to be a book that doesn't do a good job of developing its characters or its story.

Each generation echoes to a degree its former. The story revolves around the second Behl, Axel (axle?), who elects to take the path of power and influence from the shadows rather than the limelight. World War II gives him a perfect venue for this style---the OSS. Alex, his son, grows up under Axel's tutelage, takes a law degree, and becomes a \\"fixer\\" in succeeding administrations from Eisenhower to the present. All the Behls have passionate relations with women, eventually finding them impediments rather than expedients in the game of power the Behls savor. There is no climax in Echo House.

I have been unhappy with everything. The base is awful to install. If you get the incline right then the base collapses when you tighten it. I had to put a pool noodle under it to keep it level. The car seat is terrible. It never seems to want to lock in the base. The straps aren't big enough and my baby is only 14 lbs. They always cut into her neck and they always get all twisted. They are awful to adjust. Her head always leans forward. It is way too heavy and the handle is awkward. It is almost impossible to get the handle up and down. The stroller is terrible to open and close. When you try to open it is always rubs the ground and it is all scratched up. Also, when you push the stroller it isn't smooth. It is real shakey. I haven't had the stroller collapse yet but I am really worried about it. I would never buy another Baby Trend Product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dangerous travel system..DO NOT BUY!!","review":"I bought this travel system before I looked at the reviews here (stupid me). After reading how some parents experienced the problems with the stroller folding up and having the car seat fly out, I became a little worried. After all, my baby's safety is my #1 priority. I went to Babies R' Us today and I pressed the release latch to fold the stroller while the car seat was still in it. Sure enough, the whole thing collapsed and the car seat flew out HEAD FIRST!! I did this in front of an employee, who was as shocked as I was. She even did it..twice!! Needless to say, I'm returning this stroller first thing tomorrow.

We recently took a vacation and used the stroller only from the duo to tote our little one around. When our daughter fell asleep in the stroller in the reclined position her head would fall into the area between the bars on the side and the actual back support. This would cause her head to get stuck and we would have to wake her up to get her head out. In my opinion the stroller is also very hard to manuver and it is very large compared to the stroller we used with our first daughter. We are looking into buying a new stroller because of how dissatisfied we are with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Malawi Travel System","review":"I went to the local Babies'R'Us and was looking at this stroller/car seat combo since it matches our theme. It looks wonderful and I would've purchased it, but there is one very bad safety issue! You can collapse the stroller with the car seat still in it. It's not something people would do on purpose, but the button to do so is on the handle used to push the stroller. So if you are pushing the stroller with the baby in it you could actually collapse the whole thing and injure the baby accidentally. I think this product should be recalled, and strongly urge anyone who is thinking about purchasing it to see for yourself. It is very dangerous and I would recommend going with the Graco set instead. It is the same price range, light weight, and definitely a safer option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this stroller","review":"I read that this stroller can collapse with the infant seat installed. I went to the store to see for myself, and it is shocking. With just the touch of a button, you can collapse the stroller with the infant seat installed, catapulting the baby to the ground. Of course, you might think that no one would actually ever do this, but it could happen unintentially, such as by an older child who sees the parents fold up the stroller and presses the button to see what happens. I think this is very dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a piece of junk","review":"This travel system is the worst that i could have bought!!!! it doesnt fold up with one hand like it is supposed to thhat was the main reason why i bought it!when i went to return it to the manufacture they said that it was not fixable! then my son cries everytime he is in the car seat because he is really uncomfortable!!! I cant even use the base because his head hangs no matter how i adjust it! the straps are always getting tangled the handle on the carseat cant be put down without a struggle!! the car seat filps up when it is set down ! the one handed steering doent naviogate right all and all the travel system is a piece of junk!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst unit I have ever seen","review":"I went looking for a travel system when I was pregnant. This was my first child so I wasn't completely sure what to look for. I went to the store and I played with several strollers. I liked how this one released in the front. I liked that it wasn't all dark blue since I didn't know what I was having. I liked how the car seat connected to the stroller. I loved the handles and how easy they were to hold. I loved the one hand stearing on the stroller. Then I had my daughter and I went to put her in the car seat. She wasn't a big baby she was 7lbs 4 ounces when we left the hospital and the straps already felt too small. I had to push and tug to get it to snap. It was horrible. She is now 7 weeks old and I can't use it because I can't buckle her in without pushing on her stomach hard. Babies R Us was wonderful and they allowed me to return it. I will never buy anything from Baby Trend again. I called them first and their customer service was horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy Load","review":"I have this system (in a different pattern) because the carseat was highly rated on consumer reports. The carrier is very HEAVY. Way too heavy to carry around with baby in it.

Every time they put their weight on the car seat to make sure the slack was completely gone, the seat would click to another notch in the back. My baby was born pre-term and must have the highest notch so that his head doesn't flop forward. After a half an hour I asked them what they thought and they told me that they had never had that problem before and didn't recommend me using it. I have yet to return the whole system, so I'll see how easy or hard that is, but I am definitely not using it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety issue","review":"I agree with Megan Mitchell's (from North Carolina) review. I am due in February and was in the store comparing strollers. You can easily Collapse this stroller WITH the infant seat in place, which tips the infant seat forward, dumping the baby out if the child is not strapped in. Imagine another child \\"playing\\" with your stroller and collapsing it! In contrast, the Graco stroller folds forward, so if you try to collapse it with the infant seat in place, it won't fold down (plus the infant seat doean't tip forward in this case).

I think it is a nice stroller but I hate the fact that you need two (or more) hands to fold it then it slams into the pavement scratching up the very front of the stroller. I also hate the fact that you cannot have the canopy open so you can see the baby and have a drink in the drink holder at the same time. I do like that you can completely close baby up with the two (one from the carseat and one from the stroller).

We had our baby in April 05 and we have hated the stroller ever since. No real complaints about the car seat, except it can be difficult to buckle at times but I'm not having all the problems of the child leaning to far foward or that it is too hard to install in the car. The stroller is the problem! TOO HEAVY. TOO AWKWARD TO FOLD. I had to get a new wheel after 2 weeks of use because if you don't adjust the wheels just so when folding you can damage a wheel! Customer service was poor but agreed to send new wheels for free. The stroller is annoying because once your child sits on his/her own he/she is still too small to see over the front tray. My child is 9 months old and the tray is in his face...so I typically use my mid weight stoller instead. This is not a problem with the GRACO my friend uses!

This book not only recounts the previous movies but provides insightful commentary on where they got it right, where they got it wrong, and where they compromised for the sake of Hollywood.

This book can serve as introductory guide to the style and ideas of Decartes, Leibniz, Pascal, Spinoza, Comte, Kant, Rousseau, Hegel, Mach and Nietzche. The editor has picked a wealth of works that paint a thorough canvas of the life and works of each author. For example Nietzhes works \`The Superman,' \`Will To Power' and \`The Good and Evil,' allow readers to get good understanding of the author's evolution in thinking and writing as well as gauge the prevailing concerns of the scientific and philosophical interests at the time.

Nietzsche does not deserve to be defiled by simple-mindedness!! The beauty, the unexcelled sweetness and tightness of Nietzsche's prose is brutalized and vulgarized by reckless cretinism. Do you want to EXPERIENCE Nietzsche's philosophy, or do you want a perverted, feminized simulacrum?

The rest is formulaic: a jaded elite military commando is recruited for a shoot-'em-up mission to save the world from a vague menacing entity which is never fully explained. He is paired up with a beautiful humanoid \\"secret-weapon\\" in scanty clothing who fights her battles with an unconvincing flurry of kicks and punches that never seem to connect with their recipients.

The plot and dialogue were very weak, and Chris Tucker (who is usually good)'s character was so annoying I couldn't stand it! The only reason I gave this movie two stars (instead of one) is because I must admit the effects (especially the city-scape) were very good. But they should've done a better job on the script.

Just thinking of it makes me chuckle.- And \\"love\\" being an \\"element\\" whatever that means, destroys said ball of evil. This is \\"sci\\"fi???????? I watched it hoping for a good scifi flick and got a magical fantasy instead. Disapointment.- practically the best special effects ever and set designs.

Pothead Milla Jovovich shows her breasts, if you really want to see them (you don't). Production Design very well done. Bad side? Willis walks through his role picking up his paycheck with the disinterest showing on his face much like his asteroid movie that came out later. Stoner Milla prattles on with her made up language, and acts as woodenly as if see was speaking english. No chemistry whatsoever between the two leads, alothough Willis tries a bit more. Chris Tucker whose great energy helped make Friday, brings this film to a screeching halt in a Jar-Jar/Prince combo that goes nowhere and adds nothing to the plot or other character development (not that there is any character development). The Professional was outstanding but a wrong turn here by the director. I heard Besson had this idea in high school when he was a teenager. It shows, badly."},{"rating":"2","title":"EYE-POPPING FUN...YUM","review":"Anybody expecting a complicated story in this amazing movie should go to hell. This story is director Besson's imagination when he was a kid so it's pretty simplistic. But extravagant visual effect, colorful characters, amazing set and costume design, high dose of humor, Chris Tucker's incredibly over-the-top performance, and its optimistic view of the future will leave most viewers satisfied.

Chris Tucker? I never wanted a movie character to shut the hell up so much in my life. Nails on a chalkboard.

Luc Besson's direction and segues during the movie seemed well done to me. The humor is priceless, but not in-your-face obvious like SNL.The story is that all life in the galaxy will be wiped out if retired Major Corbin Dallas (Bruce Willis) is unable to retrieve the stones that represent the classical \\"Aristotelean\\" four elements of air, earth, fire, and water. The Fifth Element, life, is personified by Milla Jojovich, the \\"perfect\\" human.

I bought this back in april of 98. DVD was non existent, and I had just jumped on the widescreen bandwagon, so I didn't deem the widescreen version worthy of extra cash. I'm sorry.The movie is a great ride. Good action, interesting plot, and beautiful (and revealing, in this movie) Milla Jovovich. The only let downs were Chris Tucker, who pretty much ruined the movie, action scenes later on the casino ship, and Bruce Willis. While Bruce didn't ruin the movie, he looked very out of place. I'm not sure who, but someone else could have made the movie much better.One thing that has always bothered me is the nudity. Not that I'm opposed to it, it just baffles me how this movie got a pg-13 rating. In several scenes, Milla takes off her shirt, sure it's usually in the background, but it is very easy to notice. Oh well, if Titanic can do it, so can this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another silly movie for smart people","review":"This is one of those films like Buckaroo Banzai or Big Trouble in Little China that you either get or don't. The whole movie is magnificently over the top and like the other two titles I mention, you can watch it over and over and over.

Visually, this is quite a spectacle. But the plot is boring and uninteresting. I like Willis and Tucker, too, but both of their characters are just plain annoying.

Stranger things have happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun Science Fiction Movie, But Disappointing","review":"This was a fun movie to watch...at some parts. Others were pretty disappointing. I think the worst part of the movie is the very beginning. Just when you think a movie is at an all-time low, it gets even lower. I don't know about anyone else, but those aliens in the beginning were a major turn-off in the film. I mean, come on, they look like giant donuts! Give me a break! But, like I said, the movie does have some interesting parts, funny one-liners from Bruce Willis, and just downright \\"cool\\" scenes. Check it out...but take heed and fast forward through the first five or ten minutes...you'll be glad I warned you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Very funny, and filled with action and takes your breath, But one thing for sure, if it was not Bruce willis on the star, then this movie would not have successeded that much.As a normal taxi driver and X-soldar, Dallas (Bruce willis) finds him self stuck with this beautiful girl who physically came down from the sky to his car, he wants to help her, and he loves her, he wants to get the sacred stones, to save earth and at the same time not loss the girl (5th element).The movie is filled with action, feelings, and funny parts.Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sit back and enjoy the ride","review":"Let's face it. This is a silly movie. But if you don't take it too seriously, then you'll enjoy it. Bruce Willis plays the standard Bruce Willis role. (Think of John McClain in space). Milla is good for what she does, Chris Rock is so stupid he's hysterical, and the rest of the supporting cast fill their roles perfectly. This movie isn't to be taken seriously, this movie is meant to be watched when there's nothing else on, and you've got a few hours to blow.

What were they thinking?!!","review":"Oh, my word! I have tried to watch this film numerous times and have lost interest within the first 20 minutes. I love films of all sorts, but this one just sucks. It seems that the director wanted to make everything completely over the top and he achieved his goal in spades, believe me. I skipped around to see if it got better and of course, it didn't. UGH!!! What a waste of talent! If you want to see something a lot better, try the entire Star Wars collection, Titan AE (animated, but still 100x better than this)or even Event Horizon. This will be a future film for the Mystery Science Theater guys to make fun of. Then, at least, it will be funny.

I own two versions of the DVD which I've screened regularly over the years in a high end dedicated home theater. When I want to show off the capability of my system, this has always been one of the top 3-4 disks I reach for. I recently purchased the BluRay version and WOW! My well tuned CRT projector driven by a Lumagen Radiance video processor and an Oppo 93 as a transport any standard DVD content scales up to very high quality 1080P on the large projection screen. The video mastering of the DVD is superb, and as such I was skeptical that the BluRay release would be that much better than the DVD. Trust me, it is! I wish there were more extras but they have used the bandwidth to maximize Video and Audio quality. Long live Korben and Leeloo! Long live The Fifth Element! Next stop is 4K."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superbit makes this worth owning","review":"Let's face it. The storyline has more holes in it than swiss cheese. Chris Tucker is way over the top. Bruce Willis sleepwalks through the role. Gary Oldmans southern accent might fool some people in Asia. But, sometimes a movie is worth watching once you stop being critical and just enjoy the effects and sound. This movie is one of those.The Superbit video transfer left my jaw hanging open. This was by far the most filmlike dvd i've ever watched. TFE has many very good special effects that largely benefited from the Superbit process. The video quality alone is worth 4 stars.Then there is the DTS soundtrack. This soundtrack isn't as seperated sonically as other movies DTS soundtracks are but it is a huge improvement over the previous released version of TFE.This dvd may be weak plot wise but it is a good benchmark dvd that would impress anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD and a fun movie","review":"You notice I did not say a \\"great\\" movie. This is a reference quality DVD transfer. I have had the disc since release and very few if any DVDs since have surpassed it in terms of audio or video quality. Beautiful scenery (the opera scene for one - notice the planet rising in the background) and fantastic Dolby Digital soundtrack combine to make this a disc that you invite your friends over to see.Now for the story. I liked it. It is another Bruce Willis saves the world from baddies, he's and ex-cop, ex-soldier storyline, but with enough juice behind it to keep me interested. The film editing was incredible (again, see the opera/fight scene)and it was not quite \\"poo\\" as one of the reviewers said.

Chris Tucker is so funny and he's just so annimated. It is just so good and funny. I suggest that whoever likes sci-fi and action movies, you have to see this movie, you won't regret it and it will definately be worth it.

As soon as he came on the scene, I turned to the guy who owned the DVD and said, \\"Please tell me he gets killed off early.\\" But no such luck. He had no redeeming quality, not funny, not important to the storyline. I want a DVD with all the awful Chris Tucker dialogue, and as much as his scenes possible edited out.

The best attribute is the dialogue. Favorite lines; Bruce Willis as Dallas Korben: 'Nice hat.' and 'Anybody else want to negotiate?'; Gary Oldman as Zorg, 'If you want something done...do it yourself..Yeah!'. Of course these have to be seen in context to appreciate the ironic humor. The best character is the multi-vocal chord equiped DIVA who performs one of the most appealing musical sequences ever put on film and demonstrates such touching humanity. 5th Element is able to plunge the viewer into a totally fresh and alien experience.

The extras are all on disc 2, and they're ok. I recorded the Stars HD broadcast of this film a couple weeks ago and compared it to this DVD Superbit version. Yes, there is more detail in the HD, but not anything you can notice from less than 5-6 feet from the screen.

Horrible plot, bad special effects, bad villians, the whole thing sucked. I usually like Chris Tucker, but in this movie he is SO annoying. Boring in parts as well. Bruce Willis didn't help either. One of the worse sci fi movies I've seen. Want a good sci fi movie, go see Star Trek or Star Wars. Do not watch this."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad","review":"Together with Starship Troopers this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. I am amazed to see a good actor like Gary Oldman, who i like very much, in this save the world type array of special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Really Deserves NO STARS","review":"This film is one of the worst movies I have had the misfortune of seeing. The story is horrible. Better acting has been seen in B-movies. The directing is...where is the directing? My mind was so fuzzy after watching this film that I could barely focus my eyes. I'm not even sure WHAT the plot was, and, guess what? I don't care either.Now I didn't expect that much out of Mila Jovovich. I did expect a little more from Bruce; his movies are usually a little more interesting than this. I expected light years more from Gary Oldman. Maybe he realized that actually trying to turn out a good performance in this thing was impossible.If I didn't know better, I would have sworn that Luc Besson was a 5 year old that liked to shout, \\"Action\\" and little else. People often cite \\"good imagery\\" when there's little else to praise in a movie. I can't recall being impressed with the imagery, but, then again, I had trouble focusing my eyes through more than half of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow this is un watchable","review":"I rented this on blu ray (Netflix) and couldn't watch it.

It was so stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Garbage","review":"This movie is utter garbage. I was writing better stories than this in 5th grade. It's a crude regurgitation of a thousand cliches into a shameful vomitous pile. There is no inspiration at all in this story. It astounds me that a movie studio could approve a script like this.

For an adult, it is really terrible: unintelligible plot, cheap looking plastic alien/monster costumes, and run of the mill acting. This is not a thoughtful sci fi movie in the vein of The Day the Earth Stood Still, or Star Wars. This is more a cartoon - but a poor one. I wouldn't recommend this movie for any living person over the age of 16!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF, THIS MOVIE SUCKS!","review":"I literally have no idea why this movie has so many positive reviews. It's extremely cheesy and weird. I don't know whether or not to take the film seriously. One minute it's serious, the next minute I am watching some blue Diva singing opera and break dancing. Not to mention the Chris Tucker character is soooooooo annoying. I have never gotten such a weird vibe from a film before, I have no idea what to make of it. I even watched it a second time because I was so confused."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a Great Movie, Modestly Better in Blu-Ray","review":"The Fifth Element is one of my all-time favorite movies. It's stylish, it's beautiful, it's colorful, it's action-packed, it's got romance. It's also got cornball in it, and the math & science are atrocious: \\"So when is this snake act supposed to occur?\\" \\"Every 5000 years.\\" \\"So we've got some time.\\" Actually, no, not if the last one was 4,999.99 years ago. How 'bout \\"Sir, the object is growing at 200%.\\" 200% per second? per million years? Still, an immensely entertaining, visually stunning film. The high-definition transfer is so-so, but still about 50% sharper than the Superbit standard-definition DVD. Until the remastered 3840x2160 ultra-HD version comes out, this is good enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"eye-candy of the highest order","review":"While the plot of the Fifth Element is sparse and typical of genre SF movies (which is to say, light on actual SF), the visual effect created by this movie is totally spell-binding. The Fifth Element earned the unique distinction of being the only film I ever watched, then watched again immediately in a back-to-back double viewing. It was even better the second time. Irresistable. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bunch of shills!","review":"Get a life! This was a piece of tripe and you know it.

Sure, it's sometimes funny. But, people, as a watched this movie, I realized what bad acting and terrible directing looked like. How did the excellent Iom Holm get a part in this mess. I guess he lost a bet. This is the Riven of films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all its cracked up to be","review":"I can't believe all the positive reviews I am reading here at Amazon. The movie has some good directing, a nice performance from Milla, and a few good special effects, but little else. There is so little originality here. Why do those ships look like Star Wars' Star Destroyers? Why do the bad guys have British accents (ala the Empire)? Why do we have various Blade Runner elements, i.e., the flying cars, the eye imagery, Milla doing back flips ala Darryl Hannah. This movie tries to be a tribute to those movies, but never succeeds at it. Chris Tucker's performance finally puts the nail in the coffin, as his character is so damn annoying, and on screen way too much. Finally the concept of Korben being in \\"love\\" with Laylu doesn't make sense. What is he in love with, just her body? Is that how the world gets saved?Milla's performance is quite good and the visual imagery is pretty strong, but theres not enough here to make this movie very memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was terrible!!!","review":"I'm sorry, but I thought this movie was unintelligible nonsense. The story made little sense, and the acting was mediocre at best. Willis was obviously remaking \\"Die Hard\\" in space, and expending little effort in the process. Gary Oldman's makeup/costume was so bizarre, it was distracting, but distracting from this movie is probably a blessing. There are a lot of good sci-fi flicks out there, don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fifth Element (Blu-Ray)","review":"The DVD on the blu-ray disk was bad news from the git-go. We tried to play the movie twice before we noticed the bad lines on the disk. The bad line couse the movie to stop playing or some skipping off and on. I never had this problem before and now it has happened twice in the same month and all on Blu-Ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to fast-forward","review":"I know this movie is critically acclaimed and that alot of people really like this movie, but I thought it was horrible. I think Bruce Willis is great and he usually makes good selections, but I can't imagine what he was thinking with this one. I found the plot to be weak and relatively hard to follow but it wasn't really the plot that made it so bad; it was the acting. Bruce Willis is a fine actor so his performance was good, but not good enough to carry this film. The remaining actors seemed to walk right off the set of Starship Troopers (the hands down worst movie and acting I've ever seen) -- the actors seemed like they just got their lines the day of the shoot. There was no emotion when there should have been, there was no conviction, no connection even to the scenes they were in. The special effects were decent but still not enough to make this movie worth watching. There have only ever been two movies that I fast forwarded through parts of and this is one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinkville","review":"The next \\"Star Wars\\"?

It has the oft repeated line of total destruction and the hero trying to save the world. Poor story line and No great special effects make it just another sci-fi movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious and contrived","review":"Being a huge fan of the science fiction genre, I was delighted to learn of a sci fi movie whose theatrical release I somehow missed. And Bruce Willis playing the hero being means it must be a sure fire hit, right ?Wrong ! This was truly the most contrived and unimaginitive piece of drivel I have seen in a long time. And no, I'm not \\"slow\\" or unsophisticated. I just didn't see any ideas here which had not been done, significantly better, by Star Trek, Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark. The only character I found modestly intriguing was the opera singer alien. And she got wasted rather quickly, leaving only the highly stereotypical characters. The above average visuals were not enough to redeem the tired plot.My advice is rent it if you are really curious. It was certainly not worthy of being added to my fine sci fi DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"very satisfies","review":"Arrived quickly and appears in good shape. It is a Christmas gift and I haven't played it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly.","review":"If only they had another director (perhaps Ridley Scott, using a little \\"Blade Runner\\" flair), this movie could have had the potential to be very good. Instead, director Luc Besson (\\"Leon,\\" aka: \\"The Professional\\") chose to formulate this sophomoric piece of sour eye-candy that even the geekiest science fiction aficionado would despise. Aside from the poor direction, Hudson Hawk paired with an androgynous (and extraordinarily annoying) Chris Tucker sidekick, is enough to drive anyone to mercilessly strangle a kitten."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover","review":"You'll never look at the future the same way again after seeing this movie. Bruce Willis plays a taxi cab driver that becomes a hero when a mystical woman drops in his cab. He must bring her to safety and save the human race from Mr. Shadow and Zorg. This movie features flying cars, shootem up spaceship sequences, action and explosions, intense story, and wonderul special effects. The film will take your breath away and leave you wanting a sequal. Bruce Willis is so likeable you will be rooting for him all the way. Gary OldMan is so evil you will be waiting for his death. Chris Tucker is absolutely hilerous and that red haired girt is positively hot and sensational. If you want to see an entertaining and wonderul sci-fie adventure that is second best to Star Wars go and see the Fifth Element. Like I said the movie depicts a remarkable and stunning future."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fifth Element","review":"I'm very happy with the high quality of the disc.

I have always like the movie Fifth Element but creating this movie as Blu-ray only makes this movie that much sweeter. My advice is if you have the funds go a head and purchase this movie because it is pretty sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem","review":"Between Chris Tucker's hilarious he/she hysterics, and Bruce Willis' witty underdog snideness, this movie was perfect. Thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining. You don't have to be a big sci-fi fan (which I am not) to understand the plot, which is a basic good (earthlings) v. evil (piggish aliens) story.A truly great film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody needs Love!!","review":"I admit I may not know what love is, but this movie showed me the key to all livin' \\"LOVE!\\" Everybody needs some love. That certainly showed that even a supreme being needs love as well. I am a huge fan of Sci-fi/Action movies but this film towards the ending brought out the soft side in me!! This movie has great special effects,good actors,great costumes(well you get the picture) So if you haven't watched this movie get yourself to the nearest movie rental place and rent it. I guaruntee you'll just love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A better movie after I had seen it a few times","review":"Not a great movie, but a good movie. This being from outer space in the form of Milla Jovovich has come to save us from the big evil that is coming for us. Not that that is a bad thing. Could have been someone else we would have to watch for 2 hours.The plot is a bit tired, but reworked well enough to have life in it. The view of the future is funny, the effects in the movie are well done, and some of the characters are very well played. Gary Oldman is his typical self in a Besson movie, over the top and a bit twitchy, but that is what makes watching him in a movie great. Willis is Willis, what can I say. Milla is a beauty, and that's always good. Better than average, but worth a watch or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ridiculous- and delightful","review":"If you're a fan of the French comic \\"Metal Hurlant\\" (or its English edition, \\"Heavy Metal\\"), then you're the perfect audience for this marvelous piece of comic art brought to life. Bruce Willis is in his element playing the reluctant hero living, plucked from his life as a taxicab driver to save the world from destruction. Milla Jovovich is superb as Leeloo. Gary Oldman is absolutely marvelous as the trancedentally evil Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg.\\"The Fifth Element\\" never takes itself too serously, and indeed there are a number of wonderfully comic moments. Buy it, and save it for a dark winter weekend when everything outside is frozen slush and you need a bit of adventure and silliness to cheer yourself up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Style Over Substance","review":"This film really deserves 3 1/2 stars, but i decided to be generous and round up. If you are looking for a science fiction film with some substance, this film is not recommended. But if you are looking for a film that has a great and original style, both visually as well as musically, The Fifth Element is for you. It is the unique flavor of this film which makes me enjoy it so much. The costumes, the special effects, the music: they are all great. The characters are all great and wild too, even if a bit unrealistic. Willis is really the only uninteresting character, even though he is the protagonist. Zorg is a great villain.If you want to see a fun, unique film, watch the Fifth Element."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good!","review":"When I first heard about this movie, I said \\"no way!\\" but I got to see it for free at the theatre. I liked it! I was more surprised than anyone about this but this film really is good. The set design, special effects and the way the film does'nt take itself too seriously (which would of killed it) are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST movies ever made.","review":"I am a person who likes well written scripts, good acting, and good direction. This movie is good because the plot is developed and the camera work and shots were visualy stunning. I own this movie and would encourage everyone to buy it as well.

You take an classic like TFE and treat it like a red-headed step child? I mean, this thing was shot in 2.39 and not only do you show us 1920x800, it's horribly grainy. I know it's been said by others, but I just want to let everyone know that they should demand more from the studios releasing Blu-ray discs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a good movie; Blu-Ray remastering holds up well on big TVs...","review":"I chose Fifth Element as one of the titles I'd keep on my shelf to show off the picture quality of Blu-ray on my 59\\"Samsung PN59D8000 Plasma. It was a movie I really enjoyed in the theater back when it was released, mainly due to its hypnotic second half with Chris Tucker and the Diva.Some of the CG leans towards the cartoonish side, but that can be expected given the year of production. Nevertheless, it is rendered cleanly on a large television screen, and I didn't have any trouble at all \\"getting into\\" this film. This release is barren of any noteworthy extras or special features, so if you're looking for more than the movie, this disk may disappoint.The story line progresses quickly, there's a good amount of ironic humor tossed in, and overall my appreciation of Fifth Element is unchanged after watching it again all these years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man, I love this movie!","review":"The Fifth Element is one of my favorite \\"fun\\" movies. It's not meant to be taken too seriously, but it as a great movie to watch. The Ultimate Edition version of the movie gives us one disc with the movie in Superbit format for ultracrisp visuals of a movie that went out of its way to be visually stunning. It also has a second disc with tons of extra stuff on it. One of my biggest complaints with Superbit is that most Superbit movies tend to be totally lacking in extras, because there isn't room for them. This one solves that with the second disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie","review":"This movie was a must have in my collection, and the Ultimate Edition is fantastic.

I think it is a well made movie and I love it so much I purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, terrible transfer","review":"A great sci-fi movie but this is a terrible transfer (there was apparently no attempt to clean up the master before the transfer to HD); my Superbit version of the movie upscaled by my Blu-Ray player looks much, much better.Sony will be releasing an new version with better picture quality sometime soon; they are also working on a program to trade in this poor version for some kind of credit/refund when you buy the new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very cool movie","review":"I LOVE this movie. A definite must-see. I watched this movie for the first time with an ex-boyfriend and I just loved the feeling it gave me. We were watching this movie about the meaning of love and happiness and why Earth should continue to exist...which is for love. It was recently on TV (3 years after I saw it with my boyfriend) and I was so excited that it was on I couldn't do anything else. This movie just always makes me feel so good about life and love...and myself. Definitely a movie that I could watch 100 times in a row and still want to watch again."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD worth the widescreen...","review":"I prefer widescreen. It is a favorite of mine, and the main reason I prefer DVDs is that they can have a widescreen version.

Really cool story line, and some good cheesy moments. You have to love the radio-star!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than \\"The Phantom Menace\\"","review":"This movie obviously took a lot more thought than George Lucas put into his latest Star Wars creation. I refused to go see this movie in theaters because I thought it would be a Star Wars wannabe. I was so wrong. the characters have more personality than any of the characters in George Lucas's movies ever have. Although Bruce Willis gave a typical performance, Chris Tucker made the movie. Tucker steals the show as the extremely flamboyant DJ who gets involved in a plot to save the world by accident. If anyone has not seen this movie, I suggest that you do. It will no doubt become a classic one day."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fifth Element - Better the Second Time Around","review":"This new version of the Blu-ray release is indeed better than the first one and I am very happy with this new-mastering.

But I rented the Blu-ray version and was sorely disappointed at the quality. My first impression, flying through asteroids, was that there was no improvement in quality from the DVD, but it's hard to tell at that point. Then the bright earth scene in the desert flashed in front of me and it looked horrible. It looked like I was watching a dirty copy of a film in a dollar theatre -- and it didn't get any better.

Gaultier costumes, amazing music, and carefully crafted campy situations and lines make this the perfect film to simply sit back and enjoy - just don't try to take things too seriously.

That they didn't make a sequel. I (usually) really hate sequels, and a sequel to this would have blown.

I have tried to keep an open mind but the movie is nothing more than a comic book brought to the big screen or DVD as the case may be. The movie is most similar to Star Wars but is not anywhere as high quality. The Fifth Element has virtually no plot or story line and is really as series of unrelated visual elements. The quality of the sound track is great and perhaps the visual quality of the movie itself is great--but beyond that, there is nothing... I purchased this DVD because Armageddon was fairly good with spectacular special effects and had Bruce Willis in it. I am surprised he consented to be in this movie.

Naturally, my hand swerved towards The Fifth Element. The title was an amazing bit of reference work on standard DVD, and that Superbit version was awesome. Obvious choice, right? Should look amazing in HD. Yeah... it should. But it doesn't. In fact... I'm going to come out and say it looks bad,it is easily the worst looking high-definition title I've seen yet, and I've seen 30+ titles now. The image is muddy looking, lacking in crisp, clean detail. The colors don't quite pop off the screen like they should. This title should not have been released in Blu-ray format. Seriously, if you compare the upscaled Superbit standard-definition DVD to this, the Blu-ray Disc looks only marginally better. This should have been a reference title in high-def and it's not even in the ball park. My brow furrowed in troubled surprise at this point. Wow... and not the good kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BRILLIANT action packed movie.","review":"Ifound this film similar to MIB (Men in Black) I think Bruce Willis played a great part in this once again save the world type movie. Also Chris Tucker played one of the funniest parts I have ever seen in an action film. Over all a film that could be watched over and over again. IT IS EXCELLENT"},{"rating":"2","title":"Want a movie you can watch over and over?","review":"This movie is one of those movies where you can watch it one week, and then the next and not get tired of it. The acting is awesome (especially by Milla Jovovich who I fell in love with after this movie) and Bruce Willis did a perfect tough guy, while Chris Tucker was funny for anyone. The special effects are great, the music is awesome (buy the CD, it's one you can have just playing in the background) and the storyline is fantastic. I pick up something new evertime I watch it. Still dont know the point of the black goo coming from peoples face. Pure evil? ANYWAY BUY THIS MOVIE! It's well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engulfing, Epic Fantasy","review":"This movie blew me away, not only with it's spectacular visuals, but also with it's superb cast and a solid, classic story. Milla Jovovich is absolutely adorable, and Bruce Willis nails his role. Gary Oldman's character must be one of the weirdest, charmingly evil personalities I've ever seen on the screen.Just one problem: it's too short! I could've sat through 3 hours of this! Maybe we'll get a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic movie just got better","review":"This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again and enjoy it every time.Thanks to Blu-Ray, I'm enjoying it even more!The colors are amazing in this transfer! The detail you see in outstanding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still my favorite","review":"This is a classic sci-fi movie with all the trimmings: great looking actress, tough guy actor, action, adventure, great video and sound effects! And the story is decent to boot. The video and Dolby TrueHD sound track is stunning, one of the better transfers to BD out there. This is a very nice edition to a Blu Ray collection and is a one of the better ways to show-off your home theater system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Combination movie","review":"This is one of those movies that has a little bit of everythingin it. If you are feeling like watching a romantic movie and your husband is wating to watch an action flick then this is the movie for you. I like this movie cause it is action packed this get blown up and fights happen not to mention watching a girl kick the crap out of big yucky aliens but it also has its romatic side. Gotta see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fifth Element","review":"Luc Besson does it again, one of his finest films!Sit down with a beer, turn the sound up and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully annoying","review":"Chris Tucker's extremely annoying performance will have you reaching for earplugs, the barf bag, and the off button.

It's an overdone genre with nothing new to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"You either love or hate this movie. I fall into the latter category.The effects are great. It's a wonderful transfer, and the sound is incredible, but let's face it, people, THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE WORST SCI/FI FILMS EVER MADE.ABSOLUTELY EMBARRASSING.Take a lighter and burn your $20. It'd be a better use of your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a worthless movie","review":"I Despise this movie. It makes me physically ill when I even think about it. The premise is retarded, the plot is idiotic, the acting is nauseating, and Milla is the most annoying person I have ever had the misfortune of watching on the screen. If i could, I would have given it ZERO STARS. NO, I would have given it NEGATIVE stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good movie.","review":"The landscapes are very pretty but the storyline, acting, and creatures need alot of work.

Then Ruby Rod appears and steals every scene he's in. I mean come on, the man recored himself having sex, then played it for another girl, it doesn't get any better. The film does have good action sequecnes though, but Tucker still makes it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best SF movies ever made","review":"Excellent movie, brilliantly edited. Touches on most of the great themes of life and does so with vision and verve. The ending is formulaic but it's the only ending that would have worked and by no means is the route to that ending at all formulaic. Superb performances all around. Excellent photography and effects.But if you're slow and your imagination is a bit dull, you will not be able to keep up with this movie and probably won't enjoy it too much either. If you think Star Wars and its sequels are hot stuff, you aren't grown up enough for the Fifth Element."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs Better Treatment on DVD","review":"I can't find anyone that agrees. After seeing this movie in the theatres two summers ago, I knew it was one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made. I'm not too good at reviews so I can't really describe the magic that happens up on screen. One gripe about the DVD, where are the SUPPLEMENTS? I hope some kind of Special Edition is coming out because while the DVD is the best way to see this film, I'd be interested hearing the director talk about his film on a commentary track, I'd also want that amazing teaser trailer, for anyone that remembers it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fifth Element","review":"A cult movie as it was released.

Oh yeah bruce willis."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good glimpse of the future","review":"The plot was OK, but compared to other futuristic movies and tv shows, a very good idea of life in the future. One time, I saw a tv show that took place in 2013 and there were colonies on the moon and mars, and time-travel! I was so shocked, I could feel the electrical current frying my recliner (pun intended). This was very realistic for the 25th century. No aliens. No time-travel. No crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply amazin'","review":"people, just let go of rating every movie like its up for the oscars...this movie was just over the top, graphical and sound madness. The dvd is a definite must own for the home theater fan, especially if you're running 5.1. For your home theater \\"virgin\\" friends, play this or the opening scene to Saving Private Ryan and then ask them for 6 bucks and thank them for coming. Seriously, the movie takes a Besson delusion of grandeur and instead of getting all huffy about love saving the world, makes it funny and worth watching again and again. The characters are caricatures, and each one is funny and amazingly creative on Besson's part. The acting wasn't \\"american beauty,\\" but come on if you still respect Empire Strikes..after you saw Mark's reaction to hearing Darth is his dad; well you can stand this. Buy the DVD, sit back and enjoy this guilty sensory pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"cooll","review":"One off the best movies out their.Highly recommend this movie.this movie is one off those that you want to see over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Movie, but no extras","review":"The movie is fun to watch, but there are no extras included with this DVD.

It's fast paced and vibrant. Gotta love the Gauthier costumes and futuro-dada sets. I love the Ruby Rod character; he's over the top and outrageous. You just have to put aside your own inhibitions and watch him go. Think drag queen gone wild - faaabulous! The entire film has a heightened, frenetic, ultra-vivid feel to it.Until the very end. Unfortunately, the ending is too sappy for my taste. I felt let down by the filmaker; he seemed to be going for cheap sentimentality, rather than finishing the film at the high level of energy of the rest of the film. I tend to stop the movie as the yatch pulls away from Floston Paradise and heads back to Earth. For this reason, 4 stars rather than 5.That said, don't let this keep you from getting this DVD; the rest of the film more than makes up for the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality BLU RAY","review":"I always though that the director's movies are a little bit over the top except <Nikita>This movie is a bit annoying too.But I bought this Blu-Ray disc because this movie is a Science fiction film and I liked the visual.The disc is almost perfect in terms of picture and sound.I wonder when there will be true 7.1 released but other than that, this disc is truly satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dive for Bruce Willis","review":"Did not care for this movie at all --> probably the worst film ever for Bruce Willis.

When the digital sound is on it's absolutely awesome, the plot is original and very entertaining, while I did not like the movie the first time I saw it the second time something snapped and I realised I wanted this film so I got it... on vhs, laserdisc, DVD and got the soundtrack and the game. I love this film, if you haven't seen it see it. If you don't like it the first time, watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"blu ray remastered ... almost very good","review":"Honestly, most of the movie is very nice in the blu ray format. But it is I think quiet a shame when right at the beginning you have this nice overview of the temple and the sky is just THE NOISIEST SKY I HAVE EVER SEEN IN A MOVIE. I mean come on, even a movie that has 640x480 pixels of resolution will display better than that ... later in the first space scene, the white halo around the reactors of the Mondo-shawans spaceship is really noisy too. But when you pass that I guess it is ok. I never had the impression when watching a DVD before that there were good or bad transfers. Since I have the blu ray player and a TV that can actually display some real 1080p I see that at least in the blu ray collection you have good or bad transfers. Luckily we have Amazon reviews to know which one are the good and which are the bad ... about the movie, well I like it a lot so not to much to say about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"The case had minor damage (as listed) but the disc was fine and I am overall happy with my purchase :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too bad no sequel","review":"One of the best Sci-fi movies out there, the visual, wardrobe and opera is enough to sell this movie!

I enjoyed it many years ago and thanks to Amazon can once again enjoy it on DVD. Just a fun, kick back movie....not to be taken too seriously. Humor is thrown in with chases and lots of action. Special effects are pretty good too considering how old it is and how we've become so spoiled by what's being offered up now. Enjoy. Bruce is, as usual, great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fifth Element - Blu-ray","review":"Love the movie and always have -- since this is my first Blu-ray experience, I don't have much to compare it to, but I thought it was great -- the colors and the concept/special effects are something, even after all this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie I have ever seen!","review":"The premise and some of the special effects were good, but the acting was awful! I cant' believe so many people loved this movie. I can honestly say it was the worst movie I ever have seen. My husband and a movie going friend of ours also hated it (and he normally likes quirky movies).One of the reviewers I read said, \\"Wow, look what they did on a $7500.00 budget.\\" Maybe they should have used some of that money for acting lessons for Duke White! I still think that they made the movie with intentional bad acting!I bought this movie solely on these reviews (which I have done many times before) and this is the first time I was steered very wrong. A word to anyone wanting to buy this movie, save your money and don't do it. It is not even worth renting! I wish I could have given it zero stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Are These People","review":"Five stars what do you guys have points on this movie. Easily some of the worst acting and cheesiest special effects I've ever seen in a zombie movie. I don't understand why it is so hard to make a good zombie film these days. What was Night of the Living Dead. Shoe-string budget, unknown actors, no special effects, little makeup, and B&W and it's the greatest zombie film ever. The time it stole from my life is one thing but I actually paid for this. $20 for a movie I watched once, then slamdunked into my garbage can.

More importantly, it works great too. I use it with my Moccamaster, and with the gold tone filter we had before this one (the one that came for free with the coffee maker) we would get a lot of grounds in the coffee and it would sometimes even overflow because the grounds would block the flow of the coffee into the caraffe but not this Krups filter. There's still a little bit of grounds when drinking the last cup--especially if the grounds are on the finer side--but so so so much better than our last filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good for fine grounds","review":"This filter seems like a good idea but in practice it allows far too many fine grounds to enter the pot. This drastically changes the flavor of the coffee and makes the last few cups in the pot completely undrinkable.

However, after seeing how much my son enjoys reading and it (over and over and over again) and how many discussions it has spurred, I am glad I purchased it.

The reoccurring themes of individual's secret struggles and eventual consequences are foreboding and ring true with modern readers.While not comparable to Capote's true masterpieces, this is not a work to discount. At times, the plot is thin; however, Capote's true story is and always will be with his characters.

Now, 25 years later, this set fell into my lap and I am happy to say that I finally understand what all the fuss was about. The one thing that strikes me is that when the end credits roll after each episode, I always look up at the clock because I can't believe it's over already.

I loved this season and was surprised at some of the content given when the show aired. For an 80s cop show this drama is one of the greatest old time/ahead of it's time shows that ever aired on tv. Every episode is filled with suspense, action and great acting that made the show a great one. I encourage people who are a fan of Law and Order, NYPD Blue, Homicide or other cop shows to check this series out.

Glad to see this on DVD. \\"Hill Street Blues\\" is what good television used to be. I miss the early Steven Bochco days. Anyone even thinking about writing a police drama or episodic-cop series needs to pick this up ASAP. Words can't describe how much I miss the quality that a show like this represented. Almost everything on TV now is so formulaic. I'd take \\"Hill Street Blues\\" any day over some of the current mess that's on TV. This show brings back good memories. I hope since it's on DVD that it can reach a new generation. But I'm glad that I had the opportunity to watch it during its original run. Brilliant are the only appropriate words.

In collecting many old TV shows, I thought maybe I was missing something. I never watched Hill Street at the time and now I know why.

I bought both seasons one and two, but could only stand watching about fifteen minutes of episode one and gave up. If I want want silly baloney I'll watch all my old Andy Griffith shows.

This LIVE CONCERT is just so fitting, to remember her on stage, brings back memories. Laura is such a talented singer/artist and has such a great voice. This Best of... Live DVD of the concert in Milan has excellent sound and video quality. The cameras did a marvellous job in capturing every gesture of Laura and her musicians, nice and clear. The best songs are in this concert, one word, AMAZING. Really pumps you up with Non C'e and Il mio Sbaglio Piu Grande, plus the unforgettable ballad, Incancellabile, La Solitudine and Strani Amori.

Congratulations Laura, you have done it so well, once more. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I've never seen Laura Pausini live so I was really excited about this dvd. I knew already that Laura has a magnificent voice but still I was surprised to really HEAR how good it is.Laura sang all of her hits since 1993 'till 2001 and some other songs which weren't on her collection album The Best of: E ritorno da te.Absolutely the best moment is when Biagio Antonacci arrives to the stage to sing Tra te e il Mare with Laura. The audience goes crazy and the whole performance got filled with the friendship between these two artists and the passion which they both have for music. Another thing that I love about Laura's concert is that she makes me love songs which I didn't like before, for exemple Un'Emergenza d'Amore. Also One More Time sounds ten times better live than on the record. The concert isn't just about Laura and her very successful career...she welcomes the fans to be part of it... her music, her show, her life. That's one of the reasons why love and respect her work so much.."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best live performers","review":"I have seen many live performances and i have been disapointed most of the time.

Uniden claimed it must have been a misprint and they were not responsible for misprints. So it was my problem and they wished me luck getting my money back, but sorry it wasn't their problem.

Mao's only concern for China was staying in power, and he couldn't have been less concerned about what would happen after his death. To top it all off, Chen portrays Vietnam and China at war in 1972, when both were allies fending off the U.S. in Southeast Asia. China's falling out with Vietnam actually took place in 1979, as a result of Vietnamese attempts to expand into Cambodia. Serious errors like this made finishing \\"Brothers\\" impossible for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"The concept is interesting; the execution is remarkably poor. Childish and overblown prose, combined with cliched dialogue, makes Brothers diffcult enough to read. When that's combined with a ridiculous story, with improbable coincidences and dangling plot threads, it's hard not to laugh outright as you're reading. I also found the theme of having the brother(Tan) who was raised in luxury also being the hero who could do no wrong a little annoying. So it's not possible for someone raised in poverty(Shento) to be a decent man? ALL of the characters were shallow caricatures, however, and I guess it's easier to make it extremely clear who's good and who's bad. Anyway, I did finish the whole mess, so Da Chen deserves that much credit. Pick it up at a library if you really must read a novel set in modern China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"Childish. Sophomoric. Immature. Stupid. Any other words come to mind? I bought it with high expectations but was let down throughout. Poor character development; an absurd plot. Supposedly an accurate view of China post Mao but the author makes up a person who supposedly was Mao's successor! People act in totally unbelievable ways. There is simply no reason to read this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is too juvenile a work!","review":"The author has a rabid dislike of the Chinese government, and this book is his mechanism for trying to get that point actross. On the way he overstates and exaggerates the issues and problems associated with China, and his attitude is so strong and so transparent, that the story loses credibility.The story itself is sophmoric, relying on chance meetings, people being saved from catastopohe akin to Marlowe's Dr. Faustus, where, if not everything, most things happen for the better. Good guys get rewarded and the bad guys get their come-uppance.Overall, there may be some enlightment in this book on Chinese society before the 1980s but that is not enough of a reason to recommend the book. It is too juvenile a work."},{"rating":"1","title":"High school creative writing project.","review":"This book has some rather good writing but it's spotty and thin and easily overlooked in the ridiculous story and over reaching prose. The writer shamelessly makes the same two or three characters into extremes of everything - if the one character is intellectual, he has to come first in China,when he is rich, he has to be richer than anyone else, if he's in love with a poet, she's no.1 in the country.The other character is of course desperately in love with the same woman and is ridiculously evil..but the author hastens to give us reasons why the one became evil, and keeps a worshipful tone about the heroine throughout, making me feel this was written by a very young writer. I can't imagine taking this seriously enough even to comment on the authenticity of the period, representation of the Govt. etc. The cover art is the best part. (Sorry - I feel I just slammed a young teen's first writing effort)."},{"rating":"1","title":"good start, disappointing finish","review":"This book started well.

The band entered the hotel playing their instruments as if they were in a parade. It was incredible.

WRONG! That's only one of the many ingredients in this almost campy horror flick. DEADLY SPECIES gives us the usual billionaire business man out on a mysterious expedition. A kindly professor, his wife and several of his \\"best\\" students, who all act like prepubescent idiots. Only the studly bodyguard for the businessman exudes any kind of presence, and his role is certainly not challenging. A muddled plot, bad pacing and just all around foolishness make DEADLY SPECIES a rental on an All Night Bad Movie Fest."},{"rating":"1","title":"B Movie Dreams","review":"\\"Deadly Species\\" was made for one reason, to make money off the straight to video market.

I also wondered where the originality of B movie filmmakers went? \\"Deadly Species\\" is no where near my type of film, but I always give credit where credit is due, at least the filmmakers created a movie that's available to public.

But, just because seeing them live in action is preferable to listening to their CD's doesn't mean you shouldn't own them. Buy both Tee-Tot and Desert Shores, they are both worth the price of admission.Now, about this CD. About half of these tracks are still in their live show, and the reason is because they ROCK!

The live performance was shabby at best, with over-the-top stage theatrics that didn't have any point or meaning to anyone except the band. Every song was as bad as the previous one and the crowd seemed happy to have them off the stage after a 45 minute gig.Sadly Throwrag are going down on my list of bands I will steer well clear of in the future. It was such a shame that a truly fantastic band - Queens of the Stone Age - were supported by this c**p. Throwrag were the only bad thing about the entire night, and they replaced the magnificent Eagles of Death Metal.If you want to listen to a decent punk/rock/psychobilly band buy a compilation of the Reverend Horton Heat (Holy Roller) or the Supersuckers (Evil Powers of Rock n' Roll or Sacrilicious)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've worn out my first copy","review":"I've just ordered a copy to replace my condiment stained, well thumbed edition that has endured a busy kitchen for 12 years.

The film seemed grainy and the colors were not as distinct and lifelike as they had appeared in the theater. The audio quality was pretty good, but the narration was a bit on the dull side. The camera shots were done pretty well but we were looking forward to more helicopter fly-by shots through the Grand Canyon itself.I hope they re-do this video from scratch and stick to the high-quality film that IMAX theaters are famous for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woefully Inaccurate!","review":"I was only able to read the first 100 pages of this book.It was filled with so much incorrect information, I returned it for a refund.I presume they did a search/replace for NW5.1 and put in NW6.0They had many facts that were correct about NW5.1 but wrong about NW6.Other facts, were just plain wrong for any version of NetWare.This book did cover many topics, but since it was so bad about the topics that I did know, I was afraid to rely on any of the information about topics that I did not know.Please do not buy this book unless you intend to read Novell's On-Line documentation to allow you decipher what is real and what is not real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expired crippleware CDROM and insufficient depth/details.","review":"I was excited with the 5-user license trial CDROM of Netware 6 that comes with this book, but we soon found out that it actually IS crippleware! It expired last year in 2001, though we tried installing the trial CD only this year Nov2002! So the CD that comes with it is practically useless!. The book itself we found is not detailed enough, lacking in depth of information, as if it was written before Netware 6 was finally released and as if the author was not quite certain of all the details thereby ommitting many of them and leaving the reader in the dark.But seeing that its been about one year after Netware 6 was released but yet there is still a lack of detailed and user-friendly Novell-authorised Netware 6 books available in the world market right now, this book serves as a can-do, in-the-meantime, reference book we can get.

In fact in several places, the book accidently says NetWare 5 when it means NetWare 6 - I think they were cutting and pasting from the NetWare 5 book.

Finally, Fred Rawlins \\"takes on\\" organized religion with startling insights on church wealth, the man-made rules, rituals, requirements, demands and \\"dogma\\" that frequently tend to diserve and ignore those that need spiritual help the most.Good reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soul Growth -- Hard to Follow","review":"YAWN!

Its unlike anything else I've ever heard, and for no reason that I can put my finger on. The effect of it is unbelievable.A real explanation of the music: It's a hard rock album with metallish influences. It's progressive, in a Pink Floyd rather than Dream Theater sort of way. No particular element stands out on its own. Somehow, it all fits together perfectly though, Devin's unbelievable vocals, the guitar and electronic tones, the whispered clips interspersed throughout the cd, the choral moments.... Songwise, Night, Funeral, The Death of Music and Things Beyond Things stand out, but every song is amazing, and fits perfectly in the progression of the cd.True art.

All three composions here are (notably) recorded in full modulate analogue-synthesized sound. \\"Planet Diamond\\" (21:30) is like that good old-fashioned vintage space rock and \\"Love On The Galactic Railroad\\" (19:24) is a generous helping of that traditional out-there cosmic goodness. Since most of Makoto's solo CD's have just two tracks, I sort of thought of the title cut \\"Your Voice From The Moon\\" (33:52) as maybe a bonus song - and a quite lengthy one at that. For it has a heavy 'vibe' and acidic droning feel. Another patron had mentioned to me this disc had a pure 'lysergic' vibe to it. Yeah, no sh**!

I think that the band is very diverse, the way that they can make you shake your head until it falls off, and then make others dance along to their rap beats. Fred Durst is no Jeff Buckley, not that you should ever compare the two. He isn't the best singer that's ever had a record deal, but he's good enough.

If you're like me and bought 3 Dolla Bill Y'all around 2-3 years ago, and are a real fan, \\"Signifacant Other\\" will suck after one playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album Is droppinwisdomandall athjs","review":"This cd is cool Limp bizkit isa da bomb Fred Durst is carrying that grou"},{"rating":"1","title":"not that bad","review":"white zombie style techno -but not as good..... beastie cypress style raps - but not as good..... tool style heavy metal sludge - but not as good..... janes addiction 9 inch style whining - but not as good....the surpising thing is that the album doesnt suck really really bad ......... and that it was able to reach number one. its kind of monotonous. its not great. the guys in the band are total suburban style high school mall geeks. but so are a lot of kids. obviously."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn!!","review":"the line should be \\"I did it all for the money...\\" Limp Biscuit, I mean Limp Bizkit, are boring sell-outs like korn and kid rock. limp bizkit is a bad rap/rock band with an even worse rap/rock CD in a horrible genre:rap/rock. I can't wait until another nirvana or sex pistols comes along to bring ROCK back into rock and roll"},{"rating":"1","title":"FRED NEEDS TO GET PISSED OFF AND YELL MORE, DAMMIT!","review":"Well folks, 3 Dollar Bill Yall was good. This CD isn't. I think Fred's talents are limited to the screaming vocals that I loved off their first disc. Why? Because he just can't rap. Oh yeah, this album has \\"trendy\\" written all over it, so evidently LB doesn't mind making some phat cash now and being \\"nobody's\\" tomorrow, because that is exactly what's going to happen to them I guarantee it. So, all in all, unless you want to look cool while you blast these mellowed-out tunes in your car as you cruise around town for the next 3 months (in 3 months, you trendies will have gone on to some other forms of lifeless music anyway), then steer clear of this album. And to those who are aspiring musicians, KEEP IT REAL AND STOP MAKING EASILY DIGESTIBLE MUZAK. Push the limits, don't just put out whatever's popular at the time (ie LB copying the whole hip-hop/hardcore cross that Korn put out last year)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kicks @#%!","review":"This is directed at all the people out there who hated Significant Other. 3 Dollar Bill Y'all was a great CD and yes, it is very different from Significant Other and you may not like it because it isn't angry, but Significant Other proves the fact that people grow and change musically and the new CD I think is the better of the two. Significant Other just shows a different side of Limp Bizkit, a more mellow and grown up side I believe. This CD is now being played non stop since I got it and I can now retire 3 Dollar Bill Y'all. This CD is nice for hardcore Limp fans, but not for all y'all wannabe fans who can't take change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no, another clone!","review":"This music is anything but original. The lyrics are pathetic, the music is primitive. This cd is meant for suburbian teens who are too petty for \\"gangsta rap\\" and too dumb for even mainstream alternative. The idiots who made such music (korn, RATM etc) are making millions on dimwits like themselves. Horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak lyrics and soft music","review":"Alright... it breaks down like this... The first four songs are great, hard hitting, hip hop lyrics true Korn/Limp Bizkit style. Then they break into this melodic garbage, painfully reminiscent of Sprung Monkey or Sugar Ray. What LB has done is created a song (Nookie) that they play on the radio and MTV that alot of people will like. Then when you buy the CD you get mindless drivel. That song I'm broke, Fred, my man, do you have a ten year old brother who wrote those lyrics (\\"...get a job like you should, jerk\\" Jerk, jerk? Did you just call someone a jerk? Oh the horror!)? I'm really disappointed, I was really looking forward to Limp Bizkit getting better with age, like Korn..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Softer then expected, but still good.","review":"Significant Other was good, but I expected it to be better. Three Dollar Bill (The first album), was a hard hitting album that rocked all the way through. This one still rocks, but it seems like it gets softer in the middle of the songs, especially during the chorus. However Significant Other is a much deeper and much better written album then the first. Excellent tracks on this CD are \\"Just Like This\\", \\"N 2 Gether Now\\", \\"Show Me What You Got\\", \\"No Sex\\", and of course the smash hit, \\"Nookie\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd sucks compared to 3 Dolla Bill Yall...","review":"Limp Bizkit sold out... and thats all there is to it. The only good songs on this cd are break stuff and no sex, the rest are MTV crap. Their first cd was all about real stuff and hardcore music, now its blown to hip hop stupid crap music... im sorry limp bizkit, but i lost the faith in ya!"},{"rating":"1","title":"why?","review":"Why did I buy this? Nookie seemed like it was a good song when i purchased significant other. However listening to it for a few times got really boring. The other songs like re-arranged don't really help in the process because they too also get really boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was too generous","review":"You may have read my review where I gave them 2 stars. I was wrong, this does not deserve 2 stars. Not even Scott Weiland and Jonathan Davis could save this album. It's that bad. \\"N2gether Now\\" is just Fred attempting to rap, and doing a ...poor job at it, Method Man(being the MUCH, MUCH, MUCH better lyricisist) makes him sound even worse. Like I said before, Fred should be grateful that people who actually have talent are willing to share a mic with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I believe this is one of the best rock cds of the decade.

There really isnt any meat, it reminds me of glam metal. No real feeling, just picked a market, and made songs to fit the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new era - s**t music makes millions","review":"The new rap/rock combo has been getting major bucks but the actual sound of the music is horrible. There's no beat and the guitar mind-as-well be a noise maker. The rap is \\"hardcore wanna be\\". Fix up the style, because there's nothing worth buying here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgrace to the American metal scene","review":"Limp Bizkit is the perfect example of everything wrong with the American heavy music scene. The lyrics are unbelievably cliched, the music is poorly executed, and there is almost no real melody. I'm sorry if that hurts,but it's the truth. This \\"band\\" is quite awful. All of the songs are verse-chorus-verse, with no progression. The same chords are used repeatedly, with the same pattern. This is why Norway and Sweden have much better scenes. Those countries don't bow to trends, they create them, perfect them, and then surpass them. Don't waste your money on Limp Bizkit, buy some Iced Earth or Shadows Fall, both bands who do the American scene proud. We'll beat those Scandinavians yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Limp is exactly what they are","review":"Limp Bizkit...Pioneers in the Death Metal Arena. \\"Significant Other\\" marks the return of their speeding thrashy riffs and blistering extended guitar solos. The double kick drums are a metal tour de force while Fred's raspy growls and lung fired screams embody the very essence of metals true nature. With the bands current line-up they are sure to tour with Metal vets such as the ever vigilant Whitesnake , the blood drenched raw power of Hootie and the Blowfish, and of course metal greatest vocalist and master of orignality Kid Rock. Had Limp Bizkit kept their repetitive beats, Rap-influenced whiney vocals and slow uninspired drums this album may have sucked. The hint of sarcasm in this reveiwers tone can only be summed up as...Priceless."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should be banned off the earth","review":"Limp Biskit should just stop. Calling this good music is like calling paint fumes healthy. Their music is the most immature music I ever heard. No heart, no soul, no intelligence. The lyrics could have been written by me in 4th grade. All Limp Biskit has going for them now is a seal of approval by MTV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh lordy lordy, somone shot gordy","review":"This album leaves much to be desired, in fact the only redeeming part of Limp Bizkit, and especially Fred Durst, is that they agreed to be part of an ECW story-line. In fact, ECW has better music than anything Limp Bizkit has done, with the possible exception of that thing with Method Man...but that's just b/c it's funny. This goes out to all the teenage girls out there: BUY METALLICA STUFF. It's good music, unlike this. And Amazon has great deals on their stuff now, just search under Metallica...and don't worry about Fred Durst; he'll still have his job as a VP over at whatever company owns Limp Bizkit, so he'll have money and can show up on MTV for you to ogle in that position. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"pitiful","review":"i've heard far better. they're trying to be cool or something putting out mindless lyrics and some semi interesting guitar riffs. the only song i found worth listening to is no sex but the rest are repetitive and sound the same. a waste of money in my opinion"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only significant","review":"Limp Bizkit is the original and everlasting Rock-Rap king for me, so it ain't a surprise coming out of my mouth that this cd rocks. Along all those rocking melodic shouting are also a couple of slow songs, which are good too but not too much for my taste. My favourites are Nobody Like You and Nookie. Anyway, you like anything like this you gotta buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Limp Bizkit Rocks On\\"","review":"The boys from Limp Bizkit come out guns a blazin' with their recent release entitled \\"Signifigant Other.\\" The album is saturated with testosterone-fueled aggression spewed by Bizkit leadman Fred Durst that will make you scream for more. Durst masterfully tells tales of anger with each passing lyric. Be sure to listen to this album when you are looking to unleash some anger. Tracks such as \\"Break Stuff\\" and \\"I'm Broke,\\" will pump up your adrenaline to freakish levels. Furthermore, Dursts'rhyming skills are seen on the two best songs the album has to offer. The songs \\"Nookie\\" and \\"N 2 gether Now\\" are classic Durst displaying his rich talents for rapping to a heavy beat. Overall, \\"Signifigant Other\\" is an album true to the unique style of Limp Bizkit. It puts the band on the map as a force to be reckoned with their funky fresh style of rap and rock . This album is definetly a must-buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More hardcore covers of 80's pop comin' at ya","review":"The band that would be Korn, except there already was a band called that is back with more wax for the white male 17-24 fraternity crowd. \\"Oh, wow this is like the best thing to happen to me since like, Ozzfest!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you give reviews","review":"how can all of you people give reviews?

I really do think that they show what good rock/rap music is.

They attempt to combine lame hip-hop and lame metal to create an album which only people will buy because it is \\"popular\\". The lyrics are trashy and terrible as is the whole album. Was any effort or output put into this record at all? For good metal try Soulfly, Pantera, or Spineshank or for good hip-hop try The Roots, Pharcyde, or Tribe Called Quest but don't waste your money on this album.

They have released another album to disgrace metal or should I say music in general. If you people think this is real metal, you must be retards. I thought metal was Chunchy / sludgy guitar riffs, death, drugs, depression, humor, bluesy stuff, long hair, insane drumming, raging guitar solos, great vocals. Not this nu metal, rap, sh*t. This album sucks just like all of limp bizsh*ts albums. This music is annoying and a bunch of bull sh**. If you want real metal, get black sabbath, led zeppelin, ACDc, Alice in chains, Metallica, megadeth, pantera, Ozzy osbourne, even Rush and cream can be metal at times.

Fred Durst makes it obvious that he has some problems with his ex, but otherwise it is a well put together album."},{"rating":"1","title":"a grossly overrated band","review":"I think Limp Bizkit could be a much better band if they dropped the hip-hop angle. It interferes with what could be good music. The only reason I grudgingly gave this 2 stars is Wes Borland's cool guitar tone. This album doesn't show us anything we haven't seen before. Though Fred Durst isn't necessarily a bad singer, his exaggerated hip-hop/urban persona has got to go. This band may be popular in the short term but do you honestly think they can keep up this schtick 10 years from now?

There have been rap-metal (yo-core) bands long before Korn and Bizkit, that have done it much better. Try checking out Downset or E-Town Concrete, theyve got actual thought out lyrics, focusing on things in society that need to be changed, not just whining about some girl that they wanted to get laid with.

The most meaningful lyrics are \\"Should've kept my pants on this time, instead you let me dive right in.\\" Can you say worthless? I have to say, the only song that didn't burn my ears was the one with Jon Davis, but it was still just mediocre. My advice is to listen to the songs on MTV, and pass on buying the CD.

Where's the raw, edgy power? Maybe it will get them on TRL if that's what they are going for. Look at the other artists on there. A great group!?? The songwriting is quite bad. I should've known when Carson Daly loved this album. Maybe I'm being too hard on them after a few listens and maybe I'll grow to like it. This album comes nowhere close to the original.

I will give Fred and Limp credit for one thing though, they can market themselves. They make all these insecure high school kids think that they have some kind of connection with them.

Bad points: his performance only emphasizes how truly awful Limp Bizkit are without someone who actually understands hip hop lending a hand, and how lame Fred Durst is as a rapper and lyricist by comparison. Rap and Heavy Metal make a potent combination if done right (Rage Against The Machine, Faith No More, Anthrax & Public Enemy); this is a textbook example of how to do it wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Played out","review":"What is this garbage?

They truly do suck terribly, I was only a kid when I first heard of Limp Bizkit back in '97 and didn't realise how bad thier music was. Well now I know, they try so hard to be metal, but fail on SOOOO many levels, and just ends up being pop music for idiots who think they're 'trendy' or 'hip' by purchasing this crap!Do yourself a favour fellow CD buyer reading this, get 'Hangover Music' by the legendary Zakk Wylde instead, at least that is an album that DOESN'T suck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Faultless rap-rock perfection","review":"i feel that Significant Other is just fantastic from start to finish. i think that it was good for Limp Bizkit to start changing there style, because TRUE artists don't constantly repeat there same sound over and over again on each album. they evolve and experiement with new musical styles despite what all the fans stuck in the past think. i highly recommend this album.10/10"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...","review":"limp bizkit is pathetic.

Let's compare this band with Korn and Nine Inch Nails. Both Korn and Nine Inch Nails, while not being pioneers in the genre, both pushed the genre ahead. Both turn what, outwardly, sounds like noise into rhythmic and beautiful music. Both have great songwriting skills, thier lyrics are clever and well written. Both seem to take their profession very seriously and are very emotionally attached to their music. Then, there is this. This is just poorly written, and performed, music. Fred Durst seems to not take his music seriously at all, and it shows in his not so clever lyric writing skills. The songs are unbalanced and uneven. This is a sixteen track monstrosity, that does not deserve a place on the shelf, let alone high sales. This is the music, along with Kid Rock, that represent the loss of music as an art medium. I am extremely saddened at the state of music today."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"great work\\"","review":"I gave this album 1 star because I only think \\"rearranged\\" is worth listening to.

The lyrics seem to be written by a 4 year old. The riffs on this album can be played by anyone that has seen a guitar. The guest appearences are lame and probably thrown in as some way of crossing over to a hardcore rap audience (i.e. Method Man). Scott Weiland's cameo is unexplainable.

Nookie is still their strongest record. It sounds like the drummer was barefooted when he hit the drums in the song. But there are some flat numbers like Rearranged. The pace of the song is BORING! Good groove, but a very boring pace sometimes. A few times, I went to sleep when I heard the song. There seems to be an '80s feel in some of the songs and Fred Durst's raps tend to range from normal to offensive to outlandish. They stick to the same song formula, rapid pace, then a slow breakdown before their big crashing endings. But the lyrics are corny and flat in some places. Even some of the song titles sound stupid. So I just don't see this as their breakthrough. Just don't see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"More hard than \\"Limp\\".","review":"Remember in 1999 when these guys were everywhere and seemed inescapable? It was mostly because of what's on \\"Significant Other\\". Not only was it released at the peak of their popularity, but it's also probably their best album. It's full of great tracks, including the aggressive \\"Break Stuff\\", \\"Re-Arranged\\", and the monster hit \\"Nookie\\", but songs like \\"Show Me What You Got\\" and \\"Just Like This\\" rock as well.

Further proof that no matter how hard we try to deny it, us white people will never get it right.

VERY DISAPPOINTING.........","review":"I thought I listened to all the bad music out there until I listened to this CD. I first thought Limp Bizkit was one of the distinctive and powerful groups which stood out from those trendy music crowd of the 90s. I guess I was wrong. I liked some songs like \\"Re-arranged\\" and \\"n 2 gether now.\\" But they got old after listening to it couple of times. Other songs ranged from simply horrible to fair. I think it is because they have very immature, and shallow music and lyrics, uninteresting at best. The voice of the lead singer is annoying and overly repetitive(no creativity) and the guitarist is simply not skilled enough to make good music. He just cranks up the bass and distortion and plays simple, plain, boring riffs over and over. The bassist is pretty good though. I think this group can be great if they improve on their horrible musical skills instead of just trying to be bad who wants to get laid too much....(just my opinion people.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"You clowns wouldn't know a good cd if it humped your leg.","review":"What did we do to deserve this?

This is a travesty to metal. This is pimp\\\\jock\\\\lowlife rock. Limp Bizkit's music is the most immature music that I have ever heard in my life. No heart, no soul, no intelligence, and no talent. It sickens me that some 30 year old fool from the trailer park is trying to be 16 and use cuss words to gain popularity. I couldv,e written those lyrics when I was in kindergarden. This is not rap either. Real rap is street. This is nothing but suburbia garbage for the brainless mallrats of America. The music itself is nothing feel proud about. Two chord noise that sounds worse than screeching a chalkboard is enough to make me want to turn off this CD at about three seconds upon starting.

Limp Bizkit desperately tries to cash in and copy Korn's success. Fred Durst is anything but a singer, with his whiny, thin voice that makes me sick. Wes Borland should spend more time trying to learn how to play his guitar than worrying about his face-painting games. These guys are a joke. Their only success lies in the rebellious teenagers who buy these albums to piss their parents off. For a band who succeeds at what LB is trying to do, check out Korn's first and second albums.

All of the songs are wonderful, I love it. Limp Bizkit is the only rap group that I listen to. I especially love the song Break Stuff. I love listening to this song when I'm angry or pissed off at someone. I sing (actually I tend to scream) along with the song and I feel just peachy afterwards. And the song No Sex...god...what a song! It's full of so much overwhelming feeling. I'm listening to it now. This song represents the US totally. It fills me with so much feeling...I listen to it whenever I need an inspiration with something that I'm writing or when I'm sending a sad/depressing/upsetting note to someone.

But surely this cannot be a bad thing, since the album is still neatly constructed, produced, and executed as well as their first album. Songs such as \\"Nookie\\" easily exploit the band' ability to blend metal and hip hop, while sever other songs feature phat hip hop induced beats by DJ Leathel, only to be backed up by the remainder of the band (John, Wes, and Sam). This album may be diffrent than their first album, yet it is as good as ever.

This CD has a few good moments, such as tracks 2,3, and 5. Other than that, it's a piece of trash. Fred Durst can't rap. He's not funny. He cannot sing.

I loved 3 Dollar Bill Y'all, but this is just depressing. Method Man? Get real. What happened to the time when Limp Bizkit and heavy metal were in the same sentence together. They used to be one of my favorites. But what happened, it seems that when a great underground heavy metal band all of a sudden becomes popular because they're on MTV every day something happens to them. Maybe they feel they need to write music that everybody will like so they can keep a large fan base, Which should not be an artist's main goal.

What it is good at is sucking and blowing, neither of which I'm a fan for.If you have half a brain, let alone half a brain cell, it will tell you not to buy this album but rather to steal it and burn it in a ritualistic like fashion. Limp Bizkit deserves to be slapped in the face a million times for this.I wish that Limp Bizkit would just stop with this silly charade and try to make music for once, maybe it will be good for a change.

Just the teenagers stupid enough to fall into this blatant marketing scheme. How pathetic does one's mind have to be in order to discover that \\"cookie\\" rhymes with \\"nookie\\" and endlessly repeat the two. Give me a break.

Calling this band metal is an insult to good bands like Slayer, Black Sabbath, Metallica, Deicide, and Meshuggah. Calling this band Music, is insulting people such as BB King, John Lennon, Roger Watters, Jimmy Page, Jimmy Hendrix, Kurt Cobain, Trent Reznor, and all of TOOL. And Calling Fred Durst's \\"Lyrics\\" anything but APE LIKE is an over statement! Fred Is the worst singer ever, and this band is as annoying as N'sync!

Of course those TRL kids just jumped on it. Nobody Like You at least has Jon Davis' vocals which help out. I really can't stand N2Gether Now. Partly because of the fact that Method Man appears and secondly because I really find it wrong for a white boy to try to get credentials in the rap community. Eminem is the only one who can get away with that. But he's not a damn redneck hick like Fred Durst. Rearranged is just a sad attempt at a ballad.

Limp Bizkit, Fred Durst, has no vocal talent and the hip-hop-rock conglomeration is done all wrong. They don't have any style or suavity, they merely mesh the two styles together into a crude, boring, intellectual-less and (low i.q) appreciative style. The tunes are just noise, with no form in any way and Fred Durst has an identity crisis. He thinks he's black but he isn't. His futile attempts to seek other artists to abet his record, displays the depravity and overwrought nature of the band. If you want a REAL hip-hop-rap-metal fusion, then turn to RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE, the best of the rap-rock confluence. Limp bizkit doesn't have any talent and their popularity is just based on insipid idiotic masses of the nation (namely teenagers) who do not know how to distinguish a quality rock/rap from junk music."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a joke","review":"Don't waste your money.

I love the way they integrate hip hop and rock, something that should be done by more bands and probably will be. They are reminiscent of Sublime in that way. Their first album is a little more hardcore, than their new cd, but I actually really like the new one. I read some articles before it came out on their new songs, and the artists they were working with. Wu-tang is so tight, and I was getting really excited to hear their new sound. They definitely have something good going on here, and although they're getting a little played out because of demented dj's, I am still lovin' it. I'm happy for them to be getting so much attention and I don't think they've sold out.

If you don't like this CD and say that 3dby was better then you probably need to expand your horizons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow Im disappointed in andreaabs...","review":"I thought he liked real metal and then gives this 4 stars??? Hmmm, very odd.But seriously what else did you expect me to give this dreck??!! Why did Fred have to always act like an obnoxious a-hole all the time and try to be tough? I don't get it man, I just don,t and never did either, even back in 8th/9th grade when this came out. I have to admit I think metalcore is worst though and so is Kanye Waste. I hate when those metalcore fa**ots scream like p*ssies, it pisses me off. DIE LIMP BIZKIT DIE!

Oh, I can really tell the producers spent a lot of time on Nookie, theres like basically only one line to YELL in each song. I can't belive it went number one."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album from an underdeveloped group","review":"LB as a group seems VERY underdeveloped. For example it seems as if Fred Durst's voice was given an \\"electric\\" effect which was probably done to give the tracks some more substance. The rhymes are primitive. This is definitely apparent when Fred raps alongside Method Man on \\"N 2 Gether now\\" who rips up the track and leaves Durst in the dust. Also, the lyrics are very immature and drab.So why did I give this album 4stars? I'm pretty much a hip-hop & techno fan, so I have to say that I'm impressed with the beats and baselines on tracks 2,3,5, and 13. Must be DJ Lethal (who IS the group's secret weapon). These tracks were JUST AMAZING! Driving and pumping the volume on these tracks is an awesome experience. LB's energy and enthusiasm is their main hook. And I like this CD even though I'm not a white, suburban teenager..."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd kicks","review":"I love this cd. I first only bought this cd for \\"nookie\\". I then started to litsten to all of the other songs and I love them.

This is a great background music for making love.Too bad they don't have 20 stars on here.....Peace,Love,Ya'll"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Hey, another 15 songs about Durst's girlfriend, another band lost in the media sludge, the pop meatgrinder, another albummade for the people instead of by the band. TDBY was a good effort, thy had potential, but instead we have something only a few steps away from the spice girls. Bizkit became a corporate run money machine, a very common thing these days. Fred stopped screaming and teenage girls began lining up to buy this cd, simple as that. Somebody told them what they had to do to make the big cash, and they did-by making the musical equivalent of oatmeal, easy to swallow, goes down without a fuss, requires nothing on the part of the listener. It is a slightly sad day for lovers of the rollin'metal groove, but not to sad. There are bands-Tool, Clutch, Machine Head-that deserve the attention and respect. Bizkit will soon go away and everyone here who gave a five star review will not notice from their pop-drivel of the moment coma."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must-have for both rock and rap fans alike","review":"I'm not the biggest rock fan in the world but I love rap. Limp Bizkit makes a steady blending of rap and rock with the hardcore rock riffs and rap lyrics. My favorite song on the album is \\"n 2gether now\\" featuring Method Man from my favorite rap group the Wu-Tang Clan. That is my favorite song but most of them are good. Another song worth checking out is \\"Just Like This\\". I recomend this album to rap fans who sometimes like to bang their heads and get rowdy. I also can recomend this to any rock fan because these guys can play!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good CD","review":"I'm not a fan of any music that has the word \\"Rap\\" in it. But Limp Bizkit got that idea out of my head. I still hate rap, but this \\"Metal Rap\\" type of sound on this album is very good. I heard \\"Faith\\" when it came out, and during that time, you could tell Fred was trying to be like Phil Anselmo from Pantera. But on their new album you can tell he worked on his vocal talent, and it really shows. Hell, he can actually sing. The highlight song on the album is more then likely \\"Nookie,\\" a song which will kick your a$$. So if you're in for an album that will make you want to break windows, buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave it on the shelf!","review":"This cd is nothing compared to their first album. Fred Durst hit a bunt on this one yall. The only song I can give some props to is the track with Method Man. The rest of the songs are duds. No doubt this cd is for the population not the real limp fans. I was offended to hear the soft beats and \\"significant\\" decline in bass quitar. All in all, try to find Three Dollar Bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did the hard edge go?!?!?","review":"What did they do to their music? Where is that raw hard edge sound that made the band popular on their first CD. I was so disappointed when I heard this new album. I loved their first album because of its energy, power, and raw metal sound along with Fred's unique style of screaming and whining. But they lost it...they sound like they're trying to become a rap group rather than a hip hop/metal band. Its not a terrible CD, I've heard much worse. Its worth checking out to make your own opinion but I think they're making a big mistake with this change."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're getting soft but still harder than most.","review":"Listen, nobody loves this band more than I do. I honestly believe that this album is better than 99% of the music that's on the shelves today, but after listening to it three or four times I formulated the opinion that I was really looking for the Limpsters to impress me a bit more than they had. But I still like it and listen to it every day. I say buy it, let it grow on ya for a bit, then go listen to their first album. You'll make up your own mind! Better yet, put both of their albums in regular rotation along with KoRN, Incubus, Tool, HedP.E., Soul Fly, R.A.T.M., Def Tones, and a few other such bands and they'll sound even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty pathetic","review":"The singer is just full of himself amoung other things.

Limp Bizkit has potential to become a great speed metal bad, but this album proves a high failure. The album has tasteless cheap rap mixed with pieces of heavy metal music that are great, but just pieces ! You know the band has a cool name, it reminded me of a band of the eighties called Laaz Rocket- Fred Durst has to improve in feeling the light when it comes to singing. The only thing good about this album is the front cover with the kid rapper strutting his stuff, and the band's logo on the Cd, and that is it. Limp Bizkit should write music and songs that compare to Ice T's Cop Killer, and with the great heavy metal rhythms that Overkill plays on their albums.{a heavy metal band-and a respected one}. If you want an album that has cheezy music with no effort at all buy this album, but if your looking for an album that has great music, and vocals, buy another album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album rules","review":"This album rules and Fred Durst is hot I love the song nookie and re-arragnged and i love the song nobody like you.

There are so many better groups out there. First of all I don't understand why they have to cuss so much, it shows their lack of talent for writting lyrics. If you want to hear a truly good Hip-Hop Hardcore band try \\"The Fundamental Elements of Southtown,\\" by P.O.D. (Payable On Death). They formed in 1992, so they are technically the first Rap-core band.

Gather up a few random people who have just touched their instruments and have them start a band and see. These songs can be learned by anyone in a couple of minutes. However, talent is not the only criterion for being a good band, IMHO. Maybe if a band has at least intelligent lyrics it could make up for lack of talent, but, judging by Limp Bizkit's most popular song that goes \\"I did it all for the nookie, so you can take that cookie and stick it in your a$$\\" it's quite obvious that not only do they lack talent, but they're a little short in the brains department as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleeeeeeze!!! This Is Kid's Stuff...","review":"Limp Bizkit has got to be the trendiest band of all time. Everything about these guys, from the way Fred Durst controls their whole little empire (like a talentless Billy Corgan) to how they try to pass off this whole rap/rock fusion as something new (Rage are the real innovators). I was embarrassed to listen to this CD! I didn't even pay for it and I still felt ripped off!! It's just song after song of wannabe thrash filled with brain-dead lyrics (\\"stick it up your...YEAH!!!) What a waste of time. My friend kept having to shake me to wake me up.

I could listen to $3 dollar bill front to back with out hitting the track skip at all, but unfortantly I'm skipping all over the place with this one.

But that was a long time ago and my musical taste and knowledge have matured greatly since then. Anyway, back to this album. It [stinks]. The only Limp Bizkit album I still enjoy is their first one. It was much heavier, more complex, and it was back when Fred Durst wrote meaningful lyrics. Please don't buy this or the even worse \\"Chocolate Starfish And The Hotdog Flavored Water\\".

Just so all you kiddies know, bands DO have a choice as to release an album where they freely express their art (however stupid it may be) with no censorship. Limp Bizkit has chosen twice to sacrifice whatever integrity they have just so they can put their albums in Wal Mart and other such unconstitutional institutions.

I never really liked them even during the 3 dollar bill yall days, because the sound quality and lyrical quality of that album (and this one) were absolutely juvenile. Titles like \\"Break Stuff\\" show the lack of thought that Fred Durst puts into his lyrics. The music is just absolutely soulless rap-metal that 311 and Rage do with much more complexity and conviction. If you want solid rap-cum-metal, 311 and Rage are your best bets.

I've honestly heard better musicians at my high school. The songs have weak lyrics with little meaning. I don't even know what kind of music it is supposed to be for sure. Its not rap, alternative, heavy metal, or pop. Its pretty much just noise. My friend told me these guys rocked so I bought the cd. When I popped it in, I was like \\"what the heck is this? \\".

It's just like Nirvana never came. Re-arranged isn't half bad(there's actually an element of songwriting.). Nookie has the intensity of the best Rage songs, but the lyrics are so stupid. I don't blame LB for Woodstock '99, but when your fan base is angry teenage boys, what can you expect. Selling a lot of records doesn't earn the respect of anyone whose opinions matter.

The Fred Durst Abomination (otherwise known as Limpbizkit) could not dissapear soon enough. If you want to hear true rage and passion in hardcore music, throw on Slipknot's new one or even an old Helmet album. Skip this overhyped pile of monkey waste and try growing a brain. And remember kids, just because its on MTV doesn't mean its good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music for people who can't appreciate good musicianship.","review":"\\"scores of people seem to be oblivious of the fact that this is THE MOST ORIGINALE ALBUM in years.\\" No. \\"First, Fred has the highest male vocal variety.\\" No. You must have never heard a talented male vocalist before.\\"lyrics just scream with the 1999 reality.\\"No. \\"Guys, get real, this is the best, most original, no-nonsense album in years.\\"No. If you can't appreciate good musicianship buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music for the intellectually deprived","review":"According to the guidelines for writing reviews I'm supposed to focus my comments on the album's content.

This one sounds even more commercial and radio-friendly (is that possible?) than Limp Bizkits debut. I would say these guys sold out, but they never had an ounce of musical integrity to begin with. Wes Borland still quite hasn't found out how to operate the basic mechanics of the guitar, with the most repetitive and simple riffs I have ever heard. And of course wigger Fred Durst yells the typical inane lyrics that make surburban white kids drool. Overall a pitiful excuse for an album (does make for a nice coaster though). If you are a true independent-thinker you will not let MTV dictate what you listen to and reject all the weak trends the corporate suits of the industry spew. Don't allow yourself to be just another sheep in the herd, skip pass this album and search for music you like. In a few years Limp Bizkit will be laughed at just like Vanilla Ice and Milli Vanilli are now."},{"rating":"1","title":"From an appalled listener.","review":"As it has become painfully obvious to my contemporaries that I only bother to review bands and/or albums that I loathe, I will now launch into a scathing criticism on both this band and this album.This is a bloated and conceited effort at venting, through the eyes of a fourteen year old, the troubles and turmoils of the modern middle-aged man. Surrounded by, if not drowning in, a sea of mediocre musical masturbation, we hear a complacent Durst whinge and whine his way through a maelstrom of real-life issues such as fumbling first sexual experience, anger, hatred, disgust, boobs, girlfriends who cheat and the like.The only reason this album is worth pursuing is the guitarist, and he left, and good on him.I sold this album on the flea market.

Their songs are still common aggro-rock, And Fred has no lyrical skill whatsoever. He raps like a 13 year old kid at a school talent show. Hamfisted guitar work, and beats that I've heard on a dozen other albums. I don't care what they say, they have no sense of expanding melody. And a quick word of advice to DJ Lethal, and the rest of the band. Scratching the band's name and Method Man's name is not clever.

If anyone wants to hear the downright most abrasive album, it would have to be White Light White Heat by the Velvet Underground. Unbelievably raw, it will hurt your ears. Limp fans, just give up.

Why are Limp Bizkit on the cover of Rolling Stone?

Surely after hearing such brilliance, everyone will forget this Korn/Limp Bizkit/Sevendust tripe. Limp Bizkit might pump out loud \\"pissed off\\" music to reel in the 15 year olds, but they've completely forgotten that songwriting is a *craft* - there's no songcraft here, no invention, no artistry. It's so sad. The five artists above had more talent in their collective pinky fingers than Limp Bizkit will ever have. Popular music used to show creativity.

Their older stuff from Three Dollar Bill had more driven, hardcore and deep lyrics and lots of complex chord progressions. Songs like, \\"Counterfeit\\", \\"Stuck\\", and \\"Indigo Flow\\" really blew me away. But, their new album, Significant Other, really doesn't have all the driven, hardcore and deep guitars and lyrics. Fred Durst is a very talented songwriter, and has written some nice lyrics for the new album, but they just don't live up to their first album. Durst has collaborated with a few new friends on the album, such as Jonathan Davis from KoRn and Method Man. I like this album alot, but it's very light, and driven more towards the rap and hiphop side of their music. If you really want a good hardcore album that you will want to listen to over and over again, I recommend Three Dollar Bill.

And once they've ceased petulantly stomping their feet like little troglodytes that haven't gotten their waterdishes filled, they turn their contempt towards ex-girlfriends ('Nookie' and 'No Sex').Don't bother looking for any progressive or tentative elements in \\"Significan Other', or you'll set yourself up for a let down of the Millennium Bug kind.

This would've been a great album to exercise that."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the WORST BAND EVER!!!","review":"I would give this CD a rating of zero stars if possible. Their sound is terrible and in no way should it be considered music. I don't see how people sit down and listen to this trash. When people use curse words in their music they think they are good or that the use of the words makes them good. That makes me sick that people could even call this music!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No-talent album","review":"I do not automatically dislike any music classified as \\"rap-metal,\\" but like any genre of music, there are good bands and there are not-so-good bands. LB tries to play music that is both rap and metal, but their music fails to sound good in either genre. The guitar riffs are some of the worst in the genre, and the singing is not true \\"rapping\\" either. The good production, synthesizers, & \\"scratching\\" (what a gimmmick!) cannot disguise the essential lack of talent. Other \\"rap-metal\\" type bands, notably Korn, Slipknot, & Run-DMC (I love their song \\"Raising Hell\\") are far better than this. (The songs from LB's debut album that I've heard are considerably better, but still not great, btw.) The reason that this gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because the band plays their own music unlike you-know-who. If they improve their songwriting & guitar playing skills, they could record a good album, but this one shows that they are not skilled enough yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another bad album from another rap/rock band","review":"This has got to be the worst album of the 90's. I listened to this album after hearing how great it was, and was very dissapointed. I can't think of a single redeming quality to this album. Everything about it is bad. Nevertheless, I must be open minded, so I'll list both the pros and the cons.Cons: Fred Durst can't sing; Fred Durst can't rap; the lyrics are childish and badly written; Fred Durst's vocals are very annoing; Wes Borland sucks at guitar; every song is about bad relationships, with the exception of \\"Break Stuff\\"Pros: Fred Durst, as well as the rest of the band, is extreamly loyal to their fans.Well, off hand, I'd say that there are more cons than pros, so do yourself a favor, and avoid this album at all costs. 10 years from now, you'll find this in a bargin bin somewhere, and you'll actually laugh at the thought that there are people who actually bought this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARGH! What were the record companies thinking?","review":"This is the WORST album I've heard to date! Even a deaf person would hate this album! Anyone can scream into a microphone and sell it for money! I'm glad another decade is coming, maybe they'll be dumped back into the garage they came from and stay there for good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An unbeatable import, four edited videos","review":"Well, for those of you wondering what an import has that you don't already have, this review will focus on what you don't have. First off, the CD is great, then second within the jewel case there is a bonus disc, containing four tracks. Break Stuff which is already on the album. You get a new track called Crushed, their first hit Faith and finally a remix of Counterfeit which sounds better than the original with a new melody backing Fred's vocals. Finally, there is a huge CD Extra when you put it into your CD ROM, four videos, that are not full screen. The unfortunate thing about the videos is the lyrics are edited (no swears, no middle fingers like on MTV). There is an additional few seconds on each video from the originals on MTV, making this a true collector's item. Five star import all the way, one of the best imports in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bimp Lizkit","review":"I don't know how these guys still have fans because they could be quiet possibly the worst band I have ever heard. They bring shame to rap, hip-hop, rock and any other kind of music they sample in to make themselves look good, and Fred Durst is the biggest sissy alive. Pick this one up if you love TRL, N'Stink or any of that other commercial mindless junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Hot","review":"Re-aranged and Break stuff are the only really good songs on the whole alblum. N2gehter now and Nokkie are ok, and it sounds as though a good 20 minutes was invested into writing the filler for rest of the alblum. The four singles, which are mentioned above, are the only songs that sound as though any effort was really put into at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply the worst music on the face of the Earth.","review":"This is so bad,that somebody could not pay me money to buy this disc. Well maybe if it was the amount.In the end I say: don't buy it. If your one of those who has no individualidy (which is spelled wrong), then you might consider buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You may want to listen to real music","review":"I usually don't take to time to discredit bands, but this music is terrible. It is a shame that so many people my age listen to trash like this. If you are into heavy music, try a little Hendrix."},{"rating":"1","title":"so this is supposed to be good?","review":"You'll have to excuse me. Just before I listened to this i had been listening to something with TALENT (Powerslave by Iron Maiden and Demanufacture from Fear Factory). It was quite a shock to go from those two albums which are actually GOOD to something as horrible as this. So i listened to it the next day to give it another chance but alas no luck. As a diehard metalhead who also loves classic rock, industrial, and hardcore i consider myself pretty open ended when it comes to music. Heck i even have a few CDs of Tchaikovsky but no matter how hard i tried, this CD did the worst thing possible. Worse even then being crappy (which it is). This CD was so damn boring I could barely stand it. I mean there is NOTHING AT ALL on here thats even remotely interesting. I can't see just why some people love this, its just so BLAH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Such crap, we need some new bands to save rock...","review":"If this is what we consider rock nowadays, it's dead, or at least on life support. What is this crap? You can't mix rap and rock, it just doesn't work. Kid Rock, Fred Durst, their lyrics are lame and they're such wiggers. Oh, and don't get me started on Wes Borland. \\"ooh, i have SEVEN strings on my guitar and tune them all so it sounds terrible. i'm a genius!\\" and he really needs to get rid of the black contact schtick, he looks like a no-melody space monkey. As far as I'm concerned (and I'm sure a lot of people agree with me) rock is at its lowest point since early 80's hair bands, and we need real rock bands like creed, and to a lesser extent the foo fighters to pick things up. if you want excellent rock though, you have to go back in time, pick up some metallica, black sabbath, ac/dc, anything other than all these sell-out bands nowadays."},{"rating":"2","title":"True, not much ability musically, but....","review":"Does that really matter that they have no solos? Bottom line is, if you want to move.. and not worry about what is said, even though, i feel that they have some valid stuff to say.. GET THIS CD. I am a 32 yr old, alternative loving, hiphop loving, rock loving dude... and these guys blend it all together into a very excellent cd i have to say. Get it folks, you wont be disappointed, oh unless you are like one of the whiners on here whining about this or that... always be whiners..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's see...","review":"combine rap and rock. Great idea! How about a band that looks cool in their Abercrombies? Even better! Oh, and don't forget the swearing and obscene lyrics. The kids will eat it up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I luv limp bizkit","review":"Boy, isn't fred durst such a babe. He is so sexy and he says really neat words like \\"i did it all for the nookie\\". What an amazing sentence. I love it. And listen to those wonderful thud thud noises, i think those are guitars and i think they're not really rocks scraping on cement. Yep, those are great guitars, cause they go thud thud and i love them a lot. Don't you love limp bizkit cause Fred Durst can say amazing words like \\"i did it all for the nookie\\" and yell and rap and say \\"shut the F___ up\\". He is so sexy. Oops, did I say that already, well, silly me. And those guitars they go thud thud."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Heinously Awful CD in Human History","review":"This is quite possibly the single worst CD ever recorded in the history of humankind. You could put a hundred monkeys in a hundred recording studios for a hundred years and even they wouldn't come up with garbage like this. Is this supposed to be music? I was under the impression that music implied a sense of, I don't know, tone? Perhaps even...musicality? Limp Bizkit is symbolic of all that it is evil and wrong with the world. They are the flagship of a generation of evil, smelly little children. I am a worse person for having EVER heard this CD. That's an hour of my life I'll NEVER have back. Ever. I'd rather have my toenails pulled once a week for the rest of my life than have to listen to this conflagration, this cacophany of noise and profanity. Damn the man!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated...Fred did it ONLY for the nookie!","review":"Listen to this CD...All you hear is stupid, immature, meaningless lyrics that are yelled by some guy over tracks that sound like a car wrecking yard at peak hour. \\"I did it all for the nookie,\\" screams Fred Durst. What do you think he did it for? The music?"},{"rating":"1","title":"im going to kill myself.","review":"Just the fact that a band like this gets a deal makes me want to kill myself! This band sucks in every way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative 10 stars","review":"How in the hell could anyone like this?

That is in the music industry you don't necessarily need talent, you just need to know the right people. Personally, I think Fred Durst has no talent whatsoever. Stay away from the Bizkit, because the Durst is yet to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"I did it all for da nookie!","review":"This CD rocks! \\"Just Like This\\", \\"Nookie\\", and \\"Rearranged\\" are the best songs. \\"No Sex\\" is a good change of pace, being a ballad as it is. \\"N2Gether Now\\" ihe worst song, and if you want to listen to \\"Break Stuff\\", get the unedited version. The song is cool and funny, especially the lyrics \\"Everyting is f**kt, everybuddy sux...\\". This is better than their first cd, because the music is more controlled, and the songs are easier to listen to. Cheque it out fellas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"an overrated band","review":"This release from Limp Bizkit is slightly more diverse and mature than their first album. However, their exaggerated rap/metal gimmick is bound to wear thin. Eventually this ugly wave of rap/metal artists like Limp Bizkit, Korn, Kid Rock, etc. will just disappear and the fickle record buying public will move on to the next trend. In all fairness, this band has a cool guitar sound and that is why I reluctantly gave them 2 stars. The 15 minutes of fame clock is ticking away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puh-lease!

Gone is the more agonized sound of Bizkit from Three Dollar Bill, Yall$ with a new organized rap-metal sound. In some ways, you might miss the screaming, but Fred Durst's new style will have you hooked. This CD includes songs with Method Man and DJ Premier, of GangStarr, (n 2gether now) and Scott Wylen (from STP) and Jonathon Davis (KORN) both on No One Like You. The best tracks would have to be #2, Just Like This, and probably #9, nineteen 90nine, where Fred Durst showcases his MC skills. Also, if you ever have a chance to see Limp Bizkit in concert, pay whatever the price is, because it's worth it. I saw Bizkit, Kid Rock, and Staind in St. Paul on the Limptropolis tour and it was the most fun I've ever had. 5 stars for the CD and 10 for the concerts. You won't regret buying this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the worst CD Ever?","review":"God, I'm white and I think I can rap, get a clue and some lyrics.

Limp Bizkit has great songs on this album. Rearranged really isn't that great and neither is Nookie, but listen to No Sex, Just Like This, N2Gether Now, and the best song on this album- Break Stuff. If you put this CD in the computer it has a video where you can speed up the song Nookie. It also features guitarist's Wes Borland's art work for wall paper and its really good. And please note that Fred Durst takes up all the spotlight in Bizkit.

If your looking for some real good rap metal buy either korn, reveille, powerman 5000, or incubus. If your looking for good hardcore or metal buy Earth Crisis, Dope, Amen, or Strife. My final thought is that I have a new way of describing Limp Bizkit.

If these guys do heavy metal, then Yanni does gangsta rap. Fred Durst's ego is much bigger than his music, a facade which cannot hide otherwise repetitive and silly lyrics. How these guys made it #1 on the music charts, I will never know. It's always those number one hit singles...like Nookie. If that song (or any thereof) had meaning, I wouldn't be so negative. But trying to make an intellectual statement out of them is like turning a Dr. Seuss book into a rocket science manual. A good little dose of Slipknot should wash away the stench of Bizkit from all infected parties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ego Virus But Good CD","review":"I was a skeptic about buying this CD because of N 2 Gether Now, but being a huge Korn/Jon Davis fan, I had to b uy it because he is featured on a track.

By the third season, things really kicked in, beginning with Mary Richards evolving into a more assertive character.One of my all-time favorite episodes is in the third season (\\"Put On A Happy Face\\"), featuring one of MTM's best performances. Ms. Moore is at the forefront of this story, and she is superb in spoofing her 'perfect' image - an Emmy-worthy effort.After season three, \\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\\" got better and better...and \\"Betty\\"; as you know, Betty White's outstanding run as Sue Ann Nivens kicks off the fourth season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary Tyler Moore","review":"My wife and both enjoy MTM as good light and humorous entertainment - good for relaxing before bedtime."},{"rating":"1","title":"great dvd, but","review":"Good quality but you have to select each chapter seperately.

It's irritating how Fox has produced the set, with few commentaries - no MTM, for example- and each episode reverts back to the main menu, just like the Bob Newhart season DVDs, which is irritating.The writing is - as always- clever and sensational , and fans grew to love Mary more with each season. It's very disturbing to see the diva now - after all the plastic surgery- looking nothing like the Mary we knew and loved; At least Valerie Harper aged gracefully and naturally, as did the rest of the cast, all but Ted Knight still with us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intricate Minds II Understanding Elementary School Classmates with Asperger Syndrome","review":"I was not impressed.

It did not give examples of some of the common traits/challenges that can go with being on the spectrum: sensory challenges (sensitive to smells, touch, textures, how with some children it \\"hurts\\" to make eye contact, etc) social challenges: (i.e. some children just like talking about one interest and need to be \\"redirected\\" and encouraged to talk about other interests, etc.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Artist","review":"I had a drawing done of me by this artist and was EXTREMELY pleased.. the likeness was INCREDIBLE.. this book is also incredible... this is one talented person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Beautiful","review":"Lopez has put together a truly lovely set of pencil drawings and watercolors. He has a wonderful sense of what makes a figure enticing. Above all, that includes the happy expressions and poses of the models - they really seem to love posing, and love being seen as beautiful. Pictures generally consist of the model only, often with a bit of un-frilly lingerie being set aside, but no exotica. One unusual feature stands out, though: Lopez's frequent choice of very young-looking figures. That work has appeared in magazines with titles like \\"Barely Legal,\\" so sensitive viewers may want to think about whether or not this suits their taste.Only four stars because the models and poses, however lovely, tend towards a sameness.--wiredweird (reviewing Vol. 1)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The heart of chivalry","review":"A heroic tale from the middle ages full of romance, adventure, and splendor.

The Weber customer service person also suggested that all the covers shipped to Lowes (and I assume HD) are vented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cover, poor design!","review":"Weber quality is great, but this design sucks.

After a few months, the stitching virtually dissolved on one side then the other. I tossed it and got a well-constructed generic cover for less than half the price.

It is an awesome cover (and for less money - no \\"Weber\\" name, I guess). It also has vents on the sides, but has flaps over the vents that prevent water from coming in. Some reviewers purchased the medium, some the large. I went with the medium and it is a PERFECT fit.

Duh....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design","review":"Avoid this grill cover if where you live there is rain or snow. The mesh vents are positioned poorly so that rain water will collect on the grills side burner, burner controls and electronic ignition!Called Weber and their customer service rep gave me some run around about how it allows the cover to vent condensation away.. Of course had they designed it right I would not have to worry about a half gallon of water needing to evaporate off the grill.Have used the cover now for over a month and one of the mesh vents already is coming lose from the cover. Looks as if the stitching is of sub par quality.I would not have expected this experience from a Weber product. I own two of their grills, two sets of grill tools, mits, apron and charcoal starts all of which work great! However, this product is a complete failure and expensive one at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works even with the side vents","review":"I noted the uproar about the side mesh vents on this cover. So I tried to find the older model 9885 in various places. I only found this 7553 model and stopped looking after a few places. We have had 2 significant rain showers this past week so I got to test the cover. In fact it was raining heavily last night with heavy winds and the cover stayed put. I did not notice any puddles on the tray areas on my Genesis E320 today. The grill is freestanding without any nearby trees to deflect rain so it's functional even with the side vents. Maybe the older model is better but this one works at least. The vinyl is heavy and should be durable. The E320 has stainless steel trays set into plastic sides so at least they shouldn't rust if water does accumulate. Amazon's prices were around $10 dollars cheaper than brick and mortar hardware store. If my experience shopping is an indication it will be hard to find the older 9885 model of cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality cover","review":"Bought this cover to protect my Weber Genesis E-310 grill from the elements.

Not only does it funnel rain water into your grill's control knobs, ignighter, and the side burner unit, but, it somehow manages to divert water into the grease catching tray until it is full - or overflowing - with water. Emptying a filled-to-the-brim tray with grease and water w/o a disgusting greasy mess is nearly impossible.My write-up for the grill was 5 star. Why cover a grill so it will collect water and spread it all over the grill that you spent $50+ to protect?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the grill, hate this cover","review":"Poorly designed grill cover. I am not sure of the purpose of putting vents in the top of the cover is. Like the reviewers before me have said, it allows water from the rain into the igniter battery compartment (also poorly designed!) and allows it into the gas knobs and allows the water to pool on the stainless steel side shelves. Every time I take off the grill cover I have to wipe the water and pollen off of the sides... it looks terrible. The cover is made of great materials and feels durable, and I am sure it will last forever in a landfill now... I had to replace it with a $10 piece of junk from Walmart just to keep the water out. Very disappointed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but terrible","review":"This grill cover is made of very nice material and fits perfectly on my grill. No complaints there...the only complaint that I have is with the mesh windows that sit above the side tables. I am not sure why they would do this since it allows the rain to go right in. So, every time that I take the cover off, there is a pool of water on each side table that I have to clean off. It also lets a lot of pollen in, which is great mixed with the water.I understand that there needs to be vents in the cover, I am just not sure about the placement on this cover. Why not put it on the front and back on the vertical face of the cover, still over the tables? This would at least minimize the standing water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointed ;(","review":"Even though I'm very pleased with my e320 grill, the cover is an absolute failure!

Anyway, confused, I went and checked the cover picture on the box, it didn't have openings on the side. So I thought I got the wrong product and did a search in the internet and that's when I realized my mistake about getting this cover. If you want to protect your grill from water DO NOT GET this cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY FOR S320 GRILL!!!","review":"I read about the side vents but they were not too clear whether it will affect the S320 as well. When I looked at the product photo, it seemed the vents were below the left and right tables. I was wrong. Those were the velcro straps you can use to snugly fit the cover on the grill so it will not get blown away. The vents were on the left and right side of the cover, on the fabric ABOVE the tables. It rained a day after I received the cover. When I checked it after the rain, there were puddles of water on both side tables. I took a couple of photos and will post them here. The quality of the material and the fit is great. I really do not understand why they placed the vents there. That ruined what could have been a perfect Genesis grill cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Bizarre Thing I've Ever Bought","review":"After forking out a lot of money for a quality grill, I decide to buy the Weber cover to take good care of it.This is the most retarded product I've ever bought!

When it rains, everything gets soaked!One response said Weber told him it was for dust and leaves. Huh? Is it only for Arizona?I'm am extremely upset about this cover, and the responses here make show a bizarre and out-of-touch manufacturer.Some people mentioned finding an older version, with a mesh on the back. I'll return this to Home Depot and look for a version like that or opt for a generic cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value","review":"This is the best grill cover I've ever had. It's heavy duty and fits snugly over the grill.

It doesn't :-( I live in Ireland and the main reason for covering the bbq is to keep it dry. The vents at the side mean that both side tables accumulate water and it pools around the right-hand side controls. I have had to resort to using my old generic bbq-cover which which isn't tall enough and the then put the Weber one over that to cover the lower parts.

She makes all the haiku rhyme!!! Ugh! I suppose in Lady Bouchier's idle mind that's how poetry should appear.Here's a quote: \\"Life itself is a journey; and as for those who spend their days upon the waters in ships and those who grow old leading horses, their very home is the open road.\\"Now compare that to Sam Hamill's translation: \\"A lifetime adrift in a boat, or in old age leading a tired horse into the years, every day is a journey, and the journey itself is home.\\"This book is embarrassing.

Dorothy Britten's translations of both the text and verse cloy terribly, and betray her shallow understanding of the form. Her translations of some of Basho's best haiku rhyme, which should be enough to put anyone off.If you want to buy a translation of this wonderful work, I recommend a different Kodansha publication -- the edition featuring Masayuki Miyata's breathtaking illustrations and Donald Keene's somewhat academic but still vastly superior translations. Don't buy this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice volume, but not the best translation","review":"Although Ms. Bitton's translations of Basho's prose are not far off from other versions of this title, many have complained of the rhyming scheme she employs when translating the haiku verses of the author's most famous work. I do agree, that these translations are somewhat jarring and just a little cumbersome (especially if one has knowledge of other translations of this haibun). But Bitton's effort was devoted to making the verses more accessible to Western readers accustomed to the perceived elegance of the rhyme in popular Western poetry. This, one may argue, is the job of a translator, and thus is not an all too terrible introduction to \\"The Narrow Road,\\" especially for younger readers. However, if one truly wishes to enjoy this, one of Japan greatest literary volumes, please seek other versions as well. The difficult art of translation is in itself a fascinating study."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly useless","review":"This is a good try, but it utterly misses.

The book is designed for an experienced individual in computer applications and unless you devote a large percentage of your time on web page design, it is not recommended. The author should split the book in, perhaps, four different sections beginning with a simple web page design. The first section should contain no more than 25 pages to allow beginners to experiment on one page design. The second section should deal with multiple page design. The other sections should relate to more complex designs used by professional users.

He then drags us around the Western world and through time trying to uncover the killer of a former CIA colleague. Reilly is also on the hunt for an historical document that could threaten the very foundation of the Roman Catholic Church and there are some who would stop at nothing to keep the secret from being revealed.Loomis does a good job of building and maintaining suspense throughout the story and teaching us a bit about the past while he does it. He also has a gift for description. I'll definitely be reading more of Loomis' work in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"I've enjoyed other books by Loomis but this one just didn't go anywhere.

There aren't words enough to praise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this book!","review":"This book contains the most amazing stories that I have ever read. Dubus writes about people of all ages dealing with issues like death, religion, and relationships; yet this description isn't enough. His themes are huge, but not overbearing or contrived. You'll love his characters for both their flaws and their virtues, and learn something about yourself even from stories dealing with things you've never experienced. I can't describe his writing in any way that doesn't sound cliche; yet, reading his stories, even old themes are new again under his treatment. His characters are so real that I almost expect them to be living down the street from me; without crushing the reader under unnecessary details, Dubus gives his characters a sense of past and reality that is unlike the ability of any other writer I have come across.

Although executive produced by Mel Gibson along with Jet Li, unless you are a die hard martial arts/The Matrix fan, I wouldn't advise watching this movie unless like me, you want to see it only for Billy Zane! He was pretty good at martial arts and played the character of Os very well. He trains a group of students to take on his enemy ( Slate ) and save the world.

What is up with 4and 5 stars on this one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you give 1/2 stars?","review":"This movie was so hyped up, and unrightfully so. I read the reviews (which seemed positive) and knew that it would be somewhat raunchy, but not as profanity-strewn as it was. There are some funny parts, but they seemed contrived. The famous chest-waxing scene was just not that funny. Read the other reviews to find out what the plot was, but be forewarned. This movie may get on your nerves fast, and you may want to block your ears to some of the dialogue. It could've been so much memorable, and not the sick dud that many will find it to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie is painful","review":"This movie is painfully not funny. I was amazed that there are parts where they unabashedly rip off Deuce Bigelow. Stupid. Anyone who would give this more than two stars is pretty funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful movie!","review":"I have to say that The Wedding Crashers is a whole lot better than 40 Year Old Virgin. When I saw 40 Year Old Virgin it felt like I was watching another American Pie movie where people are trying to score with woman. Sure there are some funny jokes but the rest of the movie just sucks. It's not worth the money. Go see Wedding Crashers instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had heard so many good things about this movie - that it was funny, and watching it \\"you won't stop laughing\\". As I watched it with my friends, I was struck at the number of minutes that would pass by - with no laughter. The movie has an interesting premise, but for a two hour movie, this stretches it. There are too many extraneous characters, and too many moments where the script and direction try to squeeze out as much humor as possible, but fails. What should have been a tight, breezy comedy is stretched into two hours of mugging and \\"ha ha aren't we funny?\\" type of film. The lead actor and Catherine Keener are charming but too much time is given to the supporting characters, some who are funny, some not. Also, the film tends to become repetitive with the lead character being prodded by his friends to lose his virginity and various situations ensue. It become stale and boring. I wanted to like this film more but it didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puzzled","review":"After sitting through about 95% of this film, I finally gave up and went to bed (my wife retreated 10 minutes earlier). We were puzzled by the critical raves that this film received. I wasn't expecting a comic masterpiece but this was excruciating dull. A few titters (no, not those) or chuckles was about all you got. As the movie was playing, my son who is 22 entered the room. I asked his opinion and he shrugged and said \\"bathroom humor\\" and left. Normally this isn't a bad review for him but he said it in such a bored way I could tell that he was disappointed with this film. Some Amazon reviewers seem to think that the unrated version hurt the film. I have to agree that the cutting of any time from this film had to be a blessing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny","review":"I haven't seen this new unrated version, but I did see this movie in the theater and was very unimpressed. All the jokes fell flat on their faces, and the cast just didn't seem to know how to be funny. Steve Carell is funny in some things he's done, but in this case his character was just wrong for the movie. Instead of playing the character of Andy Stitzer as a totally naive shy nerd, he plays him as a character with much more confidence and boldness then he ever should have had. That's one of the many reasons why this movie didn't work. Plus we're subjected to a very campy romantic-comedy type ending that just ruins the humorous mood of the movie.The actual premise of the movie had potential to be a great comedy, but unfortunately the script and jokes were just lame. Sure it had a moment or two where I laughed a little, but overall I found it boring, pointless, and overrated. Avoid unless you want to bore yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's rude, too much obscene.","review":"This film insults women, a lot.If you want to show such obscene scenes a lot, turn it to be polno.I came to be fan of Steven since I watched his another work.But this film really disappointed me.And Steven's coworkers really take care of him to sleep with someone.But actually I doubt there're such a nice guy in the world.But if there were, it's wonderful.Steven's girlfriend is funny and nice.She is always arguing with her daughter who wants to sleep with her boyfriend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny movie, why tack on romace?","review":"Truly a funny and well made comedy, not sure why they tack on romantic comedy angle (just like Wedding Crashers!), but definitely a good film."},{"rating":"1","title":"America is starved for entertainment","review":"And I can prove my headline. This film was successful. That is all that I need to say. It isn't a bad film. But it doesn't deserve the popularity it received. Plus it is a direct rip-off from Ben Stiller movies. I see a lot of comedies placing crazy ethnic characters in them. These actors seem to be degrading themselves and do they realize people are mocking them by placing them in these parts? Because it is funny to hear an Indian guy cuss and talk graphically about sex. For a more extreme example of that, see \\"Harold and Kumar Go TO Whitecastle\\". That one is even worse than this one. Those actors may as well paint their faces black and put white circles around their mouths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overated","review":"Why was this so critically acclaimed?!? This is little more than a horny teenager movie with adults playing the roles - minus good T&A - don't let the 'unrated' marking mislead you. The characters are all interesting enough, but this movie is way too long and is plagued by awkward dialogue soaked in gratuitous profanity (Who do they think they are? Richard Pryor? they are not.) Steve Carell's character is so pathetic that you may be able to watch this as you would watch a 2 hr. 13 min. train wreck. However, The 40-Year-Old Virgin is not funny, not mature, not intelligent, and not very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funnest Movie Ever","review":"If you are not a prude you will love this movie. Can be watched over and over again. We watch this movie almost every weekend and bring it on car trips. It never seems to get old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Havent Laughed this Hard in a While","review":"I saw this movie Saturday night. First of all, the movie had packed all the seats so we had to sit like in the 5th row. It was worth it. Steve was incredibly funny and just the stars were brilliant. Very crude language but fun and funny. The scene were he is gonna do it and the woman asks him if he has protection and he says he \\"doesnt like guns\\" is hysterical! I loved this movie and this movie has made the Anchorman director look good even though Anchorman wasn't a very good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, overlong and predictable","review":"It's hard to believe tripe such as this is considered good comedy. THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN relies on gross-out conduct and over-the-top shenanigans in place of wit, and the result is aimed strictly at the lowest common denominator. There are some good laughs provided by the supporting characters, but the rest of the movie just goes on and on and on about such obvious circumstances like problems with condoms, male cowardice when confronted by aggressive females, drunk-driving (hardly a joke when you consider how many people have been killed by such idiots) and other absolutely unbelieveably contrived situations.If you want genuine humor, check out classics like THIS IS SPINAL TAP, TOP SECRET!, or even SCHOOL OF ROCK. This flick is just a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending So Weak","review":"I'm not going to get into the description of the movie considering so many has done so before I. So I just want to point out that this movie was pretty good till the point of the ending. Why do filmmakers make weak endings? Is it because they have no more ideas or they just don't care? It just ruins the whole movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spawn of Something About Mary and Shallow Hal, resembles both parents","review":"Very well written and funny. 40 year old just gets used to being a virgin, until his friends 'help him' out. This is the spawn of a mating between Something about Mary and Shallow Hal. Shows the lighter side of the male objectification of women like Something, and shows them off flaws intact like in Shallow Hal.What is not clear, is how the main character, kind and charismatic, could have gotten into this mess in the first place. The women depicted, would have eaten him alive years ago. But then it is not exactly a logical or realistic movie.The funniest character is the Virgin's coworker, the actor who played 'cockroach' on the Cosby Show. Took me a while to place his face, but thats what I knew him from, been a while for you buddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"something is wrong with me","review":"Maybe this movie had too much hype, maybe I am out of touch with what people think is currently funny, but I sat there and felt I was in the Twilight Zone. This movie would have made me laugh a little when I was 16. But I am tired of gross out humor. When the most written about scene in a movie is where someone throws up on someone else I think it says everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some laughs, but obvious and mean-spirited","review":"This could've been a great movie, but wound up being mean and hateful, with no really likeable characters (except the always-terrific Catherine Keener and Jane Lynch). Perhaps it was the relentless profanity in the unrated version? I didn't see the original, so can't compare. I thought that Andy's character was seriously undermined by his meanness. I didn't feel for him at all.The other problem is that there just isn't a lick of subtlety to be found. For example, the chest-waxing scene seems to be quite popular, but why? Andy's reaction to each piece of tape was exactly the same. Couldn't Carell think of some way to vary his responses?The movie doesn't know if it wants to be \\"American Pie\\" or \\"Revenge of the Nerds\\" (both great flicks).Oh well, only $10 gone. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"boorish, cheap, risqu��, uncouth","review":"This is one of the worst movies, I have ever seen. The director (Judd Apatow) clearly has a talent to direct a porn movie. I always believed that there is thin line between vulgarity and humor, and this movie has crossed that line. In the quest to make a comedy for entertainment, the director ended up filling the movie with filthy language, and obscene jokes. This movie may appeal to some youngsters, but certainly anyone with decent sense of humor won't find it amusing. I won't recommend any one to see this movie, let alone the idea of buying a DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving and vulgar","review":"My first exposure to Steve Carell's work was \\"Get Smart.\\" My family enjoyed this movie very much and so we started to search for other movies. The 40 Year Old Virgin was the 2nd movie we attempted to watch. This movie was agonizing slow moving through tiring and vulgar scenes. The vulgarity was so offensive, we had to stop the movie perhaps before it became funny.I paid a penny for this DVD and it was under $5.00 with shipping and handling--even that was overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"i didn't like it","review":"I watched the whole movie because i found it interesting.The only funny parts in the movie were what his buddies did.During the course of the movie, I found the most of the scenes almost hardto watch. And it was not that funny, i hardly laughed.If there was a naked chick in the tub telling you to get in i think you'd know what you would do. I thought it was funny though when his friend got in the tub with her after everyone else left.anyway 2/5 stars because the story was not that bad.I just thought the main character was too pathetic to be real and the movie wasn't that good overall, sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eight minutes","review":"The title alone convinced me to never watch this movie, but then a buddy loaned it to me.The premise does work. You see how this guy lives, and he's credible as a character and as a virgin. I love his bicycle, and I haven't driven anything with a motor since moving to Asia in December 1999, so I notice such things.However, the humor just wasn't funny. Very lame, pre-teen, predictable. He's surrounded by stereotypes, and really isn't he one too? I found it impossible to care, so I watched something else.But hey, two stars. That is one more than I expected to give. Way to go movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"17 more minutes? Could have been 30 minutes less","review":"I cant remember why I got this film. I think I heard it was a funny movie and it got some good reviews so I got it. First off, comedy movies should never exceed the two hour mark. I really cant think of a comedy that lasted more then two hours, maybe some Amazon reader can help me out on that. I laughed only a few times during the whole film but it wasnt really long laughs. I heard the theater version is much better then this version which would make sense. The added 17 minutes puts it over two hours and most of the scenes could have been deleted. If this movie was about an hour and forty minutes, I probably would have enjoyed it more."},{"rating":"2","title":"40 yr.Old Virgin","review":"Cult comic actor Steve Carell--long adored for his supporting work on The Daily Show and in movies like Bruce Almighty and Anchorman--leaps into leading man status with The 40 Year-Old Virgin. There's no point describing the plot; it's about how a 40 year-old virgin named Andy (Carell) finally finds true love and gets laid. Along the way, there are very funny scenes involving being coached by his new friends, speed dating, being propositioned by his female manager, and getting his chest waxed. Steve Carell deserves his time to shine.Keep the movie coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately funny","review":"This movie is between 4 and 5 stars. Its definately hilarious, and even does a good job incorporating some serious aspects to it, but there's nothing that puts it over the top to be exceptional.Definately very very funny and a good watch. Lots of great moments/lines. Good characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just... Bad","review":"I really enjoyed the acting of actor Steve Carell in The Office, but this movie, the 40 Year Old Virgin, was just... bad. Crude, rude, ... bad acting, bad dialogue, terrible treatment of women...Steve Carell, I didn't know you were so hard up for money. Please don't do it again. Yes, there are some dramatic scenes, but they can't save the movie.I need to go now and wash my eyes..."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"UNRATED\\" means viewer discretion","review":"I gave this movie one star because I could not give it zero.

This blu-ray not only has nice picture andsound, but rated & unrated versions of the film plusneat extras. I recommend this great comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve you rock the office and your virginity","review":"steve Carell is funny!, Seth Rogan did an awesome job as well! I can relate to this movie rocks!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best recent comedies.","review":"Recently, most comedies are of the very stupid category. They involve characters that don't seem real and just do moronic things because they are written that way.But Judd Apatow's movie is the exact opposite; keeping the characters real but at the same time laugh out loud. Steve Carrell plays his best role so far alongside Paul Rudd and Seth Rogen, who are equally as great. On top of a top notch script, all the actors play off eachother amazingly and it all just adds up to be a hilarious movie for the full running time.If you haven't seen this, I suggest you go out and rent it, buy it, whatever...just see it!By the way if you see this and enjoy it, watch \\"Knocked Up\\" as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better the second time","review":"This is a fantastic film. As hard as I laughed the first time, I loved it more the second and third times around. Much like another movie from this comedy team, \\"Anchorman\\", this film gets better with age. Watch it just for all the funny lines you missed the first time through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the FUNNY version?","review":"I've only seen 40 Year Old Virgin on video, and I've been kicking myself in the nads ever since I realized that waiting out the theatrical release becuase \\"it'd be just as good on video\\" was a huge mistake. I'll neve know if this movie was originally good or not. The bloated, formless version we have on DVD has some great parts, but they're buried in cut bits that should never have been put back in. I mean, they could have put out a longer version for hard core fans, but gee whillakers--put out the version that was a big hit in theatres too! When I watched the DVD the fat and repetition was just painfully obvious; there was no forward momentum and jokes repeated themselves.PLEASE release the original theatrical version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgar vulgar vulgar funny obscene vulgar","review":"And did I mention vulgar. This movie is a little bit funny, but painfully obscene. The language is so bad, I had to leave the room. But my brother and sister thought it was hysterical. I guess if you don't mind this sort of thing, you might enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satire of celibacy","review":"I must say that this was a funny film.The actors had great chemistry with each other.One thing that I found weird was that the blond actress was hardly in the film at all,although you couldnt tell that by watching the trailers.I think that teens will find this funny because,to them,anyone over 18 who has not yet had sex is some sort of freak.In one interesting and disturbing DVD extra,I found out that one of the actors in the film lost his virginity at age 6.Overall,worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly smart, wonderfully world-weary yet still romantic.","review":"Although the title (and the basic plotline) make one expect an American Pie-style comedy, the 40-Year-Old Virgin is a surprisingly smart and clever comedy. Scratch that, a romantic comedy, which doesn't work on paper, but which is surprisingly sweet and funny (and fairly wise).A recommended viewing for fans of R-rated romantic comedy, of which this is one of only a small handful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immature without the childness.","review":"The 40 Year Old Virgin is one of very few movies that can get away with being a great movie, regardless of its...subject matter. The acting was great and you really got involved with the characters. Seeing this in theaters was a good experience; I've never heard so many people laugh so much in a 2 hour time period. Even funnier, multiple scenes in the movie were improvised and that makes it all the better.I recommend two things with this movie. Parents...don't let your kids see this; there are a lot of sexual references (naturally) and in the unrated version, several scenes of nudity.Also, I recommend watching the R version of the film first. The unrated tends to be a little much and can take away from the theatrical release.All in all this is one of my favorite movies and I look forward to more of Carell's work. The final scene of the movie made me laugh harder than any other movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most highly overrated movies of all time","review":"Have you ever seen a kid, typically five or six years of age, who has discovered that acting a certain way and doing certain things evokes a specific response from adults: \\"Oh, isn't that funny and cute!\\" And the kid plays up this behavior over and over and over again, to the point that it's no longer funny and cute, but excruciatingly obnoxious and irritating?That in a nutshell is \\"40 Year-old Virgin\\".The film takes a set of lines and situations which range from tired to moderately clever, and overplays them literally to death. Almost every scene is too long, the ad libbing is 95% needless and flat, and by the end of the first half-hour the \\"Aw, gee, isn't Andy cute?\\" mantra has worn a hole in your head the size of a dinner plate.Just for kicks I may buy a copy of \\"40 Year-old Virgin\\" and edit it down to a 9 or 10 minute short story. It would likely work a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy","review":"Very funny movie. This is something I can watch over and over again.

There is no fun at all. It's a complete no-sense story, with scenes endlessly boring. What a waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie if they Cut it down to 60 mins","review":"This movie would have been great if they cut it down to 60 mins. It started out well. The interactions between the clerks at the electronics store was hilarious. Some of the dialogue, especially with the Indian clerks was classic. The premise behind the story was slightly original and different. But the director has to learn when to call it quits.. some of the scenes in the middle just went on and on and on.. Towards the end , I was about ready to pull my hair out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to watch","review":"I am sure the original cut isn't as bad as the unrated uncut version, all I know is I kept waiting and waiting and waiting for it to end.This has got to be one of the worst films I've seen in a long, long time.The cussing was just over and over and got so redundant and stupid I thought I was in a junior high school boys locker room after ten 13 year olds had downed a couple beers each. The bathroom type talk was just too much.It's not that the message of the story was bad, woman should be treated with respect and sex is not something to be taken lightly, it's just that being so over the top in rude and crude behavior and talk wasn't necessary to make the point.Anyway I don't recommend this at all, however if you must, don't watch the long version."},{"rating":"1","title":"never receive my move","review":"To this day I'm still waiting for my movie.

We were waiting for it to turn a corner into something good or funny and it just didn't. We just bagged it after watching about 95%. The only reason we stayed with it was to see if anything good was going to happen ... unfortunately we watched the \\"great\\" unedited version with 17 minutes of extra torture ;-)) I'd rank this as one of the worst movies that I've ever seen.

Team America, World Police blows the doors off of Virgin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This movie was the worst thing I've seen in years. It's laden with cuss words (obviously an attempt to supplement a virtually non-existent storyline).

Don't waste your time or money on this flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain boring","review":"I thought this was supposed to be funny, but it really wasnt (to me). predictable plot, unfunny situations, etc....just a complete bore. very annoying unnecessary characters who just say fu_k every 2 seconds....not worth most people's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"J.W.","review":"SO THIS MOVIE CAME OUT IN 2005 .I NEVER RENTED ( I DID JUST PURCHASE IT OFF HERE AND FRANKLY CANT WAIT TO PASS IT ON) IT BUT ITS ALL I HEARD ABOUT AS IF IT WAS THE GREATEST COMEDY MOVIE EVER MADE...ALL I CAN SAY IS WHAT THE HECK WERE ALL THESE PEOPLE ON WHEN THEY WERE WATCHING THIS???

There is enough new comedy in it to bring some laughs from the movie critic that obliged to have at least one negative comment for every review. Steve Carell has a supportive crew but Jane Lynch hits the homerun. Like most movies, an unbelievable storyline, but the subplots & their players make you think less of mainline definition & focus on the bylines."},{"rating":"2","title":"amusing and easy to watch","review":"My girlfriend called this one and I enjoyed it in spite of lower expectations. A comic take on the social dynamics of sexual attraction, the show picks low hanging fruits and squeezes them into humorade - enjoyable and easy to drink :)The characters are flat, and there are no surprises before the final credit sequence.. wow! The movie doesn't take itself seriously, so we don't have to - we can laugh at our ridiculous society and how obsessed we are with sex, being sexy, and every perception thereof.Set in Los Angeles and clearly inspired by San Francisco's40 Days and 40 Nights, I wish the creators had weaved a strand or two of LA culture (alaL.A.

I wish I knew this before I put this into my DVD player. Here we are - me and my mom, sitting comfortably on the couch and the first scene starts with the guy coming out of his bedroom with this HUUUUGE erection clearly visible through his boxers. I almost fell off the couch. So just a word of warning - be careful who you watch this with. The movie was okay, but to be honest I expected more humor and wit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stank, and uncomfortable","review":"Oh boy, people really loved this dumb thing. But why? It goes on waaaay too long at almost two hours. No modern Hollywood comedy should ever bore its audience for more than 90 minutes, tops! All the supposedly classic scenes here are just dumb and uncomfortable to watch, especially where Steve Carrell gets waxed. We have become a society of dummies if this is what gets classed as funny. I had never seen this before. Ick."},{"rating":"2","title":"So funny!","review":"So, I got this movie expecting to hate it, really. I was surprised when I found that it was actually pretty funny. And, being that it was the unrated version, it was mild in comparison to the unrated version of The Wedding Crashers! There weren't many scenes where I was too disgusted to look at the screen.Behind the large amounts of humor, there is actually a sweet, underlying love story that ends happily. I definitely recommend this one! I think most people with an open mind will find it to be entertaining!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some moments: just that","review":"I give the movie just two stars because it has some moments (just that, no more) where you REALLY laugh. However, overall, the premise of the story is basic and rehashed. The acting goes a bit over the top at times and most of the jokes did not even get me to laugh. As the movie approaches the end, it starts to get worse. It ends in an absolutely weird way that tops a movie that has very little to offer. Skip it. There are far better comedies out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"40 years of waiting comes to the surface in this hilarious movie","review":"In this movie (Steve Carrell) is the main character. Basically he's the virgin. He is at a poker game with his co-workers when they discover he's a virgin. They make it there job to get him laid. This movie is well written and hilarious. Judd Apatow ( the director) is excellent. Judd Apatow has worked with some of todays comedy greats (Will Ferrel, Jim Carrey etc.) He knows what he's doin and does a great job so see this movie, which is now the 5th R rated comedy to hit 100 million in the box office ( after Beverly Hills Cop,Scary Movie 1,There's Something About Mary,and this summers Wedding Crashers.)So either see it in theaters or pick up the DVD when released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible piece of you know what","review":"Terrible terrible movie.

Unfortunately, I think I could've spent my $7.50 on a mallet and hit myself in the head several times and evoked more laughter than what I got when I saw this ripe pile of garbage in the cinema.I was excited when I first heard about this movie. I've always liked Steve Carell. In fact, I've considered him to be the best part of The Daily Show for years now... and he's turned the U.S. adaptation of The Office into more than just a weak ripoff. Alas, his talents are wasted here.The film is one overblown sex joke and I don't mean in a subtle, witty fashion like The Wedding Crashers. The material is as subtle as a kick to the groin and the jokes are as weak as tissue paper. I'd give it no stars at all, but that isn't an option on this site.Avoid this movie at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very, very ugly movie!","review":"A predictable, ugly bore of a movie. The protagonist, Andy, seems like a nice enough guy but he lets his friends talk him into so many weird things, like hair waxing, that one has to wonder if this guy is playing with a full deck.The most prevalent characteristic of the movie is not its predictability, which is obvious as soon as you see this one particular woman, but it is the language. Why is it necessary to use vulgarity in every scene. It doesn't advance the plot, doesn't provide background for understanding the characters, it does nothing except turn the entire movie ugly and make it one long bore.Once I started watching the movie I felt that I had to see it through to find out why people would be praising it, but I never found out why, and wasted a couple of hours that would have been enjoyed better by watching grass grow.A very, very ugly movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as everybody makes it out to be!!","review":"This movie was not as good as everybody made it out to be. It was very stupid and I found it hard to sit and watch through the whole thing. I will try to watch it again to see if I really like it but so far I would have to rate it as a two. Sorry to all the people that love this movie but it sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"highly overated","review":"i was really disappointed in this movie after all the hype that has been coming down the pipe. i am not a prude but if there is foul language or nudity it MUST be part of the story. at least for me. if this movie ever makes it to t.v. people will scratch their heads and look at each other in amazement since they will have to chop it to pieces. i am taking a lot of flak because of my opinion. but that is all this is, my opinion. i just got really tired of all the language and the lead player. to me he was just tiresome and while paul rudd is one of my favorite actors, he was wasted in this one. sorry, but to me this is just no good at all. no redeeming features at all. but i can certainly see why it would be a great movie to some of the straight men out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't remember a worse film","review":"My wife and I saw this movie at the drive in when it first came out. We couldn't stand this movie, and ended up leaving right before it ended. I'm not sure how this ended up being a movie, but I have to give the producers credit. The fully understand that the U.S. has no limit to the crap they will spend their money on. If you liked Office Space, this is the movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful movie. I wish I skipped it.","review":"My boyfriend and I went to this movie we both hated it. It was really pathetic. Perhaps the fact that we actually know men who are engineers and physicsts who are like this is part of it. Yeah there are people who cannot interact with women or people. It is pathetic. I would feel sorry for anywoman dating this man or any man like this because they lack confidence and are so hard to deal with. Low self esteem. Do you want to see a pathetic portion of the population yeah this is them there are actually people like this. Perhaps it is funny, but just do not be around one of these people in reality. It is a painful reminder of how screwed up they are. Not all men are virgins like this man, but some might as well be because they have no clue about women. they do not know how to open a door or hold a hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never stopped laughing","review":"Definitely one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. You must be in the mood to laugh at things that are sometimes sophmoric and adolescent but, if you are, you'll laugh until your ribcage hurts. I am so glad that I didn't see this movie on a date. The content, made somewhat obvious by the movie's title, is about sex, lack of sex, wanting sex, fearing sex and a bunch of guys talking, walking, eating and living sex.I watched this movie on DVD in my living room with a bunch of friends and everyone agreed that it was one of the best ways we had spent a Friday night in a long, long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Smart","review":"Steve Carell has vastly impressed me in supporting roles such as his character in Anchorman, but he really does his best work in, what I think, is the funniest film of the summer. It's gross and distasteful, but it really has a heart. There are quite a few great scenes in which it shows the private relationships of men. Many people might think that this is the stereotype of male relationships (drinking, gambling, being disgusting, etc.), but for the most part, the movie hits the mark perfectly. The jokes don't get tireless throughout the entire movie. No matter how many gross jokes there are about sex, they don't lose their humor because of the great acting. This is one of the best reviewed movies of the year and for good reason. It's funny, smart, and really has a good heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outragious and laugh-out-loud Funny","review":"Few films compare to the insanity of this. But i couldn't stop laughing and at the end of the day isn't that what you want in a comedy. God only understands why people have been dissapointed. It was a really good comedy and its taken a while for something this funny to show up on the scene. Well Pleased.Definately worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, bad DVD","review":"I loved the movie and bought the unrated DVD from BestBuy. Had problems on 2 different DVD players. Seems like a defective DVD. Will be returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, crass, and not funny","review":"At 2 hours and 15 mins, this movie is about 45 minutes too long. There are very few funny moments. Mostly, you feel sorry for Adam (Steve Carrell) because he is a pathetic loser. Also, everyone in the movie uses a 4-letter word in each sentence. I have no problem with swearing per se; the right word at the right time can be enormously funny. But this movie has gratutious swearing that is not funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 40-Year-Old Virgin","review":"It's my first time to rate a movie and I just felt compelled to do it because seldom have I run into such a mediocre product of cinematography. I can think of many ways of spending money and time than to watch such trash. Poor acting, flimsy plot as well as unnecessary use of the 'f' word make this one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy, boring, predictable","review":"...and a pathetic waste of 2 hrs of my life that I will never get back.I watched this while visiting friends, and good thing because there's no way I would EVER pay money to waste my time like that.Juvenile use of 4-letter words, cheesy, sleazy, flat jokes--the only reason this movie made the money that it did was the undeserved marketing campaign.The title pretty much says it--a 40 yrs old guy who's socially inept and whose friends try to 'hook him up', supposedly having a hilarious time doing it.BO-RING! Why isn't there a NEGATIVE rating system here?AVOID at ALL COSTS--unless you are an early teen who still thinks juvenile sex jokes are funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this movie but I would like to say...","review":"This movie is a crude but funny romantic comedy. But I would like to say one thing to the studios who release these movies: STOP with the UNRATED versions of movies. They are pointless. Just give us the original movie that was shown in the theaters. Almost every recent comedy has an unrated version. Scary Movie 3, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, Wedding Crashers, Not Another Teen Movie, White Chicks, Old School, Road Trip, Eurotrip, Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, Team America: World Police, American Pie, American Pie 2, American Wedding, and just about every comedy that was originally rated R has a unrated version on DVD. And a lot of the time, the original \\"rated\\" versions are NOT available in widescreen, which is better than full screen. So please release the widescreen, original movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars for the Ending Only","review":"This movie is full of vulgar language, and the writing is extremely demeaning to women. There were VERY few laughs, and the plotline was ridiculous. Why after 2 years of working together, do these guys decide to befriend Andy? How is it that Andy has a huge collection of action figures (including 46 GI Joes still in the box), and manages to hook up with a woman who sells stuff on Ebay for a living? He's Mr. Nerdy and Shy, yet suddenly becomes Mr. Outgoing Problem-solver for her kids. The movie was unrealistic and unnecessarily filthy.But as I said, the ending was cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyed it","review":"This was a great movie. It follows the life of a 40 year old virgin who just wants some action with the babes. His co-workers try to get him some the whole movie and he makes some good friends. And he ends up falling for a 40 year old Grandma as his friend sais she is one hot Grandma my Grandma looks Like Jack Palance. He Finally gets lucky on his wedding day. I like when he gets a big stack of Porn and sais he hates it. He is great everytime he gets with a girl and when he gets a waxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh Out Loud Hilarious","review":"OK, I will be the first to admit this film is not for everyone -- certainly it's not a family film. However, I can't recall the last time I literally laughed out loud so much. There are some truly hilarious moments in this film. Granted, it's light entertainment, but who cares. I'm not a fan of The Office or the Daily Show, so my only previous experience with Steve Carell was his funny performance in Bruce Almighty. In this film, Carell shows some real acting chops. He veers wildly from great comedy to touching dramatic moments. Given the right material I think Carell could be the next Jim Carey, but without all the screen hogging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Hyped","review":"I rented this thinking I would buy it. Overall, I am glad I rented it first as I now will not buy this dvd as one view was sufficient. I was hoping it would be better. It had a few moments but was kinda boring the rest of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile and Vulgar","review":"I was severely disheartened to see my current favorite actress, Catherine Keener, involved in such a juvenile, vulgar and surprisingly unfunny movie. To her credit, it was mostly tolerable when she was on screen. I can only hope that she was not aware of how badly improvised this movie would be and accepted based on some other factor.This may appeal to 15-year-old virgins since they may find the quality of humor directly proportional to the amount of expletives used. I was merely annoyed and bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forrest Gump for Nerds","review":"so I finally sat down&watched this film which has gotten so much hype.after watching it I felt like it was the Nappolian Dynimite for 05. every year there is that Underdog Movie that catches on&generates buzz.it's not so much the film is so great or good,but the Main Character seems to strike a chord.this film feels like a Music video with alot of the same formula of playing songs from the past to try to create a scene or something more which just ain't there.it had a few moments,but if this is the film that generated buzz at the Box office than the Hollywood film studios are in trouble.because this film will be done again&again&again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"In my opinon this movie was not that good and not funny at all! I thought that this movie was just a rewrite of American Pie. The main differnece was it was about a 40 year old man than 18 year old teenagers. Advice to the driector: Quit trying to steal the main ideas of other movies at least come up with something good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Stinker!","review":"Saw this movie on HBO and couldn't believe how boring and juvenile it was. The acting is amateurish, the gags tired and stupid and the pacing just awful. Avoid this turkey at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good talent wasted on adolescent humor!","review":"I rented this movie based on the advice of some guys at my work. The film has some wonderfully talented actors in it,but their talent is wasted on the pre-pubescent, potty-mouthed humor that seems to be searching for laughs. Films are funnier when they don't try so hard. The writers know nothing about subtlety, dramatic irony or creativity. The lines are blatantly sexist without any kind of redeeming moment. In fact, the whole film is an insult to females and men who strive to see women as more than just objects for their penises. Yes, the end of the film does try to project a message about that, but, by this point, it's too late. The watcher is already groveling in more sex humor than a B-rated college flick. If you like junior high boy's locker humor, than this one is for you. If not, do yourself a favor and read a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible, aimed at teen male fantasy land","review":"As stated by others, this is crude, offensive, sex-obsessed garbage. It's amazing a talented guy like Steve Carrell gained fame with such trash. It's obviously designed to appeal to the horny, teenage boy who longs to live in a world where beautiful women will take their clothes off and have sex with any guy who's available."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Raunchy Comedy That's Surprisingly Sweet -- and Smart","review":"A raunchy but very funny and ultimately touching comedy. Much smarter than you would expect, and with a sweet center to it. It's not for the prudish -- there's some pretty frank sexual dialogue -- but it's all in good fun, and ultimately has a lot of pretty wise stuff to say about love, sex, relationships, and innocence.The performances are all great: Steve Carell tackles a really difficult role wonderfully, and as someone who had loved his work in \\"The Daily Show\\" for years, I was impressed at his acting ability here. And Catherine Keener is as wonderful as always -- funny and sweet and sexy, as Andy's love interest.Well worth viewing for the waxing scene alone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad humor","review":"I gave it one star for the song he sang at the end of the movie. That was funny. I rented this movie after all the hype from the reviews on TV. I took it back (the long version) to the store because it was disgusting. I was told the long version was \\"over the top\\". Well the regular version was just as bad. Why we have to laugh at this kind of humor is just beyond me. I guess there are alot of people out there (just like the men in this movie) who are so bored with their lives that they have to laugh at this type of humor.It could have been a clever movie if they had cut the porn and sick humor. It was nothing more than a glorified porn movie. Call it what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch- My virgin ears...","review":"I bought this movie because I heard it was hysterical. I was very disappointed. Although there were funny parts in the movie, I found that the \\"F\\" word and other vulgarities were used so frequently that it took away from anything that might have been amusing. I am not usually offended by swearing, but the behaviors in this movie were offensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"People have problems","review":"This movie was funny... period! Those who didn't laugh out loud at it are neurotic, and probably voted for the Republicans. Don't turn people away from this movie. There is far more crap out there to waste your time on. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"a new low for humor *SPOILERS*","review":"capping this off quick, i was told \\"you HAVE to see this movie - for the waxing scene alone! he ad-libbed all the lines during the scene, and the audience was rolling on the floor! it's so funny you won't believe it!'thank god i rented it before deciding to buy it. i watched this piece of crap w/o ONE laugh right up to the chest wax scene.the ad-libbed 'brilliance' was this:\\"motherf**ker! f**k me! in the a**hole! you sh**head!\\". that's when i had finally had enough, and turned it off. if THAT can make audiences howl, then i realize how dumbed down humor has become. i don't think i've seen a \\"comedy\\" this bad since \\"clifford\\", and that's saying something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much potty humor","review":"The main characters were good, but the supporting roles were just to weird for me.

I have a Navy SEAL for a father and 3 brothers. I LIKE GUY MOVIES...trust me. This movie should have never been made. It was a complete waste of film. We bought it because we loved Steve in his other parts esp Bruce Almighty, but this movie is nothing like that. Not funny. You've seen all the funny parts on the commercials. Please rent this before you waste your money on it. Go rent/buy Tommy Boy or Major Payne and get a real laugh with comic genius at work.If you like to laugh at cussing....then you'll love this movie. I don't think constant cussing is funny. Richard Pryor needed a desk job."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Dude, you look like a man-o-latern!\\"","review":"You might be wondering why 40-year-old virgin is good, right? And why should you watch this one sex comedy instead of AMERICAN PIE or Van wilder? Well, it compares to both of those movies in a way where this one is way funnier than both of them. It's also got a powerful message and very funny, overly obnoxious characters. It's a blast!Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vile!","review":"This movie is vile from the very first frame!

I would highly suggest this movie for a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good romp","review":"Take this film at face value.

It was a truly great comedy. Then I saw the Unrated version, and was very disappointed. The additional 17 minutes or whatever of footage was sometimes funny, but ultimately destroyed the movie's pacing and beauty. It trashed it up a little bit too much, where the theatrical version had enough heart to redeem itself as a complete film. This version, the original theatrical version, is the one you want to see. Don't buy the other one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vindicated and Bittersweet","review":"I'll be the first to say that this film was honest and funny. Yet for me this spoke of a common obsession today: finding a soul mate or the one true love. Under all of the jokes and utter vulgar references to a vagina it is a love story. It is basically a movie about a man who just happens to be a virgin due to some hellish attempts and it comes to be know to his co-workers then he starts a journey to find a relationship. And he is given advice from questionable characters that become is friends. At the end of the day his so called \\"experts\\" or friends are the ones who have no idea what love really is and are taught by the virgin. This movie shines in so many aspects that it is a masterpiece. It is a smart and honest movie that is extremely hilarious. Steve Carell is amazing and the whole cast was amazing in all fronts. So if you like Judd Apatow this is a good movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this movie","review":"The movie had a good beginning, but man - what a crappy finishing. One reason might be the length - this was a 2 hour movie. No comedy needs to be 2 hours.I'd expect a re-edited verson to score much better. There were some real funny moments in the beginning third/half, but the latter parts really sucked the fun out of this one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"hilarious movie","review":"I am sure the movie description written for the product is better than anything I could ever write, so I will just leave it as this is a good movie that I got a great deal on the Blu-Ray. I will say that sometimes they drag the jokes on WAY too long, but once you get past that is is pretty funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve Carrell is the man.","review":"This movie is a good vehicle for Steve Carell's dorky style ofcomedy. When his friends at work figure out that he is stilla virgin, they try to help him with his situation. Some verygood laugh out loud moments, although not necessarily a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catherine Keener is annoying","review":"The 40 year old virgin is a very funny movie, as long as you don't mind vulgar and obscene language and situations. I only have two complaints. First, Catherine Keener. Oh how I wish she was not in this movie. Just to let you know, she laughs, not acts, through the whole film. She laughs like an idiot through every scene. I guess she was hoping that her pretty smile would cover up her lack of talent and/or ability to give the role any depth. The other thing I didn't like was the part at the end where everyone was dancing. This scene goes on for way too long and is far from funny. Other than those two things the movie is great. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movie of 2005...LOL!!","review":"I am not a professional or amateur movie critic for that matter....but I reckon I know a good movie from a bad one. I just based this on \\"feel,reaction, or whatever you wan to call it\\". And this is a very good movie. I can't articulate in words the details as to why this is...but all I know is that 1)this movie makes me laugh out loud throughout 2)I like all of the main and supporting characters-each with their own quirkiness 3)the acting is pretty good 4) the dialouges are sharp and fresh. Overall...the movie just felt satisfying. You know that feeling...like leaving the movie theater and felt that you got your money's worth.

It is unfunny, unintelligent and rife with ridiculous cliches and stereotypes. I have not witnessed such a gross display since \\"Something About Mary.\\"In my opinion, the movie would have been more effective if it had made the point that the problem resides not with people like Andy, but with people like his asinine \\"friends\\" who can't accept him for what he is. Why should a person's private sexual life (or lack thereof) matter to anyone, except to those who are so insecure with their own sexuality that they need to mock others.'

I like him too, but I think this movie was more slapstick than a really great comedy.

I don't like movies that take too long to get to the point. Steve Carell had a few moments, but that was it. The chest hair waxing part of the movie wasn't funny at all.

My strength had decreased as if I had done no lifting in that time. In addition, I gained no muscle. I wonder if these other reviews were simply written by the authors to help them sell books. It seems odd that these two non-physiolygist guys would discover something that qulaified researchers hadn't. The book contradicts many common assumptions about nutrition and lifting.

Somehow along the way it became normal to do full reps. In my experience holding a weight dormant while the muscle is contracted fatiques the muscle much faster than the traditional \\"pump\\". I have been doing traditional full-rep weight lifting for years, and when I switched to static training I saw an immediate surge in strength. People in the gym will look at you like you don't know what you're doing but in my opinion they are wasting their time. I do agree with some of the reviews of the pictured exercises listed. It simply does not show enough. Try doing traditional chin-ups this way, or even traditional push-ups. How about dips? After several second your arms will begin to tremble. It works wonders. One of the keys is to remember to take plenty of time off between workouts until you feel fully recovered.

The approach to rapid strength gains described in this book is scientifically-sound, inherently safer due to limited range of motion, and most importantly, it really works. This comes from a non-weight-trainer who is now working out with 900 pounds on the leg press after just eight weeks of following Static Contraction Training. More importantly, the rapid strength gains made possible by these techniques provide new options to those who may have been considering the use of illegal drugs to accelerate muscle growth.

At the same time, if you are not lifting really heavy weights now, this system might work well for you.When I firest learned about static contraction training, I helped my wife try it on her bench press. She started off being able to hold 50 pounds for only 5 seconds. Two weeks later, without touching a weight in between, she could hold the weight for 15 seconds. This strength increase may have been caused by learning to hold a heavy weight rather than building more muscle, but who cares?

Obviously they did not.These examples were written for a previous version of Java and simply not updated. Another example of slapping a Java 2 title onto an old Java 1.1 book.This present a critical obstacle to the newbie who will not know how to alter the programs to get them running.

This is both. As stated many times prior to this message, the author did not include the JDK package on the CD that comes with the book. The code is all there but if you're planning on starting from scratch with this book, it doesn't provide the most necessary resource, the Software.

Their support web site is no help either. By the way, the paragraph following the one above goes on to tell you where you can find the JDK on the web (so you can get it after you find out that it is not on the CD, I suppose).

While this would not be a problem if the music is just serving as background sound as you do other things, in a massage, a client's mind looks to the music for calm and focus. For many, music is an essential component of the relaxation response during a massage.

Dracula 2000 would have made an excellent movie if it had stuck to the original Dracula story by Bram Stoker, because it is such a great story and it would have been awesome to see the story in take place during modern times.

Shame on writers Joel Sassoon and Patrick Lussier for forgetting what made their previous effort worthwhile: a good cast and some fresh innovations on the vampire legend. This one with its notion that vampires must untie all knots and count pebbles is so far out, it's goofy.I won't venture into the third of this series, which features of all people RUTGER HAUER as the vampire.

This came with four cheeses: Canadian, American, Irish, and Australian. Basically, the Aussie was OK, crumbly, a little dry, but good for grating. No better than half the vermont cheddars I've had. Irish was the best for me, a little creamier than the Aussie, but still sharp. My favorite of the bunch. The American cheese, it had the texture of a parm-reg, didn't melt, and tasted and chewed like rubber. Terrible. Now since it's only been 2 weeks since I have gotten this package, so I haven't tried the Canadian. It is definitely a little softer and less crumbly than the other two, I will update when I open the package. So far, one out of three was Somewhat good, but no better than your supermarket Tillamook or Colbert.

They work well, are lightweight, and didn't break the budget.

Sure, it sounds like a good idea...a cordless string trimmer that conveniently hangs in the garage and plugs into the electrical outlet. It would be good if it worked though. It takes me about an hour and a half to edge my property, which means I have to plug this thing back in 4 or 5 times to allow it to recharge. It might last 20 minutes on a full charge on a good day. Its pathetic. It also seems that the string gets stuck, and the only way to unlodge it is to bang it on something hard (which the directions specifically say that you shouldn't have to do this because it is an easy to feed cord).

When you see the B&D; name, one would expect a piece of decent equipment. But this trimmer is a useless hunk of garbage.I agree with everyone else on here regarding the trimmer's battery: its pathetic. You can charge it up over night, or for two weeks for that matter, and you only get 10 minutes of cutting time. What can you actually accomplish in 10 minutes? Maybe if you have an eight foot square yard this trimmer would be great. And, as someone else here stated, it tells you nowhere on the package or manual how long the battery's charge will last. This is absolutely unacceptable from a company such as B&D.;This trimmer is worthless. DO NOT BUY IT. It cuts well enough but it will take you a week of cutting/recharging/cutting ad nauseum to get your yard done... just in time to start trimming it all over again. Worthless.

The novelty wore off within 30 seconds of using this trimmer. I did not have the same problem with how long the battery lasted as other people because it would only take me 1-2 minutes of using it to get so disgusted with the unit that I would quit using it. IF (and its a BIG IF) it did actually cut something, it was more like it beat the weed or grass to death then cutting it.It also seemed as though the function where it automatically releases more string did not work very well as it would take a long time for it to figure out it needed more string.

That did not work.Then I get the new one and charge it up and it keeps running out of battery life. I have a very small yard.

The mandate was total, the methods ruthless, and not even the rare acquittal meant freedom - the Gestapo waited outside to take the unfortunate victim to a concentration camp anyhow.This sorry record of legalistic lynching is well told here with useful appendices, notes, sources, and index, and by the way - the guilty jurists were not prosecuted, but smoothly and quietly resumed their careers after the war.(The \\"score\\" rating is an ineradicable feature of the page.

I was afraid that the same would be true of \\"The Greatest American Hero\\".Even while aprehensive, I had to own it. Let me tell you, my fears were unfounded.

The concept of having the supersuit but not the instructions saved this series from the tedium of typical superheroes who are invincible.

I purchased some Shadow \\"remastered\\" CD's about 8 years ago and they were great! I could understand everyone and everything. After wear and tear I needed to replace them so I purchased this product.

I am a watch junkie - cannot ever be without one, and will take it off to shower at night and put it back on and sleep with it on. I also have horses and ride daily, which can be hard on a watch (hosing off the horses and the accompanying horse sweat/grime), swim at the Y and really wanted a nice watch that I _never_ have to take off. This fills the bill - and it's _pretty_ too. I was pleasantly surprised at how thin and sleek it was. I like the tiny diamonds as the hour markers - elegant but not gawdy. The only thing I don't like about it is the hands are not illuminated so you cannot read it at night. (And that's the only reason I gave it four stars instead of 5) I've had it a month or so now, have showered, been swimming, bathed horses and it's performed very well.

Hanafi Hayes' programmes about unusual people and places in New Zealand were enormously popular on NZ TV and made him a household name.He recounts in a lively well written style the encounters he and his film crew had with the people featured in his programmes. One series \\"One Man's View\\" sought out colourful reclusives in some spectacular and remote places; another focuses on elderly sportsmen and women still leading active sporting lives well into their 80's and 90's entitled \\"Life begins at 70\\".The film crew had hilarious adventures of their own and Hanafi always brings out the funny side of things which makes it a super book to read to lift the spirits.Accompanied by great photos from the series this is a hugely enjoyable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I needed this to create a diversion","review":"I wanted a hand-held with a rain pour head, this was very good in facilitating that.

The color photography although nice, does not come close to matching the actual colors named in the text. On top of that the colors described in the text are often just plain wrong. The Sherwin Williams Color Chips in the book are totally off when compared to the actual color chip card from Sherwin Williams.

The diamonds are a little darker but you can tell they are blue, especially when light hits them.

I bought 2 of these as Christmas presents(wife and daughter). We have owned many different brands of electric knives through the years and this is the absolute worst I have ever seen. The main problem is that it takes all your strength to force the blades into out or out of the proper cutting position in the knife. I little slip and you could be missing a finger or at least require stitches. The other problem is the lock mechanism. It is spring loaded in the off position.

After using it twice, or rather trying to and then just resorting to a carving knife, I am throwing this away. As others have mentioned there is too big a gap between the blades and it ends up shredding the meat. But, most importantly, the trigger is terrible.

A life with the Son of God.

My personal recommedation is Sally Keil's book, \\"Those Wonderful Women in Their Flying Machines\\".

Yes, we all know our history; or do we? Sure, everyone knows about the Titanic, remember the movie, and of course, we all know about Pearl Harbor; I would ask again: do we? Truly, I do not know how much research or advanced planning went into each episode of Time Tunnel; what I do know is that the \\"human element\\" is added to the stories we think we know as well as to events that could happen in the future. Lastly, have I mentioned that I am now able to see these episodes in COLOR; what a difference color makes over black and white."},{"rating":"2","title":"Advance to the future","review":"The Time Tunnel ranks with Star Trek as one of the brilliant sci-fi masterpieces of the '60s. Sure, it was an adventure series, designed to capture the interest of all audiences. But it has received an undue amount of substandard criticism over the years. Many popular reviews completely fail to appreciate the philosophical concepts behind many of the episodes and focus instead on the scenery or backdrops. In general, I feel the scripts actually improved as the series progressed because the technicians, given their restraints, were learning how to manipulate the Tunnel controls. My favorite episodes remain 'Chase Through Time' and 'The Death Merchant', both of which present thoughtful and challenging scripts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A trip to the past","review":"I was very excited to see the release of THE TIME TUNNEL. I was an avid viewer of this show when it was on the air, so it was like taking my own trip back in time when I put on the first episode. The quality of each DVD is good and the special effects and technology was probably state-of-the-art for the 60's. Although, some of the historical facts may not be entirely accurate, the show still creates a feeling of nostalgia for anyone who watched it while it was on the air. My only disappointment was that the season was broken into volumes, as was done to LOST IN SPACE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultra cheese - but in a really good way.","review":"This is one of those \\"great shows\\" from my childhood and it was a lot of fun to revisit it after all these years. Its really good that the price has dropped by about half however, I mean seriously.... This sure isn't Hamlet. The show is cheesy and cheap, but not in a bad way at all. I found it quite entertaining still. And it is really a treat to see the eternally classy and beautiful Lee Meriwether at what is perhaps the pinnacle of her elegance and grace.The show is more serious then, and far less classic then, Lost in Space or Batman. But it provides the same type of wholesome campy entertainment that has made those shows TV legends. If you don't like cheese however, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TV SCIFI CLASSIC","review":"I absolutely enjoyed this dvd set. The show hasn't been televised much since 1968 and now is the perfect way to view it! This show was a landmark for scifi television in it's time period of the late 60's. Excellent use of bright colors in it's filming and the transfer to dvd is crisp. I never really got into other Irwin Allen shows as much as The Time Tunnel. I rank it among one of my favorite 60's tv shows along other great shows like The Prisoner and UFO."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Irwin Allen Classic!","review":"I have not seen this TV series, since it aired in the 1960's. These films and their special effects borrow from the old film \\"Forbidden Planet\\" which had spectacular matte and property sets back then that are great even by today's standards in computer animated graphics and prop design.I gave this a 4 star rating simply because some of the episodes in season one were not to my fancy, even when I was a boy; but the acting quality and special effects are choice in all episodes.Even the silent home movies Irwin Allen had made on the day in and day out activities going on with the sets and filming were enlightening to watch. What ashame he did not shoot in sound. It would have made them even more interesting to view. I wanted season one simply to have the opening episode which was a classic starring Michael Rennie and the sinking of the Titanic. Don't know if I would buy season two.Cover and DVD quality are fine. No complaints. Its fine for the price. Delivery was on time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs Down","review":"I did not grow up watching Time Tunnel when it originally aired but wanted to see this series because I love time travel themed stories. The first episode (Titanic) was fun but every episode after that seemed like a carbon copy. Every episode follows the same pattern: duo lands somewhere in time (on the Titanic, at the Alamo) where a bad event is going to happen; they attempt to tell someone of the bad event so they can prevent it; that someone thinks they're crazy and locks them up; they finally get someone to believe them and escape; they are unable to stop the bad event from happening; they are then transported to a new period of time; repeat episode. After a few episodes it got pretty boring. Since I don't have the same nostalgia for it as probably most of the viewers buying this set I guess I didn't appreciate it as much. I wanted to like it but can't recommend it. If you've never seen the series I'd say rent it but hold off on buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT COMPLETED","review":"I purchased Time Tunnel vol 1.

I was also thirteen years old when it aired. Honoring my memory, I recently watched several episodes on late-night cable tv. I saw an old, cheesy, severely dated show frought with cold-war hysteria, a relic from a time when might made right, when minorities were rarely allowed on the tube. Why, the \\"futuristic\\" episode I veiwed was down-right hysterical, but for all the wrong reasons. So far as I am now concerned, my memory suffers from a deceided lack of credibility. There is one thing, however, I failed to notice with my thirteen-year-old eyes, that did not escape my more mature, sophisticated self. Lee Merriweather sure had a great set of legs!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"...Kinda Outta Time...tick...tick...tick...","review":"This show was a great adventure series for its' time (wise crack # 1), but it's only a sense of nostalgia. I don't think I could bear to watch the series today. The primitive excuses for technology alone will remind me of 'Plan 9 From Outer Space'. Spray painted cardboard boxes with Christmas lights and toggle swtiches. Geeezzzz! Besides, as another reviewer noted, \\"why did they always find themselves at a crucial turning point in history and not just in someone's backyard barbecue?\\" Ratings aside that is.

However, if you view the series for what it is - GREAT 60's sci-fi entertainment, then you'll love this series. I was eight years old when this aired and I haven't seen it since. I'm happy it is out on DVD and have enjoyed every episode. Watching these old episodes has brought back some great memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"We bought this book for my 3rd grader. He was planing on using it as an autobiography.

Like one of his jokes is:\\"What if horses could talk, but all they said was just stupid, like 'I can hear the radio!' and you'd be like, 'you're magic for this?! what a waste!\\"You'll probably finish listening to this CD with a feeling of ambivalence towards him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very funny.","review":"Seventeen tracks -- but maybe three decent jokes, tops.

SORRY, BUT THIS IS A BAD, BAD BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I did not feel this book at all. It falls so flat--everything might as well be a cardboard cut-out--that it's hilarious the main character is a celebrated writer. The structure of the story should work: a man living off his waning fame as the author of a celebrated novel leaves his prominence, and his leeching girlfriend, for a small village in France, hoping to recapture his inspiration and find some answers about his past.Harris fails to deliver in all respects. The novel reads like a first draft, and I wish she'd realized her mistake and threw the manuscript in the fireplace. In light of character Jay's decision at the end and how it must reflect on Harris, you wonder why she even bothered in the first place. With Jay, Harris barely manages to creat a character more talented and wise than she is.Absolutely terrible. Extra star for sustained effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fomulaeic","review":"This was a choice of my bookclub so I dutifully plowed my way through it. My main beef with this novel is how totally cliched her characters are - especially the minor ones - the bluff general of a grandfather, the rich and famous father with the supermodel and so on - they are like cardboard cut outs stuck in with so little thought. Even the main characters who are fleshed out a little more just dont hold together well enough to be anywhere near believeable - I just didnt CARE what happened to them.There are some redeeming features to the book - I very much enjoyed the gardening folklore and the home remedies. Also the story flowed at a reasonable pace so it wasnt too onerous a task getting through it. But at the end of it I felt it was a totally forgettable book without any of the magic promised by the cover's blurb. Its not a horrible book - its just nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just didn't work for me","review":"I loved Chocolat and the Lollipop Shoes and had just finished the even better Five Quarters of the Orange when I picked up Blackberry Wine. Unlike the others, this was a real struggle to get through. The characters seemed shallow and one-dimensional, as though they needed more work. The plot didn't really develop until well into the novel (it didn't start to get in the least bit interesting until about two thirds of the way in) and even then, it was weak. I think that one of the biggest mistakes was to set it in the same village as Chocolat, making vague references to the events of that novel and giving some of the characters cameos in this one. While I am glad that I made it to the end, this is one book I won't be reading again."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the way back to my childhood","review":"If you liked Chocolate, then read Blackberry wine just to find out what happened to your favourite characters after Vianne had left the villige. The smell of Specials will take you back to your own childhood, you will remember the light, feelings, wishes. Very nice and inspirating reading. It says Funny on the cover, but is is more nostalgic:) Worth buying though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not tasty","review":"Even though I like Joanne Harris' writing, this book alienated me completely. Do not expect the secrets and magic of \\"Chocolat\\" or the mystery and beauty of \\"Five Quarters of the Orange\\". This one is a flat, uninteresting romance. It is full of cliche, the characters are incomplete and unreal, almost stereotyped (the quintessential lonely author looking for magic in his life, the mysterious widow etc.), and the flashbacks in every two pages are tiring and do not allow the reader to enjoy the plot. I couldn't keep it going. I read Five Quarters after that, and I found it much better. Skip \\"Blackberry Wine\\", it just isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum!","review":"After reading and watching Chocolat, I expected an equally delightful book with lovely characters. This book had dull characters, with whom one could hardly sympathize, a homely setting of no charm at all, and a dull plot, which only became interesting once the neighbor started talking to Jay; too little, too late. The alternating flashback chapters were so horribly useless as background material, I read them quickly, only to find myself bored once again by the tiresome plot of silly Jay and his shallow life among the not-quite-eccentrics of his French village. Pity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blackberry Wine Bore","review":"This book entirely missed the mark for me, which was a shame as I had really enjoyed her earlier work \\"Chocolat\\", in this case I felt that the character of Jay Mackintosh and several of the other cast were completely boring and stereotypical, even his early years as a adolescent with the ubiquitous bully boys and his 'saviour' Joe, divorcing parents and elderly disinterested grand parents left me unmoved...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sorce of Inspiration","review":"I loved this book.

The flashbacks to Pog Hill distract from the present day story. The book is tighter and more compelling a read when those chapters are skipped. When the story finally moves away from Jay's fond memories of how great Joe was and goes to the mystery of Jay's neighbor and her daughter Rosa the story hits its stride. I wish it had focused more on them and less on \\"Jackapple Joe.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a book on who the real aces were of the luftwaffe","review":"After reading this book, I gained a new since of being a ace fighter pilot of WWII. I felt Peter Hinchliffe did a good job describing the methods and training of the night time fighter pilots of the luftwaffe. This is a book that gives light to a little known part of world war II. It tells us how the beganings of radar detection for planes came into combat for the first time. After reading this book. I have a deep respect for the german fighter pilots of the night. Unlike their counterparts in the day, these pilots had to navigate and fight almost totally blind in conditions more hazardous than in a normal daylight raid. So if you would like to read a book about the part of the luftwaffe that isn't really mentioned in the history books. Please read this book. I dont think you will be disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely technical","review":"This book gives you a nice all-around view of night fighting in Europe during WW II. It is extremely technical, and I thought it lacks a little bit concerning the human side of the pilots, engineers, etc. But it is the best book ever written about the subject, no doubt about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Analytical plus attention for anekdotes","review":"A comprehensive study of the war between Bomber Command and the nightfighters of the Luftwaffe. The best I've read so far. I got a good overview of the subject. Both sides get even attention. A mixture of analysis and personal recollections of the men who took part in the struggle. Because it concerns technical questions on radio and radar, it is sometimes a bit hard to follow. The onely minus point is that the author hardly gives notes, so that you often don't know where the story comes from. And I sometimes would like to know more about the men described in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bottom Up Democracy Still Matters","review":"This book is very interesting, but the argument might be a bit overstated.

The quality of the coffee was good, but as noted by another reviewer, the machine is finicky. It overflowed a number of times, I'm not sure why. I changed to a paper filter, instead of the gold plate permanent one, and that helped some, although didn't completely eliminate the overflow problem. The piece that is at the bottom of the filter holder broke within four months. It was not fixable at home. Without it the water flowed too fast through the coffee and into the carafe and it was very weak. I give the carafe four stars! Very good, holds the heat well.

The bass is thick and clear (no distortion) and the highs like cymbals and synths are not drowned out. I really enjoy these headphones and use them for everything from casual listening while at work to watching TV while on the treadmill at the gym to watching movies in my bed on my portable DVD player; everything sounds GREAT!The biggest key is to make sure you select the correct size ear-bud tips. The package comes with a pair of three different sizes, small, medium and large. I found for my ears I needed a small tip for the left ear-bud and a medium for the right.

At first, they sounded terrible, but after the burn-in, they're doing great. Bass is pretty clear and the highs are sharp. It seems to be lacking a tiny bit in the higher mid-range, but it's nothing major. The only thing that bothers me is that when the cord hits clothing or anything else, you hear it very clearly. It's the cords that stem from the main cord and go to the earbuds that are the loud ones. They could do with a slightly thicker cable. Otherwise, the construction of the earbuds themselves seems very solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound, nothing to compare to though","review":"I like these headphones quite a bit, and think they've got pretty good sound quality.

They have way to heavy bass (distorted and fuzzy) and the vocals and high tones get lost. It's mush! MUD! They also have the stethescope effect (make noise as they brush up aginst clothing, etc.) and they whistle in the wind a bit. The silicon is not so great...you have to put them too deeply into your ear canal, which only makes them sound more distorted.PASS ON THESE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative EP-630","review":"I have a uncanny hobby for testing earphones. Based on the 4 star rating that was given to the Creative EP-630 on Amazon I gave them a try. I was very dissapointed with them. Terrible lows, very little bass and high's were ok at best. For $35.00 there are much better choices out there including Senniheiser, Altec and Sony. I rated these earphones a two rather than a one because I have heard worse. I would say these earphones are a notch above the cheapo ones that cost $5 to $15.

From my iPhone, I get the best sound out of them by selecting the \\"Treble Booster\\" EQ setting (I tried \\"Bass Reducer\\", but that didn't sound as good). This is, of course, less than optimal.Unfortunetly, I just don't like these. They are very (not just a little, but \\"very\\") muddy and bassy to my ears. I am a 31 year old man that takes hyper-��ber-insane care of my hearing. I have little-to-no hearing loss and frequently hear sounds my peers and family do not, so please don't attribute this to hearing loss! ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks in a month","review":"Mine broke in a month.There is a lot of wire rubbing noise.Noise isolation is so so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep and clear bass, works best with X-fi","review":"It has a deep and clear bass. Details are also clearer than standard ear buds. I tried it with Creative Zen Wav 2GB and I notice improvement especially with the bass. Details are also more noticeable. It also blocks away external noise. I got in in Singapore for S$45 at Creative HQ and I think it is worth the money. When combined with X-fi Extremegamer soundcard's headphone out jack, it is closest to perfect, almost the best music you can get today, possibly second to Aurvana X-fi headphones. It basically works with any standard headphone audio jack, including Zen and Ipod players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality and a great price","review":"Great headphones. Sound quality is excellent as well as soundstage. Bass is pretty tight and strong. 3 choices of silicone buds offer a great fit, and as noted in several reviews, it isolates noise amazingly allowing the music to come through the way it's supposed to. HUGE step up from ipod headphones.only minor complaints are that they get tangled sometimes and the noise from the wires can be annoying for some"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL, QUICK SERVICE!

Excellent....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly Great","review":"Really shocked by the quality of these. I got them as a temporary replacement for my super fi 5 headphones while i sent them back to be repaired. They were lighter, sounded about as good, and had a way better fit. I never got around to sending the super fi 5's in to get repaired and now i just had a cord snap and i'm in for another pair if i can't get them fixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bang for the buck","review":"Usually, earbuds that sound great lean toward the pricey side, like $100+.These are very good sounding earbuds that won't break the bank.

At least not at this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"flawed design","review":"the fit is funny no matter which size i use. i have previously used a sony one similar to this. since it doesn't fit properly, i can't judge its sound quality. the earbud is too short/stocky. its really useless for me because i must pressed into my ear in order to get the full sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good...until they stop working....","review":"So...I love these...they block out annoying noises. BUT..they stop working randomly. I've owned 2 pairs and both had the same pattern. One side stopped working..then the other. You have to play with the cord to get the sound to continue and you just end up getting annoyed. Both started doing this after a few months. I'm going to something else...."},{"rating":"1","title":"These were great when in ear buds first came out, now they lack","review":"These were Creative's first and worst attempt at noise isolating in-ear buds (first in-ear from any company for under $50 back in 2006). The high frequencies get clipped (or 'hollow'), and the rubber material used in the cord creates a stethoscope effect that recently manufactured in-ear buds have improved on. That said, I have not yet upgraded and still find use for these when I am in especially noisy areas (rarely).If you sort the reviews on here by \\"newest first\\", you will see a trend of lower ratings in recent years, though over half of recent ratings still give 5 stars because of the noise cancellation. In a loud environment, in-ear noise blocking ear buds will sound better than standard ear buds or even much more expensive open-ear reference headphones.My 1 star rating reflects the EP-630's vs a more recently manufactured bud I tried (the 'Jbuds J2'), which I suspect is similar to other recently designed buds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-par muddy fuzzy sound, AVOID!!!","review":"Got a pair of these with my Dell XPS Laptop for free. I used to guess this is a rebrand of Senheiser CX-300(which I own), since they look almost exactly the same. However, after getting EP-630, I can tell you these are totally different products. EP-630 has a fuzzy muddy sound which blurs everything together. CX-300 is not a high-end earphone, but it delivers sound far better than EP-630.Did a quick comparison with some of the earphones I have. EP-630 is only better than the ones came with a Creative Zen micro MP3 player. But, I only paid $30 for the MP3 player, basically that earphone probably worth $2. EP-630 could not even beat the earbuds came with iPhone. IPhone earphones sound more balanced and clearer than EP-630. This would tell you a lot.EP-630 simply becomes unbearable after I listen to the same music with my Senheiser HD-280 and Etymotics ER-4s.AVIOD this one, there are many other earbuds in $30 range much more worthy than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Deal","review":"At first I was worried that these headphones would be a waste of money since from the pictures available they look less appealing than other headphones(I've owned some pretty awful headphones) but I was pleasantly surprised that they have a high sound fidelity. More so than the Sony Fontopia which I owned prior to these. It is more than worth the price they sell at considering it has such a clear sound. I would recommend these to those who want decent audio without spending more money on their headphones than their MP3 players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, except...","review":"These earbuds are pretty darn good considering their low cost. Good clarity and the soundstage isn't cramped.I took a star off because the straight plug failed and the headphones no longer worked.

Hurts my ears...","review":"I bought these headphones, had them for only 1 day and returned them for refund.Sound is good, nothing special though...My main problem is once you put these in your ear they are air tight and when you pull them out of push them in it pushes and pulls on your ear drum, I find this very uncomfortable. I was using them at work and I am constantly putting them in and out when someone was talking to me or I needed to get up and do other things. I did try other sizes of ear pieces (the ones provided and even others) but when it's too loose it loses sound quality.I much prefer the Sony MDR-EX71 headphones, they are very similar except they have small holes in the back of the ear piece which allow for ventilation, while the silicone ear piece is sealed in your ear the air can escape through the tiny holes in the back of the ear piece.I would not recommend these headphones to anyone..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy them!","review":"If you are looking for in-ear headphones look no further - the sound quality is superb and the noise isolation is excellent. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best value cost-benefit!","review":"I have tryed many headphones looking for a complete range of sounds but also a good level of noise isolating. This little headphones functions better even than most of that big complete-over-ear heavy headphones. Believe me, this cheap in-ear headphones will surprise you with a great, great sound. The only posibly problem is that you need to put it inside your ears, and some people doesn't like that experience. But if you doesn't care about, then you will really enjoy this headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative EP-630","review":"The sounds (music and voice) are distorted. (Have used buds for FM listening as well. Voices seem to have a slight echo.) Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ear buds not a great concept?","review":"I was disappointed as these are only a little better than the ear buds that came with my iPod. None of the three sizes of foam ear pieces are all that comfortable or secure in my ears, and are only marginally better than the iPod version at noise-canceling. My $15 Sony MDR A-35 conventional style headset has much better tone, stereo separation, and comfort. Maybe ear buds are just not that great a concept. I could have spent a lot more on ear buds, but I see no reason to - I'll stick with my conventional Sonys."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON\\"T BUY THESE","review":"Go to Big Lots and buy a $3.00 pair ofSentry headphones and you won't be anymoredisappointed-you'll just spend a lot lessmoney.

Used them for a day and now I'm returning them.The audio quality seems as though it would be really good. The only problem is that the construction of the phones promote that stethoscope sound from transmitting whenever the wires encounter vibrations (i.e. when you move). This problem makes them all but unusable unless you are completely still while using the headphones.Unless you only plan on using these headphones while sitting on the couch, do not bother to buy them.

The soft silicone does a decent job of reducing external noise, especially higher frequency ones.I compared with a very old (1st generation) pair of Bose noise canceling headphones and found that the Bose canceled almost all external low frequency noise (e.g. running dishwasher) and some of the higher frequency noise. On the other hand, the Creative earphone cancels higher-frequency well but not low frequency. If you have music turned up to medium, it effectively blocks out sounds like keyboard typing.I'm unhappy with the frequency response of these. The bass is almost non-existent (worse than my 10-year old Sony $20 earphones) and the treble is decent but nothing to write home about. I'm a classical musician so trust me, I know how \\"life like\\" sound is supposed to sound.These are definitely not life-like.I think the best use may be for audio podcasts, that's about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic... and at an unbelievable price","review":"I heard about these when I shopped for Bose in-ear bud headphones. Someone compared the sound quality to the Bose brand. At a quarter of the price, I thought I'd give them a try.Of course they aren't Bose quality, but they give a relatively good chase. First, they blocked out background sound. Then, I could hear bass and treble sounds in my music that I'd never noticed with my silly iPod earbuds.I'm buying a second set... one for home and one for the office. I'm surprised that the earbuds didn't fit some people. I never had trouble. The only reason why I rated these a 4 instead of a 5 is because they have the tendency to pop out when I'm running... but so did the iPod ones, so it's not a huge loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"they're good","review":"I was mowing my lawn listening to my ipod with the ear buds it came with and I could barely here my jams (this is at maximum volume)...then I did it again with these ear buds and man did it dampen outside noise...I could really hear my music and I didn't even have to have the volume all the way up! One problem is they fall out of my ears and that gets annoying; and when I try to really stick them in it hurts my earholes...Overall I think they kick butt all hardcore and poop!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buds","review":"These are great little buds! I had a set that came with my laptop, and ordered this pair for my girlfriend. They stay in her ears (all others would fall out while she was working out at gym).

So many things I was taught didn't \\"ring\\" true for me. Now it all makes sense.This book reads a lot like a dissertation, but keep reading because the conclusions she makes are fascinating and eye opening.

Now I can thank God for making me a woman! :DI will never look at the Bible, Judaism, Christianity, or Islam in quite the same way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daring to take an Honest Look","review":"Fascinating look at the religious history of the human species. Stone dares to research thoroughly and to examine that evidence honestly, knowing that the truth is nothing to be feared. Stone presents the evidence, and suggests, allowing the reader to use intelligence and draw conclusions for her/himself. If some of the middle chapters seem slow going, it is only the calm before the storm as the evidence gathers to its conclusions. Stone is NOT alone in these researches or in her conclusions; respected scholars such as Joseph Campbell and M. Gimbutas and a host of others have also trod this path. Hers is simply a superbly researched presentation which is respectful of the reader. It is very difficult for many, even scholars, to have the courage and honesty to examine deeply-held prejudices and preconceptions; those who are willing to do so will find this book thrilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read!","review":"This book is an eye-opener, coherent and well researched.

This book set the tone for many to come, and the reason this particular book is important is that it is based in actual archaeology.

There are two tiny bulbs on either side of the time display and they don't light up the time very well.

Then, it only snoozed for four minutes! I want to snooze for nine. I didn't care for the back light - two small lights from the side rather than the soft blue glow behind the time that I'm used to.

I nearly break a fingernail every time I set a different wake up time or turn off/on the alarm setting. And don't even think about selecting the alarm setting; I have to choose the alarm with snooze setting. With snooze, I can stop the alarm noise with the push of a big snooze bar; but with the alarm only setting, I have to be awake enough to locate the right control and try not to break my fingernail when attempting to turn it off. Worst trave alarm clock I every had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"Don't buy this product. I wanted a replacement for my last travel clock that I had also used daily on my nightstand.

Are you kidding?","review":"Should be a 5 Star, but the lighted display deserves a 1 Star. A worthy travel alarm clock is difficult to find. It seems there is always something no quite right with any model. The Westclox Travelmate has everything right: easy to set, large AM/PM indicator for alarm setting, increasing alarm volume and snooze, small and lightweight. BUT, the so-called light is so lame you cannot read the time even up close, and even in a very dark space,. Perhaps we received a lemon, but it is obvious the lighted display is not \\"Indiglo\\" which is also impossible to find now-a-days. If you don't need a lighted display this is one of the best travel alarms by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Received the Westclox Travelmate today, and just printed the return label.The face light does not illuminate; AM/PM does not appear on the face; the alarm is barely discernable, and yes...my hearing is excellent.

I loved this design with all the controls conveniently located on the front of the clock. However, when I tested it in the dark I was so disappointed. It is described as 'backlight on demand'. However it is not backlit at all. There are two very weak, relatively useless, little bulbs on either side of the time display that do not shed enough light to allow you to read the time in a dark room. This just won't work for me. I'm returning it. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Serves My Purpose","review":"This is a good clock/alarm with an easy-to-read display. The snooze function comes in handy.

I like the little Westclox better for about the same amount of money (I bought both, but I am not using this one at all). Hey, it works, and it lasts (both units). In a day where quality is in short supply, I guess this is a good investment since it is also relatively cheap as well as pragmatic.

Great travel Alarm."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent alarm clock","review":"When weight and space are key, the Westclox travelmate alarm clock is a good pick. This alarm clock folds to a nice size and can fit in nearly any small space in your suitcase. Setting the alarm and time was easy and intuitive -- you do not need a guide. When folded, the clock is protected by a fairly hard plastic cover. I consider this a durable piece of equipment. The one gripe is that the light that illuminates the time is very, very dim. If you want to check the time in the wee hours, you may need a small flashlight depending on your level of vision. If you are looking for a small replacement bedside clock or something with a bright display, keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"westclox travel clock","review":"The clock is small, sleek and made by a reputable company. The only disappointment is the backlighting to view the clock in the dark. It is so dim you can barely read the time.

I hope that is true as I have not used it yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good travel clock","review":"The price is right on this clock. The size is perfect, especially when folded for packing and taking with. It sits at a good angle when it's open, and the backlight is sufficient. The alarm tone being sufficient to wake you up is, of course, by personal opinion. It works for me, but it might not work for you if you're a heavy sleeper. I would also knock the battery choice...coin type versus a AA or AAA. I worry how quickly that coin battery will die since I'm a habitual \\"3 time snoozer.\\" I ordered a card of 10 batteries, so I'd have plenty on hand just in case."},{"rating":"2","title":"the perfect small clock","review":"The Westclox Travelmate is multi-useful. Use when travelling, at work, or at home. The ideal \\"backup\\" when weather-related problems develop. Keep one in your car (and boat, etc).

Why did they even bother? But I find that hotels have clocks next to the bed that I can check if necessary. I just don't trust the hotel clock alarms and they are usually way too complex to set. So I have been using these for years with total confidence. They are reliable, simple, easy to pack, indestructable (suitcases have been stored in blazing hot and freezing cold attic) and easy to set. Since I figure the batteries are going to go one of these days (they are yearssss old), and it's easier to buy new than find replacement batteries (much less find a screwdriver small enough to open the back) ... time to order a few more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Backlight Very Dim","review":"This was such a great buy and I received it in record timing according to the shipping estimate. However, I'm quite disappointed in the backlight of the clock. It is too dim. Perhaps, mine is defective because the numbers are unreadable even when the light is on. I need to turn the light on in the room to see them and that defeats the purpose of having a backlight. At least that's how my clocks have worked in the past.I would not repurchase this because I'm unable to determine if the light would be bright enough for visibility in the dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in backlight","review":"The back lighting on this clock is horrible.

My previous one of this model with the same dim light works for years.If it had a night light that i could read in the dark it would be great.If you have to put on reading glasses to read it, and maybe a lamp, it isn't good enough.

I measured it at 75 dB at a distance of 1 foot from the alarm (usingthe sound metercomponent of Smart Tools Pro on an Android phone).This would be forgivable if the alarm were persistent, but it shuts off after one 1 minute of operation.The light is ineffective; you won't be able to read the time on this clock in a dark room without an external light source.In addition, this alarm uses a 1.5v button style battery, a form factor that might be hard to locate in a pinch should it run out on the road.Avoid if the user is a heavy sleeper!Better than no alarm clock at all...but barely."},{"rating":"2","title":"travel alarm isn't alarming enough!","review":"Great little clock, compact, easy to read, but not loud enough to wake me up!

It kept the feeling of a Hispanic-American community authentic."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good read","review":"This Mexican-American story is a great piece of literature.

Lincoln moves schools from a poor school to a rich kid school which he calls the kids GAVACHOS which is a spanish word for white kids. Lincold needs to decide if he wants to lead his new basketball team to victory against his old basketball team which was the poor kids.

At first I was interested because like the character in the book, I had just recently gone to a new school. But as we got further into it, it got boring. It was hard to follow, and they kept repeating the same topics. And the sides he had to take were a lot less imperative than I expected. It was just kind of like which school I like better. I think you need to be older to read it, because it will put 6th graders who like action or strong storylines to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"taking sides","review":"A kid named Lincoln moved from his house where he wason the Basketball team and had a lot of friends.He alsohad a girlfriend who he had to dump because he moved.He goesto this new school and has the same stuff as the old school.The new school has a lot more money then the old school.Hethen has to play his old friend's team in Basketball andis forced to take a side.

I most definately reccomend"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent opportunity to obtain everyday grace.","review":"I read \\"A Return to Love\\" by Marianne Williamson and I recommend \\"A Return to Love\\" to everyone. Particulary to those who are confused by the many religious doctrines in this world that have more rules than love. \\"Everyday Grace\\" is a great companion to the spiritual path that \\"A Return to Love\\" began for me. I can find something in it to help every circumstance in my everyday living. Easy to read and easy to follow. Enjoy it and use it to bring peace, joy and grace into your life. I also recommend \\"Illuminata\\" by Marianne Wilson, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"She is a gift of grace","review":"Everytime I think the world gets too much for me to take this writer comes out with something better and better. She always pulls me up by the bootstraps. Even better, she reminds me not to hate or be angry but that love will heal. I always look to her tapes and books when I need uplifted. This one, ILLUMINATA and A WOMAN\\"S WORTH are simply the best. Two thumbs up for writing positively about the Harry Potter books and seeing them for what they are. She is grace herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"This tape will put you to sleep","review":"If you love Marianne's tapes, do not buy this one. She reads in a breathey, monotone, drone.

I love everything Marianne does, but this one is especially nice because it made me feel that magic that I felt when I read \\"Return to Love\\" ten years ago and then \\"Illuminatta\\" a few years later. It has been quite awhile since she's written this kind of book. It's wonderful to be able to open the book up anywhere and get a nice spiritual jolt. It's the kind of book that makes you feel giddy that life is going to be not only Ok, but amazing. Pelase also check out a recent book release that Marianne edited with lot's of amazing cultural visionaries called; IMAGINE: What America Could be in the 21st Century."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Psychobabble continues","review":"Marianne Williamson's take on grace, mysticism, miracles, and so forth are an attempt to bring feel good spirituality into life. Williamson's text, A Course in Miracles, is the basis point for her teachings. Everyday grace is one of the more recent hodge podges of spirituality offered in an eclectic mix from Williamson whose mantra of love casts out all fear continues in her theological constructs. The one thing is .... everyday grace is far more simple than it seems. Everyday grace is about being in the flow. Williamson conjures up more feel good spirituality which she is known for."},{"rating":"1","title":"really really BAD BOOK","review":"The Everyday Grace is written help you come back to your spiritual source, exploring ways in which we can nurture our soul. On page 4 she tells of her journey in magic, philosophy, astrology, tarot, the I Ching, she looked into Christianity, Judaism and more.As you read this book, you will see that she mixes ideas/beliefs she found in magic, philosophy, astrology, tarot, the I Ching, Christianity, Judaism, course of miracles... Now the question is this, are you OK with this book feeding you with nonsense she build up from her experience in different religions? This would be like a cake that has meat, sweets, vegetables, fruits, and dirt all in one.Bottom line: Occasional good thought does not make this a good book when it contains spiritual poison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comforting, life-enriching","review":"Another winner by Marianne Williamson. This book is about the themes of having hope (and maintaining it), creating happiness and forgiving the hurts of the past. Of course, these are not new themes, especially from Marianne Williamson, but it's always so soothing and renewing to read her words.Lightly touching on \\"A Course in Miracles,\\" Williamson shows how we can reframe our view of the universe and how we fit in it. She's right on about how many of us start our day--getting wrapped up in hectic news and things outside of us. A good day, and a good life, starts from within.I always appreciate references to spiritual texts of all faiths, but this book also used Cinderella and Snow White as metaphors, which I found elementary and perhaps even forced. Also, the use of techniques being called \\"wands\\" (as in magic wands) was strange and not really necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyday Grace: don't you just love her title!","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who wants to turn their life around. If prayer and meditation speaks to you you'll love it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Title says it all ...","review":"Everyday Grace Having Hope, Finding Forgiveness, and Making Miracles this title truly says it all! Years ago I read Illuminata and have gone back to it time after time. I suspect I will have the same experience with this book. Marianne has this way of seeing all the ills in this world and making a choice to believe in goodness. Celebrating miracles, taking deep soul-filled looks within our selves and choosing to make the best out of life. She is a tried and true inspiration. I am thrilled to have purchased Everyday Grace and can see why it was a #1 New York Times Bestseller!

Personally, I am not an Ashanti fan anyway, but this sort of puts the icing on the cake. The first cd was much better and it's not just because of the fact that she was a new artist and no one really knew her style, but almost every song on this cd sounds the same. Out of the 16 songs on this cd, I only play 3 songs: Rock wit u, Rain on me, and I don't mind. Other than that, everything sounds sampled and her voice sounds more like she is whining than singing. I really do not understand because Ashanti can usually hold a tune, but this cd completely did not hold anything with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than 1 good song (rare on many cd's)","review":"I was surprised by how good this cd is.

I did like her first song foolish and everyone knows she took the beat from Biggie's One more chance but I did not know the beat to all of her songs are somebody elses. Her rock with you video is horible. When did she become Janet Jackson. She does not deserve the title of princess of hip hop when you have a lot more talented young female artist like tweet,lil'mo,beyonce,brandy, and a lot more. If you want good music don't buy this cd because you are going to try to find the nearst pond shop and get your money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Decent at best....","review":"This CD is decent. And I think the current overall score of 3 is worthy. Not being an Ashanti fan at all, I did give this CD a listen and I found stuff that I liked and also stuff that I definitely didn't like. Items such as, \\"Sweet Baby\\", \\"Rock wit u\\" and the best song on the disc...\\"Rain on me\\" all were good. Mostly all of the other songs were listenable, but I wouldn't want to do it twice. There are some really generic songs on here. In my opinion, where this Ahsanti disc goes wrong is allowing all of these thug sounding guys on her songs. I for one, have had it with singers and rappers working together. It worked with Mary J and Redman, but it need not be on every disc I hear! This CD also had way too many skits that weren't really necessary in my opinion. All in all, it's a semi-decent listen, but don't expect it to be a must have. Ashanti needs an energy boost as does much of R&B with the exception of the neo-soul artists. It's time to start doing things differently."},{"rating":"2","title":"different in a good way","review":"In my opinion this cd is very very good it shows Ashanti in a way that i wished we wouldve seen sooner. this cd gave me chills when i first heard it, I knew ashanti wanted 2 prove herself in this album and she certainly did it. The best songs are certainly \\"breakup to makeup\\" and \\"living my life\\", although i think she overdid it at the end of breakup to makeup, Her vocals and lyrics match perfectly with the beats and make this a must have album. But i gave it 4 stars cause the skits, intros, outros really just werent workin 4 me, they were corny, and it brought down the level of classiness this cd has"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not soo good!","review":"Ashanti's new album \\"Chapter 2\\" isn't all that.

Her voice gets annoying after a while and the cd is reminiscent of an 80's discoteque. The style of music is mostly disco? I always thought that ashanti was a hip hop star. There are maybe afew good songs on the cd, such as \\"rock wit me\\" and the story of love. The rest are seem old and have been done before. Ashanti should try and go into new lengths in her music. She should choose better songs to sing and stop collaborating with those rap people. They dont make her anybit gangsterish, but even more annoying and less nice. She should try and find a new label such as sony maybe. Murder inc doesnt try to exuberate her talent. I am sure that she has got a good voice (maybe shown in shany shia), but the songs she sings doesnt make us want to know! Sorry ashanti! Try harder next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Support real artistry","review":"I'm not hear to crack on Ashanti, but, I have been disappointed with the world and their acceptance of musically-challenged artists. Every year, we find new artist and put them on this pedastal of greatness, and they (the artist) prove time and time again that they actually can't sing live. Last years and this years happened to be Ashanti. Ashanti can't sing, and for all the people out there who think she can........clean out your ear wax! It's really thick! But, I give Ashanti credit for being able to write catchy tunes, but this album is a step back form her first album. The songs lack substance and I would suggest you pick up Tweet's Southern Hummingbird or Beyonce's Dangerously In Love."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Step Down","review":"I feel that the music on this CD is a step down from her first album.

ASHANTI YOUR ALBUM ISN'T ALL THAT GOOD."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell???","review":"Ok...Ashanti...this album SUCKED. Honestly, I thought all her songs from her second album \\"Chapter 2\\" were AWFUL! When she first came out with \\"Ashanti\\" I liked it. She wasn't my favorite artist, but I could atleast tolerate her, but now, it's like \\"What the hell is this??\\" I want to hear MUSIC, not some \\"Aww baby\\" all the damn time. Nobody should say the word \\"Baby\\" in so many songs. It's pathetic and shows they have nothing better to sing about. Besides, she can't sing that well anyway. She's definitely not Beyonce or Janet. So, Ashanti, it's either do better next time, or just sit back and let REAL artist work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money !","review":"I will admit that I bought this CD the first day it was released because of it's sale price and out of curiousity. After all the fuss that was made about her not being able to sing, I was prepared to hear Ashanti prove her critics wrong. Unfortunately, in my opinion, I thought the CD was horrible. I couldn't get through a single song without skipping ahead. Throughout the CD you'll hear the other artist say how beautiful and talented Ashanti is.

Right now, she's just a studio singer.I am mad that I brought this album.

I have hear to it several times and I can only remember the sounds or chorus lines of \\"Break Up\\" and the other one that saids \\"Dreammaker make my dreams come true....\\", all the songs sound the same.

This is why i can't be buying cd's full price. Im sorry this cd is junk. At first i was trying to like it but i can't get with a cd that has no orignal beats!

There are a couple songs I like, including \\"Rain on me\\" and \\"Then ya gone\\" (which has a good message with lyrics like \\"See, everyday we complain about lil ups and downs/ We needa be thanking the lord that we're still around/ U gotta live everyday as if its ya last one\\"). Since most of the songs aren't catchy, don't have good lyrics or beats, you're forced to pay attention to Ashanti's singing, or lack thereof. It's not good. The tracks I mentioned would be sooooo much better if they were sung by someone with a really good voice like Mariah or Christina, but, nonetheless, they're still good. The only other song I like on this album is the first single from this CD, \\"Rock wit U (aww baby)\\". She does say \\"awww baby\\" way too much, though. Her voice sounded better on her debut album. Or maybe I didn't notice her voice because the songs were good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please!!

Its hard for me to write this because I know Ashanti is trying really hard, but she just don't have it. She has a nice tone, but she has no range. Her songwriting is worst on this album,than on her last album. And once again, she is sampling every song from back in the day. No Growth. Plus, she has those annoying skits with that guy name Chink Santana (who made you want to scream, \\"Shut Up all that noise\\"!!!). I am not hating on this girl, I really tried to like this album, but this album doesn't cut it. Despite the fact I didn't like her last (first) album, I went out like a dummy and purchased this one.

For example \\"i think i like how your body feels next me\\"(then the horrible awww baby) c'mon anybody could write that. Geez i could write a couple of her songs and probably have more hits than the songs on this album. Well her singing needs better tuning and the producers just plain [stink] on this album.

Secondly, about half of her songs are sampled from artists like Issac Hayes (Rain On Me), and other old school R&B hitmakers. Third, her lyrics are horrible. Does her vocabulary include any words other than \\"baby\\" (ie. her third single \\"Baby\\" sampled from Scarface's \\"Mary Jane\\" included on her debut album, \\"Rock Wit U, Aww Baby\\" from this album, and \\"Sweet Baby\\" on this album)???? Besides all that, the cd has too many skits and the second track isn't even a song!! I do not understand what all the hype is over her!!!! Chink Santana and Irv Gotti have no originality and make her worse than she already is. If she wasn't cute she would be a nobody.

It's the best song on the album. Ashanti's singing is atrocious but the song itself makes up for her weak singing (after reading some of the reviews I find out even that song is sampled). Someone with a little more soul like Mary J. Blige would have done it justice. The other tracks on the album just make me wish I would have kept my $13.00 in my pocket.

Enter Ashati, who's debut album caused much unwarranted hype, with a vocal range that does not even catagorize her as a \\"singer\\" and elementry lyrics. How many times can one stand to hear baby?

The melody is more of a romantic touch where jazz and r&b have become the main players. Chapter II is more soul which compliments the first cd which was more hip hop, instead this cd has become more vocally involved and it would be recommended for those that love jazz and r&b.

Stop talking over the beats fool. You cannot take anything away from the voice and vocal stylings of Ashanti. Hands down the girl can sing. What detracts from this CD are her cohorts at Murder Inc, you know the guys with little or no talent, namely Irv Gotti, and Chin Santana. Irv, just keep playing the background man. Your vocals add absolutely nothing to the effort. If this album had any more samples and interpolations on it, they would have to rename it to the remake album. Leave the sampling game to Mary J Blige. She and the team she has surrounding her do a much better job. I thought this was Hip-Hop/R&B man. Ashanti, when your contracts up you should seriously consider bolting for higher ground. Work with some true professionals. Babyface has tons of stuff on ice for you I am willing to bet on it.

I listened to this cd twice and the only song that I like is \\"Rock Wit U.\\" This cd in no way, shape, fashion or form adds up to her former hit. I must admit also her singing on this album is all but impressive.

Ashanti did say that they were using the same formula to make the second album. Which is sampling, using electronics to make her voice sound better, and use the word baby in every song. She incorporates interludes that don't fit the record. She took music from the 70's/80's to use in her songs. It's not that hard to rewrite lyrics to old music. Sampling is okay but does it really need to be done for the majority of the record. She uses the word baby in 90% of her songs. She needs to find a new word to use.

Ashanti, stick to R&B;, and let Mary J. Blige handle hip-hop and soul.How dare someone compare this album to Mary's \\"My Life\\"? That album has feelings, emotions... you can actually feel Mary pour out her heart and soul onto those records. And since she's my favorite artist, I'm a little picky when it comes to someone compared to her.Despite her short-comings (and extremely annoying skits), I'll still give the album 3 stars.

Ashanti has a decent voice and I know she's capable of making better music than this! The only song on here that I can tolerate is Rock Wit U. I bought this album figuring that there are enough tracks on it that I would like at least three or four more in addition to the first single but I was wrong. I won't sell my copy or use it as a coaster because although it won't see the light of day anytime soon I still might one day decide to give it a second listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"no better than the first","review":"rock wit u and rain on me are the only ok songs, she shows a little bit of vocal improvement on rain on me, but her performance skills are not great at all. I saw her singing rock wit u on BET swaying around and if it wasn't for her mixing it with michael jackson's rock with you, she would have gotten booed for it. The Rain On Me video is alright though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wack Big Time....","review":"Crap! Why did I even bought this album. Its trash really. Her debut was much better. You'll get sick listening to this LP cuz its very wack. The productions are so wack.Her first single Rock Wit U is such a turn-off. And Rain On Me is lame! Anyways DON't buy this album cuz its not worth it. Only for tone deaf Ashanti fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad","review":"Honestly, there are 3 songs I sort of, kinda like on the album and they are: \\"Breakup 2 Makeup\\", \\"Rain on Me\\", and \\"Then ya Gone\\". Now when I say I sort of, kinda like these songs I mean they are at the very least melodic and have a point. But really, I listen to them only as a background sound when I'm at my desk at work, so I'm not *really* listening you know what I mean. This cd was actually pretty terrible. She is known for saying baby too much throughout her songs and it's true (on the 3 songs I picked she doesn't say it so much). It's very annoying and can make you angry actually. I don't know about her 1st one, some other reviewers seem to have liked it better but oh well, I'm definitely NOT a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"ASHANT WHATS GOIN ON ????","review":"I DONT KNOW WHATS GOIN ON WITH ASHANTI SHE GOT TO MANY SKITS TO MANY INTRO'S THE SONGS ON THE CD ALL SAY THE SAME THING OUT OF 20 SONGS THERE ARE ONLY GOOD 5 ONES WHICH ARE ROCK WIT U (AWWW BABY) RAIN ON ME I DON'T MIND BREAKUP TO MAKEUP I FOUND LOVIN THE REST OF THE CD IS HORRIBLE I WAS REALLY DISSAPOINTED WHEN I GOT THIS ALBUM CAUSE I LOVED HER DEBUT ALBUM SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT CD GET THAT CD.

I thought the overall CD would be at the least decent, since her first CD wasn't bad. The only song that is worth listening to on this CD is her radio song 'Rock Wit U (Awww Baby)'. My opinion: she has too many skits;... her vocals and beats aren't the best; no songs really jump out at you. Sorry, Ashanti, I think you're highly over-rated on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"Ashanti 2nd album lacks substance, with very few noteworthy songs from the so called princess of hip hop and rnb. i feel like ashanti maximised her talent on her 1st Lp, her latest offering does not compare favourably too other female star releases like beyonce, monica and mya.The problem with ashanti is she does not have a striking voice and this puts more pressure on her song writing skills, that are sadly lacking on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm, not so good!","review":"To tell you the truth Ashanti's new album isn't all that. I did not expect it to be like this. I would not recommend it at all, who ever wants to enjoy her music should download it online.On the other hand, Beyonce's \\"Crazy in love\\" & Mya's \\"Moodring\\" is amazing. Mya's new album to be out on July 22, is the best. The songs in it are woooo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chapter II hmm not very exciting","review":"I expected it to be better, but to my surprise it was just bad. The songs just are boring and seem all alike execpt Rock wit u which is probably the highlight of the album, but even that song isn't that impresive. She could've done a better job at this or maybe her producers should've. Her first album being a better effort while this one isn't really worth the money. Ashanti could've also done a better job in her vocals also. In her first album they were better, but i still think she needs to choose what style of music she can sing better with cause the way she is going just ain't cuttin it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could have been better","review":"Chapter II isn't as good as ashanti's first cd, but it makes the cut. Chapter II features more of ashanti's solo side, without all of the duets with ja rule.While most of the songs are slow, there are about 3 dance-able songs. I was disappointed with her vocals on some of the songs, but overall I think this album is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with her this time around.","review":"Now dont get me wrong I love Ashanti. Her whole style and everthing but this time around the CD wasn't hot. She only has like three good songs on it. And I wouldn't spend 15 dollars for 3 good songs. Her first CD was wayyyyy better.

Thanks to all the hype and fan that have gone tone deaf, she is selling millions without knowing how to sing. I tried to force myself to like this CD since I spent money for it, but I couldn't help but skippig every song. I felt I was getting dumb just by listening to the lyrics. Ashanti proved that she can not improve vocally and that her song writing is as bad as her singing. To those who are thinking about buying this CD, hold your thought, and go get Blu Cantrell CD \\"Bitter Sweet\\". You will listen to someone who deserves all the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE HER!!","review":"They are practically giving away record deals because she can't sing or dance.

I probably have severe hearing problems thanks to Ashanti's horrible writting skills. She is a nice person, but this CD is garbage.

One of the most annoying voices in music, decides to release a second CD. Sooner or later people are going to realize that her songs are only rehashed versions of the same subject. She is a talentless artist who is listened to by tricks. In her songs she questions why she gets played on by guys. Who could blame them when she is such a stuck up b*&%h. She thinks she is higher than everybody when all she is, is a cross-eyed slut. Ashanti should realize that adding her own version of old songs to her CD are just pathetic attempts of structuring her image. Instead of wasting her time filling our eardrums with horrific sounding vocals and her ugly face and body giving us eyesores, she should work on fixing her screwed up eyeballs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It!!!!!","review":"All I can say is garbage. This CD is only taking up a slot in my cd holder. I've tried to listen to this cd several times and I've come to the conclusion that this is just Garbage.

She is another britney spears. A wannabe, someone who cant think for themselves. Aaliyah was real, aaliyah was her, aaliyah was awesome and wil always be, from day one. The gurl could move, ashanti, dont dance! You make urself look fatter then usuall. The dancing should be left to Aaliyah, the singing to tamia, cause tamia sings alot better too, Ashanti Killed So Into You Tamia or even Aaliyah would have or tamia did a good as job. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE NIGHTMARE CONTINUES.....","review":"After I listened and did'nt like what I heard in Concrete Rose.I thought Ashanti would at least exceed my expectations with this album,unfortunately I was proved wrong(again!).The lead single,\\"Rock Wit' U\\" is a nice song,but I got annoyed by the way she moans every two seconds of the song.The second single,\\"Rain on Me\\" is without a doubt, a beautiful song,with solid,well-thought lyrics-something which lacks on this album.\\"Break up 2 Make Up\\" has a good beat,but the lyrics are a different story altogether.Otherwise it just goes downhill from there.She still applies the same old formula:terrible skits and mundane songs.Ashanti has a great voice,but as I wrote before,she wastes it on crappy material,I sometimes wish there was a law protecting music-lovers from bad albums ,such as this one.Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Princess of R&B???????? Please she wishes!","review":"I liked Ashanti when she first came out but her second album stinks. Mainly because she CAN'T sing. I saw her in concert when she was touring with R.Kelly and it was pathetic. I don't know how she could get a record deal. No wonder she didn't want to tour with Mariah. Don't waste your money on this CD. Get Monica's \\"After the Storm\\" or Mariah's \\"Charmbracelet\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starting to become someone I love to hate","review":"Ashanti, needs samples and guests to try to be the bomb.

Well she's not a rapper and happends to be a pretty bad R&B singer too."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissappointment","review":"It wasn't until Rain on Me came out that I decided to get the CD dispite the poor reviews. I can honestly there is 3 or 4 songs I like on the CD including the ones that were released. Her first CD was so much better then this one. I feel that there is too much praise on the CD talking about Ashanti all that. It made it seem like she was really not humble about her success by having all this, I'm the ish on her CD from other people. It was retarded. She is okay singer. I liked her more for her writing, but I don't know about that anymore. I like Rock wit you for a minute until I noticed the repeating of the chorus constantly, it was a lack of lyrics.

The animated characters are not really animated, but rather an arm or mouth moving on occasion on a stationary cardboard like figure.An elementary school project would produce a better viewing experience.The history included is fascinating, and enlightening and the audio is very good. Mike and his adorable daughters did a nice job in trying to bring history to life. Too bad this was marketed as a DVD which in and of itself is a very poor product.The content gets lost in the annoying presentation. I would recommend this for the content, but it is not a video worth buying. It should be sold as an audio disc and priced accordingly and then I would have given it 4 or 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor production","review":"Anything which promotes understanding of American exceptionalism (and our Constitution plays a huge part in making us exceptional) is to be encouraged and supported.Mr. Church is to be commended for his effort here.But the presentation is unwatchable and at times absurd. Ken Burns this is not. Static cartoon characters are used to represent the Founding Fathers; only their mouths move, sporadically and puppet-like. And so it goes. The ideas are profound, the execution is dismal.Mr. Church is an exceptionally likable and intelligent man in his role as narrator, and his daughters are wonderful, kids anyone would be proud to call their own.For the ideas and history alone, the $36 dollars would be well spent if it were possible to get through the presentation. It was not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent Content","review":"Bought for my hubby for Christmas.

Even though it's a crude cartoon depiction, it's still great for helping people, young and old in understanding the history of the Constitution.

The first way is you can take off the top level, set it next to the stack and start turning the pile. The second way is you do not have to reach into a tall compost bin to grab stuff during the turn. As you turn the pile, not only does the pile get shorter, so do the sides of the bin. Brilliant!Why do I own more than one of these? easy, It allows me to make a stack of 4 if I want, and as the compost happens, and the pile shrinks, I can remove the extra level and start a new pile.

The music is well arranged and goes well together with the lush Portuguese vocals from Simone.The only disadvantage is the depth of her voice. Although less shallow than Astrud Gilberto or Tanita Tikaram the album could do with a bit more passion and soul to get the extra star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tibits and tips","review":"I use the ideas in this book in my HS creative writing classes.

It is about as artless and ingenuous as they come. If ever Amazon would provide less than a 1 star rating, it should be specifically for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the best?","review":"One thing is for sure, we have our choice of collections, including the \\"Greatest Hits\\", \\"Best Of\\", \\"Downtown Train\\", \\"Very Best\\", \\"Very Best 2\\", etc. You get the point. Of them all, this is arguably the best of the best. It covers his entire career anyway. But with someone like \\"Rod Stewart\\" who's been around for decades, it's hard to narrow it down to 16 tracks. Plus his style has changed in that time, from his classic songs, to his disco flavored and 80's tunes, to his recent mellower work. So, obviously this is missing even more than it includes. But there's no doubt that what's on this cd is great. This has his huge hits like \\"Maggie May\\", \\"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?\\", and \\"Forever Young\\", as well as my favorites \\"Young Turks\\", \\"Reason To Believe\\", and \\"Some Guys Have All The Luck\\", among others. If you find that you're missing alot of songs, they're probably on \\"Encore: Very Best Of 2\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rod still rules!","review":"Great CD for Rod Stewart fans!

Although coming from a different cultural and language background, I found Rod's songs are romantic, inspiring and all his songs are bearing his unique voice. I bought both \\"It had to be you\\" and \\"The very best of Rod Stewart\\", however I listen to the later one very often as it collects many top hits of Rod Stewart.Not only do I listen to Rod's song, but also I am deeply impressed by his continuous hardworking to refine his artistic styles while he is about to be 60 years old. I feel that I am greatly encouraged by him whenever I have a difficult time.Rod, just like his song says, is forever young!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection","review":"Everything you like from Rod Stewart and nothing you don't.

However, as an owner of almost every Rod album ever produced, I can say that not all of his greatest and best songs are included in this CD. He is a true artist and without his voice I wouldn't have a favorite singer. I love Rod's work even when the critics don't. I just wish they would stop making the best of albums with all the same old songs. Rod has so many to choose from that you could make compilation after compilation and still never have all of the best of Rod. Keep making those CD's. Two very good cd's that have gotten little or no play are Every Beat Of My Heart and Spanner in the Works. Both excellent Rod work."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great rod stewart collection","review":"rod stewart was among my best rockers along with clapton,frampton,beck and neil young.most of his good songs like downtrain are included here.this is recommended for people who want his big hits on one disc.please get this brilliant album and rock!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remastered and sounding great.....but only \\"One Disc?\\"","review":"Simply because it spans his entire 30 years and it is digitally remastered, alone brings it up to a 4 out of 5. I love the clear sound of each song. I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves Rod or wants to hear his best hits. If you want all his hits though I recommend the Import version titled \\"The Very Best Of- The Story So Far\\" which is a two disc set including 14 of the sixteen songs featured on U.S. version plus 20 extra. It is available at all major music sites for only $9 more."},{"rating":"2","title":"best of--but FORGETS his best song","review":"This \\"best of\\" is done with class as well as \\"ENCORE-BEST OF 2\\". So I'm shocked that ROD's greatest song is left off of both HIT'S CD'S. The song is \\" STAY WITH ME\\", one of his best classic songs. My suggestion would be to REMASTER this hits and add \\"STAY WITH ME\\" as a bonus that is deserved to be on this close to perfect CD ( Along with ENCORE ). There is plenty of extra space for this famous and classic song.It's just not right to have a \\"ROD'S\\" hit's album without this song---\\"just plain painfull\\". Do it Right ROD, and your fans will STAY WITH YOU."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is no coincidence that Rod rhymes with God...","review":"Rod is one of those rare artists that are able to transcend genres, decades, logic and reason. I mean really, a nasty looking Scottish guy with a horrible raspy voice shouldn't be atop the musical world for 30 years, right? WRONG. Rod is awesome; and if anyone ever tells you differently punch them in the face repeatedly until they come around and admit that Rod is the greatest recording artist that this world will ever see. If you don't own this CD and all his other ones you should kill yourself now because most of your life has been wasted in a gloomy Rod-less wasteland."},{"rating":"1","title":"rod stewart","review":"very disapointing!

If you are a lumberjack you'll swear you've worked with these guys, or you have worked with someone just like them. If you are not familiar with logging, this is a great introduction.

There is no liquid inside with the die or anything it just spits out phrases when you push a button - sometimes anyway. It is nothing like the original magic eight ball. It says it has eleven phrases but it only repeats four of them over and over again, and considering Family Guy has some of the greatest catch phrases, they picked really dumb ones. Peter has one or two, Chris has one, and the rest are all Stewie. There are no Brian quotes which I thought was disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for first time visitor or repeat visitors","review":"I just came back from Cancun, and travelled with this map and their Cancun-Tulum Corridor map.

If you're a fan of the French language and the American pop scene, this album is for you.The Singles:\\"Je Serai\\" has a wonderful dance feel to the music, reminiscent of Britney Spears or N*Sync.\\"Toute Seule\\" is my favorite on the album and has a similar feel to \\"Je Serai\\", but is more emotional and less bombastic.\\"Pres de Moi\\" is softer than the other two, but has perhaps even more feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lorie is great","review":"This was my second CD of Lorie's and it is not as good as the other albums but I liked it a lot. Lorie is very talented, she does not sing the style of Egyptions but her work deserves 4 stars. If you want to hear the most catchiest songs of Lorie's go to Rester La Meme. That is her finest work. I was surprised when I first heard it. She has mixed her Hilary Duff American style with a tiny bit of boy rap. She added catchy, good, faster beats to her songs making them great songs to listen to. But the only downer is that she cut her hair in an ugly way and dyed it brown.If you are looking for the best beats songs this is not the greatest CD. If you are into Hilary Duff style this is the CD for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pr��s de Nous!","review":"This album is really really good!!! I am not able to understand 100% of the lyrics, but they are catchy and the songs have such a fun pop beat that you can't help but dance and enjoy them! The 20-second intro is a bit odd, but you don't care about that. One of the best tracks is \\"Pr��s de Moi\\", which is lyrically good and is memorable. Hit summer songs that can stay with you for a long time are \\"Toute Seule\\",\\"Je Manque de Toi\\", \\"Je Serai\\", \\"Entre Vous Deux\\", and the love infused and lyrically poignant \\"I love you\\" and \\"Se Donner la Main\\" are nice.

Cocky was a major player in importing ecstasy, cocaine, marijuana and heroin into England through his Liverpool base and on England terms he was a John Gotti type figure. He rose from a football hooligan tough to the preeminent drug dealer of the UK. This book is totally from the law enforcement angle though and needs more insight from the criminals themselves to ever out the depiction but still it is a good look and interesting read if you are into true crime reads. Hopefully they will make some documentaries on Cocky or do some articles in Maxim or something so those of us stateside can learn more about this intriguing and fascinating drug lord from the UK."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book for children","review":"My children loved this book, and my grandchildren love it.Its full of inspiration and insightful healings that all ages can appreciate andlearn from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did the job","review":"I have a Lyle 5-piece kit which I couldn't get to workon the transmission cooler line on 97 Ford Taurus.

Like other PTR products, which I find the best on the over-the-counter market, it is effective, but also runs the risks of drying. Use weekly, or as a spot treatment like the review above suggests.And in a pinch: if you have to pop a painful whitehead (not recommended, but occasionally unavoidable), apply a large dollop directly after and the clay will effectively and quickly drain it, taking away pain, redness and bumpiness the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far its Good","review":"This masque doesn't get hard and flaky.

It is well written, and conversational - avoiding a lot of minutia about the technical details. I would recommend it for anyone interested in the history of technology in general, as well as for the computer enthusiaist.The author offers some insights and analysis regarding the significance of the efforts, and several of the systems described proved to be dead-ends. I found the English, Australian, and Russian computer chapters to be particularly interesting as they are less well known, and the stories reflect the unique cultures of those countries. The discussion of the British / Australian hydraulic analog computer for understanding economics is a great story of a little known backwater from the early days of computing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a rocker, and I don't mean chair.","review":"This guy is about as under-rated as they come.

When the World was Small is my favorite on this body of work and the piece that led me to purchase this CD. Ian Hunter has always had a way of capturing your mind, forcing you to think about what he is saying and leading the way in music long before the style becomes main-stream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ian Hunter returns to form!","review":"From the opening, 'Big Mouth' (with it's clever spoken Hunter intro) throughout, this is the best Ian Hunter solo album since \\"You're Never Alone...\\" and ranks with this and possibly some of his Mott recordings! Hunter, while in even raspier voice than the past, has all of his lyrical bite and humour displayed in the best of his Mott period. He (unlike Jagger & Co.) has in fact copped to his age and writes songs about where he is now in live with great wit and playfulness. The band is just great, with a rocking mix. I approached this cyncially, but definitely his best release of new songs in over 20 years. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Really Solid Ian Hunter Album","review":"I've been an Ian Hunter fan since his days as the front man of Mott The Hoople.This is one of the best albums Ian Hunter has released since his debut solo album in 1975. Great music, great lyrics, ranging from commentary on 9/11 (Soul Of America), to aging (I Am What I Hated When I Was Young), to regret at having said the wrong things (Words).This is an excellent album by a real pro whose music is often overlooked these days.
