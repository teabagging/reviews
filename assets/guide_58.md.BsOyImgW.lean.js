When I listened to the entire CD I realized how wrong I was. I like a majority of all the songs on here. It is a CD that you can listen to at anytime and still love it. The more I listened to it, the more I noticed that I liked the CD even more. If you like just one song on the CD, you will love the rest. It has become my favorite CD and that has a song for any kind of mood you are in."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm diggin' this...","review":"So refreshing! I'm pleasantly surprised to find a CD full of original sounds and songs. For a minute there I was getting tired of listening to the same tunes over and over on the radio...after a while they kind of all blend together. But not this! The lead singer's voice perfectly fits the music. I find myself driving and boppin' my head uncontrollably without realizing it, lol. This CD also reminds me of music that was created 30 years ago; I can hear those influences. I'm very pleased with this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rock Album - Must Buy!!","review":"There are very few bands like Jet, it isn't your pretty boy manufactured band that we are used to seeing debut. Every song is catchy and you can hear the Beetles and AC/DC influence. It's good to hear that back to basic - kick ass - high energy great music again. You don't realize what you've missed until you hear Get Born. It is a must buy, must hear album. An instant fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't you see it?","review":"Jet may be a copy of the White Stripes and have major influences from AC/DC, but does no one else see that they are almost identical to the early Beatles?

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"CahcahPooPoo","review":"This CD will get old real fast. I do not recommend buying it for the following five reasons: 1.It's unoriginal. 2.The songs are lame. 3.It sounds like AC/DC filler. 4.It's cheese 5.It's boring. I will say that the singer has a strong set of pipes and that the singles are pretty catchy. But the ballads are real cheese and the lyrics are good to poke fun at.

The media displays only 3 files on the \\"enhanced\\" CD. These files are an autorun.inf, a B.S. flash menu, and a playCD.exe. PlayCD.exe is most likely launched when clicking play cd in the flash menu, however playCD.exe doesn't run when launched through the menu or by executing it directly off the CD.It would be more aptly named \\"wontplayCD.exe\\".

I didn't listen to it for a while because it has anti-copy on it and I couldn't put it on my mini-disc. So my father took off with it and he thought it was great, so I stole it back and decided I should listen to it properly.I prefer the slower songs on this album. Whether they're better or not I couldn't tell you, I'm only giving my opinion.My favourite songs would be:- \\"move on\\"- \\"lazy gun\\"- \\"timothy\\"- \\"cold hard bitch\\"- \\"Sgt. Major\\" (this must be a bonus track or something, but it's my favourite)I know this album sounds a lot like bands from the 70s and 80s, but compared to other things that get played on the radio they're pretty good.And they don't sound much like the Beatles to me, so I don't know where that came from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy 3 songs on iTunes and save the money","review":"I am a rock fan, and especailly of the current array of bluesy bands, which Jet appears to draw much of its inspiration from. Listening to the band's recent crop of hits, it appeared the album will be a winner. Sadly, it is not.Instead of taking it further with songs like 'Rollover DJ' and 'Are you gonna be my girl', the band descends into a seemingly endless emotional string of songs that make you want to harm the CD player at worst, or just click the 'Next' button at best.This album is a great example of why people want to buy music on a song by song basis; why waste money on the 10 mediocre songs when only 3 are good. Save the money, forget about the CD..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album of the year","review":"After seeing these guys live I am further convinced that this is one of the best albums I have ever heard. It has it all, from all out rock tracks to slow ballads that blow you away. Everyone owes it to themselves to pick up this disc. You will swear you are listening to the Beatles when you hear 'Look What you've done'. Stop reading and go get this album now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...I had no idea....","review":"...That there was now such a generic, packaged formula for \\"retro-rock\\". First time I heard the cd my ears perked up \\"wow, sounds good\\" I thought. Second time I heard it, I was like...hmmm...what exactly is it about this music that sounds..empty...vacuous...cheesy...inane...insipid. By the third time I had heard it, it was clear that this band was a front, and that there was a corporate shadow in the background. Jet is contrived and prepackaged. Still has a few nice hooks, a couple nice lyrical phrase turns. It's better than a lot of the other schlock out there I guess, but if you want authenticity and soul, don't go with Jet. Try something, anything, by the Brian Jonestown Massacre, the best band in the world that nobody has ever heard of, or the Warlocks, or BRMC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Born","review":"Alright, so Jet isn't the most original band ever sure they sound a hell of a lot like Oasis, The Stones, Stereophonics, The Beatles, and AC/DC. But why change a formula that has worked well for ages, even if originality isn't their strong point Jet's Get Born is still a fun cd to listen too. Let's keep in mind this is only the groups first cd i'd keep my eyes peeled for these guys chances are they'll develop a more original sound on their next album and blow everyone away, jet definetly have the potential to be rockstars."},{"rating":"2","title":"heaven on a disc","review":"this album is one of the best albums i have heard in a long time it has the songs you can dance about and sing along to songs to relax to songs to drift away with you can listen to it when ever and what ever mood you are in and you will still love it.

I bought Get Born and absolutely love it. The band reminds me so much of the Beatles yet they bring a more modern sound to rock and roll. My favorite songs on the album include Are You Gonna Be My Girl, Rollover DJ, and Look What You've Done. I strongly recommend this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really thought I'd like this one","review":"I heard \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\", and I love garage rock. So I picked this one up expecting more of the same. Unfortunately, that song was the high point. I listened to this album several times through going to and from work for a few days.

I'm so dissappointed that Amazon does not have a 'zero' star option for vapid crap like this.From the start to finish the album reeks of poor musicianship, lack of creativity, and a blatant disrespect of rock music and listeners alike.Perhaps most heinous are the undeserving comparisons to AC/DC... Not for a second was I under the chronically mistaken impression that I was listening to anything more than a regurgitated, rank, sorry excuse for music. As a musician, I am offended by the release of this record.Why listen to this shamelessly pretentious, spurious, unconvincing noise when the real thing is so much better. If you want some rock music, buy some music from AC/DC, The Darkness, The Music, Guns N Roses, or Led Zeppelin, and leave the flithy sin that is Jet to MTV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poo!","review":"It's unfortunate that so many people would write decent reviews about this ablum.

Then the song \\"Timothy\\" starts out with him again trying to sing a slow ballad which his voice is NOT made to do, and as it cracks while he moans Timothy like a depressed gay lover I almost puked up my lunch. Thank god I was close to the \\"next track\\" button or I probably would have commenced the up-chucking.

And listening to the rest of the CD ( I didn't buy it, I was roped into hearing it by same said friend) reminds me why so many people are still downloading music illegally.

When I opened the package, the spine of the cardboard was sort of ripped and when I took one of the cases out a whole entire corner was broken off of the case.

And if it was a true story, i really dont see how soloman could still be alive after everything that happened to him. I just dont think its possible for one teenager to betray so many people and get away with it.

Yes, the message of courage is great and the idea behind the story is good but it's not realistic and there are many unnecessary parts in it. The nude parts had nothing to do with the movie's plot. It just looked as if he was saying \\"hey look at my body isn't it great?\\" Yes, the story's important but it just seemed as if this kid lived his life completely off of luck, and that's not realistic. I watched this movie in history class and I hope to never see it again. The movie would have been good if some of those parts were excluded. Instead of enjoying the movie, I would turn my head everytime a bath would come up (and there were plenty of those). Don't get me wrong, the story was good but some things were definately dramatized and made up.

That shows was their ideology was made up and didn't make any sense. I also felt that the movie really showed what living in Germany was like, how they were raised, and how they felt about the Jewish people.

I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of use, ease of clean up and the quality of the apples produced. It peels, cores and slices apples in just a few seconds. All you have to do is slice the whole cored and peeled apple down the middle and use it in pies, salads, and my favorite, apple s'mores (just take a graham cracker, put a marshmallow on top, bake it for a few minutes till the marshmallow gets soft, put a slice of apple on top, then top it all with yummy caramel sauce. Yum.) I now plan on buying a load of apples for canning and drying. I very much recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"the masher","review":"this was the worst waste of money i have ever seen. not only did it not form a vacuum with my counter top, but it mangled the apples, did not keep contact with the apple's skin and only periodically did a peeling job. don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"a tasty, clean meal without laundry time","review":"The chain bib holders are great; work well as starters for the meal, once attached kids are ready to eat and finish a meal with clean shirts; mom likes them too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruben Vela CD","review":"I love this CD.

I have been listening to music and an amateur guitarist for years and I think Everclear with it's original members is one of the top Ten bands of all time but Welcome to the Drama Club is horrible. It' like it came from a machine. Alexakis is a awesome artist, phenomenal lyricist and a great punk style player but this release is one for the contract obligations. I hope Alexakis has some more left but the chemistry of the past needs to be addressed. I wish the original members the best of luck because they were truly a one in a lifetime occurrence. Buy everyone of their CDs that are before 2003.They are well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Everclear Recording","review":"This is a consistently fine album. This album must have bern under promoted. If you like Everclear, I can't see how you wouln't enjoy this one 'cover to cover'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Band They Used To Be","review":"I've been a diehard Everclear fan since the early 90s. Ever since Craig Montoya and Greg Eukland left the band, however, Everclear has just not been the same. A once hard rocking alternative band, Everclear has gradually shifted to mainstream pop music with each new album released. That said, I was really rooting for \\"Welcome to the Drama Club.\\" I really want to love every Everclear album and I can't help but feel compelled to purchase them with the hopes that Art and the \\"band\\" won't let me down. As I listened to this latest album, I felt instant dejavu. Long time fans will quickly recognize that most of the songs contain recycled lyrics and chords from earlier, more successful albums. \\"Glorious\\" is the only song on the album I can stand to listen to. Go to itunes and download it for 99 cents. Don't waste your money on this album. If you want a real rockin' Everclear album, I strongly suggest \\"World of Noise\\", \\"Sparkle and Fade\\", or \\"So Much for the Afterglow\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster Effort","review":"Following the renewed and applaudable effort of Slow Motion Daydream, Welcome to the Drama Club leaves a bad taste in my mouth. The song writing is weak, though the music is fairly good. It seems that Alexakis is trying to hard to recapture the hard edged feel of early albums, but without the emotion to back it up.Many of the songs will remind you of So Much for the Afterglow and the first volume of Songs from an American Movie, but empty shells of those efforts.However, there are some gems on this album, such as Portland Rain, Under the Western Stars, Your Arizona Room, and the amazing song Glorious.You're better downloading the mp3's of the highlights rather than purchasing the whole album.Ranking this, it would be behind Slow Motion Daydream but light years ahead of the Everclear's weakest and most lyrically disappointing album, Songs from an American Movie Volume Two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really Everclear anymore?","review":"Is this really Everclear anymore? I mean the only person left is Art. Plus there are five memebers now instead of three. WTF? The single is okay, the lyrics suck though. The music is typical Everclear.

But, there is more to Jujitsu than technique. A book like this can actually be very dangerous in the wrong hands.

Maybe just avantegarde performance art. I saw a poster hanging at an independent record store here in Chicago and that's how I first noticed them. Everyone was body painted blue and had long black hair. It frightened me at first but nevertheless I was interested. I'm surprised Karen Black allowed them to use her name. I ordered from the record store a video copy of one their performances in New York City for Halloween and by the way they got Karen Black to host the gig but the video never came in. Remember this was in the late 90's before everyone's conversion to dvd. What happened to this band? Does anyone know?

The box that my game came in was damaged, so that might be the cause, but the game did not work properly. We couldn't get past the first round. The screen kept going back to the menu, not of the game but the dvd player. Then the game would start from the beginning with the same catagories and questions. We tried it in more than one player with no luck. I'm returning it in hopes that if we get another, it will work correctly and I can write a new review.

I'd heard that Matthau wanted to play Felix first, saying that he could've \\"phoned in\\" his performance of Oscar. But, this was perfect casting. A line that still is one of the best is when Oscar goes through his littany of things that irritate him about Felix. He tells him to stop the little notes he leaves on his pillow. \\"We are all out of toilet paper. F.U. It took me three hours to figure out that F.U. meant Felix Unger!\\" You gotta own this one. It's a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like it. Remembered it being much better in its time.","review":"I bought this more from nastalgia reasons. The acting was good and you will get some enjoyment from this if you are a Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau fan. However, the pace is really quite slow and there are just a couple of memorable scenes. I would not recommend this one if you are looking for an exciting movie. If you like both actors, I would strongly recommend Grumpy Old Men and Grupier Old Men. Both are classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny, not believable","review":"This adaptation of the play hasn't worn at all well over the years. The movie was directed and filmed much as if it were still on stage, using the peculiar and somewhat stilted projection-style of acting that is deemed necessary in most stage productions. Neither Matthau nor Lemmon or any of the supporting cast are especially believable. The scenes are overdone and not funny. The characters all come across as actors playing a part and never cross the line into people we care about. Lemon's character is so overdone that he is the least believable of the group. It's difficult to understand why this film gets such praise in 2010."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok if you like Neil Simon","review":"The Odd Couple is much like most Neil Simon\\"comedies\\" - 1st act of humorous setups, 2nd act of conflict(and in TOC the conflict is pretty mean-spirited), 3rd act everyone kisses & makes up. I guess this paved the way for 80's & 90's TV sitcoms where all the humor is \\"dissing\\" the nerd or geek (actually unlike the TOC series). Matthau's Oscar comes off as a scummy, loud drunk with repugnance for all, most of all Felix - if you see the humor in that go ahead & buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all time classic","review":"It's nearly 40 years old but it never dates.

Felix and Oscar are two divorced men who now must try to live with one another in the same apartment, but can two friends who are complete opposites live peacefully with each other?

Other reviews go into detail, and you probably already know of this movie anyway.I'd like to describe the DVD media itself (produced in 2001).First, it is \\"wide screen\\" but letterboxed, NOT anamorphic format! This means that it loses 25% of the available resolution when watched on a wide-screen TV.Worse, the film is grainy and blurry in places. It even has some jerks and missing frames.Finally, there is no commentary or interesting bonus material.In short, they did a dis-service to a great film.

This film set the standard for a funnier, ditzier Clouseau, not entirely seen in the original or in \\"A Shot in the Dark\\". It definitely has a few slow spots, but in my opinion, only \\"Revenge\\" and \\"Strikes Again\\" are funnier. Although every film in the series, besides \\"A Shot in the Dark\\", uses the panther name in the title, this is only one of two films that even mention the Pink Panther. I found out that \\"Strikes Again\\" was originally scripted as another theft of the diamond, but was rewritten so the film would focus on Dreyfuss' insanity........."},{"rating":"2","title":"DA DUM DA DUM, DA DUM, DA DUM DA DUM DA DUM...","review":"Has there ever been a more catchy theme than Mancini's \\"Pink Panther?\\" I can't think of any off hand, and in this third entry in the Clouseau series, the music and the animated panther are back in fine form.Mainly a vehicle for the superb Peter Sellers, this sequel is tired in plot, and struggles for some of its laughs, but one cannot deny the superlative hijinks of Sellers as the impossibly inept Inspector Clouseau. He has so many brilliant moments, it's hard to think of them all, but Sellers is in top form. Christopher Plummer and Catherine Schell do okay, but Herbert Lom and Burt Kwouk as Dreyfuss and Kato are outstanding in their supporting roles. Lom's slow decline into mental illness is hilarious in its cartoonish way, and Kato's fights with Sellers are priceless.It's an entertaining if inconsequential movie, but I had lots of fun watching it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, it did not meet with our expectations","review":"The disc was ruined and would not play.....was not able at the time to request money back.

Olstead has the POTENTIAL for a great voice with training and time but instead she learned some quick technical tricks from her mentor and tried to sell it. If you aren't trained musically she pulls it off but I cannot see any serious musician actually liking her cobbled together singing.

I only pray she has a good manager and the wherewithal to stick with it because she has the ability to mature into a truly great vocalist.

That's just a matter of personal taste but I would love to see her make an album accompanied by just a guitar, a la Tuck & Patti.

But as wrought, Dig Infinity is an absurdly long, poorly edited work. Oliver gets all kinds of facts wrong and is egregious when it comes to people's names (Preston STURGIS? CINDY Miller for Donald O'Connor's sidekick instead of SIDNEY Miller? And that's just two). What a shame that such a great subject and such obviously hard work have actually done the impossible...made Lord Buckley boring.

Not only does she include recipes, she also includes the essential oil reference guide, which is my favorite part, because she gives you a breakdown of not only the origin name, but what the physical and the psycho-emotional benefits are to the essential oils. She also gives you a headstart on how to make your own formulas, by including a blending chart. Please pick up this book, if not any other book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooksley's book is a useful & practical aromatherapy guide","review":"I am a certified massage therapist interested in integrating aromatherapy into my practice. I found this text to be straight-forward with a good grounding in history, cautions about essential oils, references (very important!) and listings of additional sources to pursue.I always have trouble finding factual, practical information on such \\"soft arts\\" as massage and aromatherapy which do not include \\"new age\\" aspects that a practitioner of health arts usually is not interested in, at least to obtain a starting basic knowledge.I would recommend Cooksley's aromatherapy to anyone interested in the basics of aromatherapy and its many applications. Cooksley's explanations are clear, her recipes are good, she has a variety of ways to use essential oils. Most of all, her background in nursing and health arts is reassuring to me that her information comes from a grounding in SAFE essential oil use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"I didn't know anything about essential oils before I purchased this book. Aromatherapy is easy to read and understand. The instructions are clear and specific, and there is so much information. It gave me a clear understanding of how to use essential oils, and a desire to use them in so many different ways. It was exactly what I was looking for: a clear and precise understanding of essential oils, something I could easily refer to, as it's organized so wonderfully, and has so many, many ideas as how to use essential oils. I feel like I have an essential oils \\"nurse\\" in the home every time I open this book.This is a great Essential Oils for dummies and experts.

The plot is completely implausible, senseless, and trivial.Also, this book has been categorized as science fiction. It most definitely is not science fiction. There is no science in the book other than the profession of the physicists.As a side note, there were a few sloppy editing mistakes that got through to print. A few words were mispelled and there were a few sentences that did not make a bit of sense.Be warned. Stay away. There are much better books out there. This one is a waste of time. For instance, try the Time Traveler's Wife. The Time Traveler's Wife has similar goals as Oh Pure and Radiant Heart, but it actually pulls off what it set out to accomplish."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dislike being a downer, but","review":"I didn't even finish this. And before you discount my review entirely, it's worth acknowledging that I was more than halfway through it at the time I gave up. Around page 270 the main plot was just being introduced, for starters. The constant back and forth of Hiroshima/Nagasaki and present day was very distracting, and the way dialog was set up was very confusing at times. It just dragged, and I couldn't make myself push through to the end, especially when it took so long to get as far as I did. I was disappointed, in both the book and myself. I don't like not finishing books, but I had to cut it loose."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a concept","review":"the premise of this book is HUGE. who wouldn't want to return to the future and atone for the consequences of their decisions. Ms Millett presents us with the the inventors of the atomic bomb returning to see the legacy of the Manhattan project. The characterizations are faithful to the personalities of the scientists and their interactions with the disparate personalities and politics of the late 20th century are at times comic and tragic. I recommend this book highly and perhaps our current politicians could take note and consider their legacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!!","review":"I purchased this book for my husband who read it and said it is one of the best books he has ever read. The story of these brave men who endured unspeakable horrors as prisoners of war and their living their Christian faith is remarkable.

As with many \\"based on a true story\\" movies, I was curious how much was fabricated and how much was true.This book is absolutely amazing. It is far better than the movie. The movie focused on the brutality with an undercurrent theme of forgiveness. The book does touch on the brutality of the POW camp, but the primary focus of the book is the real life stories of people who learned to care for others instead of themselves in the face of death.Before reading the book I was concerned it would be too long or boring... it is not. It is a very fast read, yet not too short. I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE.....NOT for Cassiopia E100","review":"I just bought this GPs system and it does not work.

Look, Blonde on Blonde is a double album with all the mythos that implies. Highway 61 is a single album. They are both beyond perfect... there are about five Dylan albums which can't be compared with the work of mortals (we all agree about this--the question is which five) and for me, this is one of them. Nevertheless, you get a lot less TIME with this one. This album ought to be $6.99 if Blonde on Blonde is $9.99. Otherwise, I feel like I am being ripped off.I had all the vinyl, all of them, through Knocked out Loaded; I sold all the vinyl (sue me, I live in New York with kids, there's no room for vinyl, and I personally cannot hear the difference) and now, if I am going to buy them all again... Basement Tapes for $9.99, of COURSE, but this one for 40 minutes of music... I can live without it. I even have to live without John Wesley Harding. Hard Rain for $6.99 was a good deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"SACD?","review":"After reading most of the customer reviews for this SACD, I have to ask:Has anybody who DOES own the compatible multi-channel SACD player and amplifier noticed that the music is playing through only the front left & right speakers? I have only a couple of other SACDs and I played them to be sure everything was working correctly. Sure enough, the equipment was correct.Maybe the disc I have is faulty. A friend loaned it to me. He doesn't have SACD compatible equipment but loves Dylan, so bought the new discs just because.Many of the reviews on Amazon state \\"I don't even have a SACD player, but this new release sounds amazing!\\" I just want to ask if anybody else is NOT getting any multi-channel experience on this particular disc.For the record, the songs themselves are essential Dylan. I'm interested in reviews of this disc from those who are qualified to review it in its SACD format."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning album","review":"From the gunshot that kicks off the awesome \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" to the final notes of \\"Desolation Row\\", this is quite simply a magnificent album. In fact its probably the greatest popular music album of all time"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!!!","review":"This is one of the difinitive rock albums. If you can appreciate good music then you will love this album. You cannot find a list of the greatest rock albums without this listed in the top 25. Dylan is the greatest songwriter of the era, and the fact that so many have re-made his songs only pays tribute to his greatness. If you are not intrigued by this album, then you don't know the first thing about music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"With \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\", \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\" and \\"Desolation Row\\", how can this be anything but a classic. Even if you don't like Dylan's voice, the material transcends it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean sound, but...","review":"Yup, it's Dylan alright, sounding better than my 40 year old LP! I bought the SACD version and am impressed with the clarity of sound, but was a bit disappointed in that the SACD layer (also has a regular CD layer) is only 2 channel - NOT multi-channel. But if you have good front speakers, you won't be disappointed in the improved sound quality: the harmonica in\\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" and honky tonk style piano in\\"It Takes a Lot To Laugh, etc.\\" and \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\" are especially noticeably better than on the LP. The SACD version is even clearer and more intense, making me wonder why they didn't put a multi-layer (5.1) on the hybrid CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Each Song a Behemoth on it's own and Each one an Anthem","review":"I'm not going to write a long review , there's no need. This is my favorite album ever , the lyrics are sparse and penetrating , the music is amazing and only complements the lyrics to give them an extra edge. Dylan was one of the best if not best lyricists ever and a Poetic catalyst that changed songs and how they were written forever.Listen to this and really think about what picture he was trying to paint , this album is a mosaic of sound , poetry , and sincerity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic Nuts and Bolts Guy","review":"I have to agree with my colleagues reviews in all respects. The songs on this album (how old am I?) are a \\"sav\\" for pain I went through growing up. How lost I can find myself in Desolation Row. How I am almost drawn to tears when Dylan finally whales the harmonica at the end of that song. In From a Buick 6, I can visualize him riding in that Buick. Was it a 6-up-straight? Or did they make only v-6's in those days? Who cares. But the prose and the rythm are haunting and beautiful all in one.I haven't reviewed Blond-on-blonde in a while..maybe that is next.John - 46"},{"rating":"2","title":"The praise is deserved","review":"Dylans famous album does not fall into the category of classic albums that do not live up to the hype. The album is at the same time delicate and furious. Dylan offers a clear, unabashed collection of folk, blues and rock inspired songs that will make you dance and, more importantly, make you smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest albums of all time","review":"Listening to \\"Desolation Row\\" will make you understand just how amazingly great this album is. That 11 minute song, along with 8 other tracks, make up one of the best albums ever. An outstanding mix of rock and roll and folk, like only Dylan can do, Highway 61 has only good songs. The title track, my personal favorite, shows just how funny Dylan can be. His satirical lyrics are the best around. And with every song on this album, he proves once again he is the best songwriter, possibly of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"61 Revisited.... Ridiculous!","review":"This quite simply is one of the seminal Bob Dylan albums. Starting off with the classic \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" Dylan makes The Beatles look like they're singing nursery rhymes. But that's not even the best track on the album. No, that distinction belongs to the locomotive that is \\"Tombstone Blues.\\" All attitude, Dylan poetically \\"lets it rip\\"and leaves the chips fall where they may. By the way, the awesome guitar work you hear on this album is provided by the often criminally overlooked Michael Bloomfield. A legend in his own right, Bloomfield pushes Dylan over the top to achieve the a level of excellence most artists can't even concieve. Other highlights include the title track, From a Buick 6, and Ballad of a thin man. For those wanting to find out what Dylan is about, 61 Reveisted isn't the whole story, but it's a damn good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desolation Row","review":"From the opening track \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" to the unbelievably deep closer \\"Desolation Row\\", Bob Dylan has crafted what has come to be known as one of his greatest albums, and one of the greatest folk rock albums of all time. Deceptively complex lyrics, full of subtle meaning and imagery will take you down that lonely highway. The first album Dylan did with a full band, the music is engrossing. Dylan's talky vocals are the understating means by which all this is brought to the listener's ear. I find it hard to describe this album, it takes a few spins to really appreciate the depth of it all. Anyways, the highlights on this album for me were \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\", \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\", and \\"Desolation Row\\" but the rest of the tracks are outstanding in their own ways. If you're curious about Dylan, I think this could be considered a great place to start. Just be ready to have your view of the world slightly changed by the time you're done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Im an old Dylan buff","review":"I gave my son an old boom box with tape player and my old lady whale sounds and relaxation tapes. he's in his forties and said to be sure to include some sixties tunes for nostalgia (tho he wasnt born till 70). I didnt have any so went on line to find cheap tapes..I was thinking about what I would give him about the sixties to give him an idea of what it was like...and I thought of Dylan (I also thought of cream, hendrix, taj mahol, ravi shankar, beatles, credence clearwater revival and more. My budget is tiny so I could only pick a few and I decided Dylan was one you never hear about anymore but he was the sixties and no collection would be right without him. So here's to social activism, caring beyond oneselves, the lack of greed or need for power..to Dylan and the 60s."},{"rating":"2","title":"The peak of greatness","review":"While I personally found the songs on \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\" great but a bit jarring in arrangment, this album is the peak of Dylan's most creative period. The rock is ROCK, and the poetry is POETRY. The lyrics are superb and his band is tight, while his performance is good. Sure, Dylan's voice won't soothe the savage beast, but any of his fans will tell you that his performance strength is his vocal emotiveness. This album has all the elements in place, and the new mix brings it all, well.. \\"back home\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Dylan Classic","review":"Dylan already went electric on Bringing It All Back Home, and there was no turning back. On Highway 61 Revisited, Dylan solidified his songwriting, mixed rock and folk very well (whilst BIABH had either rock songs or folk songs), and this is Dylan's arguably most cohesive album, and one of his most influential.Dylan's lyrics, like always, are filled with bizarre imagery bordering on both reality and surrealism. Like on \\"Tombstone Blues,\\" he tells of people going through hard times then adds one of the weirdest lyrics ever (\\"The sun isn't yellow. It's chicken.\\") \\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" and the 11-minute \\"Desolation Row\\" rank as some of his best works, and despite the rather long songs, it flows and resonates, something Dylan has struggled with on past albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"As Pappy and I look out tonight, from Desolation Row\\"","review":"I first heard this album long ago because my Dad (Pappy) was a huge Dylan fan. Probably the biggest Dylan fan in Delaware at the time, which is where we lived. Pappy said this was one of the \\"Big Three\\" by Dylan that you couldn't live without (the other two being \\"Bringing it All Back Home\\" and \\"Blonde and Blonde\\"). But this one was his favorite -- especially the immortal (his words) \\"Desolation Row\\" which contains the line: \\"As lady and I, look out tonight, from Desolation Row.\\" But who is lady? Try though we did, we could never quite figure that one out. Maybe that's why, whenever I hear the song, I always sing along with it but change the lyrics to \\"As Pappy and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.\\" And I invite you to sing along too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY ESSENTIAL","review":"WHILE BOB DYLAN'S Voice isn't My CUP OF TEA HIS WORDS&MUSIC SPEAK VOLUMES.&This Set Reflects His Genius.LIKE A ROLLING STONE FOR INSTANCE You know you are Hearing SOmething Ground-Breaking.His Words Have Made Him One OF The GREATEST POETS EVER.THE MUSIC HERE IS ESSENTIAL AS WELL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Possibly The Best Album Ever Made","review":"This is it. The best record ever. IMO nothing can stand next to it. Its simply the best one out there. The ultra-beautiful ultra-sinister poetry of classics like Ballad Of A Thin Man and Desolation Row are undeniable. But the greats dont stop there, powerful rockers like Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues and the title track are also here, not to mention subtle brilliance like Queen Jane Approximetly and From A Buick 6.

I think he's one of the most important rock artists of all time, but after a few songs, I feel like my eardrums are going to start bleeding. There are exceptions; on his most outstanding tracks, his awful voice actually seems to complement the songs rather than detract from them. Like A Rolling Stone is definitely such a case, and one of the best songs of the century. Desolation Row, as well, while it is arguably a bit overlong, is a gorgeous song that transcends Dylan's warbled mumbling.If you don't own this album, there's a gaping hole in your record collection.

I thought that you'd be able to bend and pull at the molds to release the popsicles, but no matter how much I pull, they still won't come loose. Out of 12 popsicles, I've only managed to get two of them out with the stick still in the middle, and that was only after lots of pulling and tugging at the mold and after running them under hot water for a minute. Even after all that, the stick came out on its own for the rest of them.I think the real problem is that the silicone for the molds is too thick to be very flexible, and the inside of the molds is not as smooth as the outside (and nowhere near as smooth as the silicone muffin cups I have). So, the popsicles end up sticking.I'm sending this off to charity. Maybe someone else can make it work, but I think it's worthless.

Instead, it is a guide to the ethos and pathos that made Francis a saint.From a startlingly clear sighted examination of Francis's youth through to the unvarnished look at his death, this work rings true in the way the many \\"pious accounts\\" do not. And yet, despite staying true to the historical nature of Francis (who once said \\"Don't make a Saint of me too quickly, I am still perfectly capable of fathering a child\\"), the book resounds forcefully with the charism of this special folk hero.St. Francis's simple and unyielding commitment to take the Gospel seriously is a challenge to every Christian. This book makes that challenge clear and unambigious.I have read many biographies and collections of stories about St. Francis. This is one of the few, I think, that might not make the Seraphic Father wince."},{"rating":"2","title":"God's Fool - Great Christian Inspiration","review":"God's Fool brings depth and color to one of the Church's most beloved Saints. Julien Green does so much more than just describe the events of Francis's life. He describes the daily life of his medieval family, friends and neighbors. This, in turn, really helped me feel just how much Francis was sacrificing by abandoning a future of knighthood, nobility and wealth. I could feel the anguish in his mother's heart, the anger of his father's fist and the confusion in his brother's mind. This illustration of one of the most remarkable spiritual journeys since the original apostles, can be contageous. The desire to run to the nearest Franciscan monastery is almost overwhelming, even for a traditional Protestant"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for those new to the saint...","review":"This book was the first that I had ever read about St. Francis - and in that context, it stunk. In the first few pages you repeatedly read \\"Well, since everyone knows about the (whatever) incident, I won't describe it, but it affected Francis like this...\\" This continues throughout the entire volume, and left me wondering why I had bothered to read the book. If you are already well acquainted with St. Francis, this book may interest you, although the author's \\"smarter than thou\\" ego bleeds through the pages. It does have a lot of information which claims to be absent in other works on the saint, but aside from that, I would not recommend the book. If you are looking for an introduction to St. Francis, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"The continuation of a fallacy.","review":"Turkle's book is a good read, but can not be taken as authorative.

Also a lot of vague talk about how \\"people didn't used to like to do\\" such and so a thing with computers but now \\"people like to do\\" such and so something other thing with computers a lot more.

BAD SOFTWARE!","review":"I haven't used TurboTax in years. I own several apartment buildings and things got complicated. This year I thought I'd give it a try, but TurboTax Premier wasn't up to the job. In going through EasyStep, there is no way to enter when particular buildings were purchased! That's right - no way to account for depreciation! Unbelievable. I chatted online with their tech support twice, and they couldn't find a way around it.Someone who wasn't paying attention would lose a lot of money by paying a lot of extra taxes.This is incredibly inept on the part of TurboTax. I will never buy anything from Intuit again.In my opinion, the program sucks.P.S. There is a money-back guarantee, but it ain't easy. You have to chat with them online to get the address, and then return the CD ROM via UPS and pray that you get your money back. In my case, they gyped me on the refund by $26. I am taking action against them.

And I am using one of the fastest computers on the market (Macintosh G5 185 GHz 1 GB DDR SDRAM). It crawls through each calculation. I can use a manual calculator and hand enter the information on the forms faster!!

I don't know that keyboards any larger would fit under the cover.This cover does come in other sizes and that may be where the 48\\" W x 16\\" D description comes from, one of the other versions.

If you're just looking for a comfortable pair of earbuds for a good price, I'd recommend these.The only downfall I found was that the rubber can slip off sort of easily.

I had to test it against my other phones to make sure that nothing was wrong with my audio player, computer, headphone jacks, settings, etc. Even a set of free throwaway earphones had much more bass.I'm definitely not a bass head, but I think a minimum amount of bass is necessary for things to sound balanced. While the mids and highs are clear and crisp with these phones, I really cannot bear to use them for more than 5 minutes. It is tolerable for stuff like language learning audio, but seriously disrespects any form of music.As others have mentioned, the cord shape is also weird and lays uncomfortably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two broke in a row","review":"I really liked the different sized buds this comes with - the regular size of other earbuds is too big for me.

He recorded much Bach perhaps forty years ago (since reissued) and it was worth some attention although quite individualistic and a good bit out of the mainstream. This disc is newer and shows Martins's technique to have diminished considerably. There is, frankly, nothing here that hasn't been recorded better by others. Probably the best thing here is the familiar short Scriabin Nocturne, Op. 9, No. 2. The Saint-Sans études, however, are awkwardly cautious. The Bach/Brahms Chaconne has some expressive depth but has been better done by such pianists as Leon Fleisher.The Ravel D Major Concerto is simply a throw-away. Accompanied by Boris Spassov leading the Bulgarian National Symphony, this performance is really dreadful. The orchestra is bush-league and Martins's playing includes bunches of wrong notes.Avoid this one.Scott Morrison"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What is Pictured","review":"I ordered these and was pretty pissed to receive a double pack of Cool Alert Pull-Ups, which are $10 cheaper than what is pictured here for the same size.

Don't these creative prima donnas know there is a good reason for a comic character being so popular for so long? Ang Lee had entirely no sense of the Hulk. You could tell he probably never even heard of the character until he got this movie deal. For one instance in The Hulk, they have the Hulk being attacked by two gamma irradiated dogs. How hard would it have been to replace the gamma dogs with the Abomination? My advice to Marvel is to let directors who know their characters make their movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should be called The Kangaroo.","review":"The CG Hulk looked absolutely awful, and his habit of \\"jumping\\" around the landscape like a kangaroo seriously degraded the already bad movie. The ending was not clear and the characters were not developed well."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's green, he's mean...but seldom seen","review":"This is a long boring movie. Stan Lee revolutionized comics by adding an emotional and psychological background to the standard superhero story line. But this technique was just a frame to add depth to the main story of adventure, threat and action. This film focuses on the emo/psych part, leaving a piddling amount of screen time to the action part. This genre screams for action, not endless background plot. Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly both appear to be sleepwalking thru their parts. Nick Nolte scares everyone within acting distance by an emotionally drenched method acting demonstration. There is not one scene containing humor, fun, wonderment, adventure, or any kind of thrill whatsoever. This film is a major misfire."},{"rating":"1","title":"the \\"hype\\" not the hulk","review":"It's amazing how much you can be fooled by a films trailers and advertising. What looked like a good picture to watch this summer, turned out to be a major bore. This was an insult to the comic strip THE HULK , a story line that never gives the viewer the action expected, it would have been a relief if the HULK in the movie would have ended up in Hollywood and destroyed the studio and production team, ending by smashing the producer and writer,,instead, it open-ends leaving you to believe that a sequel could be better. better,,better get some sleep instead. very poor movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a remote control with ultra fast forward button","review":"You need a 16-speed DVD-ROM drive to view this move ! It is that boring. What a cheap remake."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is a mess.","review":"This movie is just awful. The bleakness of the story line is only slightly worse than the emptiness and vapidity of the acting. The love story between Banner and his girl-friend (Connelly) lacks any warmth or interest. And what should have been a powerful relationship between Banner and his father ends up ragged, confused, and senseless.For those old enough to have enjoyed either the Stan Lee comics or the TV show, ignore this movie. It is but a poor reflection of a creative and engaging sotry. This weak rendition will leave you empty and disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"It's very sad how Ang Lee made a mess of the 'Hulk' movie. This could have been a great movie: action-packed and funny like Spiderman with great special effects - but no, they had to give it to the director of 'Crouching Tiger - Hidden Dragon'. I figure it is because the hulk jumps around a lot just like the actors in the 'crouching tiger' movie? They should try to fix it by making a movie called 'The REAL Hulk' and give it to a director who knows how to make action movies. The actors are a joke, the dialogue is boring and predictable. The split-screen technology is crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"It seems to me that some people ALWAYAS expect a superhero movie to be all about action (and HULK did have plenty of action in it) and want nothing to do about backstories.

The first time Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) transforms into the Hulkster caused chills to run up my spine, and I got to tell ya', almost took my breath away! Some of the most incredible, smack-down style action scenes I've ever seen!And, it's not just action, this film possesed great acting, masterful directing and a storyline which wasn't bad at all. A great all-around film which even the most discriminate of comic book films would adore.The most unique element of this film is it's cinematic brilliance of split-screens, disolves, wipes, pans, zooms...you name it! Watching this film made me feel like I was actually reading a comic book.

I saw Spiderman and X-Men 2 and other Marvel movies, and those were pretty good, but this one is a discrace to the marvel name, so all of the people that were going to buy this twisted movie, you might want to think twice before you buy, get any other movie by marvel and i assure you that it will be better than the Discracefull \\"Hulk\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"hulk make you sulk","review":"it isn't a good movie by any sense. i pity yall who like it and say it's s good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti Climatic.

I wanted to know much more about Bruce Banner and needed less of the David Banner story.However, the movie is lots of fun with terrific CGI. Lee stayed true to the little nuances of the Hulk (like the fact that he jumps incredibly high) and put in lots of mega-action. Bana as Banner and Elliott as Gen. Ross are fabulous.You won't have a bad time at this movie if you already are a fan of Hulk's; I think you'll like it a great deal more if you know nothing about Hulk at all.Well worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"1","title":"The HULK, ...who let the plot out?!!","review":"After viewing the much anticipated and overly hyped Hulk movie I have to say I was extremely disappointed. Ang Lee's \\"King Lear\\" based version of the story drudged on and on and on -establishing character, background stories, sub-plots and yack yack yack. The Hulk does not actually appear in the first third of the picture. There was so much story that there was almost no creature and therein lies the main problem with the film. Viewers want a large green rampaging monster with a human side tortured by the fear of releasing a monster on humanity. What we got was an intellectually intense complicated story with constant yack yack yack yack yack dialog. Where was the monster? As far as the story it was intelligent, involved and worth watching as a struggle between father and son. But I came for an angry green behemoth pursued by a world that did not understand or want him. In general, there was a lot of plot getting in the way of a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Acting + Strange but Creative Directing =A Great Film!","review":"Alright, everybody who has read a review about The HULK from people who have just seen the trailer don't know what they're talking about. HULK is a great, creative film, maybe better than SPIDERMAN but not even close to X2: X-MEN UNITED. The HULK is so true to the comics, that's why people have mixed reviews about it. They split the screen like a comic, when some scenes end you see a page flip, and they freeze some scenes also. But enough of the HULK, what about the storyline? At the beginning of the film Ang Lee makes the only mistake of the film, showing the hard to understand creation of the Hulk. But from there on, Eric Bana shines as Banner, Connely rocks at the role of Ross, but Banner's crazy dad (Im sorry I don't know the actor's name but I heard he''s crazy in real life)steals the show. Go see the best summer film in a long time!!

I would have left, but I didn't, because I hoped it would get better. It didn't.

Don't go see this movie, it's a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie/Blu-ray Difficulties","review":"I absolutely love this movie, BUT, unfortunately, I think I've received a bad batch of Blu-ray discs from Amazon. After three minutes of waiting for the movie to load, the first one would cause the Sony Blu-ray player to automatically reboot once the movie starts, no matter if it started from the beginning or at a random chapter. It wouldn't happen when I would play the Extras, only the movie. I asked for and received within 48 hours a replacement Blu-ray disc and encountered the same exact problem. And I know it's not the player, because I played other Blu-ray discs with no problems.

Frankly I thought this movie [was bad]...some scenes seemed to go on forever. I went with 6 other people and we all were either very disappointed by it or thought it was just ok and one guy is a huge Hulk freak. And I?m sorry I?m not a comic aficionado so I was little confused on aspects of the plot and there seemed to be big gaps in the story and how we got from point A to point B. I even closed my eyes & took a little snooze in some parts because it was BORING. Not the best movie I have seen... more hype than anything else.

I wish i could give it less than one star! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been called \\"DUD\\"","review":"Ang Lee viewed the story as a Greek Tragedy. The only tragedy here was letting him direct this ponderous, dull, flat meandering film. The multi-frame scenes that are supposed to mimic a comic page only distract. I mean how many frames of helicopters flying endlessly over featureless desert are needed?The story starts out with a confusing obtuse story about the hero's father doing some sort of proscribed experiment. Unfortunately the rest of the film adds nothing to the plot. The characters are all either flat and stereotypic, or silly caricatures. You never get a chance to develop any sympathy for anyone in the film.And just so it does not go unmentioned: four star generals DO NOTcommand bases; secret or otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"dumb","review":"this movie made no sense, I am a huge fan of the comic, and this movie to me just seems like a big advertising ploy.And the cgi isn't very good, the hulk looks incredibley fake.

He looks like a big slab of clay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, dreadful, terrible <insert your own adjective>","review":"What a horrible movie.An action movie that has far too little action.A catastrophe that is burdened with criminally bad performances, most notably from Nick Nolte, who clearly began his own personal problems while filming this movie.Sure I know the Hulk is a CG character, but it doesn't even look remotely \\"real\\", I felt I was watching a video game.The incredibly dull first hour tries to set the stage and plot but then leaves numerous angles/questions unanswered and unaddressed - why waste my time developing a plot in an action-less action movie if that stage setting is completely forgotten after the \\"action\\" begins.Compared to the other Marvel superhero movie of 2003 (X2), this film is a disgrace.Ang Lee should be charged with gross negligence and prohibited from ever making another movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"They butchered the Hulk","review":"The Incredible Hulk has been one of my favorite Marvel Super Heros, since the 1960's.Yes, I lost track of him over the past few decades when I gave up comics in favor of computers. But I still love the character I remember.I even liked the Incredible Hulk TV show of the 1980's. Hulk wasn't as powerful as he was in the comics, but he was more believable. Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno helped tremendously in that regard.But this movie stank like rotten eggs on a warm July day.The story turned into some weird story of father and son, and their inner battles, or something like that.In all my years of following the Hulk, I don't recall ever reading anything about Bruce Banner's father or mother. I surely don't recall this crappy storyline.If you haven't yet seen this movie, rent it, don't buy it.I'm so glad The Incredible Hulk has gotten another chance with the new movie released in 2008.I haven't seen it yet, in the theaters. I'll probably buy the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the video","review":"The Hulk is a huge disappointment. The scientific dialogue is too difficult to understand. It takes entirely too long for the movie to pick up in pace and the Hulk itself looks like a character on a Saturday morning cartoon. There is no real plot and the most interesting part of the movie is the last 5 minutes. There is not anything loveable about the Hulk or any of the characters so you aren't drawn to any of them to even care about their situations. Bottomline - don't waste your money, wait for it to come out on video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter disappointment","review":"I saw the trailers, and I expected what it seems quite a few people here expected (a fake-looking Hulk). When I saw the movie, I was actually quite impressed with how well the Hulk was done.My problem was with the storyline. I couldn't decipher how any of the characters related to one another, with each pair of characters seeming to move from friendship to indifference to hatred and back in the blink of an eye. I found that the Hulk had essentially no personality whatsoever, assuming that confused and defensively angry aren't really personality traits.I entered the theater with low expectations, and I left the theater utterly disappointed. Amazingly bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE ABSOLUTE WORST MOVIE OF 2003!","review":"This movie was absolutely horrible. It was like Daredevil, where they didn't know what to do with the movie, but a lot worse. The script was all around the place and the special effects were as good as nothing. They should have waited a couple of years so that the special effects could have been more realistics. The Hulk looked like they had drawn a picture of him and put it in the movie. I know this is suppost to be a comic book movie, but they should have tried to make him more realistic.

DVD exras are very nice. Worth getting. 3 million DVD's were sold of the title the first week.....thats a very large amount if it wasn't liked.With Marvel recently announcing a sequal I am sure that Connelly and Bana are going to pass on this next film of the HULK franchise.

I was constantly looking at my watch wondering what I was watching, because it didn't seem like a hulk movie. The problem was that Ang Lee tried too hard to explain this 15 foot muscular green giant. When in the end, how can you explain it?Don't get me wrong, when the hulk was on the screen, I loved it. To see this guy jumping miles into the air bouncing around like Shrek on steroids was fun.

If Ben Aflek could play Dare Devil and Toby Miguire could play Spiderman and Micheal Keaton could play Batman, why couldn't Ang Lee get an actor/bodybuilder to play the Hulk?Bruce Bana played the Bruce (David) Banner character OK, but I think Hugh Jackman has more of the Bruce (David) Banner look and could play the charater much better.If Ang Lee makes another Hulk movie lets hope there is some kind of improvement to the Hulk character."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Hulk\\"","review":"It has its moments and it can be flashy fun at times and very serious at others.

Perhaps it was all of the pseudo-scientific jargon. Perhaps it was the cheesy \\"comic book frame\\" technique that Ang Lee seemed to use ad nauseum throughout the film. Whatever it was, the film did not resonate with me at all the way I thought it would.Eric Bana displays the range of a turnip as Bruce Banner. He has a total of three expressions throughout the film: vacant, morose, and angry, and tends to remain in the first through most of the film. I grew up watching Bill Bixby \\"hulk out\\" into Lou Ferrigno, and for all the cheesiness of the series, I'd take it any day over this overblown piece of cinematic fluff.This film is painfully slow and pathetically written. If you haven't seen it already, save your money for the X-Men or Spiderman franchises--they know how to do comic book action properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"... skip it.","review":"I grew up a fan of the Hulk, so I couldn't wait to see the new movie. Imagine my surprise when I saw that they had mangled the story of the Hulk, turning him from an accidental anti-hero into the posterboy for male-bashing.In this story, Bruce Banner's father is a violent man, with his emotions out of control - his angelic wife loves him but is unable to penetrate through and share her natural female stability with him. Bruce himself is an emotional basketcase, all [messed] up by his father. Then, due to an accident, Bruce is turned into a violent man with his emotions out of control - his angelic girlfriend loves him but is unable to penetrate through and share her natural female stability with him. Do I see a pattern here?Sorry, but whoever redesigned the story of the Hulk is a misandrist - probably a man filled with self-loathing...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really, really wanted to like this movie!","review":"I saw this in the theater not on DVD, nor do I plan to watch the DVD. I enjoyed the Hulk-smash bits, who wouldn't? I also liked how they used cutting to give it the feel of being in a graphic novel, but otherwise it was pretty much a snoozer. It tried to be psychologically interesting but failed. I like the Hulk and really wanted to like this movie, but I was bored. And the one scene where you were actually interested in what happens, the final fight. You couldn't see it because of poor lighting and poor animation. I'm still not sure how this movie ended, and sadly I don't really care. Maybe they will add in more scenes and make this movie more interesting, but I'm not sure that's possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie SUCKS!!!!!!","review":"This is the worst movie of 2003! Don't buy it and don't even bother watching it! It is unblelievably boring with crap acting, bad lines and i story that line that i don't even bother caring about. Seeing some guy with dumbo ears (ERic Bana) turn green in the face and then smash out through the side of a house made me laugh out loud! He says the same line about 10 times, which is \\"don't make me angry, you wouldn't like me when i'm angry\\". Also, what is with it when you see the Hulk running? He looks like the ROADRUNNER from the cartoon! Also his ability to jump a thousand feet in the air was also over done by about 1,000 times. Don't waste your time. You'd be better off seeing Spy Kids:3D instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank goodness for that elasticized waistband!","review":"Being as this flick is based on a comic book in which a dude gets riled and turns into a big green cartoon monster, it should come as no surprise when Eric Bana's character flies into a pique of rage and, coincidentally enough, also turns into a big green cartoon monster. Which is a long-winded way of saying the CGI in \\"The Hulk\\" is so bad it makes Harryhausen's stop-motion technique look like it came from the future. As for story, well, the cartoon monster breaks stuff and Jennifer Connolly is kinda purty. And subtext? Sure, there's subtext. The cartoon monster is obviously a metaphor for... for... er, um, not to worry - Ang Lee hasn't quite figured that one out yet either. There was a day when this sort of junk culture came with a price tag of 25 cents and a warning from your parents that it would rot your mind. Chalk one up for your parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish Director Hadn't Ruined Good Opportunity","review":"Ang Lee really gave me ANGst. The first half is horrible, lots of Islam-sounding music and brooding of Banner and a story that barely moves. VERY difficult to sit through this. Once the Hulk goes on a rampage, it certainly gets better but the CGI is OK-to-Good and not superb as we expect in today's world.It's too bad they got Ang Lee as he almost ruined Stan Lee's creation.I wish a Marvel character had been respected better by a director. Hulk and Marvel fans MUST own this just because, but it won't be your favorite. Even the mediocre (given today's expectations we all have) TV series with Bill Bixby (who was wonderful as Banner) has FAR more heart and soul than much of the first half of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!","review":"THIS MOVIE SUCKS!IT\`S SO CRAZY,STUPID,BULLCRAP,AND ALL THAT KIND OF BAD STUFF!I DON\`T RECCOMEND THIS MOVIE FOR ANYONE!IT DOSENT EVEN MAKE ANY SENCE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I saw this movie @ my cousin's and I thought it was gonna be so good.

Other superhero movies usually something in common with the comic book they were in. The Hulk does not do this. Bruce Banner isn't the Hulk because his father did weird stuff to his mother.

Fourth, In SPider-man after 10 mins Peter is already turning into spiderma. In Hulk it took like 45 mins for bruce just to get exposed to radiation. Fifth, HUlk looked WAY to cartoony.

Don't watch this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hulk for Real","review":"I seen movie with my daughter last summer and we both enjoyed the movie alot. I felt it was a little long and the last half hour of the movie could have been used in the next movie. The pace of the movie was good in developing the story and when the Hulk broke loose and the action took off to amazing heights. It would have been nice if the Hulk talked more like in the comics. I enjoyed watching the REAL Hulk jump, run and destroy everything in TRUE MARVEL FORM not a man on TV with green makeup runnig through downtown Manhattan in New York. If you read the Marvel comics or watched the 1960's cartoons on TV everyone would understand why Hulk can do what he does. I feel it's a good buy because it has a good storyline and the true Marvel nature of what the Hulk is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed action","review":"When I heard they were going to make a film about the Hulk I got excited cause I thought it was going to be one hell of a thrill ride. Boy was I wrong, the graphics were good but there wasn't enough action. If you are going to make a film about the hulk you gotta make sure there is enough action and less talk. That's why I liked the comics, because they were quick and had a lot of action. This film was like an independent film with a great big monster on it. Ang Lee may be a talented director but he should stick to films like crouching tiger hidden dragon , and he should stay away from comic book movies in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was prepared to hate this movie","review":"Based on critical reviews of The Hulk, I was prepared to hate it. I put off viewing the film for a long time because I believed that it was a poor film. WRONG! The special effect of the Hulk is terrific. The storyline is excellent. Casting is great, featuring Sam Elliott and Nick Nolte in striking roles. This is a long film -- 2 hrs. 18 min., but it doesn't feel like a long movie. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"could've been good....","review":"if i understood ANY part of it!!!!most of it was stupid when they were talking it was boring and then they went too extreme with the action scenes and i didn't understand why bruce's dad sent those dog's after him because they went to that cabin way out in the woods and how did he know they were there in the first place? and also the ending when they were fighting the hulk simply punched his dad and he blew up? what was that for anyway??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hulk","review":"One of the most awesome pictures I've ever seen in HD or Blu-Ray format.The picture is pristine and the colors perfect. And also the Amazon service excellent. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ewwwww","review":"I tried REALLY hard to like this movie. Unfortunately my high hopes for a harrowing and exiciting film like X-Men or Spiderman was completely shattered when I first noticed the way of how they were directing, I instantly knew that i wasn't going to like it, their attempts for making a comic book style film failed...well for me at least. First off, Ang Lee i think tries WAY too hard to make movies with good storylines too big. Paycheck was a good movie, but he tried to make it way too emotional, instead he gets a two dimensional image of a good actor. Before i knew it, i wasn't watching an amazing film based off an amazing comic book character, i was watching an amazingly done special effects, two dimensional characters walking and talking to each other wondering what they should do about a giant 2-year-old thats running around destroying things."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAAAAAAAHH He's Green!","review":"This movie is funny as hell. It wasn't meant to be a comedy, and I went to Ryder's house as a comic fan expecting to see a serious adaptation of the comic books. What I got instead was a 1950s B-Movie mockery of a riddle. There's a scene in this movie where Hulk is locked up and talking to his dad. His dad all of a sudden starts ranting about how the military is conquering everything in its path, which had nothing to do with anything. While he's talking, Banner starts screaming for no apparent reason. I laughed my ass off during that scene. It was funny man. Not as funny as when me and Ryder tried to copy the scene from Spiderman, but all we had was silly string, and Ryder fell down and smashed up his XBOX, I was laughing my ass off, and his head was bleeding all over. Damn, that was a funny day."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hulk Wins with Me!","review":"While some didn't enjoy the deep intellectual discussions and the scientific background of this movie, I did, because this movie is worth it. The special effects are amazing. Jennifer Connelly was fantastic. I loved the costumes (I'm the Costume Master for my school's Drama department), and the whole movie was pieced together great. I didn't enjoy the comic book look, though. It was great, but more suited for something like The Flash, if they ever make a movie on him. The plot is also a little slow. The ending left a little to be desired, but it was a all-around good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster Mash","review":"There was plenty of criticism about this film. However I thoroughly was entertained by it. I thought it did drag until the Hulk's first appearance which isn't until about 45 minutes into the film. After that it is very good in my opinion. The dog fight scene was tremendous...watching the hulk jump from mountains to bridges to canyons was very cool...although the animation wasn't given great reviews I thought they did a tremendous job making the Hulk seem lifelike. Isn't it great to see a giant Hulk breaking the front of a tank in half.:) The ending was kind of wierd and definitly leaves room for a sequel but nevertheless I think the effects will keep you wanting to watch this movie more then the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop the Madness","review":"How many films of the 1990s and 00s can be reviewed in one sentence: The special effects were dazzling, but the plot and acting left something to be desired? If the 1970s were the height of the humanistic film (\\"Whose Life Is It Anyway?,\\" \\"Breaking Away,\\" \\"Testament,\\" \\"Harold and Maude,\\" \\"Ordinary People\\") than 1990-2003 has to be its all-time low. So much current film is digital and excessively slick.Director Ang(st) Lee's attempt to inject the issues of child abuse and family dysfunction into its FX parade meets with clumsy results. \\"Spiderman\\" was far superior in fusing its dazzling visuals with the charisma of Kirsten Dunst and Tobey McGuire, but no actor in \\"Hulk\\" is terribly compelling in his or her role. \\"Hulk\\" vacillates between slow, sad, and baffling passages about Bruce Banner's secrets and upbringing and roid-ragingly impressive but oddly disconnected Hulk transformation and battle sequences. Eye-candy and ennui. Pass on this. Buy \\"Spiderman\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bigger they are, they dumber they get.","review":"I can't believe they spent $150 million on this crap.

I really love looking at the Computer Generated Monster.I love the fight scene with the dogs. Eric Bana plays the scientist who transforms into The Hulk. Jennifer Connely plays Betty Ross his exgirlfriend who believes him. Sam Elliot plays her Father. A general who wants to destroy him. Josh Lucas plays Glenn Talbot. The evil guy who wants to take The Hulk's DNA to create soldiers who can heal their own wounds. Nick Nolte plays David Banner. The evil dad who was not to be seen for 30 long years. Unlike \\" SUPERMAN,THE X-MEN,BATMAN,SPIDER-MAN,DAREDEVIL and THE PUNISHER\\" The Hulk first gets mad at people and turns all green. The ending for some reason got a little disappointing. And here's why. Because Nick Nolte's character first meets his son and turns into some bizarre mammet play. And they were screaming and yelling at each other and Nick Nolte bites the plug and electricutes himself. But like I said,Ilove this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hulk","review":"This Hulk was inaccurate to the comics. It had few scenes of great comic enjoyment.

The plot just plodded along and once Bruce Banner became \\"The Hulk\\" I thought the action would REALLY start but instead it seemed to me that he would go back and fourth between B.B. and The Hulk too often. Plus,Eric Bana and Nick Nolte didn't add anything at all to their characters and Jennifer Connelly wasn't all that great either. One wishes Bill Bixby was still with us to breathe life into B.B.(for those who remember the 70's show). I also wish Lou Ferrigno had a more substantial part! ...

I found Ang Lee's treatment of the Hulk mythos to be interesting and compelling. While some liberties were taken with the back story and creation of the Hulk, I think it worked out pretty well. The pure CG Hulk himself doesn't detract but does serve to stand out against humankind and nature. Banner's dad as the Absorbing Man was a bit of a stretch, couldn't they have waited for a Thor film for that? Still, the effects for the Absorbing Man were good while he was on film. Oh Jennifer Connely, where are those fit and full days of the HotSpot and Rocketeer? You're too thin and look sickly now, it saddens me to have to say. Overall the cast does a bang-up job especially Sam Elliot as Thunderbolt Ross. Bruce Banner is adeptly played w/ wide range by Eric Bana. There are some Crouching Tiger angles and sensibilities sprinkled about if you watch for them. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hulk want to bash the director and crew!!!!!!","review":"This movie had some good acting and digital animation but came out lame. Why? Because of the corney events that happened in the movie. Ex. the crazy man eating dogs, hulk jumping miles high in the air, and hulks father turning into a giant electrical monster near the end of the movie. What the hell were they thinking. Didn't any of them say, this sounds sorts of corney. Rent but don't buy this movie because there's to much talk and you'll probably be put to sleep by it. The best Marvel movies are X-men and blade.

But the answer came a little easier: the filmmakers wanted to make MORE of the story than there was. Get into the Hulk's inner child and psychology. Blah, blah, psycho-blah.We want to see the Hulk throw more tanks.We want to see him foil villians who try to use him for their own nefarious purposes.You've got hundreds of comic books and dozens of TV shows to cobble a cool plot from.You blew it.And...that...just...makes me...ANGRY!You killed a movie franchise faster than Joel Schummacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"I am still not sure what to think of this movie.

The problem I see with this film is the same problem I see with the other Marvel Comics movies being released recently. The story does not have a steady flow. The movie stops and goes and by the end I feel like I have movie whiplash. I don't recommend this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do you make The Hulk boring?","review":"By taking it too seriously. That's how. This thing labors along like it thinks it's Schindler's List. It's a comic book movie. Where's the joy? The adventure? The freaking FUN? It's buried under an over-long expository first act, bad over-acting (Sam Elliot), bad under acting (Eric Bana), and some really silly concepts (a hulk poodle?).And just because people keep saying the CGI \\"looks real\\", it doesn't make it so. It's good CGI, but in the end that's all it is. They just don't have the technology to do a realistic human face yet.

Unlike Spider-Man and Daredevil, The Hulk has a small time starring actor. The Hulk was truely a disapointment for me. It moved too fast, the story was hard to follow, but non-the-less, great performances. If your a big Hulk fan, you should watch it. The action scenes are good but the story and dialogue just screwed it up.

Plus the movie took way too long to get the good parts (if there were any).

The special effects for the Hulk were great, you can see the bullets bounce off of his sides, and the sheer anger and immense destruction literally radiates off of the screen as you're watching it.

This movie was barely even remotely entertaining, when it seemed to be getting better, it would fall flat over and over again. The Nick Nolte character seemed to be going somewhere interesting but ends up doing something so over the top that I lose all interest.

Anothe thing I liked was how during some scenes they would split the screen up into smaller boxes and show the scen from different viewpoints. some said that got annoying, but I liked it.

THE F/X LOOK STUPID FRANKLY, WITH THE HULK BEING SOME KIND OF GIANT JUMPING AND RUNNING AROUND AND THE EARTH ACTUALLY SHAKING UNDER HIM. THEY COULD HAVE WENT THE MORE BELIEVABLE ROUTE AND JUST MADE HIM LOOK MORE LIKE HE DID IN THE SERIES, A VERRY LARGE PI__ED OFF MAN, AND NOT SO CARTOONISH.

BIRTH DEFECT! A few words for the ones behind this effortless project : Does the word realistic mean anything at all? Maybe this movie wasn't ready to hit the big screen just yet, since it seems digital artists now a days aren't paying much attention to life like graphics 101. Only those who cross the youth limit of age 35 can only get so hyped about wasting time & money on this cartoon.. I mean movie.

Being a comic book hero fan, I was looking forward to a spetacular movie with a notable director, fine cast, and padded budget; yet, we get all these, but an otherwise flat movie based on a flat scripted.The film has its moments like the \\"Hulk vs the dogs\\", but besides a few moments here and there, one's mind starts to wonder because of the sheer silliness and overly done multiangle filming.The end, as the Hulk/Banner battels his father (uninspiring performance by Nolte) is just anti-climatic and boring. Sam Elliot provides the screens best performance as Jennifer Connely's father."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MARVEL FILM YET","review":"This film is a complete creative disaster. The origin of the Hulk has been altered in a way that completely obliterates the character, the plot is nonexistant, the dialogue laughable, the split-screens pointless, and the Hulk's face looks like a fat pouty Eric Bana. If you are unfortunate enough to find yourself in the theater, stay for the jaw-droppingly bad third act super-villain...and then try to explain what you just saw. This was supposed to be a fun superhero monster movie, not a boring and stupefying repressed-memory melodrama. Ang Lee was the wrong director for this film, but the real blame goes to the producer and writer: Shame on you, Schamus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre...","review":"This has got to be one of the most boring movies ever made. It took WAY too long to get to the point. The only reason I'm posting this now is just to make sure people do not base the 2nd movie off of thier opinions of the first. The new Hulk is 1000 times better. Go see it! I have had to tell at least a dozen people that it was actually good and not half as sucky as the first.

Face it: The HULK has all the right elements and then some that made SPIDERMAN the huge hit that it was.. The HULK Will have: ACTION, DRAMA, ROMANCE, SUSPENSE with a Blend of SCI-FI Mixed in that will appeal to all age demographics, not to mention the fact that Ang Lee at least knows how to make a STORY, something the Matrix Reloaded lacked heavily and was too overly reliant on FX... Even Richard Roeper has predicted that Reloaded will not be the Summer winner, but the HULK..

Plenty of other reviews here will tell you how the story is off the mark, so I'll concentrate on something not many mentioned: The Hulk is around 20 feet tall in this movie.In the comics, the Hulk gets stronger the madder he gets, which is usually when he's getting worked over. In this movie he expands in size when he gets hit with bullets, and he can't be harmed. This transforms the movie from a Frankenstein-like story to a King Kong-like story, which is far less interesting. The Hulk is even animated as if they were trying to make him look like the claymation used in the original Kong.Finally, Hulk not talk which made Chris mad and made Chris want to smash stupid movie seat.

I like superhero movies. I don't like this one. The story lost control of itself somewhere. Plot lines were left just dangling in the wind. And for some reason, the hulk chooses bouncing around as his mode of transportation. Did he fill up on gummy berry juice? Great actors were wasted. And apparently the transition between scenes is more important than the scene itself.

I have never seen such a movie that was SUPPOSED to have special FX and action and had none. Well, other then Spider-man 2. This movie has about 10 minutes of action towards the end, but 95% of it is just talk, or some scietific blather that the normal-brained person can't understand. There is too much gooey sentementalism and dull childhood flashbacks that will bore you to death. If the entire movie had been like the one action sequence in the whole movie, this would be a 5-star movie. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Misfire","review":"The only thing incredible about this Hulk was my disappointment. What a letdown - a boring letdown - and a wasted opportunity. I expected more from Ang Lee. The only saving grace was Jennifer Connelly's amazing cleavage, which never disappoints. Thank you, Jennifer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! This really makes me appreciate the TV show","review":"Despite having a great cast and director, the Hulk movie is a total dud.The main problem for me is the CGI rendition of the Hulk is cartoonish and absurd- throughout the movie, it's impossible to feel any empathy (like King Kong) for the titular character! They really should have cast a human being (with some CGI) like the TV show (or hired the F/X team that did the Lord of Rings).The second major problem is a very weak script that may be mostly Ang Lee's fault. The father-son conflict (at the heart of the movie) was poorly conceived and the storyline is very weak and boring. This movie really makes me appreciate the Incredible Hulk pilot from 1977, which starred Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno. I'd have much preferred seeing a remake of that then this ill-advised, expensive flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"just way too much...","review":"this movie stinks why did they twist it up so much? could've been good but...nope. only one word:HORRIBLE!!!!also they should've done hulk in a costume like thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"i COULD'VE liked it.....","review":"but i don't. the next time i watch a superhero movie i'm approaching with EXTRA,EXTRA caution i guess spider-man has his own category because i expected hulk like to be like that,but it was not!! the violence was extra,extra high!!! didn't they know little kids watch this stuff??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie i have ever seen","review":"This movie was without a doubt the worst movie i have ever seen. Usually I rate movies in terms of how they do compared with my expectations, but even if i expected the worst, i would have hated this movie. I expected this movie to be an OK movie, entertaining but stupid and cheesy (spider man...). It was nothing short of awful. The plot took forever to develop, there was too much wierd scifi stuff, etc. The special effects were very good, but they did not translate into enteraining action sequences. I truly hated this movie and as a result will never see another comic book inspired moive again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ang Lee should have watched Spiderman first...........","review":"The CGI Hulk was very impressive, for the 18 minutes you got to see him during the 2 hr. 18 min. film. The movie explains pretty much nothing and gets more confusing as it goes. Constant picture-in-picture type scene splits make it even more confusing. Bad transitions between scenes dosen't help either. In a nut shell, no plot, confusing story and no ties to the original Hulk story. The only way I would reccommend you see this film is on DVD when you can pick the scenes with the Hulk in action and watch them to your delight."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzz","review":"This movie was a bit dull for a comic book adaption...the 1st 40 minutes was about the origin..an extended origin unlike the comic and could have been alot less dealt with..Finally, the Hulk shows up and most of the fight scenes--ARE IN THE DARK??? you couldn't make things out...Since the storyline was so dragged out you would have thought the technical effects would have balanced the movie out, but i was a disappointment...hopefully a sequal will be made with a different writer and a btter HULKmovie will be brought more to the comic fan..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ang Lee,what went wrong?!","review":"This movie is [weak].

Yeah right.I was having severe phsychological issues once I left the theatre.[Weak] action,(the most exciting part was when the Hulk got attacked by ... poodles)boring scenery(all desert or military complex)and did I mention [weak] action?

The plot wallows in some supposedly meaningful dialog as everyone does their best to be brooding and deep. The computer generated Hulk is itself a major disappointment, they were turning out superior CGI well over ten years ago. In fact it reminded me of the old stop motion photography they used in the 50s...Still, I suppose it shows what 21st century marketing can do.

It's been a long time since I've really hated a comic-book type of movie, but this one was just awful. I hope, in a BIG way, that the split screen effects don't catch on in Hollywood. I found them distracting and annoying, and they didn't even make much sense. The sound on the DVD was strange, too. I turned my volume way up, but still could barely hear a lot of the dialog. The Hulk animation was so embarrassing. I wished for Lou Ferrigno many times. I did finish the movie, but just barely. Couldn't really care less how it ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing...","review":"To tell you the truth, I expected a LOT more from the Hulk.I thought SUPERMAN 4 was stupid!

However, I never heard of many reasons as to why it's so bad. Well after viewing it for myself I realize that yes it's bad. I'll tell you what I think is bad about it. After a painfully boring first 40 minutes which explains how science can go wrong (been there, done that) you come to realize that now that the HULK is finally present the action isn't. Well at least it's boring and unexciting action. The CGI of the HULK is unique, but I'm not sure that's a good thing. I'd rather have a real live actor play the key title role in a live action comic book movie. Bad script w/ bad dialogue and I hate how director Ang Lee had 2 to 4 squares on the screen at one time. Even on a big screen t.v. it wasn't possible to follow. If you still plan to buy this DVD, buy those Hulk hands with it so after you watch it, you can Hulk smash it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF was Ang Lee THINKING!?","review":"What was Ang Lee thinking when he made this flick. Alright... here's the good part... the animation was AMAZING. The hulk looked and felt and reacted like a real human...(sorta) but the plot was so !@#$ing weak. I mean... seriously, I went to support the industry, and to see the re-birth of the hulk, but where can they go from here? It was ghastly. Details left for the imagination.

Let me start off by saying that I waited a long time to see the Matrix 2. When I saw it, I was so happy. A 5 star movie! Then I saw the Hulk. Woah. [cue dram music] Never had I imagined moving making could be like that. Never had I even fathomed ever seeing a movie based on Science fiction so well done. I was astounded. This movie in the first 30 minutes made my top 10 list of movies of all time. I should commit myself to a mental institution saying these next words,\\"it was better than the Matrix Reloaded\\". There I said it.You won't be dissapointed.Drama!Action!Plot!Suspense!Hulk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hulk lacks power","review":"My favourite is Incredible Hulk tv series and I am fan of Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno.The Hulk was slow paced, confusing story, poor performances and the ending was terrible.

I often will re-watch a film years later after not liking it originally, only to find myself thoroughly enjoying it the second time through.This was unfortunately not one of those times. I won't quite go as far as calling it un-watchable. But dear God it was close to it. The acting is ok. But between the pacing which erratic and the plot which was so bad I actually wanted to go watch Gigli as a palate cleaner. It is very uncommon for me to hate on a movie. The exceptions of course being the prequels to my beloved Star Wars. I'll hate on those all day.I think I'll wait for them to legalize pot in my state. Then I'll try watching it again in another ten years.It can't be any worse than it is already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"in my opinion i liked this hulk better than the 2008 version simply because he seems much more powerful. The 2008 hulk had to use a little muscle to tip over a humvee while this one grabs a tank, spinns it around a couple of times and throws it hundreds of meters away. Now that is a HULK. This movie truly deserved a sequel instead of a remake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly bad","review":"I didn't finish this movie. I couldn't stand the way it was shot, i guess trying to be a comic book or something. It was way too distracting. The Hulk when he finally appeared, looked horrible, i've seen better animation on South Park. This is the worst comic-book adaptation i've ever seen. The part with the dogs was incredibly stupid looking. I like how the constantly keep The Hulk in the shadows many times, hiding the bad effects and the fact the Hulk looked and acted nothing like the lead actor: they seemed unconnected, even though there the same person. And how about the storyline?, whoooaaaaa, is this magnolia or a comic book hero? lets stick to the source material guys. 1/2 a star. at least that gorgeous Brilliant Mind actress was in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"As a comic book fan when I heard about a Hulk movie I was very exited.I expected awsome fight sequences and great story like in spiderman,but what a joke! When I finally went to see it I almost fell asleep the first half of the movie, with Bruce's stupid flashbacks when he was a baby.When fight sequences actually did come it was worse than the 70's TV show.When the Hulk jumps He just might as well have the ability to fly!Then the final fighting scene was completely stupid and confusing.Plus the ending was dumb and unsatisfying.If you are an EXTREME fan of the hulk go see it but if your just a casual comic book reader or just want to see a good entertaining movie skip it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost interest very fast","review":"While I appreciated Ang Lee's direction and cinematography of the film, I found myself becoming quite bored with the story. There were very few good moments, and they were quickly over-shadowed by the banality of the super-hero genre. Unfortunately, this movie did not offer anything new and spectacular... the best parts of the movie were 1) how high and far The Hulk could jump and 2) the desert landscape and shots in National Parks... and that is why I kept watching.If you want to see a comic-book adaptation, there are much better choices out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried to be too much","review":"This movie was a big disappointment. I was hoping for an entertaining flick, lots of action and fighting, etc. but instead it was kind of slow and tried to fill in way too much back story. Really we just want a story, don't we?, when we watch one of these comic book character driven movies, not the whole history.The computer effects were good and there are a couple of decent action scenes, in fact, if it means anything, my 2 and a half year old saw the \\"green monster\\" on the cover of the dvd and asked to see it. So I showed her the part of the movie from the previews, where the Hulk fights the tanks and helicopters. She made me replay it about 10 times, so I guess that's an endorsement of that sequence, too bad the rest of the movie couldn't keep up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hulk","review":"Hulk's trailer was really exciting and intense. Made you wanted to watch it. However, after watching the movie in the theatres, I decided that this movie is probably one of the top ten worst movies of the year. Hulk's green skin looks just like some paint splattered onto this towering model. Eric Bana was a great actor in the movie. It's just that the movie was bad so everyone assumes that the actors and actresses were bad. Don't spend money to buy the DVD or VHS. Pick another movie that's worthwhile to watch over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"What a disappointment! The dialogue was weak, the story was boring and frankly absurd.

Yes, the movie could've been paced a little better and the end was a bit anticlimactic. This I can forgive. What I can't forgive is the commercials for 2 Fast 2 Furious and some other flick on DVD, which you CAN'T skip on your DVD player. You can fast forward through them which takes several minutes, but cannot skip them and go to the Main Menu. This is the company's way of force feeding commercials on a DVD you bought for home viewing. Also, some of the \\"Extras\\" on the DVD are actually commercials. Yes. You click on the icons and see commercials for soft drinks and Mastercard. SHAMEFUL. I bought this DVD for the Movie. NOT commercials that don't allow you to skip to the Main Menu. In case you couldn't tell, I was pretty much disgusted with the way they released this DVD.Also there is no DVD insert with chapter stops.

Second, if we're going from the comic books, make the Hulk talk in the third person (i.e. \\"Hulk smash puny humans like bugs!\\"). Last, if you're going to have a super-villain from the books, don't make it Bruce's DAD just for the sake of showing off the particular super-powers you want for the movie!

I was very surprised, I actually liked this movie, it had a serious side with a main plot and the special effects were very good although too much CGI is not my thing. The hulk looked very good and the anger and destruction that followed were very well epicted. The hulk really show that exploding rage in his body language as well as the physical devastation caused by it. I did not like the mutated dogs (they looked too much like CGI) and the final fight against his father was over the top and somewhat cheesy. I rented the VHS version and the picture quality was so good that I could barely tell it apart from the dvd image, the sound was also top notch with excellent dynamics and clear dialogue.

This is all found out through split screen antics and alot of flashbacks that detract from the film. The movie is at its best with The HULK in action,his c.g. persona is quite beliveable and the action scenes are great. The actor playing Banner was mis-cast. He seems unlikeable from the start and we are tormented ourselves as we keep flashing back to his childhood. The first 40 miniutes are wasted why they try to describe all of this and how the HULK was created. I swear, the guy playing Banner was as stiff as a board in his acting except when we were treated to the transformation of The HULK. Good and bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAHHH!

The character is a cartoon-like green figure, totally lacking in his emotional capacities, not even his rage convinced me, it looked like a video game more than a movie.

Well, simply because all the CG is deadly wrong, plain pathetic and totally unrealistic ! Such an expensive movie to have a CG animated Hulk that moves so badly and it's totally out of the screen...it's a real shame, indeed! The production should be really sorry for having produced such a low-level CG movie. The whole CG Hulk character is really out of the screen, it's like a hand drawn cartoon overlaid on real images--read: BAD ANIMATION! The CG Hulk character doesn't look real, doesn't move as a true lifeform and doesn't look inside the scenes at all. They should have learned from Lord of The Rings CG animations where unreal creatures looked absolutely real and full embedded with real images. The Hulk has been as much expensive as that probably but results are the worst ever seen to date. It looks like a B movie overall.

The trailer makes the film look so exciting, intense, and well made. However, it's a big mess. From the special effects to the acting. Eric Bana as the Hulk does a decent job, but Nick Nolte is horrendoes, and Jennifer Connelly is boring. She speaks in a whisper the whole film, and the only reason i can come up with as to why she does this, is to prove she is a serious Academy Award winning actress. The special effects are horrific. The Hulk looks so fake, and if Gollum from Lord of the Rings look real, why couldn't the Hulk. I admire Ang Lee for taking on such a project, but his comic book directing, with split screens and all are distracting. Skip the Hulk.

Audiences sat through long periods of Banner's whining and bouts of deep introspection to finally see the Hulk bust out and bust heads. Too little too late. The Mean Green Machine does'nt show up in the film for almost an hour, that is WAY too long.Like I said, there is nothing to the Hulk character, what made him interesting were the donneybrooks he had with comic heavyweights like Thor, Iron Man, The Thing.

I realized I could have spent two hours and fifteen minutes doing something else. The movie was unneccsary too long and everytime you thing you are ready for some great action the movie slows down again. It took a full hour to finally see the big green guy as well. The acting of this movie will not exite anybody either. It is fair to say that Nick Nolte does a respectable job as Bruce Banner's father. To my suprise Jennifer Connolly did not have it in this movie. Also, Eric Bana is far from special. The ladies also get see him naked, not completly though. At the end of the film, when we see the hulk walking around the dessert smashing things having some fun, the viewer would want to know what took so long see some action. Thses movie did not have much, it clearly lacked action. The bottom line is that it could hav been terrible but is far from good."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie doesn't work","review":"The Hulk is a movie by the great director Ang Lee (who again does an amazing job directing this movie) but due to a bad plot nearly all his efforts are in vain. This movie tries to have more susbtance and drama than action and killing. This seems like a great idea unless the plot you choose is so simple you couldn't even make an issue of a comic book of it. In the end the movie alienates itself from practically everyone because it doesn't have enough action to be classified as an action movie, and not enough substance to carry the movie past the slow parts. The reason I gave this movie two stars is because of the superb directing and formidable acting from Eric Bana (as the Hulk) and Jennifer Connelly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small, simple, and it works","review":"Might seem pricey for a small piece of foam, but it does exactly what it's supposed to do.

Liked it so much I ordered two more for my acoustic and electric guitar and one for my bass (the bass version). Only down side I see is -- they DO seem loose like they could fall out AND I doubt the picks will stay in place when I case my guitar (haven't tried it yet).

It's certainly not blues, at least not as we know blues, and it's not really old-timey music. From my standpoint, what Henry Thomas was doing was collecting tunes, songs, popular lyrics of the day and combining them all into entertaining tunes for dancing and listening. And saying these tunes are entertaining is an understatement...they are simply some of the prettiest, happiest old-time tunes I've heard. Archaic sounding and fun, this collection is a keyhole look into another musical era. It's likely that old-time country music back in the late 1800s was similar to these.

Just the light portion is approximately 3 inches long, not including the keyring part, which has this odd (hard to describe) swiveling action that is awkward and seems like it would break easily. It does not just hang and swing freely...it is beyond me why they would design it this way.As for function, you turn it on and off by twisting the base...but if you twist it a little too far, the battery compartment pops open, all 4 fall out, and the light falls to the ground! (At which point I guess you'd need ANOTHER light to find all the little bits?)VERY poor quality, badly designed item...and if that wasn't enough, it arrived broken!

Actually, make that the trilogy. This 4th installment really seems tacked on to the first three, and should have been left in some writer's mind, not on the movie screen. It really brings none of the originality that the first three enjoyed. I would recommend renting this one only so that you've seen the complete set - otherwise, standing alone, it rates only as a passable alien/sci-fi movie. That they brought Ripley back from blood found on the Alien3 planet is really an insult to the audience - she went out with a bang and proved her character in the first three, this movie just regurgitates a successful idea in the name of making some extra bucks for the studio.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.

Alien 3 is dark, scary and very gory, back to the style of the first film. The alien is also one viceous little [creature]. But in this film the aliens are totally boring, the underwater sequence very uneccessary, and the little addition of the \\"half-human, half-alien\\" at the end is more than a little bit stupid and will dissapoint fans.

It went into a totally new direction than the other 3, corny. This was also the Alien film where the supporting cast of humans were more frightening looking than the aliens.

The filmmakers tried to combine the best aspects of the first two movies, but this one had neither the atmosphere of the first or the intensity of the second. The most shameful part is that is movie is NOT scary at all! Gross as hell, but even my wife wasn't frightened. Sigourney Weaver's character appeared to care less about being in this movie. The horrendous dialog makes a mockery of the whole series. And the gore is forced and gratutitous, convincing me they were just trying to top the other movies. This movie is the nail in the coffin. Rest in peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"They really should have stopped at No.3!","review":"Easily the weakest of the Alien series, this pointless addition has little to recommend it. Neither the claustrophobic terror of the marvelous original, the breathtaking action of 2 or the human interest and devious twists of 3. Alien Ressurection is populated with profoundly unlikeable characters whom the viewer simply couldn't care less about. Even the lovely Sigourney's heart doesn't seem to be in it and she puts in her most lack-lustre performance to date. The only redeeming feature is the gruesome alien/human hybrid, but even that only gets a few minutes coverage. Overall, extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an ALIENS movie","review":"Watch ALIENS. Then compare. Then wonder what the hell happened. Like the comment made earlier, this does no feel like an ALIENS film ( I am by no means an expert on movies, yet by the first few minutes of the movie, I knew it was being directed by some french guy ). The characters were more like caricatures in there one- dimensional acting, and they had a \\"cartoonish\\" aspect to them. Probably the most ludicrous part of the movie was the \\"richochet\\" scene where one of the guns-for-hire shoots his pistol in the air to hit the marine below ( totally out of place in the ALIENS universe ). It's saving grace was the way the movie potrays the ALIENS, in that even though a threat to humanity and must be exterminated, they still hold a loathsome beauty and grace that man can only pervert and never perfect. It's only unfortunate that this message is blurred by laudible parodies of evil scientists and equally inept military men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"The worst thing about this movie was how much of it was predictable. I watched this with my son and long before the final sequence where the Alien confronts the survivors in the escaping vehicle (deja vu) we were both shouting at the TV, \\"Kill Ripley! End the Agony!\\".We don't even need to get into the ludicrousness of mixing human oxy-breathing DNA and Alien acid-blooded DNA. This is supposed to be a Science Fiction movie. This sort of unscientific crap relegates this flick to Independence Day level, without the action to redeem it. Still, it was better than say, any made-for-TV Sci-fi flick. Or any Sci-Fi Channel 'Original' Production. Though Babylon5 beats Alien4 hands down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alien Ressurection/Alien 4 is okay, not the best.","review":"There was a formula to the life cycle of the aliens. First a queen alien lays a nest-load of eggs, the eggs hatch face-huggers, the face-huggers plant an alien in another lifeform, the alien is either a soldier or a queen. If it's a queen you start over from the beginning. Alien Ressurection defies this simple formula. The movie is okay but not the best. If you liked the original trilogy than you may not like this movie. If you like it and want to buy it. i reccomend you get it on DVD (always suppliments galore, and great picture quality, esspecially on DVD-ROM), VHS is okay, but if you have access to DVD than, get it on DVD.

I thought the second movie in the series was pretty good, but the third movie (set in a \\"prison planet\\") looked depressing and I passed on it. This one (4th in series) came on TV, so I decided to give it a chance. BIG MISTAKE! I liked the beginning for the most part, interesting characters, Sigourney Weaver playing her part well, etc. The second half of the movie had way too much gore and little story development. Yeah, there were some surprises in the story, but really this turns into a lousy movie. REALLY lousy! The final part with the grotesque, newly-born creature was both unnecessary and totally awful to witness, just an excuse for more killing and nasty special effects. I couldn't wait for this movie to end, maybe just to say I endured watching it? Please, let this be the last spin-off of ALIEN. Please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is god-awful","review":"The story-line is stupid, direction is horrible and is filled to the brim with political correctness.

But upon subsequent viewings, the product seems to improve. Alien 3 was dreadful at first, but now I feel that it was the best of the series. So too, with Alien Resurrection, does familiarity breed enjoyment. The character of Ripley evolves and changes with each new entry of the franchise. The current technology of special effects has made the creature(s) a lot more interesting and believable than the guy in a suit from the first installment of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Ripley's back again after falling to her death.","review":"Well Ripley's back again to save this movie from a horrible death. After falling into melted lead, the insane scientist decides to try and save the perfect killing machine, oh and the alien too. After eight tries they finally get it right as well as saving Ripley. Then smugglers arrive with frozen humans for food and choas ensues. The emprovements on the alien are truly supreme and some of the best fx on the market. For what it's worth I would buy this flic or at least rent it if you are remotely a fan of the last three, or just plain into movies full of bloodshed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated.","review":"This film is hardly as bad as others claim. It has some of the best effects of the series, colorful and distinct characters, great performances (Michael Wincott, Ron Pearlman, Dan Hedaya, J.E. Freeman), memorable action scenes, some of the best lines since ALIENS, excellent musical score, and visually impressive cinematogrophy and sets. I especially like how the aliens are portrayed as living, thinking creatures rather than mindless killers like in the second and third films. The only thing that detracts from this spectacular sci-fi thriller is Weaver's completely flat and uninspired performance as the new Ripley. Overall, not as good as one or two, but just as good as three. The Alien series is still going strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its good, not the best.","review":"Ressurection was good enough to own, but it wasnt awsome! I mean it was a good movie, but the thing that disappointed me about this film was that its a lot different than the first 3. Dont get me wrong though its still a pretty good entry in the series. This time around, its 200 years later. The Military resurrects the long dead Ripley from blood samples they retrived from the prison planet of Alien 3(a little hard to belive since she was burned in the furnace at the end). Anyways the decide to resurrect her to get the alien from her. They start their own race of the aliens. Soon they escape and the people of the ship have to run for their lives, including visitors from another ship thats docked their. Good entry, yet lacks some true alien fun. I can't say i loved Winona Ryder in this movie. Maybe if they make Alien 5 it will be better. Rated R for violence, language, alien gore, and some brief nudity."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I thought Alien 3 sucked!","review":"Terrible addition to a once great franchise. I thought after the depressing Alien 3 it had to get better. NOT SO. this is by far the worst of the series--stock characters, with no insight to seemingly illogical actions taken by them.

If you ask me, this was by far the worst film in the Alien series. I cannot understand why so many people seem to find this movie enjoyable. It was really silly. It had bad acting. It had aweful, unlikeble characters. Events occured without any sort of sense. It was just a bunch of space cowboys walking through corridor after corridor in a dark gloomy spaceship. That is until the human/alien is introduced. Brad Douraf introduces us to the creature by calling it a \\"little butterfly.\\" It then sucks his brains out. The hilarous looking creature runs around, chasing Riply, before getting sucked out of a spaceship in a goopy unconvincing manner. I am sorry folks, it was just bad. As in, I've seen sci-fi movies more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summer Popcorn Flick","review":"Terrible compared to the other three. Randomly put in the hands of a Frenchman who had never directed a movie in English. Very odd for a foreigner to direct a sequel as his first movie in another language.

I thought the third film was terrible, but this one takes the cake. The premise is this, Ripley is cloned many years after her death and she spawns an Alien queen from scientists tampering with genetic engineering. After she escapes with some more tough characters who we don't care about, she ends up killing a relative Alien born from her own Queen Alien which has its face ripped off by the half alien, half human alien, yeah, stupid. Ripley cries as her child Alien dies and a scientist looms over the situation and says one bad line after the other like \\"Look, a little baby,\\" and \\" a perfect butterfly.\\" The movie finally ends and Ripley is finally brought down to Earth, lets hope the movie studios milking this series to death are brought back to Earth as well. Terrible waste of time and money and not including one of the great creature creations ever.

I thought that this film had a very good storyline. I do, however, agree that they should have left that alien/human hybrid out of this film, but that being added doesn't make this movie bad.The story of Ripley being half alien is a very interesting thing. She can use their own techniques against them, and does. The Xenomorphs themselves looked fantastic, they look even better than they do in Alien vs. Predator; they are very detailed in this movie.I don't have much to say, but I do have to say that I did like this movie.

Easily the worst of the Alien films and quite possibly one of the worst films ever made. What is Alien Resurrection suppose to be? A black comedy or an actual sequel to Alien 3? Either way it fails miserably. The acting is atrocious, the story is non-linear and absurd and the direction is abysmal. Believe the hype...this movie sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK, just awful...1 star is more than it deserves","review":"Stick with the original. I also think the under-rated 3rd Alien is much better than this. Forget the ridiculous \\"Resurrection\\", I never even got past the silly part where the \\"new\\" born-again Ripley proves she's a basketball star. Simply stupid. Even the upcoming \\"Predator VS Alien\\" couldn't possibly be worse than this. They should have stuck with the storyline in some of those Alien comic books that came out years ago. They certainly were better than this tripe. Plus, finally we'll get an Alien film without Ms Weaver.

This was the 4th movie in the ALIEN series, and could be arguably the best one. By letting the resurrected Ripley play the semi-bad guy in this one, it gives the movie a hell of a plot twist.

Seems like he could have just unbuckled himself and grabbed the ladder. Besides the acting, the aliens themselves looked cheap and stupid; they were so slimy that they were gushing slime everywhere.

I hated the special effects, and the aliens looked horrible as if they were actually Terminators due to the metal skeletons. The idea of cloning Ellen Ripley back from traces of blood was ludicrous, and I don't know if it can be challenged by having Sigourney Weaver back for this fourth installment and knowing she was in it for money. It's pretty much safe to say that she was once a good actress. If I had to describe what the story in Alien: Resurrection is about, I don't rightly know. The movie was so boring that I got cooed to sleep many times. All in all, Alien: Resurrection, just like the third part, is too far removed from the series and ought to be avoided at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save a Classic. Don't See This.","review":"There are movies in our life that we all think should have never been made. I thought Alien 3 was one of them until I saw this one. This is by far junk meant to cash in on a franchise that should have died with the original Ripley in the lead foundry at the end of Alien 3. Honestly folks, lets chat about how bad the concept was.The bad guy corporation was able to recover enough DNA from the burning lead to develop both a Ridley and an Alien. Okay whatever. Then pixie Ryder turns out to be a super android-great.There are so many ways that this sucks, and I think there is no finer pair of SCI FI movies outside Star War and Empire than Alien and Aliens. This movie just hurts to watch because you realize that once again Hollywood has to find someway to separate you from your money; don't fall pray. Go buy the first two. Curl up with you signifgant other and polish of a big bowl of popcorn. Buy those classics before you spoil them by seeing this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for Alien 5.","review":"I am bordering on the chances of this film being saved by Alien 5. As it is, it stands alone, as a strange branch that does nothing for the first three, but starts the potential for a future set. At the moment I would say it's worth watching but only as a standard \\"blockbuster\\" style action film. The only familiar characters (while a bit modified) are the aliens, since Ripley has totally changed. I would have liked to see this film receive a great deal more in the way of improvements however. Why have the guy with superhuman shooting abilities? Why have the aliens so easy to kill? Why have the spaces so open, taking away any sense of suspense? Why not tidy up the science? Why not improve the script, and clean up the acting? Why not have more POINT to the android character being there? I could go on.P>Let's have a new film, please! A sequel to save this! Let's not end it on this potentially sour note!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This film is terrible, stay far away!","review":"Did we really need yet another Alien film to be released after the third? No, but we got one anyway, and what we got was a horrible movie with a lackluster plot and the result is a tired and worn-out franchise. I didn't mind the first Alien, the second one was amazing, the third was alright, and Alien Resurrection is just plain bad. I must have been drunk when I bought this thing, because I haven't watched it since the first time I took it out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ideas but a disgrace","review":"As a great fan of the truly awesome Alien series, I was highly disappointed by the 4th installment. There are some good ideas, like the idea of cloning Ripley (first off, how is this possible when she is melted in molten metal in Alien3) as a way to bring back the Alien race to study them for science. That's the only real good idea of this movie, because from that point on it gets really stupid.Sigourney Weaver's acting seems incrediably forced (it was rumored she wanted no part in the 4th installment but was persuaded by a large sum of money-10+ million) as does all the rest of the acting. Character development is poor and the range of characters is weird. If its its own movie its okay, but compared to the other Alien movies its a waste of time and money.This is sad because the director is really talented (CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, AMELIE, DELICATESSUN) and so are most of the actors. So I suggest watching the first three, and if you're interested, watch the 4th..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't recommend this one","review":"While this movie contained a reasonable storyline, and its FX were ok, I feel this movie totally wrecked the entire Alien series. Ripley being brought back after 200 years by cloning, coming out as half-alien herself, was just too strange. It was an ok movie, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone who hasn't seen the other three. While the characters are original and the actors did play their parts well, I thought while watching this movie that it put a bad ending on a good series of movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember to close the cargo bay hatch!","review":"This is as visually impressive as you would expect from the director of The City of Lost Children, but the genius behind the Alien series has been sadly lost. The characters are nearly all stereotypes we've seen before in the first movie and two sequels, and the plot twist about Winona Ryder's character is old, too.The reason the first two Alien films were so brilliant and the last two were so rubbish was that the directors wisely concentrated on quick editing and darkness to hide the aliens from full view. In Alien 3 and this, the special effects are flaunted too much and there is no sense of mystery or menace.By the way, a small tip for any characters in future Alien movies: IT'S IN THE CARGO BAY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"By far the worst of the 4","review":"I was always an Alien fan.The first two are great movies,and the third is my favorite.I went to see this and I was like \\"huh?\\". I always thought the Alien movies were supposed to be dark and menacing,not comical. Black humor is always welcome in these dark movies,but the silly pop-culture jokes in AR are woefully out of place. That's not the worst of it though. Sometimes the scenes meant to be dramatic/scary are laughable (the piece of brain scene,the death of the nerdy scientist scene,the whole dopey newborn scene). The reason why this doesn't get a 1 star is that I liked a few of the characters. Brad Dourif as Gediman was delightfully weird,and Michael Wincott and Ron Pearlman were cool and likable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome flick!","review":"This movie is very entertaining. It is much more modern-day than the first 3. I think this really shines through them all. When Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver : Aliens 3, Aliens) gets resurrected from the dead by some pretty stupid scientists all hell breaks lose. It is breeding season for her, and guess what? She has babies, easily. They are in space so who knows what could happen next? Will they all die? Or will they manage to fight the aliens with all their power?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as others think","review":"This movie is highly underrated by others. I think its one of the best 2 of the series, behind Aliens. Good story, great special effects, great action sequences. It deserves 4 stars, or at LEAST more than 3 of them, same with Alien 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proper Return To form","review":"After the dymsmall Alien 3 release, I had my resverations about Alien: Resurrection. To my surpise though the film was a lot of a fun and the directors cut is better than the oringail film. The script by Joss Wheldon is one of the best in the series and both Sigourney and Wionna give great performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part 2 was better, heck should've really ended with 3.","review":"While this movie is nice for just a popcorn flick, this series really should have just ended with 3. While I could enjoy the movie for what it was, which is why I'm giving this a 4 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should have stopped at 3!!!!","review":"This was a movie that should not have been made!!!! They had a very good ending to the series with Alien 3(even though it was not nearly as good as the first 2). Besides the fact that this movie ruins arguably the best sci-fi triology, the DVD has next to no extra's. I highly reccomend not purchasing this movie and perhaps even pretending that it does not exist, to save the integerity of the first three movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst entry of the Alien series","review":"Some people call it art because it's French. Other people think it is terrible, because it is. Alien Resurrection tread hitherto unexplored ground: a sequel worse than Alien3. How did they manage it? Horrible, absolutely horrible, dialogue. Insane lame-brained plot that makes no sense whatsoever. Overacting abound. Bad special effects (you'd think they'd get that part right, since they spent the most money on it, but no). Aliens that dodge bullets. Why even mention the insipid \\"child\\" thing? In case you forgot, this creation used to be the worst character in cinematic history before it was replaced by Jar Jar Binks. Remember, kiddies, just because a French art director made some good movies a long time ago doesn't mean he still makes good movies now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's hope this is the last of the Alien series.","review":"I would like to warn all of you with weak stomachs, don't even think about watching this movie. This is, perhaps, the most violent movie that I have ever seen. I found it even more violent than Saving Private Ryan. Alien Resurrection is not interested in telling a story, the film seems only interested in grossing you out with unnecessary violence. Resurrection seems to be saying, \\"You thought that last scene was gross, this next scene is even more violent and gross.\\" Hopefully this is the last Alien film."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the point?","review":"Ok i dont know bout the rest of you, but the 4th film reallysucked. Winona wasnt made for the part, and the rest of the characterswere cheesy.The story was really stupid as well. Alien 3 was far more original with atmosphere and charaters even the music. This one just didnt have anything really going for it. And the ending is messed up too. wow.In other words, this one isnt really about aliens, its more about weaver and winona. We hardly see any aliens. Im hoping the next alien film will be directed by someone other then this guy. Cause ripley died in the 3rd and it should be left at that. And also that new characters should be introduced, like in the books such as aliens: earth hive.If you are a fan of movies with action, this might work. But hard core alien fans should just skip this one and rent alien 3 instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only they had 0 stars","review":"First off, I would like it known that I am a hardcore Alien fan and as a fan I was thoroughly insulted by this fourth installment. every critic complains about Alien 3 but I enjoyed it immensely and it was obviously better than this swill. What I hated most about this sequel was the mutilation of the Aliens. They are what draws people to the films, they are completely menacing and terrifying. The one in Alien 3 personified this completely but in this one the Aliens are slow and hardly ever move! What was the meaning behind that (bad script, director are my answers). it is just sad watching this movie, because i was watching the whole franchise sink down the toilet. I do know that an Alien 5 is being written and has the go-ahead to be made and from what I heard about the script I think I'm better off watching my toilet function. So sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst alien films ever made.","review":"Number one this movie was a flop number two this has been done before , number 3 we hope there will be no Alien 5.And number 4 this is worse then Alien3 and even thats not saying much, terrible excuse for alien movie waste of tax dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"I cant understand how anyone could rate this movie higher then 1 star. Everything about this movie su**ed. Bad effects, bad script, bad story, bad acting, and tons of just plain stupid c**p. Next time some studio wants to piss millions down the toilet just right the check to me and ill put it to better use."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's been done before","review":"The previous three Alien movies each tried to do something different: the first (and best by far) was a horror flick, the second an action rollercoaster and the third a dark thriller. I enjoyed all three to some degree, by having seen the others there is no need to see this, since it's mostly the same premise and plot line - company wants to keep alien, alien escapes, Ripley leads a bunch of people to freedom whilst they get picked off one by one along the way. On it's own, for me there are too many stereo-typical characters and one-liners, and Wynona doesn't have any screen presence at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"beyond horrible!!!","review":"I am one of the biggest fans of aliens movies, but I was very disappointed with this one. The whole cast is terrible and so is the plot. The only thing that saves this picture are some solid action scenes but that's about it. If you thinking about buying this one, rent it first!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst films of all time","review":"I tried watching this again to see if I might like it the second time around....I didn't. In fact, I actually hated it more. This list of bad mistakes and stupid ideas are legendary. For example; one idiot get the little jaw for the alien on the back of his head. The fool just stands there and feels the back of his head. Then he looks at his fingers, crosses his eyes and then dies. This alone is unforgivable. Believe it or not, the film is loaded with even more retarded ideas. One was having some guy in a wheel chair. Who thoughtthis crap up? If you want to waste some of your life, don't buy this, just rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE SUCKS","review":"I'm tellin you do not rent or buy this movie. it is the worst and give a HUGE descrace to the fanchise. Allthough i have'nt seen Alien 3 i hear from people that it would've been the best place to stop. What ever you do, DO NOT BUY OR RENT OR EVEN TOUCH THIS MOVIE. I rented this from my local library and a regreted it. THIS MOVIE IS cow $H!T"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Plot, Worst Characterization","review":"This movie is utterly ridiculous, and it cheapens the previous three episodes. The story \\"resurrects\\" Ripley after her death in the last film, making her sacrifice in Alien 3 for nothing.The worst aspect, though, would have to be the characterization. Unlike the first three movies, in which the interplay of the characters supplemented their struggle against the aliens, the characters in Resurrection are two-dimensional, crude, and wholly unlikeable. I wanted all of them to die; everything about them is underdeveloped and unsophisticated.If you're feeling self-sadistic, you should watch this film together with Jason X and then down a bottle of aspirin."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP Ripley","review":"May the Alien franchise Rest In Peace. With a very thin story line, questionable acting, and marginal special effects, this movie is a little less than entertaining!Of the franchise, Aliens will remain the classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What HAPPENED to this series?","review":"Another one of those situations where they have a great franchise (Aliens), which great people working on it (Ryder, Weaver, Jeunet, et al), but still manage to come up with a bad, bad movie. Aliens3 might not have been great, but it at least had some interesting visual style going for it. This... does not. The nonsensical plot, poor costume/design choices, and silly ending ensure that this one is fit only for watching some neat FX and a few fun scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Was From The Director Of Ameile?!","review":"Yuck. This is the worse of the Alien series. And it is from the director of one of the best films ever made, Ameile From Montmarte. It is cheaply done, filled with B-Movie lines. Those lines can wreck the movie like it did to the second Mortal Kombat. If you are a perfectionist, get this. But if you don't want to watch a movie, don't get this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yelch. This movie [is bad].","review":"I was a big fan - a BIG fan of the first film, thought the second was great and the third enjoyable more in it's own right. This one though, should be put on the back of a truck and pushed down a sharp slope. Put quite simply - THIS MOVIE [is bad]. The only thing that made me watch it to the end was that it was a part of the Alien series. That's it. It has boring characters (even Ripley has nothing to make her interesting since she does nothing but sniff people and mumble), nothing scary about the aliens, just nothing, forget it. Try looking out of the window instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A laugher!","review":"I couldnt help but laugh at some of the scenes. Especially the love scenes between Ripley and the Alien.I kept wondering when the camera's would pan back and we would see the Science Theater 3000 characters making jokes as the movies ran.The plot was absurd and dialog even worse.Alien and Aliens are some of the finest sci fi out there. Too bad the studios got greedy and lazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"love ressurection","review":"This movie had scenes not published in the movie before, and the high definition made it super suspensful.

No thank you. Instead of making Wynona a MORE advanced synthetic, she's LESS advanced. they were synthetic humans for both Alien and Aliens. now they're mechanical robots? that sounds like a step BACKWARD...oh well I'll calm down on my bashing of this rubbish and let you decide for yourself I guess..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody should have said 'enough'.","review":"This movie plays more like a comic book than anything else.The ONLY redeeming quality is the aliens themselves. So, if you're into special effects, watch it only for that.Poor story, weak acting and lack of direction make this a waste. The only one of the alien series I found to be worse was Alien vs. Predator... they really should be ashamed of themselves. Neither this one nor vs. predator even have 'B' movie quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Alien3, and better than the critics say","review":"Ripley's back, cloned to create alien-human hybrid offspring by (that familiar trope) recklessly overreaching scientists, in the Alien series's conclusive fourth installment. I don't count the Alien-versus-Predator travesties. Director Jeunet brings his regular players Dominique Pinon and Ron Perlman for just the right mix of quirkiness to go along with the doomsday bleakness. Sigourney Weaver conveys the darker note of a woman who's come back from torment and death.Conventional wisdom says Alien films declined in quality by installment, but I disagree. Resurrection is clearer and more engaging than Three by a wide margin, and better than the naysayers say."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only thing that Aliens 4 should have started with was...","review":"....Ripley waking up realising that Alien 3 was just a bad dream! Then have a face hugger drop down and infect someone on the space station where they are docked in orbit above earth. She saves the day keeping the aliens from getting to earth, but not before all those company idiots get cocooned and chest bursting justice is served on all of them. Jeez, I should have been a rich executive producer/director, I could have made a ton of money for the studio instead of the lame amount those two flops of movies made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bizarr and strange, but awesome...","review":"Jean-Pierre Jeunet is one of my favorite directors because his style is unlike the predictable and awful vision of Hollywood directors. This is a great and bizarr vision of Alien and the killing of the alien being sucked through the window hole is terrifyingly great. Sigourney Weaver is as usual flawless."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could anybody like this?","review":"This was long and boring and dull acting! I didn't even realize that Weaver was in this. That's too bad! She's a good actress too! Wasting talent on this! Ryder {stinks} even more in this then in Girl, Interupted. This movie was stupid, long and boring! Better then Aliens, but it {stunk}!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Resurrection Cannot Revive The Alien &#65533;Franchise&#65533;","review":"THE ALIEN FRANCHISE IS DEAD. Why do they keep bringing Ripley back anyway? I mean, didn't they go out of their way to kill her in the last terrible Alien movie?

The cartoony Alien and it's ITCHY AND SCRATCHY death scene was unforgivable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie, wery bad movie","review":"Its no surprise that this was the least popular Alien movie. The other 3 movies were all a bit similar, Alien 3 was not a good film but at least it looked like the other films.This movie is compleetly diffrent from the other alien movies. Its weird and not beliveble. The aliens are not cool in this one and are often made with wery bad visual effects.Dont see this film. Not even once, if you have not seen Alien 1 and 2 then by all means see them. They are a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't believe the Hype...","review":"Let me start off with - Go buy the 4 DVD collection instead of buying the singles. This series has to be the one of the best science fiction trilogies ever. Number 4 was pushing it a bit, although the film is good. Alien3 is by far the best movie in the series. The birth of the alien from the dog along with the cremation of Newt and Hicks is one of the most intense seens ever. In terms of the even numbered action films, the director's uncut version is the best one of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALIEN RESERRECTION IS AWSOME!!!![....]","review":"This is the very best of the alien movies [...].

With your favorite ripley back again as you have never seen her in the other movies she has super strength acid blood and even a bond with the aliens. Even I am only 12 I still think this is [great]. SO IF YOU LIKE GORE GORE AND MORE THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU. Also I HEARD THAT THERE WILL BE AN ALIEN 5 SO BE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR MORE TO COME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotional sledgehammer. Ick.","review":"This could easily be a decent enough movie, except I think one rather serious mistake was made. Jeunet, though I'm not familiar with his previous work, certainly seems to be very good at evoking emotions and imagery. The problem is he does it far too often here. EVERYTHING is emphasized and made to be a highstrung emotional event, no matter what the event or what the emotion. Because of this, the movie ends up like an emotional sledgehammer (\\"*ANGRY!* *MEAN!* *SAD!* *TRAGIC!* *DRAMATIC!*\\"), and quickly becomes a real strain to watch, especially since the actors seem to really have to stretch to present the story in this fashion.This *could* have been a very good movie, if a little restraint had been employed. As it is, it takes a lot of effort to watch. (One of my friends is partially autistic, and even he couldn't stomach the sledgehammer.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good action thriller","review":"This is one of my favorite political action thrillers. In addition to the good cast (Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman, Rachel Weisz, Brian Cox, etc.), the storyline is one which applies just as much today as it did 20 years ago, illustrating that greed and political expediency invariably seem to get the upper hand over real solutions. The film depicts a story wherein a clean, inexpensive alternative energy form is discovered -- but getting it out to the world for practical applications is the problem. Along the way there is lots of action, and good plot twists and turns. If you like this genre, you will enjoy this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"It was a real pleasure to see a movie that was excellently written.

I don't want to sound like a Puritan here, but come on! They shouldn't need a science advisor on the set to know something as simple as this ... all they need is somebody with a high school education.Having said that, the movie wasn't completely worthless. After I got over my initial irritation during the first ten minutes, I sort of got into the movie. Some of the chases were sort of fun, and the special effects were pretty cool. Morgan Freeman is always cool, even if he seems to play pretty much the same character in every movie. Keanu Reeves did a marginal job, which for him is an improvement (we all love the guy, but even he knows that he can't act).Near the end, there is more of the weird hydrogen combustion - nuclear fusion, which brought back initial irritation.

Combining suspense, chases and a plot that never tells why until the end, this is one of those films that keep its audiences entertained, tuned in, and waiting on the edge of their seat holding their breath for what comes next. Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz, while being an unlikely pair of love interests, have a chemistry unmatched by many others, and they play their characters to perfection. The special effects, when required, work very well, though sometimes one can tell the difference between reality and wizardry. But this movie still remains a true action thriller, and I recommend it to all who saw Speed, whether they liked Speed or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah Reaction","review":"I had no recall of this film despite the pedigree of director Andrew Davis and stars Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman, Brian Cox, and Rachel Weisz.

At times Davis channels some of the inspiration from his masterwork, \\"The Fugitive\\", but all for naught because it's wasted in this pointless exercise.

The instructions say,this is the same as saying \\"over\\". However I would rather say it myself than listen to this same squeaky voices over and over. Plus,you can't talk until the princesses are finished talking. My 4 year old granddaughter didn't like this feature either. She has used our regular walkie talkies and liked them better. This excessive chatting of the princesses is unnecessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for parents","review":"I purchased these for my oldest son last year for christmas. We use them almost everyday. When he goes out with his friends bike riding or just playing in the neighborhood I can keep in contact with him. He feels like he has freedom and I know I can talk to him whenever I need to. He loves the disney design and they work really really well. Great investment. They have many different disney characters that alert him when I am calling. The volume control is great and I can reach him when he is pretty far away.

In short I lost my cynicism and came away with a different opinion on the subject. What did I discover? The telephone psychic biz serves a genuine function in our culture; helping people access the mystical and magical side of life as an alternative approach to problem solving. I also developed a solid understanding of how astrology and the tarot work. And WHY they work. The author really knows his metaphysical subjects well and elaborates on them with just the right mix of knowledge, humor and psychological insight. Considering the topic, this is a smart, spunky and wry book -- not at all cynical -- and a real page turner to boot. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The author appears to lack self-awareness.","review":"This book had all the raw materials to be a \\"Great Shamu\\"-like expose of the telephone psychic industry. Instead, the author piously recited the dogmas of astrology, the tarot, and the like. He must have realized on some level that his \\"psychic\\" powers were really intuition and knowledge of human nature and that the star signs and tarot cards were merely a peg on which to hang his observations. But no such thoughts made their way into the book.To give just one example, did he really need to deal the eight of cups out of a tarot deck to see the future of one caller's relationship with a married man? If he had used a different deck and dealt the four of diamonds or the \\"Get out of jail free\\" card, how different would his reading have been?Also, the book has a chapter entitled \\"How to Call a Psychic and Not Go Broke.\\" Given that the book has a copyright date of 1998, the list of scams has some startling omissions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title is very misleading...","review":"I picked up this book thinking it would include stories of people who called the psychic network.

Chicago was to me a real let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily one of the best Musicals","review":"This movie had every right to the best oscar award when it won it in 2003. Besides Zellweger, every person in this cast gave the performance of their life. Zeta-Jones overpowered in this to prove her magnificent voice, and Gere was surprising good as well. Even the smaller roles of Latifya and Reilley gave a powerful perfomance to really prove their stuff. Anyone who says that Moulon Rouge was a better movie has very bitter taste and must have fallen asleep in both or are deaf.

Although I still don't think that Richard Gere can really dance, I do believe he did an excellent job of convincing the audience that he actually can and did.

Renee Zellweger should have gotten the oscar for best actress for Chicago. Her acting is so vulnerable and fascinating, she is not like any other actress nowadays. Her singing is great, boy i was pleasantly surprised, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere are great as well. Fabulous dance numbers, catchy songs, and a superb directing job by Rob Marshall. The audio commentary is also very good. I love the numbers, All that Jazz, Cell Block Tango, and Roxie. It is fast paced, has a solid storyline, and excellent tap dance number by Gere.

And why is it that SO many boring, and strange, movies are nominated for Oscars all the time? It just doesn't make any since! The Lord of the Rings and The Pianist were the ONLY two good movies nominated for Oscars. Chicago got its share of VERY undeserved Oscars. This is the worst movie of 2002!

These actors (they're actors, not singers) cannot sing to save their lives, and the lyrics sure don't help.

Fred Astaire used to insist that the camera shoot him full length. Most of the other great film dancers did, too. But here, instead of dancing -- instead of Bob Fosse -- we get a lot of actors in various postures, and constant cutting by the director. It's like shooting a Shakespeare soliloqy: (wide shot) \\"To be\\" (close-up) \\"or\\" (medium tilt from Hamlet's shoes) \\"not to be...\\" That wouldn't allow much scope for acting. And \\"Chicago\\" doesn't display much dancing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Razzle Dazzle me!","review":"I'm reading the reviews of others and find that this movie is being compared to Moulin Rouge. I personally think that these two movies should not be compared in the least. They are very different, although BOTH are musicals, this is all they share.Chicago has a great story, great acting, great singing (I agree with most critics - Catherine Zeta-Jones has a great singing voice and Renee isn't as good, but isn't that her character as well folks?) and great customes etc. They really razzle dazzle us with great music, great satyre (sp?) on the press and legal system of the day, which hasn't changed much and parallels today's court rooms.Folks this is an awesome movie and for those of you who are concentrating on the lack of voice training on Ms. Zellwegers and Mr. Gere's part, let us consider the voices of Ms. Kidman and Mr. McGregor. Not great either of them, but good enough and still entertaining. That's what this is, not a world statement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Musical!","review":"If you're not really into musicals, you should still give \\"Chicago\\" a chance. I love this movie! Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones are fantastic. The dancing is incredible, especially the Cell Block Tango. Queen Latifah, Taye Diggs and Richard Gere round out an awesome cast.

They are all good voices, mind you, they just run out of room quickly (QueenL of course rocks).But it is just an overall lack of building as the movie progresses...it all unfolds and is revealed right away (on a sight and sound level), so there is just nowhere to go dynamically.Juxtaposing tragedy, and a song about tragedy, in a wildly entertaining performance is a very cool trippy idea.The story itself just seems too trite and trodden."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Has it All Coming!","review":"While ruined by the boy next to me in French who can't seem to stop singing the songs, Chicago is a great movie with excellent songs and dancing.

The only bright spot of the movie is Renée Zellweger, truely a great performance (and I am not even a Zellweger fan) however, Richard Gere's performance is way over done. He really needs to get some more acting lessions under his belt or perhaps it's due to a weak script.I purchased the DVD expecting a lot more from a movie that won 6 Acadamy Awards including Best Picture and I am going to promptly sell this turkey back.I do not recommend this movie, if you have to see it, rent it.

Everybody else had no character to speak of, and if you really can't root for the main characters, then how can you enjoy the film? Had the characters been written as seedy and flawed, yet somehow portrayed by the actors as likeable and human, then that would have been amazing acting. But I found them all to be superficial and sleazy. And I found myself thinking they deserved to go to jail!Maybe the play was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"I have to admit - I couldn't sit through the whole thing. We skipped through the middle and most of the musical numbers (most of which were terrible).Since there were no \\"good guys\\" in this movie, I just hoped that justice would prevail. It didn't. Just a bunch of rotten folks ruining their lives and taking others and singing up a storm about it. The only one in this movie who can really sing is Queen Latifah, and her talent was wasted in this film.And the acting - AWFUL! So amateurish and over-the-top. It was like watching a macabre human cartoon.I am both amazed and utterly disappointed that a film like this could win an Oscar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"I bought this DVD based on its numerous awards and great ratings and reviews by well known personalities.

You just can't trust the academy awards anymore I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated movie with overrated cast","review":"This movie completely sucked.

I just love Blu Ray disc!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish - Exciting - Mesmerizing!","review":"This movie musical has all the right elements to make it a timeless treasure to be viewed over and over again. It's a great tongue in cheek look at Gangsters, Crime, Jazz, and Liquor prohibition of the Roaring 20's and how America and our Justice System dealt with these \\"Evils\\".Every cast member gives 150% of talent, sweat and bravado - The entire movie is filled with high spirited and entertaining song and dance numbers. There are no dull spots to muddle through between musical numbers, just witty dialogue to keep the plot moving.This is a great film to have on DVD - a real treasure!Two of my favorite musical numbers are The Cell Block Tango and the Ventriloquist Scene.TWO THUMBS UP!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Musical Speaks the TRUTH!","review":"In movies, we see the prince carrying the princess away on a horse as they head toward the sunset... but. You never find out what happens to them after that! How do the authors now they will live happily ever after? This is a continuation of a fairy tale. Only it shows reality. It shows history of the Roaring '20's at their most exciting moment. This musical shows more than excitment, it shows reality, but adding music to it makes the audience have more of a comical impression of a serious situation. It also relaxes some people, because Roxie speaks to the bad girl/boy in all of us. This musical truly speaks for itself, and it helps us realize how much our decision affect us, and helps us learn how many people are affect as well. Beautiful musical, full of fun and comical suspence! I love it!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A musical??","review":"I decided to rent this atrocity only because it received the best picture Oscar and was expecting something better. What the hell all the hype is over is beyond me. I'm a Generation X'er and this must be a nostalgia trip for the Baby Boomers or something. I can't stand musicals and this tried I guess to be a good drama mixed in with singing and dancing? It didn't do anything for me. I turned it off after about 15 minutes.

It's badly written and the terrible characters don't help. Can't believe I actually watched the whole thing. I did enjoy the razzle dazzle song but the movie is just not worth it.

I bought it and it was a waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm.","review":"All I've heard about this film was positive, and today I finally went to see it. My friend and I were both disappointed though. Other than John C. Reilly and Richard Gere, I felt the film was poorly casted. It just didn't 'grab' me like other's.

While Renée Zellweger did a good job holding up her role, Catherine Zeta Jones totally tanked, and who in the world cast Richard Gere? He was god-awful in the part of Billy Flynn.There are those who can sing and dance and there are those who can't and this movie proves that. Gere couldn't carry a tune, and for all of the major characters there were \\"stunt dancers\\" that were way too obvious in the final cut. It's a shame.The lesson of this film is this: if you can't sing the part, if you can't dance the part, don't take the part. Gwen Verdon and Bob Fosse are roling in their graves, and I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"SleepToChicago","review":"I must be from another planet.I've read so many great reviews of \\"Chicago\\".I LOVED \\"Cabaret,\\"Loved the music from the play I heard over the years,Loved Fosse's work,but HATE THIS FILM.Its HORRIBLE.If your having trouble sleeping at night,buy this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"3rd Best Musical movie ever!","review":"Chicago although is a very good musical but MOULIN ROUGE WAS FAR BETTER and SOUND OF MUSIC WAS BETTER THAN BOTH OF THEM do not forget the best family oscar winning movie out of the list!Chicago has it's original songs but it was a bit dark and Moulin Rouge!didn't have any original song I think besides COME WHAT MAY and Moulin Rouge! was so colorful it's so nice,superb! spectacular spectacular!if Chicago won Best Picture this should have won!Remember Chicago fans Moulin Rouge was the whole reason why Chicago was made and won Best Picture they honored the Best picture to Chicago because they didn't let MOULIN ROUGE WIN!

Still thought that Seabiscuit should've won. 2.5/10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Hollywood -- No More Musicals!!!","review":"After suffering through this waste of celluloid, and reading some of the outrageous reviews here, I came to the following conclusion: This movie can be enjoyed only by (1)angry, man-hating white feminists (2)limp-wristed liberal white men, and (3)gaie men. For the vast majority of normal, hard working Americans, this piece of pop trash was a waste of the price of admission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gwen Verdon is spinning in her grave!","review":"I didn't get to see this movie when it was in the theatres, but I already knew that Gwen Verdon won a Tony for the broadway version in the 1970's. So I checked it out from the video store for me and my grandfather to watch. I'm almost 22, and I was glad when this movie was over, but my grandfather was gladder. Gwen Verdon's musical is trashed in this God Awful film. The movie version is about a woman who kills her abusive husband, (who probably deserved it) and is put in jail and threatened execution and the night club that she sings with makes fun of her with music. As you may know, Gwen Verdon died of a heart attack in the winter of 2000 and if she could have seen this film, she would have been APPALLED! Get \\"Damn Yankees,\\" instead. This film is only for people who enjoy offensive musicals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-hyped, Overblown, Overrated","review":"This movie narrowly beat out \\"About Schmidt\\" for the poorest excuse for entertainment I have experienced this year. Cynicism and satire have saturated Hollywood and a sane person can only take so much. The costumes and choreography were not bad, but the acting and singing were sub-par (save for Queen Latifah's sterling performance). Obviously, I am in the minority for disliking this movie, but it was just not my cup of tea. In the future I will use a little more discretion in renting moview that the critics and the Academy rave over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical musical - DUMB","review":"Movie musicals are usually dumb anyway but this one takes the cake. The girls are murderers and I didn't like any of them. Watch one of the many classics with Gene Kelly instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good as a Musical but Fails as a Story","review":"Chicago was visually beautiful, well performed, and displayed some top-rate editing and directing. But ultimately, a movie needs to stand on its story.This story is not only cynical, simplistic and unsympathetic--its also flawed. The characters were all very unsympathetic and corrupt--the only two redeemable ones getting shafted or executed. A story doesn't have to be uplifting or happy to be good. But it does have to be complete. The fact that Roxie's devoted husband just sort of meanders and disappears into the night is a violation of story-telling on the highest order.I'm indifferent to musicals--I'll state that upfront. And yet, comparing Chicago to Moulan Rouge, I have to say that I'm shocked at the number of awards Chicago won. Moulan Rouge seemed superior to this movie in every way to the eyes of this layperson.Ultimately, it was a movie I could respect, but not love."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Big, It's Beautiful, It's Chicago...Not Moulin Rouge!","review":"This movie pops off the screen. My jaw hurt from smiling so much. The acting is superb, the story is superb, the singing is superb, the art direction is superb.If you loved Moulin Rouge! (as I did) you will love Chicago. If you hated Moulin Rouge! you will Love Chicago.One of the best movies all year (in many years)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"The negative reviews below are mind-boggling. I've now seen \\"Chicago\\" 4 times and each time I watch it I am still blown away. I can't wait to watch it again. Being a fan of the Broadway show, I was very skeptical when I first learned of the casting. However, the two female leads do a phenomenal job, especially Catherine Zeta-Jones. The singing, dancing, choreography and acting are all fantastic. If you're not a fan of big production numbers, then \\"Chicago\\" isn't for you. But if you enjoy musicals, especially stage based, then \\"Chicago\\" is sure to please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Hat","review":"I wish I had seen this film before Moulin Rouge.That innovative musical made this one seem stale and old hat. It should have been made in the 50s. The film seems so delighted at poking fun at Chicago and its corrupt justice system -- jeez, that was fresh when Hecht and MacArthur wrote The Front Page three-quarters of a century ago. Now, after their masterpiece (and Roxy Hart, Some Like It Hot and dozens of other films) its premise is stale, stale stale. And unlike Moulin Rouge, which used an equally stale plot to re-invigorate the way movie musicals were presented, Chicago's staging was an stale as its story line.The musical numbers might have been staged by Vincent Minelli ... I didn't find anything fresh or innovative or even memorable.I was shocked that Renee Zellwegger's blah performance was on Oscar. At least she was better than Richard Gere -- what a disasterous performance.I didn't really hate this movie ... I was merely bored by it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative Musical Vehicle","review":"All the world really is a stage with Renée Zellweger's portrayal of an aspiring nightclub singer trying to beat a murder rap. The climax spawns an unnecessary subplot, but good Jazz-Age numbers as metaphors for her predicament, plus solid acting make for a film any Roaring 20's buff would want to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"lots of talent, but film is too dark and slow","review":"First, I love all of the stars in this movie. Richard Gere (since American Gigolo), Renée Zellweger and Queen Latifa are all favorites of mine. I had never seen Catherine Zeta-Jones, but I was impressed with her talent, too. It was very cool to see them together in a musical because, other than QL, I had no idea that they all had song & dance type talent. So, for that reason, I guess that I am glad to have seen \\"Chicago.\\"Despite the raw talent that was oozing from the screen, my discontent with this movie lies in two facts. It moves (way)too slowly, and it is VERY dark in both appearance and in subject matter. I even caught myself nodding off a few times.... I would not watch it again.If you want to see a gripping musical, watch Moulin Rouge."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a well-done film but...","review":"I am pleased to see the revival of the musical, but I have real problems with \\"Chicago\\". My problem is very basic - for any show to appeal to me, it has to resonate at some level. Especially with a musical, there should be someone in it you can either identify with or would invite into your home. The only sympathetic character is Roxie's husband, but I'd invite him in just out of pity. All through the \\"Razzle Dazzle\\" number, all I could think of was Johnny Chochran - and no, I wouldn't invite him in either.A good show about terrible people just isn't enough for me - and I remain totally underwhelmed by Renee Zellwegger."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMIGOD .. one of the best movies EVER? Possibly!!!","review":"I really can't put into words how much I enjoyed this movie. I won't go into the story as you can pick that up from the other reviews here and across the country.I'll just say that this is a fun, brash, exciting, phenomenal film that I won't soon forget. Catherine Zeta-Jones BLEW me away!! She is amazing and has a great voice. Of course, she's also sexier than you can imagine.One of the things I enjoyed the most about this film was the dancing/choreography. The few musicals that have been relased over the last few years (\\"Evita\\", \\"Moulin Rouge\\") were great, but, they didn't have much dancing in them. The dance numbers in this film are superb.Do yourself a favor .. catch \\"Chicago\\". I'm going to be seeing it again!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST MOVIE MUSICAL EVER!!!","review":"Chicago. Some people think it's sexy, cynical and depressing as hell. Not me. It's an exiting and beautifully done film. Cathrine Zeta-Jones shines and she really deserved the Oscar. Renee Zellwegger is good. She's the only one I could ever picture playing Roxie. And last but not least, Richard Gere. When I first found out he ws playing Billy Flynn, I thought...OH MY GOD! He's gonna screw up the whole film. I was wrong. Gere is wonderful and It is a shame he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar. Queen Latifa is great! John C. Reily is superb. Christine Barinsky reminds me of my principle, Mrs. Becker, but hey she was just great! Chicago is a great film! You'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And All That Jazz!","review":"chiCago, what can i say this has to be one of the best movies of all time. Not only does it have an all-star cast it has great musical numbers but it was nominated for 13 Oscars!Chicago is about a aspiring preformer (ROXIE-Zellwegger)living in chiCago in the 1920's. When she shoots someone she goes to jail where she meets some amazing people. Not only does she meet Mrs. Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones)but meets Billie Flynn (Gere)the best murder case lawyer. When Roxie sits in jail she visions all these Razzle Dazzle musical numbers including ROXIE & WHEN YOUR GOOD TO MAMA. Will she be guilty or let off? Find out in chiCago and it will really Razzle Dazzle you.All the actors are amazing and their singing skills are unbelievable who knew Rene Zellwegger or Richard Gere could belt out those tunes. I can't wait to see what the DVD offers (special features) and i bet you in the first week my DVD will be burned out and i'll have to buy a new one. LOL."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay","review":"I just don't get what the hype is all about. It's a movie that features the biggest stars of our time and I just feel like the media made it into a much bigger deal than it should have been. I didn't really like the characters because their not worth rooting for. One is a manipulator and the other a murderer and they got rewarded for it. Why would I want to root for those kind of people? I dunno, I just didn't like it but that's just me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hate musicals, hate Jazz, LOVED CHICAGO!","review":"I hate musicals and jazz. From the first second, I loved Chicago.

Chicago isn't just a musical now it's a movie masterpeice , the cast are superb.Renee is just adorable is Roxie and her voice is suited to the role, Richard is fantastic as Billy with his crooning voice and tap dancing he should of got an oscar nomination! and then Catherine .... She was made to be Velma this is her role no if's and's or but's an amazing performance and a very well deserved oscar for her.All in all if you like musicals or even if you don't I think you will love it as much as I did. With it's great performances and amazing music you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best film musical in YEARS!","review":"I saw the original \\"Chicago\\" on Broadway with Gwen Verdon, Chita Rivera and Jerry Orbach and it was absolutely incredible. Well, now I can say this filmed version is that and more. Zeta-Jones, Zellwegger, Gere and Latifah are a perfect team for this crass and cynical movie. I'm glad they gave Rivera a cameo (why didn't they for Orbach?) and while I understand they had to cut the song \\"Class,\\" I would have liked to have heard it over the end credits (instead of the so-so \\"I Just Move On\\" which was specially written for that purpsoe). At least \\"Class\\" is on the soundtrack and it's even crasser and funnier than before with the addition of a certain lyric. This is a great musical (even bertter than \\"Moulan Rouge\\" which I liked) and I recommend it for all film fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Music","review":"I saw nothing on the cover to indicate this was mainly a musical. The minimal story line was squeezed in between 110 minutes of singing and dancing..... I would describe as \\"interpretive modern jazz\\".

Catherine Zeta-Jones is fantastic in this film... her abilites to sing and dance will never leave you in doubt that she is one great, beautiful and talented actress... This is by far her best role yet... Being a fan of Renee Zellweger's after Bridget Jones' Diary (another great film btw), I thought her role in Chicago didn't do much for her because it seemed to me that she played more of the supporting role instead of the lead role (seriously, Zeta-Jones brilliantly stole the movie)... nevertheless, Zellweger's \\"innocence\\" adds a nice contrast to Zeta-Jones' all-out vamp-like dancer character... the music and dancing is great!

I read the bad reviews on this site and could not disagree more. This is the Millieum and things change, maybe that was the complaint, but this movie is such a show stopper I can not see how someone could not enjoy this.

Fantastic music, production, acting, dance, sound, art design, photography, everything.The maturity of the cast is a testament to the care the makers took to reflect the snappy boards of yesteryear when music was half percussive precision, half soaring reeds and snappy brass. And all the artists had 10-20 years under their belts before they had the chance to strut their stuff big time.No need to compare this to other flicks. On the other hand, if you check out All That Jazz (1979 by Fosse who created the original 1970 Chicago stageplay) you will see dance and music reflected and even improved. And if you want to wriggle into major retro, Pajama Game (1954) is where Fosse got his creative start - and you can see the seeds of his genius.Any student of the genre will own this. Stage musical history is defined here."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie ever","review":"This movie was so awful it made no since. Everyone I was watching it with had no clue what was going on. We thought it would be better because we had watched Moulin Rouge and thought it was an awesome movie.

Not a chance...","review":"This picture is obnoxious and unbearable to watch on the screen. Show tunes do not translate well to the screen if you're dealing with subpar actors who are not veteran Theater performers. Watching \\"Singin' In The Rain\\" or any old musical where people are actually singing and dancing with such talent and prestige, no cut-away shots to mask the fact that there is no way in heck the leads could do what they're trying to manipulate, is what I miss. Gere and Zeta-Jones and Zelleweger couldn't sing or dance to save their lives, but thanks to modern technology we can edit a movie so much to make this bombastic mess, which helps them appear to know how to perform in a play-sorry, no thanks. The fact that this picture somehow stole the Best Picture from Lord of the Rings (a true masterpiece) is beyond me and makes the Oscars a joke in my opinion. I couldn't stand this hyper-anxious-cynical take on our world and I don't know why others can. Remember, that's just my two cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good God! Does the Academy think this was good???","review":"Given a choice between watching this movie again, and death, I think I'd choose the dirt nap. This thing was so horrible I couldn't stand it. They segue from a few scant seconds of dialogue into a horrible musical number every two minutes, and none of the songs or music advanced the plot in any way.I think I'd rather be forced to watch that Turkish Star Trek remake over and over before I ever see another minute of this film. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzz!!! What A Yawner!!!","review":"After being treated to last year's aural and visual treat, \\"Moulin Rouge\\", I must say that \\"Chicago\\" is a huge letdown. The only ray of light in this dismal production is Catherine Zeta-Jones in the role of Velma Kelly. She can sing, she can dance and she looks fabulous!Please beware of the reviews claiming that this is the greatest musical of all time. That's just flat-out ridiculous. As far as modern musicals go, both \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\" and \\"Moulin Rouge\\" run circles around \\"Chicago\\" for sheer energy and entertainment.How this film won Best Picture is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've never wanted to leave a theater so much","review":"See above.

Good God...who told this man he could sing and dance let alone act?The only saving grace of this movie if Queen Latifah, and that's only because she's mildly humerous.Catherine Zeta Jones was alright, but she didn't deserve and Oscar...and neither did this over rated piece of tripe.The movie is dark, depressing, and lacking any originality. I hated this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Overrated Film of 2002","review":"I don't understand how this film won the Oscar for Best Picture. I also believe that Moulin Rouge was a much better film. It's set design, costumes, music, choreography, cinematography, and camera movement were amazing and unlike anything I had seen before. Chicago, on the other hand, was extremely dull and the songs were painful to watch. Richard Gere should not be dancing, and Zeta-Jones is not very convincing as a dancer despite her dancing background! Renee Zellweger shines in any role she plays, but not enough to keep my interest throughout the whole movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chicago: City of weak shoulders","review":"An amazing achievement: A truly boring musical. All the choreography has been removed, replaced with quick camera cuts and distorted views. Slow and uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"I really don't understand all the hype about this movie. I am a personal fan of musicals, so its not the genre that bothered me. It is an entertainig and well executed movie, but not much beyond that. It sort of tricks you into thinking that its a good movie when really its quite flat. It has no message or theme, and you can't really come to care about the characters. 20 minutes after I had left the theater I had forgotten all about the movie, definitely a sign of a bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Waste of money","review":"Elaborate sets, noisy, lots of singing and dancing by people who could not sing or dance. I found myself groaning every time a music/dance number started. These routines seemed to drag, and were very repetitious. I don't understand all the raving about this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Not to Do a Movie Musical","review":"Take a premise that's based on tabloid journalism, mix it with a quasi-historical situation, and then stir with music. The result: Chicago. Forgettable songs surrounding a dubious plot, with poor acting and mediocre singing and dancing. It's a wonder this production even made it to the movie theaters.The dialogue was obviously meant to be cynical and sarcastic, making us aware of Americans' fickle obsession with celebrities, but it somehow ignores the racism, poverty, mob warfare and other maladies that were much more prevalent in the 1920's. The movie is lost in its own razzle-dazzle.If you want to see a movie musical with social commentary, I'd advise you to obtain Cabaret, where it's done right."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply horrendous","review":"I am halfway the film and it has been painful. Obviously Fosse was a dancer so the lyrics are far from great. The tunes are repetitive and there is NO DANCING. The roles acted by famous stars are lacking... I have seen these people act better in other movies. As you may suspect from the number of \\"used and new\\" of the DVDs listed here, this is a movie that had a lot of publicity that it did not deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicago is a musical and Moulin Rouge is a cabaret act","review":"To compare the two movies is ludicrous. Chicago is a musical based on Bob Fosse's work and Moulin Rouge is just a mishmash of different song types. None of the songs had anything to do with the time peroid. Renee Zellwegger and Catherine Zeta Jones did a great job as did Richard Gere. ... Chicago is not only a great movie but it also had a great soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Above Average Musical-Made-Movie","review":"I really don't understand all the hype and praise surrounding this movie. It is nothing new-- \\"Chicago\\" has been around in some form or another for 70 years or so. It is pretty much like every other musical I've seen, maybe a little better than average-- Entertaining, but not something that you will look back on for years to come. Even a movie like Forrest Gump, an imperfect movie that somehow won the Oscar, is more of a classic. Rent, don't buy, with low expectations, and you might be entertained. Just don't get sucked in by \\"all that jazz.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST FOR MUSICAL LOVERS","review":"I don't know why this hasn't been release in the US yet. I got a copy last week in Wellington, New Zealand. The extras are really good. There's a mini-doco about the origins on Chicago with interviews from some of the people involved in 1975. The extended musical scenes are put together combining shots from the movie with those at rehearsals. There are two special sections about Chita Rivera and Liza Minnelli. The feature itself and its commentary track is the same as the first one released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste precious hours out of your lifespan that you will never get back watching THIS","review":"That's NOT Entertainment, folks. The plot's thin even for a movie musical, with murderess Velma going to jail for murdering her lover interspersed with musical numbers meant to show her dream of being a jazz star. It's simply choppy and downright DUMB. Either make a murder mystery or a jazz musical....putting both together just doesn't work, especially with a character nobody should have any sympathy for...an adulteress and killer who is completely brainless to boot. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"GUYS BEWARE- -mother of all chick flicks","review":"GUYS- this movie is to be avoided at all costs, unless you love musicals. Any guy who walks into this unsuspecting, as I did, is in for 2 hours of hell. Only one guy gets shot in this movie, no nudity at all, and lots and lots and lots of singing and dancing. No car chases, no explosions, no shootouts... Definitely not a \\"man's\\" movie, and nothing you would talk to the guys at work about. You have been warned! Let the woman watch it while you give the lawn a 2 hour mowing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unmusiical","review":"The 1920's produced so much superb music in America.Sadly the music in Chicago sounds as if it's been generated by an abysmally programmed computer. No heart, no soul, no genuine period flavour.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep Dish","review":"If you like \\"show tunes\\" and like 'dressing up' for your special someone, you will love Chicago.Ladies--if you have run out of ways to torture your husband, take him to this grueller of a chick flick--This will get even with him for that last \\"golf outing\\" he went on and came home with lipstick on his pants.This one makes 'Cats' look like a Schwarzeneger movie....Fred"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME","review":"PLain and simple, DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!

A waste of money no matter how you look at it, go watch Moulin Rouge again you will be happier!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Like the Moulin Rouge ... It lacks HEART, Still Good","review":"This film is a good attempt to do what was done in Moulin Rouge...Moulin Rouge was just so good and the directing and acting were so masterful. I mean come on you cannot compare what's her name to Nicole Kidman, the star was good, the film was good, there was no story, no moral, no life, it was just a hardworked artificial americanized attempt to make a musical. Good Luck Next time .... Moulin Rouge will be the Legend, people will watch it 50 years from now, like we watch Casablanca..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleazy","review":"Although I enjoyed the music in this film, that's about it. My biggest gripe is that there are no characters you can admire or even like in it. Roxie's husband is the only decent character, and he gets dumped on throughout the movie. The rest of the characters are sleazy, deceptive, awful people, and unfortunately that is celebrated throughout the film. Not surprising that the Hollywood cesspool went ga-ga over it. I was pleasantly surprised at Catherine Zeta-Jones and Rene Zellweger's singing and dancing ability, that much I will admit. However, I would recommend that you rent this movie before you buy it. I bought it before seeing it at the recommendation of a friend, and unfortunately wasted my money. It's not a movie I want to watch again."},{"rating":"1","title":"O Star","review":"Zero Star.Nothing redeemable here. Bad people behaving, singing, and dancing badly and getting away with it on film, in the box-office, and with the Academy.It is slick...but so, too, is a scum-film on an aeration pond in a sewage treatment facility. Regarding this putrescent bio-layer; flush it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the CD","review":"The story line is most non-existant and what little there is is hard to follow. It cuts in and out of reality and musical fantasy, now time and then time to the point where you are never sure just when you are or what's going on. However, the music is hot. My recomendation? Buy the music CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie to watch over and over","review":"Apparently, the movie is not for the easily offended. But having seen it four times now, I'd say it is very entertaining, and watchable. I think it is even works as great historical fiction-doesn't everything you read about Chicago in that era tell you that murder was a pastime back then? That morals were \\"degrading\\"? Cool symoblism (the tap dance in the courtroom scene, for example) and fuel for discussion on the American character, media, and choice of idols."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bob Fosse is turning over in his grave!","review":"I love the show \\"Chicago\\"; however this is horrible! Renee cannot sing or dance! Putting men into the number \\"Cell Block Tango\\"?! - Fosse didn't and he should know! Also SIX (count 'em) SIX songs were left out. The best thing about this movie was that Marc Calamia (hot!) is in it as a dancer (from the Broadway cast) but all too briefly. Buy or rent \\"Fosse\\" if you want to see more (almost ALL of!) Marc and some REAL dancing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs, fun, and one hell of an energetic movie!","review":"Along with The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, this is by far the best picture of the year. There is no way you can be bored when viewing this movie, unless your already dead that is. Don't listen to the negative reviews bashing this movie. Go see it for yourself and then you will realize why this film is nominated for 13 Oscars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Razzle Dazzle and All That Jazz!","review":"AMAZING! Everyone should see this film. This is my favourite film ever. All the cast and crew did a fantastic job on the production. I'm not gonna bother telling you what it's about as countless other people before me have already done so, but let's just say it was deserving of winning 6 Oscars in my opinion. My favourite scenes are All That Jazz, Roxie and Razzle Dazzle - my favourite song from the show. All in all, if you don't own this or if you haven't seen it - what are you waiting for???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Picture? Not even close...","review":"Speaking of Rene Zellweger, that just reminded me that I also recently watched this movie for the first time. Unfortunately, it did nothing for me (and I tend to actually like musicals!). I can't believe this won all those awards (Best Picture???). It looked great, and the acting was good, but I never gathered any sympathy or empathy with any of the characters, and the music itself didn't do much for me either."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Queen redeems the show","review":"There's alot to be said against this movie, the brutality masked alluringly by sex and lilting voices is depressing. But the pearl in the stinky oyster is Queen Latifa. I'd never listened to her before and now I think she's just amazing. She belts out Mama and you are hooked. Its worth getting the movie to see her in action. The rest are quickly forgettable at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brash Bravado","review":"What can I say... This is an over-the-top piece of cinema that is so much fun to watch!Very well cast and directed.

It failed on all levels. Musically, it was mostly deriviative, as a drama it was poorly motivated, failing even at being a send up of its own genre. It went on and on without developing interest or character, leaving this audience member bored and disinterested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous and self-serving","review":"Yes, musicals are really about the music and dancing, and less about the story. Unfortunately, this one seems like the actors were having coffee one day, and all said \\"hey, wouldn't it be fun to be in a musical so we could all sing and dance??\\". I can't for the life of me understand why or how this piece of \\"art\\" got any awards, or any repeat views. I like musicals, but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as people say.","review":"I really found this movie bland. A girl aspires to be a broad-way baby. Terrific. I don't care about your problems though. She shoots a guy and ends up in prison.The movie is a musical. This musical had me annoyed at every minute. How hard is it to stay down and not break out into a song every minute. Sit down, and stop singing. Give me a three second break.I bet there are a few people getting ready to \\"thumbs down\\" my review. \\"I liked that one song where they sang!\\" No. If you hate musicals pass this up. There's no action. Also, the only comedy in the movie is the lack of sitting down for three seconds and not singing. Sit down. One second of not singing please. Get over the songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie [is bad]!","review":"I went to this movie today expecting to really like it, but I was let down. The best parts are the songs. The story line isn't good, it just gets the viewer from one song to another. The music video for \\"And All That Jazz\\" is better than the movie. I suggest that anyone interested in this movie buy the soundtrack instead of this movie on VHS or DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst \\"Best\\" Move","review":"The Motion Picture Academy must have been out of their minds to give this film a Best Picture Award. The film is totally miscast (Zellwiger and especially Gere, whose performance is as wooden as Sherwood Forest), and the clumsily-unfolding, simplistic plot is made even worse by second-rate dance numbers which attempt to \\"jazz up\\" the story. The only thing worth watching is the first-rate song and dance duet performed by Zellwiger and Zeta-Jones, but that occurs in the last ten minutes of an otherwise overrated movie. I would have had a better time dozing off in an easy chair than watching this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chicago","review":"This movie is horrible. How did it win any awards?

The music and snappy pace keep me going while I watch it and do a brisk walk on my treadmill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Chicago","review":"The Movie \\"Chicago\\" was very much better than the stage play. This was because the movies can produce such marvelous special effects. Catherine Zeta Jones, Renee Zetweiler, and Richard Geer did their own dancing and singing. They are beautiful, talented actors and held me spellbound throught the film. The music was also wonderful. The three people I went to see it with were equally impressed. It was a sellout audience. Maybe this movie will encourage Hollywood to produce more musical, feel-good movies. I certainly hope so."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I could rate it a 1,000 stars","review":"This is without a doubt the greatest movie musical to come along in a very long time. It has the amazing score (which is the greatest star of the film), great acting and singing from everyone involved, and amazing sets. I have already seen \\"Chicago\\" twice, and plan to see it again many times in the future. This movie will definetly go down in history with \\"Cabaret,\\" \\"Grease,\\" and \\"My Fair Lady\\" as THE definitive movie musical. Go see it and be amazed like I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic!","review":"The movie was captivating from the very start. The music, dancing and acting superb. Go see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unengaging","review":"The characters in this movie never came alive for me. The dancing and singing was well done, but the actors weren't able to make the jump between \\"reality\\" and \\"fantasy\\" convincing. Only one minor scene, by a minor charactor portrayed any depth of emotion (Mr. Cellophane)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big, bigger, biggest.

I rented this movie last week and thought that I would be blowed away due to all the hype about this movie. Well, there were a few cute numbers with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger, that's about it. The characters were not developed and the story was so simple that it was almost boring. Rent or buy Moulin Rouge if you want to see a great, moving musical."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Stylish Music Video","review":"Frankly, I still have to discover why is this movie so overrated...Sure, the production values are good, the songs are appropriate, the acting is decent and it has some neat visual moments. Yet, it doesn\`t really work as a solid, consistent film, just a bunch of stylish scenes with an almost nonexistent plot. And the characters, where are them?! What I saw was just a collection of cardboard, one-dimensional charicatures that couldn\`t get my interest. Since I don\`t really like musicals all that much, maybe I\`m a bit biased here. Still, it is not a great movie, it brings nothing new and doesn\`t deserve all the praise it got. Even as simple entertainment it\`s average at best.Pure eye candy, easy on the eyes but vapid and forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A GOOD MOVIE!","review":"I don't know what all the hype is about this movie.

That is the only reason this movie is getting so much hailing. I found that the music was the only thing I liked while I watched it in theaters. Everything else stunk!

I give \\"Chicago\\" only one star because that is the rating it really deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chicago","review":"Two thumbs down and one star for efort is my rating for the movie Chicago. There is nothing special in this movie that I have not seen in better musicals. This movie was a big dissapointment to me after I saw it in theaters."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Kind of Movie","review":"In the past, I have never really been interested in movies that consist of mainly large musical numbers accompanied with Broadway dancing (Grease is an exception). I saw the play Fosse (the man who wrote Chicago), and I didn't like it very much, but Chicago is amazing. The story is fair; good enough not to complain about, but no Lord of the Rings. The acting is very good, but once again, no Lord of the Rings. It's the music and dance numbers are the real money makers for this movie, though. Roxie Hart (Renée Zellwegger) has always wanted to be famous, but when she kills a lying boyfriend, she becomes infamous! She imagines everything as a show, including her trial (check out Richard Gere's suit in that scene!). I guarantee that you will enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Success!","review":"The stage-to-film transition for Fosse's \\"Chicago\\" has been many years in the making, but it was definitely worth the wait.It's interesting to me that while I don't particularily care for Catherine Zeta-Jones OR Rene Zelleweger, I think they were both fantastic in their roles in this film, as was Richard Gere. Impressive that, similar to Evita (Madonna's version) and Moulin Rouge, all of the principal actors did their own vocals. While they're not going to win any Grammy's for best vocalists, they all did very well.I won't recap the story, but for anyone who enjoyed the stage version of this film (as I did - saw it twice) and/or enjoys a movie/musical, this film is a must-see. If you want the soundtrack, though, I'd recommend the original broadway cast recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packed with talent","review":"A great piece of musical theatre put to the big screen. Richard Geere is a surprise in the movie, who knew he could sing and dance his way through a film with such great success.The story of Roxie is a reflection of our culture and our obsession with celebrity. Rene Zellwigger is a convincing \\"victim\\" of the celebrity obssessed time. The screen lights up with her beauty and excellent acting ability.Queen Latifah justly deserved the Academy Award nomination (I can't remember if she won or not)Lots of talent packed into this movie.Highly recomended for those who are musical theatre fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I always enjoy this movie and am happy to own it now so I can watch it whenever the mood strikes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicago","review":"Excellent movie.

Zeta-Jones has no vocal range (I'll admit she's a fair hoofer), and Gere is okay, but really---what's the big deal. I've seen better in amateur theatre productions. Zeeleger at least can hit a high note.

As it stands, it gets oscars. What gives? What if I made a movie about black people who own white slaves? What if I somehow was able to make that movie without it seeming ironic? What if I dressed up a movie about horrific, barely provoked, let alone justified, violence with snazzy 1930's style musical numbers that glorified the perpetrators of said violence, with their names writ-large in glowing neon letters? Would a large percentage of you still love the movie? What if instead of \\"Roxie\\", we had a male character who shot the woman he was cheating on his wife with, treated that wife like garbage, then became a media darling...would you all love it so much then?

A lot of the Bob Fosse choreagraphy is intact, as well as a unique vision of the complex storyline (placing it within the furtile imagination of Roxie Hart) to explain the staged direction of the play. Exceptional work by Rob Marshall and the team at Miramax to bring this dream production to fruition.And I would be remiss without adressing the assine review from Charlotte, NC. This is NOT a glorification of murderess and their ultimate escape from justice. Rather, it is an indictment of the \\"trial by press\\" of even our current age (Kobe Bryant, OJ, etc.) when we should be more aware of the opressive effect of the media. But what can one expect from a reviewer from the crotch of the bible belt...this movie wil stand the test of time. A lot more than I can say for some of the slanted political views of the reviewer from Charlotte."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the wait","review":"It took over 20 years to bring \\"Chicago\\" to the screen, but it was worth the wait. They actually made the story clearer and easier to believe that characters could move into and out of musical scenes. Bravo.This movie is infinitely better than \\"Moulin Rouge\\". In \\"Moulin Rouge\\", after 15 minutes I was bored with the constant camera movement(Luhrmann clearly must have wanted to attract the MTV crowd), and eventually found the whole movie irritating.My only complaint about \\"Chicago\\" was Richard Gere. I thought that while he was equally charming and smarmy, he just wasn't a strong enough presence to keep up with Zeta-Jones or Zellweger.Too bad it took so long to bring to the screen. It would have been even better with the original Thelma and Roxie, Chita Rivera (who has a cameo in this one) and Gwen Verdon."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"I never expected to enjoy this movie as much as I did!

I loved how they switch periodically from their life(speaking mostly) to their fantasy(singing on stage).

CHICAGO is a fun movie to watch and listen to and contains a spectacular cast.Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) is put in the Cook County Jail for murder. She eventually meets up with other women who have been charged with the same crime, most notably Vella Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who soon becomes her nemesis. Roxie dreams of becoming a star on the stage and manages to hire the notorious Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) to be her defense attorney and to persuade the jury that she is innocent.The dialogue is witty and smart, and it was fun to watch all the signing and dancing.

So much for historical accuracy in remaking good television and film. It's not just that a black actor in this role is historically inaccurate to the extreme, Will Smith is a smart-alecky and flippant actor--totally inappropriate for this character. Even Denzel Washington would have brought some gravitas to the role. How about Harrison Ford, Kurt Russell, or Mel Gibson? (It doesn't take a rocket scientist.)

A waste of carbon","review":"This is just a worthless movie. That's all there is to it. The only reason this got made is because Will Smith got popular after Men in Black and his stupid song from it.

I admit, there were a few good one-liners, and the special effects were top-rate, but there was absolutely no sense of direction in the meager story line there was. Will Smith did the best he could with the part, but you would expect more from such names as Kline and Branaugh. The plot was practically non-existant, only a meager idea shone through. This movie resembled nothing of the t.v. series. Wild Wild West was more of James Bond meets Gone with the Wind.

I nearly switched it off after 10 minutes of viewing, it is so embarrissingly bad, that you actually have sympathy for the actors. How Warner Brothers could ever allow this complete rubbish to be put on film is beyond belief. Take the worst parts of Armageddon, Godzilla (remake) and Lost in Space (remake) multiply them by 100 times and you might actually get to how bad this film really is. The people responsible for the making of this film should not be allowed to work on any other film ever again.

Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Were They Thinking?","review":"Wild Wild West is one of those movies that make you wonder just what were they thinking when this movie was being made. One thing that is absolutely essential for enjoying a movie is the suspension of disbelief. That is, you have to be able to believe that what's on the screen could really happen the way that things on the screen are happening. The things that go on in this movie make that impossible. Example: there is a gigantic steam-powered spider. Even with today's advanced technology, such a contraption would be just about impossible to build and get to operate properly, let alone in 1869.Once again: What were they thinking?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild, Wild West","review":"Some ways I was disappointed - remembering the TV shows.

Will Smith as James West trying to save the country in 1869? Sorry but I know my history and this is an insult to it. Consider that in 1869 a black man was nothing more than a freed slave, and would not have been granted such a task befitting John Steed or James Bond. This is not a racist remark. Rather, it's the truth. Just like modern Hollywood to ignore history. Nothing against Will Smith. He is a fine actor. I enjoy his work. However, through no fault of his own, he is seriously miscast in this one.

However Mr.Sonnenfield mis-directed this movie,it's an ok film but if your expectations were as high as mine don't bother with this . Actually the only redeeming quality of this movie is Salma Hayek. Oh yeah Sonnenfield also missed the mark with the Dr.Loveless character which originally was played by a dwarf in the original series.

The beginning was very slow, and had I not paid $5 I would have stopped it then. It improved slightly as the film progressed, I almost enjoyed it at one point, but not for long enough. It was a very poor idea, and even the best of actors could not have made this one great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Novel Potential","review":"\\"Nice-try\\" remake of the original Wild Wild West TV series from the 1960's. Agents James West and Artemus Gordon are dispatched by President Grant to prevent the evil genius Dr. Loveless from carrying out a threat to fragment the integrity of the United States. The plot is good, but the cast and the scripting doesn't reach the potential of what this film could have been. Will Smith and Kevin Kline a little wacky and stray too far from the original characters portrayed by Robert Conrad and Ross Martin. The casting of Will Smith does not work well for fans who remember the original TV series: he appears too young to be an experienced agent, and his contemporary behavior detracts from the period setting. On the positive side, the machinery and inventions are entertaining with armored tanks, trains, and an 80-foot tall \\"spider\\" vehicle. Overall, it's an okay adventure movie, but doesn't hit the \\"bulls-eye\\" as a successful remake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a Throwback to an Earlier Time","review":"\\"'The Great Race' of the Nineties\\" would best describe this exercise in overkill. Like that film, \\"Casino Royale,\\" \\"It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\\" and many of the other big-budgeted flicks of the late 1960's, \\"Wild West West\\" suffers from a poor script, an overemphasis on state-of-the-art special effects, a performance from Branagh that would make a first-year acting student cringe, and a lackluster turn from stars Smith and Kline.The only refreshing aspect of the film is Salma Hayek who tries her best to do much with very little...clothing, as well as dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"MORE LIKE WILD, WILD, WASTE","review":"Wild, Wild, West is undoubtedly one of the year's worst films. One of the factors that makes the movie so frustrating to watch is the fact that it is based on one of the most inventive and original shows I have had the pleasure of seeing. Inventiveness and originality are lacking in this mess of a movie where the script is horrible, the one-liners stale and the performances wooden(except Kenneth Branagh, whom you feel sorry for trying so hard to be evil).Will Smith is stripped of the charisma that is his best selling point. Kevin Kline, a talented actor is reduced to playing second banana to an uninteresting hero and I have a hard time remembering Salma Hayek is in the movie.I didn't really expect it to be \\"good\\", but I at least expected it to entertain me, instead of providing rest I didn't need. What a waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Loved The TV Show, You'll Hate This Wanna-Be","review":"I hated this movie for 2 reasons. One, it didn't come close to the quality of the original TV series. Two, even without comparing this movie to the original Wild Wild West, the pace of the movie was sluggish which made it very tedious to watch. If you want to see a great western, go watch the original series with Robert Conrad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a waste of talent!","review":"Just saw WWW on dvd and am I glad I rented it. I could be more generous and give an added star due to its DVD content. It's quite a lot. But the biggest problem lies on the story. It goes nowhere. Its simple premise of Loveless trying to overthrow the US Government became so stale halfway that it seems Sonnenfeld decided to put a lot of action scenes (dull, by the way) to lengthen the film. Will Smith and Kevin Kline seems to try as hard as they can to cherish their parts but you can tell they know this movie's not going anywhere but down. The fx were incredible though, especially the giant mechanical spider. Problem is too much effects with no story can be compared to a book with a great cover but no substance. Kenneth Branagh as Loveless was pretty good but his talents, among others, were wasted due to an attempt to make a big summer blockbuster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Wastes Money On This?","review":"I would recommend this DVD only for the interactive menus and numerous extras, including Making Of.I have never seen the original Wild Wild West, but I can tell this movie doesn't live up to the predesscor. First of all, Will Smith needs to choose roles that will gurantee a box office smash. Last time I heard, this film bombed at the national theaters. The chemistry between Will Smith and Kevin Kline isn't just there. Also, Salma Hayek in the role of an entertainer just isn't perfect. The director should have done a better job, along with the people who wrote the script. The one liners don't carry us through the whole movie, even with Will Smith's slick dialogue and Kevin Kline's wittiness in acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winner of 7 Golden Raspberry Awards","review":"...including worst screen couple & worst picture.

Simply put, Will Smith and Kevin Kline are not Robert Conrad and Ross Martin. There's no chemistry or rapport between Fresh Prince and Shakespeare Boy, which seriously damages the film's potential. Kenneth Branagh - for all his talents - doesn't hold a candle to Michael Dunn's original Dr. Loveless. Despite its impressive set design and visual effects, \\"Wild Wild West\\" falls flat. Here's some helpful advice to producers planning big-screen remakes of 1960s TV shows: If you cannot find the right actors, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"How the West Was Done (In)","review":"If this bloated, unfunny, offensive, ill-conceived dud doesn't spell the end of the Western, I don't know what will. Will Smith's usually winning personality falls completely flat here, and Mr. Kline is equally lousy in the role that calls for him to do little except dress up in drag that makes him look even worse than Kurt Russell did in \\"Tango & Cash\\". Barry Sonnenfeld displays none of the wit that he used to such great effect in \\"Men In Black\\" and (especially) \\"Get Shorty\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This was one of the very few films that I have stopped, rewound and slid back in the case before it was over. I thought this film would be a fun trip into fantasyland with crazy things and zany people, not to be taken seriously, just a lot of crazy zany fun. Well, it didn't even do that, it was bad folks, baaad. And movies have to be pretty bad for me to shut them down. Will Smith was not convincing in his character as he also was not convincing in his roles in \\"Independence Day\\" and \\"Men in Black\\". He looks much too young for these characters and shows not an once of maturity in his lines and actions. If he acted more mature, it could help offset his youthful looks.

Do we suspend history for the sake of political correctness? Let's do a remake of the Clint Eastwood Westerns, oh and who should we cast as Joe?

Not exactly horrible, but not great. As for the DVD, it's great! Enough extras to satisfy me and the DVD transfer is very good. Going back to the movie, I'll have to say this: the acting was good, the special-effects good, the plot bad, the villain: Very Annoying! I forget who played the villain, but I have to say that he didn't act well in this movie, his accent was fake, and you weren't even scared of him. Villains are supposed to be scary OR a villain can be funny and frightening(as in Men In Black), but this villain lacks both qualities.

This flick was especially disappointing to fans of the old sixties TV show who couldn't help but make comparisons of Will Smith to Robert Conrad. The film is entertaining and funny only to those who either temporarily discard their education and common sense or have no education or common sense at all. The acting isn't really the greatest and the plot is so puerile and senseless; Kenneth Branagh's character Dr. Arliss Loveless certainly could have done better than build a large, awkward, clumsy, spider-like machine to take over the post civil war United States.

All the actors in this movie play their parts as if they were asleep. The studio could have saved money by scouting actors at a tree nursery. Even bushes would be more entertaining than this. In conclusion, it made me cry tears of pity for the poor saps stuck doing this film, writhe in pain at the deliverance of those \\"jokes\\", and wonder if movie studios let just anybody with a script through.

Instead of hiring a gorgeous, handsome Jim West--someone like Mel or Brad or Russell Crowe, in the tradition of TV's sexy Robert Conrad, shock the legion of fans by hiring a--now get this--a black movie star! Boyish, flat-chested, unmuscular Will Smith. Smith a western hero star? They call this being \\"politically correct with a vengeance\\" in Hollywood. Then hire writers to weave a thread of virulent anti-white jokes and plot lines. Make every white person a bigot, a mental retardate, a psychopath.

So if what you're looking for in a 'food movie' is mouth-watering shots of the food, this isn't it, but the characters are remarkable, and it's a great story as well.

The two eventually collide when Roxie begins winning hearts (and the press) with her story while Velma must face the reality that she's yesterday's news. The slick lawyer not only must juggle Roxie's front page case but also the restless Kelly who is chagrined that even her own attorney begins to turn his back on her.

In the meantime, the events leading up to David Banner's death were compelling and added a strong sense of tragedy to counterpoint the sense of liberation that David expressed with his final words.

To think that I'm reading the diary of a woman who lived over 1000 years ago. You'd wonder if she had thoughts of her writing being read so long after her death.Sei Shonagon writes so, so beautifully. She has a sensitive and profound touch, and her descriptions are so elegant that you can almost feel what she is describing.The rare insight this book offers is incredible, and is a must for most every library. You will certainly not regret making this purchase. It is a small price to own a piece of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"challenging","review":"I know very little of ritual Japanese life. I found it a challenging and thought provoking read. I had to bookmark the footnotes and was constantly referring to them. She's a highly intelligent woman, writing a very refined, very sensual story. I wish I was more aware of the nuances of Japanese court. It seems much of the meaning is between the lines. I've had to work hard to understand, and I still feel that i am digesting much of what was written. Very rewarding. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Bought for sons trumpet.

I would purchase again, as well as recommend to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great student case","review":"I purchased this case to replace a rather large, heavy case that had finally seen it's last performance. This case is lightweight, much smaller, and is not cumbersome. It's perfect for my seventh grade band student who has no need to carry anything more than a trumpet, one mouthpiece, and cleaning essentials. No room for a mute or the trumpet stand.

Too much time spent on character introduction and not enough time spent on story/plot progression. This could be due to the fact that there is another season somewhere. This series moved along to fast near the end, but then it wouoldn't be a bad thing if you could pop in another series to finish it up. What? there's more? Yes, this leaves you hanging in mid air expecting more. However, very well done, love the story, the characters, perspective, and fresh ideas. Has zombies, werewolves, ghosts, demons, vampires and other creatures of shadows. This series is worth having and watching again."},{"rating":"2","title":"it is a funny yet disturbing","review":"This is a good anime for laughs. It has everything from action adventure to light romance. I loved it and would say this is for someone of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long, but worthwhile","review":"Surprisingly enough, Brad Pitt didn't compromise this film! I always question the use of big name actors in important movies. Yes, I consider this to be an important movie. Every time I watch it, I am overcome with the beauty and tragedy of Tibet, the wondrous mystery of Tibetan Buddhism and the life of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. It's a true account, which chronicles the experiences of Heinrich Harrer. His transformation parallels that of the Tibetans who regularly make the pilgrimage to Lhasa for spiritual purification. This DVD has no extras at all, but worth the price for the film alone. The transfer to digital is good. It would've been nice to have some information on the true account of Harrer as well as info on the Chinese occupation of Tibet. You might also wish to check out the soundtrack featuring Yo-Yo Ma."},{"rating":"2","title":"All around 5 stars, wonderful plot & scenery","review":"Though I did not see this film in a theater, I really wish I had. I haven't seen such beautiful scenery in a movie since The Sound of Music!Brad Pitt does an outstanding job at playing an Austrian mountaineer who winds up befriending the curious young Dalai Lama.Some may say that this is quite a long tale to watch, but as long as you are ready to watch a deeply involved plot unfold into a stunning masterpiece, I'm sure that you'll have no problem with the time required to watch this movie.One more thing, if you don't have any interest in international travel, I'm certain that this movie will change your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I was a big fan of the book so when the movie came out, I was first in line. It always seems that movies never do the book justice but in this case, that wasn't true.Brad Pitt was fabulous in the lead role. As a matter of fact, I can't think of one character that wasn't great.The scenery was breathtaking and the dialogue wonderfully crafted. Watching Pitt's character develop and deepen was inspirational, especially when he was interacting with the Dalai Lama. As their friendship grew, the purer it got.The Dalai Lama himself (well the character) was truly amazing with his words of wisdom and clarity of life, especially at such a young age and in difficult circumstances.I wanted the movie to go on forever but all things must end. And what a beautiful ending it was! I plan on watching this one over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ruination a Great Story","review":"Read the book. The movie fictionalized and altered a wonderful (and true) story that deserved a better movie representation. The book was excellent. This movie could have been so much better if it followed the book more closely. It's a real shame.Seven Years in Tibet"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story marred by poor Pitt acting","review":"This is a great story that was poorly told in this movie. I felt like I was watching Brad Pitt in Tibet which is a testament to his poor acting skill. I really wanted to like this movie but was thoroughly disappointed. Even a soundtrack by Yo-Yo Ma could not save it. The directing was also distracting with poor pacing and choppy editing. I really wish this had been a great movie and I was rooting for it but it fell flat I am very sorry to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard Hollywood Product","review":"If you have read the Heinrich Harrer book, this film is a serious disappointment. Only the rough outline of what happened is preserved in the film. The rest is filled in with standard Hollywood plot devices. Too much time is devoted to things that never happened, like a gratuitous love triangle and conflict between the two western protagonists that never happened. For sure, this big budget production has all the colorful Tibetan pomp that money can buy, but take that away and you've got only generic melodrama: Enlightened white guy brings humanity and western wisdom to the Dalai Lama. I'm surprised they didn't have Robin Williams play the role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book.","review":"Don't bother watching this. It is a poor recreation of a fantastic and sometimes unbelievable book. It's hard to believe this story is true; a man escapes a prison, wanders up into the mountains and becomes friends with the Dali Lama.I was so anxious to see this film, loving the book, and was so let down. It's quite boring.It's a hard book to bring to the screen anyway, so I would reccommend reading the book first. If you watch the film first, you're liable not to want to pick the book up at all, and that would be a shame as the story is wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. Makes a total mess of history.","review":"This movie was pure fantasy. Heinrich Harrer was a decorated Nazi, but the movie does its best to ignore this fact. \\"Oh sure, he was a Nazi... but, he was a GOOD Nazi!\\"At the end of the movie, Harrer's voice-over expresses regret for his political affiliation. Back on Planet Reality, Harrer was totally unrepentant.I am convinced that the SOLE reason this movie was so popular was because of its star. \\"Kundun\\" was far better and far more accurate in its portrayal of the Dalai Lama's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"seven years too long in tibet!","review":"pluses: great footage of tibetan landscape, great cinematography in general, some interest stuff about the dalai lamaminus (here goes!): brad pitt was TERRIBLE, couldn't do an austrian accent to save his life - i hate to say it, but arnold schwartzeneggar would have been better for the part; the story line, though interesting, was exceedingly shallow and hollywood, no depth whatsoever, ultimately quite dull; extremely grandiose and so sickly pro-western culture; and why couldn't they find a young tibetan for the dalai lama who didn't...have an indian accent. and i kept hoping someone would knock off brad pitt...and the movie would end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The scenery and filming of this movie is very excellentand the stars (including Brad Pitt) are acting at their very best. I saw this movie last year and it was very excellent. Anyway, this is how it goes. When a husband (Brad Pitt : Meet Joe Black, Legends Of The Fall) has gone hunting in the mountaisn while his wife is pregenant he is captured by the war. He cannot return to his wife and children until he gets out but he is forced to move to Tibet. He spends seven years at Tibet and wonders if he will ever return to his wife and kids again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for Brad Pitt fans","review":"This movie bears little relationship to the book, which is a narrative of one man's difficult struggle to exist under trying circumstances. The book is fascinating, and tells us much about life in Tibet. The movie, on the other hand, was transformed into a story about how Brad Pitt discovers meaning in life. At least I'm guessing that was the theme, because I quit watching after an hour. Brad Pitt's voyage of discovery entertains little, and informs not at all. The one plus is that the scenery is spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Great Film","review":"This film is educational, having been based on a true story.This film has numerous spiritual moments.This film does not reduce itself to unnecesary sex, violence, etc. to sell more tickets, yet it masterfully grabs the viewers attention and does not ditch showing violence when necessary.The photography was breathtaking.The acting was superb.This film has dimension and wrestles with the problem of evil in a mature way.The plot is excellent, sometimes truth IS better than fiction.The characters are easy to like.If you haven't seen Seven Years in Tibet yet, don't miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I'd expect from Brad","review":"I think Brad should stick to funny, action adventure and love stories....I suppose this was just too dragging for the typical viewer who is looking for some cute boys and breathtaking action scenes. On the other hand for someone looking for something out of the ordinary this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should have called the movie two guys in Tibet.","review":"The only thing this movie had in common with the book was there were two guys in Tibet. If you want to enjoy this movie don't read the book first. You'll be very disappointed if you know the true story of what really happened. Very poor! Why can't Hollywood seem to ever get a story straight?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A soul -soothing movie!","review":"The movie catches your attention at the first chapter when Pitt made his first appearance.I believe he show a very obvious arrogance toward his pregnant wife and does not seem to care at all as a husband.but when come to the middle in the movie,he start to change as news of divorce come to him.and not to say that the tibet scence was stunningly colourful and brilliant as deliver by this dvd technology.this picture has it all adventure,trill in the pow prison as pitt made 4 unsuccessful escape,the beautiful camera pan across Himalayas scence was awsome,and the war zone of terror when the Chinese Army took over tibet was simply carefully shot.as this picture can double up as a eye opener for us as we learnt about a culture that closed entirely to foreigner.this film simply deliver al the trill,mysterious religion in tibet,the beauty of the highest mountain in the world.a must have for lover of beauty and a glism of other distant culture and religion.Truly a fiver star"},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare perfect film gets a perfect bluray transfer.","review":"Films like SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET are too few and far between. This is one of those films that never makes a mistake in storytelling, acting or production. Jean Jacques Annaud's direction is spot on and he captures the finest ever performance from Brad Pitt. The cinematography is spectacular and the new bluray high definition transfer is breathtaking providing amazing colors and an almost three dimensional pop. This is a demo worthy transfer in both picture and sound quality. The uncompressed PCM 5.1 soundtrack will put you right in the action. The print is prestine and entirely free from scratches, dirt and artifacting. This is as good as it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not get to see it.","review":"The tape popped in my VCR.

Powerful picture of a country and culture that existed in peace and was brutally invaded and destroyed (well, the culture is resisting somehow). The relationship between Heinrich and the Dalai Lama is touching. Beautiful photography and soundtrack. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Contemporary Classic for Buddhism based on a True Story","review":"This movie portrays the life of the Dali Lama through childhood through to his escape from Chinese communist invaders. It is an amazing portrayal of true events. If you are curious about the early life of the Dali Lama, the invasion of Tibet and/or its culture, than you must add this DVD to your collection. I watch it over and over again. And the stars in the movie put out an amazing performance. It is very entertaining as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let the face on the cover fool you!","review":"I have to admit Seven Years in Tibet will go down in the annals of history as something of a great story, and the movie will become part of that. There are beautiful scenes and wonderful parts to this modification of Harrer's original story. I wish they had somebody who could stay in character better than Pitt, who seemed to want to break back into a Hollywood tough-guy character every other line. All in all, this is very good at portraying another side of the war. Few people could say they didn't learn something new without reading the book or seeing the movie - whether it be just facts or a lesson about life. The child who played the Dalai Lama was brilliant and showed his innocence and strengths at the same time. At times I was reminded of Little Buddha. See the movie or read the book - you will be wiser and happier when done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"I think opinions on this movie are different because the viewers fear to admit they actually enjoyed Brad Pitt in a movie. My opinion is that this movie is great. The story-line is very good and does not get boring at all unless your attention span is that of a donkey. The scenery in this movie is spectacular and really beautiful. This movie could be more detailed and more factual, but over all, this movie is a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":";-)","review":"It may be a little offbeat, but hay! What movie isen't????

This movie wasn't very good at all","review":"I'm writing this review mainly to tell everyone who isn't in love with Brad Pitt that this movie was good at all. I felt as if I'd spent seven years somewhere during this movie, seven years somewhere boring. The movie had about as much plot as pigs have wings. The movie centers around Brad Pitt's character who is neither likable or really that interesting. His relationship with the Dalai Lama in this movie which was originally what the studios used to sell this movie is barely a sideline. The movie was so bad that Battlefeild Earth looks like Star Wars in comparison. I hope all you ladies out there won't drop your ... to see yet another Brad Pitt washout. If you REALLY want to see Brad Pitt by Legends of the Fall or Fight Club now those two movies were excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Stupid Plot","review":"I guess this movie is only for die hard Brad Pitt Fans.

I thought that it would be a good movie, and believe me, I am a Brad Pitt fan, but this movie can put one to sleep. This movie portrays a mountain climber (Pitt) who is assigned to climb the Himalayas for the Nazis in WW2, and ends up becoming a prisoner of war. It shows how Bradd Pitt escapes the P.O.W. Camp and flees to Tibet's Holy City, Lhasa, to end up becoming HH the Dhalai Lhama's Private Tutor, and friend. Yeah right, I'm sure you are jumping to your feet right now. This'll sure keep you busy if you are prepared to watch almost 3 hours of a non-action, unrealistic film, even though the story is true."},{"rating":"1","title":"I renamed this movie Seven Years in my Seat!","review":"This movie was so boring. The scenery was okay, but the rest of the movie was horrible. And as for that fake Austrailian accent...what was Brad Pitt thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"An absolute snore-fest","review":"Yes, the photography of the movie is beautiful. However, watching the story was horribly slow. It was just boring to see how the relationship between Harrer and the Dalai Lama unfolds so slowly. No emotional strings were strummed. I sat there watching the movies like I spent seven years in Tibet. And when there is action, it is unfairly depicted. The movie makes the Chinese army into a mob of dehumanized villains. I feel that this is the most uncomfortable, high-production movie I have sat through in a very long time. If you want good drama, watch something like The Shawshank Redemption. If you want good cinematography, watch One Hour Photo. If you want a DVD coaster, use your Seven Years in Tibet DVD. Avoid this piece of junk unless you want to fall asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ironic issue","review":"The fact is simple that most of Americans know nothing about Tibet.This country liberated itself from Britain but inherited many colonial scars from Britan as the Tibitan issue.This country fought a civil war for slavery, but unconciously sympathetic to the ghost of the most notorious slavery society: Dalai Lama.What an irony!Pitt seems brighter than the Play Girl icon and religion-lost R.

I knew that the garment industry had to know a great deal more than I did about constructing clothing. They had to or clothes would be prohibitively expensive. This book is a practical, enlightening and acerbically written overview of how \\"they\\" produce clothing for the rest of us, or at least under ideal conditions. It is also a great place to read about others' mistakes!! In my first reading, my immediate impression was that the details Kathleen was sharing were so intuitively correct and grounded in common sense that it all HAD to be true. Frank speech is the hallmark of this book and you may find yourself shaking your head at the logic and order of Kathleen's description of bringing any sewn product to realization. If you ever had a great idea that required something to be sewn, you really MUST read this book.

While there is a point to be made about the skills necessary to find out the goal of the manufacturer, the point made by this author seemed to be more along the lines of \\"being right\\". At one point she states \\"Doing things appropriately usually means thinking beyond the obvious and focusing on asking the right questions, instead of getting the right answer.\\" If this is true, why does the front of her book claim that it is \\"...everything you need to know about running a garment industry business, when no one else can (or will) help you...\\"???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not without its faults","review":"Not without its faults.

The Pinhead makeup is terrible, the cenobites are a joke, the plot is hopeless, and even the gore is starting to slack off a bit. It all starts in a futuristic space station, and the man on board is attempting to destroy Pinhead and his evil sidekicks. But the cenobites in this look like clowns, and Pinhead's dog should have been laughed at. Of course, the special effects are good, and the opening credits are entertaining with its haunting music, but the rest is just a sideshow thats a hopeless waist of time.

But this film is really poor. The first three films of the series are probably one of the best splatter horror trilogies, and this sequel should never be made. The plot is silly, the actors (except Doug - Pinhead - Bradley) out of place, the make-up of the other cenobites (the twins, the female, the dog) ridiculous. All in all, this movie is to the Hellraiser series exactly what Batman & Robin (1997) is to the Batman series. A poor homage rather than a real sequel. I just hope that Hellraiser V : Inferno will have the dark magic of the first two films, or the excitement of the third. The single star I gave is for the music score which is pretty good (the Hellraiser films had always a good score). The fact that this film was 'directed' by the 'infamous' Mr. Alan Smithee says it all..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"This movie is by far the second best in the series ( the first being the best of course.) it goes back and explains the mysterious history of lemarchand's puzzlebox and finally brings to an end the reign of the horrible cenobites on earth. a must see for any hellraiser fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Sequel to a great series","review":"When released Hellraiser: Bloodline was the worst sequel in the series and one of the worst horror seqels to date.

We learn the origin of the mysterious cube through a series of flashbacks that have little impact on the overall story and are done in a flat, often boring tone that leaves the viewer wishing for something scary to happen. Scary? No. Gory? Yes. Too gory. This film packs on the excess gore and ignores everything else. But there is a time when gore is scary and a time where gore is pointless. This is the latter. It also marks the \\"death\\" of Pinhead but he makes another appearence in the fifth and upcoming sixth entries. The fifth, \\"Inferno,\\" does not follow the others, yet it is the best of the series. So far, \\"Bloodline\\" is the worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was ok","review":"I agree with the reviewer who recommends forgetting the plot of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Hellraisers. It is necessary to do that in order to enjoy this film. It has plenty of gore and not much scare. It is entertaining nevertheless. For the 8 year old viewer...go to bed. Somebody should slap your parents.

Critters 4 did the same, Jason 10 puts The Camp Blood Killer in orbit...I mean, come on. This, however, was a good movie, like i said in the title, not the best in the series, but certainly not the worst. This one follows the story of the creator of the little wooden box.

For who? Who knows? It is used when a director is ASHAMED of the movie they did. For instance, David Lynch used \\"Alan Smithee\\" on the TV version of DUNE. If you see a director with this name STAY AWAY! I will only give BLOODLINE a 2, and that is only because it's part of the HELLRAISER series, and is worth watching with the volume down to get a good look at the nasty Cenobites.

Otherwise, wait until your friend happens to rent it, and watch it in an altered state of consiousness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough is Enough!","review":"Hellraiser Bloodlines is a prime example of why I do not like sequels. I gave this movie a 1 star rating because it only has 1 star and that is Pinhead(Doug Bradley). He is the only reason I continued to watch this boring drawn out movie. It was neither frightening nor was it entertaining. I have no clue what this movie has to do with the first 3. We learn where the box came from and what it's meaning is. Somehow, the box has ended up in space and I'm just wondering how it got there and where it's creator and family members where in the first 3. There is typical Hellraiser gore which is always a plus but believe me this movie is not worth seeing. I haven't seen Hellraiser 5 (Inferno) yet and after seeing Hellraiser 4(Bloodlines) I don't know if I will. Even if your a fan of Hellraiser I'd say stay clear of this bomb."},{"rating":"2","title":"hellraiser origins","review":"I liked this movie alot! Even though clive barker moved from director to producer he still put the effort forth for the 4th installment of hellraiser. This movie goes into how the box came about, and it's origins. If you are a horror fan, you might like this movie. If you're an initial clive barler fan, you might not like it. It's not his imagination you see, it's Kevin Yagher, and Joe Chappelle's.

This is a \\"live recording\\" (oxy-moron, but you understand) in what is I think a cabaret setting. At least that's what image is projected in my mind when I hear this album. This recording sounds like an intimate, darkened room lit only by the spotlight and candles on cafe tables; smoke filling in the crevices between the pockets of light; people gathered to hear stories, told by the down-trodden, interpreted by a master. It's glorious and if you like the extremes of dark and light, the sound of a whiskey-flavored voice accompanied by a lone pianist, then you will love this piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"All politics is local!","review":"I worked for the newspaper for many years; not in editorial, but in the advertising department.Living in Philadelphia, I had a second reason for being interested in this movie.Very well done; really like Rob Morrow as well as Paul Sorvino.Enjoyable, interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a scientific book","review":"I have read this book.

This of course will not affect the performance (they were on the outside, bottom) bu makes it slightly less desirable to use all the time if you hope to use it for a decorative itme on your tabletop.

Using Handbrake on Mac, I can then take my DVD's with me on the road with the master copies safe and sound at home. It is like a TiVo in my pocket.Also, using the Onkyo, you give up your s-Video port. Most TV's only have one.

This book was my introduction to the Civil War and my only regret is that it could not be longer!! It is the story of the 7th New Jersey Regiment as told through the diaries of the men who experienced the civil war as part of this Regiment. Their opinions of the officers, the food (or lack of it)the death of comrades, the will to survive, and the heroic efforts by men of both the Union and Confederate Army, were brought right up close and I found myself caught up in their struggles.This book is loaded with photographs of the men who served, great illustrations of actual events described in the book and maps of battles this Regiment fought in. For me this book was a real eye-opener as to the suffering and hardship these men endured. When you read what they wrote in their diaries as the Civil War was unfolding, it has infinite more meaning than reading a second hand account written decades after the war ended. I HIGHLY Recommend this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"incorrect disk\\"?","review":"Two-disk set, purchased \\"new,\\" region 1.

It plays like a brand new DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie ever!!!!!","review":"Selma Hayek is awesome as Frida Kahlo in this beautifully told story of this phenomenal artists life. Marrying to her womanizing lover Diego Sanchez really helped fuel the emotional distress that artists require to create with such intensity. As if her damaged physical state wasn't enough, the heart ache of her wandering lover helped push her over the top in my opinion and fueled what became a lifetime of masterpieces.This story is warm, sad, funny and inspiring and it would seem that Selma had a great deal of respect for the woman she portrays so well in this work of art on film. By far and away the best movie I have seen to date, If the dialogue alone doesn't do it for you then certainly the set of 1930's Mexico City will. Rich and beautiful in all arena's: sound, site, time period and ideological social sub-cultures.On a scale of 1 - 10 I give this film a 55"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A GOOD MOVIE","review":"Me as a Mexican it's awful to see how a mediocre mexican actrees tries to represent the lofe of one of the greatest painters in Mexico. When I saw the movie I saw Salma playing Salma not Salma playing Frida. Also the story it's awful, I saw some comments comming from Diegos daighter and she says that she hates this movie because it's not the true.Don't watse your time and money buying this DVD, if you want search for \\"Frida, Naturaleza viva\\" or \\" Frida, lived life\\" with Ofelia Medina that's a great movie and a real one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frida Kahlo","review":"I can honestly say that this is one of the better movies out there. It is not only a synopsis of Frida's life, but also a peak at part of Mexican political and artistic history. It portrays the life of an artist, and an incredibly couragous woman, who despite many accidents has the perserverance to never give up and be Frida."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe Not for Kahlo Purists, But...Great Movie","review":"Great direction by Taymor; across the board believable acting, and brilliant visual effects of weaving the paintings of Frida Kahlo into the story line. I understand some of the Kahlo purists' complaints, but for those with a moderate knowledge of her work this will be a very satisfying movie. It's primarily the love story of Rivera and Kahlo and the story of Kahlo's artistic evolution. Of course her life encompassed much more, but how much can you say in one movie? It's vibrant, fun, exciting, emotional, sad, and it made me want to learn more about Kahlo, Mexican art and history. Hey -- that's pretty good for a movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"low and slow. Film is a ZERO soundtrack is GREAT.","review":"Odd that the pro review describes Hayak's performance as driving this mess. If it is driven, it is in low rider mode, low and slow. A complete bore. This slow paced stilted account of these two prominent Mexican art figures is a disaster. From most accounts these two were both intricate, interesting and exciting personalities. As presented here, they are neither. Simple, offensive, self indulgent, hyper ego's, is a better description of the portrayals they receive. They may have deserved better. We will never know, based on how they are painted here.On the bright side, the soundtrack is a delight. Pass on the film and snap up the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a Mexican I'm mad","review":"This is an awful movie of the life of one of the best painters of Mexico.

Be sure and get the book about the making of the movie [aisn: 1557045402] to accompany the DVD.The cinematography is stunning. The performances are flawless. The way the live action is interwoven with adaptations of Kahlo's paintings is inspired. If you've ever been to Mexico, this will have you aching to go back - you can taste the fruit and feel the sun and the colors. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars - this is the one to get for any lover of art, woman of vision, or for a person who struggles to find meaning in pain or disability."},{"rating":"1","title":"How is a Movie about a Spanish artist not in Spanish Audio?","review":"I bought this movie for my mami who was looking forward to it coming out in DVD so she could hear it in Spanish. How did she come to this assumption? My fault! I naturally assumed that a movie about Frida, Mexican artist who spoke Spanish, made by Salma Hayek, again a Mexican artist who speaks Spanish, would have Spanish audio.I was very very disappointed and my mami was so upset she didn't even want to watch it. Therefore I was forced to return it, find another present and not have the dvd there to remind my mami of her disappointment.I'm so upset that I would like to find out how to let that person who made the decision to have FRENCH audio instead of Spanish have a piece of my mami's and my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frida","review":"I did not know much about Frida Kahlo, so I decided to watch this movie. I did not have much of an opinion of her; her body or work was okay, she wore long, traditional Mexican dresses and she had been married to Diego Rivera. The movie did a good job of depicting her story in a way I could understand. Now when I think of her artwork I know to look a little deeper and can better interpret her emotions. The miscarriage explains a lot. It is also interesting to see the development of political ideas and the passion that comes with it. The exposure to another culture in helpful, in this ever smaller world we live in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Movie!","review":"This was a beautiful movie, I like it, the story is interesting maybe a bit long.

Reluctanly, I agreed to give it a shot. I was very impressed with what I saw. It is an emotional roller-coaster with excellent character development. I especially enjoyed Alfred Molino's performance. I don't recall her name, but I remember being surprised when I learned that this film was directed by a woman. That got me thinking...it's not often that you see a female director."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"A beautiful and fascinating film about a beautiful and fascinating woman. I loved it. Salma Hayek is superb, Alfred Molina is irresistible. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the end, hopeful","review":"I watched this film with two women who lived through the times portrayed. As they expressed their gratitude for youthful memories authentically brought once again to life, I tried to imagine a time when the Russian and Mexican revolutions were just being betrayed; when young people, like the two mentioned, nevertheless came from around the globe to risk their lives for their vision; and endured personal and political betrayal. Yet, I'm reminded that period pieces are often more about the present than the past. May people listen to Kahlo's words to Trotsky: in life and love, we can endure more pain than we think."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Life of Frida Kahlo","review":"This film is so obviously one of those projects of love by all concerned that it really needs no further explanation. If you are at all interested in the story of this remarkable artist, this is the definitive film biography that is unlikely to ever be surpassed. The only question left outstanding is: How did the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences not present the Best Actress award to Ms. Hayek for her performance? Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring beyond words...","review":"If I had art supplies with me, I'd start to paint my thoughts -- and I'm not even a painter. I want to create art that does indeed change the mirror we hold up to reality and art that gives us a chance to think. Really think. As a theatre actor/director who is constantly inspired by Julie Taymor, I'm overjoyed to say this film won't disappoint anyone. The music, the voices, the tones, the colors and the details (for a lady libra such as yours truly, it all matters)... the acting and passion of Salma and Alfred -- along w/the team of other players... I have always wanted to meet Frida and thru this film, we can all meet a part of her. Kudos to Salma for believing and being patient with this project. The time, energy and love is what shines thru. And you DO NOT have to be a Frida lover to appreciate this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two for the price of one","review":"This film is not only about the fascinating life of the twentieth century Mexican artist, Frida Kahlo, but also about her muralist husband, Diego Rivera. In a sense we get two biographies for the price of one! We are treated to views of many of their artistic works. As if that were not enough, there are delightful Mexican songs to entertain us. One is sung by Salma Hayek herself, and she's not bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"indescribable","review":"This is probably 1 of the best films I have seen to date. I unfortunately did not see it in the theatres and had to rent it. I had never even heard of this movie before I read the reviews about it.... It is beautifully acted, amazingly directed and the music is fantastic....Everyone who loves film will love this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid Cinematic Biography of Frida Kahlo's Life","review":"Without question this is a splendid artistic triumph for director Julie Taymor and actors Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina. Taymor tells a riveting saga about Frida Kahlo and her life, that seems faithful to those familiar with the artist's biography. At the core of the tale is the love affair between Kahlo (Hayek) and Diego Rivera (Molina), Mexico's greatest muralist of the 20th Century. The film sizzles when both actors appear together on screen. If there is a false note - even if it is true - it is Kahlo's bizarre, seemingly inexplicable love affair with Soviet emigre Leon Trotsky, which the film suggests was Kahlo's means of getting even with Rivera's excessive philandering. This is one of the best films I've seen about an artist, and surely the finest made in recent times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frida Review","review":"The movie provides a lot of reliable details on Frida's life. However, some aspects (such as her sexuality) are a bit too dramatic and deceiving. The best part of this movie is how the director managed to incorporate her paintings into the scene shots so they commanded respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragmented","review":"Like his first novel in this series, the book is written with a series of fragments instead of complete sentences.Also, he can't even get the spelling of Conan's clan correct.

It is clear after reading this book that they have very limited understanding of they subject matter. One thing is certain though: they really hate nuclear energy.

Many modern scholars believe that much of what Eusebius, who acutally met the Emperor, was false.Before this book, translated by Averil Cameron and Stuart G.

She was married to Clark Gable. It must have been terribly sad. If you get a chance watch her dance with George Raft on YouTube.Robert Stack is also in this movie.

He is correct. This film was made years before the true extent of Nazi atrocities in Europe became known so some may find the portrayl of Hitler and The Waffen SS as something like the Three Stooges to be a insulting but this film is a product of it's time. Only negative was none of Benny's Radio cast was in the film. I think this film would have had more spice with Eddie Rochester Anderson, Phil Harris, Dennis Day, and Frank Nelson in it. One great thing is we all get one last look at the lovely Carole Lombard. She was the love of Clark Gable's life and like Gable a car enthusiast who in her lifetime owned Bugattis, Duesenbergs, and V-16 Fleetwood Cadillacs."},{"rating":"2","title":"...And They're Going to Name a Cheese After Him","review":"\\"To Be Or Not to Be\\" falls under the rarified category of indispensible. This film is ambitious and it succeeds on all levels it aims for. It is a screwball comedy that is also a thrilling tale of the Polish resistance as well as a lampoon of the absurdly evil nature of the Third Reich. Director Ernst Lubitsch and his collaborators successfully navigate all the intricate threads of this yarn. Jack Benny, in his inimitable deadpan style, is a marvel as ham actor Josef Tura who utilizes his skills to infiltrate the Gestapo. Carole Lombard, in her last film role, is alluring as Tura's wife Maria. Another good comic turn by Sig Ruman as Colonel Erhardt. The DVD also contains an amusing comedy short starring Benny that should not be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, lousy dvd","review":"I must like the movie; this is the second DVD of it I've bought.

Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"He Puts the Ham in Hamlet","review":"To Be or Not To Be is a comedy set during WWII. Although it makes light of a tense time in history, it manages to maintain an air of respect and mischief to keep the viewer at ease. The story revolves around two actors in Poland, Maria and Joseph Tura. Joseph (Jack Benny) specializes in overplaying Hamlet and Maria (Carole Lombard) specializes in seducing younger men in her dressing room as her husband begins his \\"To be or not to be\\" speech. The man she seduces is a soldier who draws her into a dangerous spy situation. Although she is working for the Allies, a Nazi leader attempts to make her a spy for his cause. Madcap comedy ensues as the actors attempt to get them out of the mess.The film is very funny thanks to the brilliant dialogue and acting. It is a real shame that Carole Lombard died after this film was made in a plane crash; she proves to be a very beautiful and talented comedienne."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless classic","review":"\\"To be or not to be\\" IS a great classic movie.

This CD has liner notes that are very informative (as are most Yahoo liner notes) about these evolutionary moves.

Jennings' plot devices were almost exactly the same as in Aztec and his themes of loyalty and betrayal are already wearing at the edges from overuse.

Unfortunately, there is nothing interesting here.

I love the way it tells the story of Cinderella. The actors and actresses fit the part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever After","review":"I have liked this movie since it came out! My 7 year old was interested in a period piece and this movie is a good fit. It has Da Vinci, and although fiction, explores slavery, status, etc. It contains no inappropriate language or sex. He really enjoyed it! Great family movie! Recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"2 words......WONDERFULLY AMAZING","review":"Can I just say this is a great way in telling a wonderful story of Cinderella. It has romance, laughter, fun and good acting by Drew Barrymore and Dougray Scott, it was just so romantic you can never go wrong with this movie..Get your girlfriends and popcorn and watch and enjoy a good movie to let lose to and fantasize what could be.... ENJOY"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies I've ever seen.","review":"Ever After is truly one of the greatest movies of all time. I love the way Drew Barrymore's character thinks for herself and speaks her mind. This Cinderella story shows that the girl is quite often the hero, not the guy. This is a movie for all ages that includes romance, comedy, and a little bit of drama. You'll be laughing one moment, and in tears the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Glass Slipper","review":"A lovestruck story about a young beautiful girl,and the young prince who fall in love. The fastenating story of what people will do fo love! A must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Drew barrymore at her best","review":"This movie is so good that I just had to comment on it. Barrymore plays a Cinderella character who overcomes many trials to finally marry the man of her dreams.I am a big Barrymore fan and have seen most of her movies, but this is the best one yet. If you are not a Barrymore fan you just might end up becoming one after viewing this film. She brings the character of Danielle to life and really makes you feel for her. The chemistry between Danielle and the Crown Prince is outstanding.All the other characters are wonderful and add to the overall quality of the film. This is one movie that the whole family should watch together."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Cinderela movie ever!","review":"My family watched it many times, it's great for all ages! My favorite part is when Danielle(Drew Barrymore) surprises her step-mom as the princess of England. I know one thing is a fact about this movie, all women will love this movie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best love stories!","review":"This movie never gets old! One of the best love stories of all times! Drew Barrymore is amazing in this."},{"rating":"2","title":"For anyone that believes in love","review":"Ever After is a timeless love story for all that believes in love. You are drawn into the hope, the love,and the pain of a love story with a side of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite versions of Cinderella!!","review":"I remember being 10 when I saw the trailer for this movie. I'm 23 and I love this movie more now than I did then. The characters are superbly cast, the acting is excellent from all the actors, the story is unique even as it tells a timeless story and presents complex themes. The story is pretty similar to the basic Cinderella story we all know, except towards the end. There is no fairy godmother save a scene with Leonardo Da Vinci but it didn't matter. Angelica Huston truly was the evil stepmother, her jealousy towards Danielle was evident in the look on her face as her new husband dies says his last words to Danielle. Drew Barrymore wins everyone's heart as Danielle who remains good hearted even as everything is taken from her. Danielle is vulnerable, yet strong and rescues herself--so refreshing to see!! One of the best movies of the 90s and very highly recommended!! Only thing is the DVD doesn't have any special features besides the trailer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most awesome movie EVER!!","review":"This movie is a more realistic take on the classic Cinderella story. Many movies claim to be real Cinderella stories, but this one seriously delivers. It has epic dialogue and beautiful cinematography. It's set back in like the seventeen hundreds and it surely takes you on a trip through time. Drew Barrymore is so good at conveying emotion and keeping you in the movie. There wasn't a point during this movie where i felt that what was supposed to be happening wasn't actually happening. It has been my favorite movie since i was seven andI'm sure you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A dream come true!!!","review":"One of the loveliest Cinderella-adaptions ever! Be enchanted by a dream come true!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I was never a big fan of Drew Barrymore, but I found this movie very entertaining and her performance quite good. It may be considered more of a \\"chick flick,\\" especially considering the whole Cinderella angle. It's one of the few movies I've purchased and have loaned to friends, all of whom have really liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My All-Time Favorite!","review":"First of all, for those of you who can't seem to appreciate this film, you are truly missing out. \\"Ever After\\" was a beautiful movie that made me laughed and cried! And Drew Barrymore is a great actress! This is one of my all-time favorites! And for those of you who complain about the \\"DeVinci\\" typos -- remember that this IS a film purly for entertainment. If it's great (which it is!), nothing else matter. I mean, how much can that slight typo affect the point of the story! \\"Ever After\\" is simply sweet and innocent, anyone can enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"a cinderella for all ages!\\"","review":"I saw this movie on abc family and I have the dvd at home.My favorite part is when danielle socks her one of her step sisters in the eye.its even beter then the julie andrews version.this may be surpising.anjelica huston has also playedthe voice of gothel in barbie as rapunzel"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshing Movie","review":"The old story of Cinderella done in a very creative way. A wonderfully romantic movie with several humerous moments. Drew Barrymore and Dougray Scott are terrific, and Angelica Houston made a great Stepmother. A film that captured the heart and imagination without violence and foul language. The costumes of the time were beautiful. I loved it so much I went out and bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"DA' BOMB","review":"I TOTALLY LOVED THIS MOVIE. I WOULD TAKE ANYONE TO SEE IT. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YOU ARE MISSING A TRULY BOMB DIGGY OF A SHOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drew Barrymore is brilliant","review":"I love this movie so much because she stole my heart as always and I've seen it before because it's the story about Cinderella,who lives with her stepmother and her sisters and it's the perfect movie for all times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deconstructon of a Fairy Tale","review":"Ever after is an impressive attempt at historicising and deconstructing a fairy tale. The novel, unlike the fairy tale, placed events in a historical context. It is France in the Sixteenth Century. More over, the Cinderella of the fairy tale is beautiful, fragile, dependant on the supernatural (magic), and a highly sentimental female; whereas the new Cinderella is every thing feminists want to see in a woman: she is smart, hardworking, has guts, and independent. I loved the scene when Prince Henry towards the end comes dashing to save her from her captor to be faced by a defiant disarrayed woman with dirty nails and dirt smeared face saying \\"I saved myself\\" thus rescinding the conventional tale and emptying it of all its male-superiority claims. The part where she rescues the Prince from the king of Gipsies and carries him on her shoulder says it all. Ever after is a film I would love to show to my students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danielle fights for what she believes is good for people.","review":"In the beginning of the movie, Danielle is protrayed as a well educated and loved little girl who is later turned into a slave by her step-mother. Also by one of her step-sisters. One of the step-sisters is really nice to her and tries to help her through sticky sitiations. Danielle proves herself to be strong-minded and a survivor.So that in the end, she is happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Romantance for all ages!","review":"I laughed, I cried and I definately want this movie! Drew BarryMore was at her best. Ever After is the perfect fairy tale for all ages! Cinderella has always been my favorite fairy tale, but Ever After is a much better version of it. If I could I'd give it 10 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was out of a fairytale!","review":"Ever After is the romance movie of the year. Houstan, Barrymore, and Scott's performance was excellent.The movie is long but worthwile. The plot is well developed.The movie is far better than you would expect!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood fable brought to life with a twist!","review":"What a roar! A classic child adored fable snags the attention of an older audience! Wonderful cast of characters and great screen play. The simple little twist added to Ever After made Cinderella more interesting! Two very enthusiastic thumbs way up on the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best love stories ever","review":"Credit to Drew Barrymore for her performance in a Cinderella role. This one is a gem of a story, beautifully told. The inclusion of Leonardo da Vinci as a quirky senior inventor and friend adds a light-hearted note to the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"This gift was for a family member, they love it and there was no damge to the case and came in its plastic wrapping, I can't watch it but she hasn't called me, it arrived in good time and they were real nice about writing me back to let me know where it was, I gave them 5 stars for great service and there was no damage to the package, I would order from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite Drew Barrymore movies","review":"Drew Barrymore is my favorite actress. She is funny and yet can do great drama. This rendition of the Cinderella story will lighten your heart and is also safe enough for young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite movies...","review":"I've watched this movie several times and I enjoy it everytime as much as I did the first time I watched it. It's a fun, corny, love-conquers movie. It's one of my favorite Barrymore films."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!!","review":"I liked \\"Ever-After: A Cinderella Story\\" because Danielle (Drew Barrymore) is a strong character. She knows how to defend herself physically and speaks her mind to both men and women in all stations, which sometimes does her in. That means the character Danielle isn't flawless. Even though Danielle lies to save one of the servants and passes herself off as a noblewoman-cousin living with her stepmother and step-sisters, her intentions are true to her nature. I plan to rent it again in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new favorite movie!!","review":"This movie will be added to my list of favorites. The actors are very impressive with their portrayals of the characters. Each and every character is defined beautifully! Drew Barrymore was already one of my favorite actors, and after \\"Ever-After,\\" Dougray Scott is on the list as well. A must see! Not just a chick-flick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinderella meets Ally McBeal","review":"This real-to-life Cinderella, actually Danielle, shows that there was more to the little cinder girl than a sweet demure nature. She is bolder, more intelligent, and no wear near as big of a doormat for her stepmother and stepsisters. In the same respect the stepsister are a far cry from ugly and wicked, well, at least one of them is. The story centers around the love of a young girl for her father and also for her prince. But, can a prince love a girl who has no father, and sleeps in the ashes? The lovers seem unlikely, except for the help of one painter, who shall remain nameless. This movie shows that true love conquers all, and, what goes around comes around."},{"rating":"2","title":"I REALLY REALLY LOVED IT!!!!!!!!","review":"I watched this movie with some friends and I was so intrigued with the drama and the actors and actresses. Namely, Dougray Scott and Drew Barrymore. I would recommend this to anyone I meet. It is a great film to watch as a family."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN AWSOME MOVIE!!!!","review":"I went to the cinima and watched it. It was a great movie!!! I really loved it. I've now seen it at least 7 or 8 times already. And I have bought the movie. That's how much I loved it. It's a romantic, drama, action movie. I highly recomend it to other viewers. I love Drew Barrymore. I've seen just about all of her films. They are also great movies that should be checked out too. I think everyone should see Ever After. I think you would really like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie I saw all summer~","review":"I went to see a lot of movies this summer, and this one is the best! Barrymore does a very good job at playing Danyelle, and the prince guy...well, he does an adequate job, I guess. The movie line is a cinderella story that actually could have happened. It was one of my favorite movies of all time. I very highly recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"This fim is a sad and loving film all in one!","review":"I enjoyed this film because it not only involved the girl but the guy was in it more. It was not like the story that we all had reas to us when we were children. It is more open to the world and it is well defined. I loved this movie 5 stras! It is worth paying however much to get it! ~Rachel M."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Drew Barrymore does an excellent job portraying \\"Cinderella\\" as a strong, determined woman who doesn't NEED a fairy godmother, (just a little help from da Vinci!) Angelica Huston is magnificient as the stepmother, extremely realistic and just a great job by all involved with the project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing............","review":"Drew Barrymore stood out most definatly in this movie! I loved it so much! Everyone should go see it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I love the movie \\"Ever After.\\" I couldn't give it five stars, because, though it is very good, it just doesn't rate up there with romance classics like \\"Casablanca,\\" \\"Gone With The Wind,\\" and \\"From Here to Eternity.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"sominex!","review":"Wake me up when the movie is over! This was an absolute dud; boring and banal. Waste of celluloid."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is totally incorrect with history and the tale.","review":"Not only is this movie totally historically incorrect, but it also loses a lot of what the tale itself brings. -5 STARS~~~!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Now I don't have the DVD, but I've seen the movie. I'm sorry to say but it was a huge waste. A boring \\"chick flick\\", i HATED IT. It was boring, stupid, and it could barely keep my attention. It was the story of Cinderella, played by Drew Barrymore, but I feel that the Disney version is much better. This movie was horrible, pretty sets, but boring. I reccomend it to nobody, unless you like this type of boring, nonsense, \\"chick flick\\" movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"This movie was just horrible! I'd rather see the cartoon version by Disney then this. You never get hooked in with a plot, if you can even find out the plot. The acting is done horriblly. The directing is also horrible. There is nothing right with this movie except the fact that Drew Barrymore is in it. Even she's horrible in this movie. Go see a good movie with her in it like The Wedding Singer. Skip this movie, but if you must, rent it first. Trust me, you won't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great twist on an old favorite.","review":"This is a great retelling of the the old Disney fairy tale...Drew Barrymore is outstanding (I usually don't like her work), and plays a smart, strong heroine with grace and humor. Everyone from my 65+ mom, through my seventeen year old daughter down to my wee ones enjoyed this movie very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic, smart, and enveloping. A great fary tale!","review":"God knows I love Drew Barrymore. Ever since The Wedding Singer, I've been entranced. She does indeed seem to be living up to her Butterfly metaphor. \\"ugly and awkward\\" to start...though she was never ugly, she was hardly an angel. But recently, she has evolved into a truely great actress, person, and I had to admit my heart took an extra beat when I saw her in her wings in this movie. The lovely Angel Barrymore.Ahem...but the rest of the movie was also great. Hehe. DaVinchi's protrail was excellent and humerous, and the entire movie had an air of entertainment and fun mixed with a plot and dialouge that an older audience will love. Romantics from every generation will smile, and cheer. A very intellegent, fufilling movie. Rated on the Internet Movie Database as a TOP 10 MOVIE of 1998. It deserves it's high status, too. Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S BETTER THAN ROMEO AND JULIT.","review":"IT'S THE BEST ROMANCE MOVIE THAT I SEEN I COULD WACTH MILLIONS OF TIMES AND STELL LAUGH ON THE PARTS"},{"rating":"2","title":"The real down-to-Earth Cinderella...","review":"'Ever After' was so delightful! I loved it! Drew Barrymore was so wonderful in it! She played Danielle perfectly and I just couldn't wait until she ended up with Prince Henry. The story was so real...unlike the fairy tale version. I loved it"},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!!","review":"I am a HUGE Drew Barrymore fan and I thought her performance in this movie was great! It's a must see for anyone who enjoys a good movie no matter age or gender. My brother, a Korn fan and lover of fighting movies, enjoyed this movie very much. My dad, who usually doesn't like 'teen flicks', thought this was one of the greatest movies he's ever seen and that is straight from his mouth! I absolutely loved the plot, costumes, and scenery and the acting was SUPERB! Well, that's all for know."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"I am going to buy this movie and watch it over and over and over and over again because I will never get tired of it"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Ever After\\"- sweet, charming--yet profound.","review":"This movie does not pretend to be Gone with the Wind, but beneath its wonderfully romantic surface, there are important lessons about justice, trust, and truth behind fantasy. It makes you wonder if behind every fairy tale, there is a real history yearning to be seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Synopis requires proofreading!","review":"This is a favorite in my home, so I must try to set something right.From the product page synopsis:\\"This Cinderella is far from a victim. Much to her stepmother's demise, Danielle's independence and intelligence attract the love of the prince.\\"\\"Much to her stepmother's DEMISE?\\" Really? I thought that the stepmother is relegated to laundry duty at the end of this tale, not sent off the guillotine!\\"Much to her stepmother's DISMAY\\", maybe?Obvious errors like the above are just very demising."},{"rating":"2","title":"feminist twist, with Leonardo da Vinci as fairy godmother","review":"When my daughter put this on, I was skeptical, to say the least. Oy, I thought, another bad romantic comedy. Well, I am happy to report that I was dead flat wrong: this is a funny, intelligent take on a an old story and it really works. The actors are uniformly excellent and the story is even somewhat believable. Cinderella is a tough smart chick, the prince is rebellious and open-minded, and Leonardo is a wise manipulator. This is a really fun watch, witty and with good values and not stupidly unrealialistic or blankly politically correct.I recommend this for family watching. There is something in it for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very charming movie","review":"600 people have said it well before me, so I won't go into details. This is a very charming movie that sometimes brought a smile to my face, and sometimes a tear to me eye. Well worth watching.The DVD is nothing special. The subtitles are thankfully below the movie (and I think would be visible even on a wide screen TV, with the movie's aspect ratio of 2.35:1). I listened to it on a mono TV, so can't comment about the surround quality. There are no special features apart from the trailer. The root menu is nice. It has some animation and has music playing, which already starts drawing you into the mood of the movie. At least, it did for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful reminder to believe in ourselves","review":"First to correct, the movie does not take place during the 1600's but the sixteenth century which as we know would make this during the 1500's;therefore it is entirely valid that Leonardo DeVinci is a vital character in this film. I truly loved the way the director and screenwriters took a simple imaginative fairytale and turned it to a believable story, where personal triumph is the greatest gift if one has the courage and conviction to look within ourselves. Throughout this story our \\"Cinderella\\", known as Danielle never strays far from who she is inside. So few people today have the courage to stand up for another person,or their beliefs,to take risks,and fight for what is right. This movie was beautifully written, has a remarkable music score, and a cast of fantastic actors,not too mention being set in a breathtaking area of France. I can not recommend this film enough. It is one I will treasure for my lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinderella with a twist","review":"A mediocre fairy tale turned into a wonderful piece of art! This film portrayed Cinderella (Drew Barrymore) in such a way that you cannot help but fall in love with the story.You get to meet the prince, Cinderella's best friend, The \\"Fairy Godmother\\" (Leonardo DaVinci - which was charming beyond belief) and her step-sisters. They are all cast in quite a different light and it draws you right in. The costuming and acting were quite superb. The movie keeps you rooting 'Cindersoot' on.Do yourself a favor and get this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, charming, superb!","review":"Drew Barrymore is perfect as a strong, courageous, imaginative Cinderella, whose prince falls in love with her for her character and wit rather than her beauty. Angelica Huston is absolutely splendid as the wicked stepmother. She and Drew Barrymore make this movie! The supporting actors are also superb. The setting is realistic and the human psychology far more realistic than the fairy-tale cartoon that everyone has seen. Get this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great get-away movie!","review":"This is one of our favorites to pop into the VCR. Wonderful for a rainy day or when you just want to curl-up in your favorite chair. My husband will even sit down and watch it with us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Drew's best film to date","review":"Ever after is a beautiful cinderella story that portraits a strong and willed woman as cinderella. Settings are very good and the mood of the film is extraordinary. All comes to a beautiful love story very well cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Modern Version of Cinderella","review":"Ever After is one of my favorite films. I saw it when it came out and I've just watched the DVD. It tells the Cinderella story in a new way. This Cinderella is gutsier, braver and more believable than the classic story book story would have us think. She knows about equality and independence and she's outspoken. Her Prince Charming is really cute, too! Angelica Huston's Wicked Stepmother is a lot of fun, though the viewer wants to protect Cinderella from her. I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless.","review":"Timeless movie! The dvd has both full and wide screen options, plus spanish and french audio and subtitles. The French dubbing is particularly well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"One of my favorite movie! I've watched it more then five times. It's a good one for anyone who like watch it on a girls' night out."},{"rating":"2","title":"All time movie that everyone has to see!","review":"This classic movie of cinderella was a exciting and funny movie. There was action and romance and I loved the twist on how her sister is not so evil. This movie will have to be put in my collection. A must see flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Romantic Film Ever!","review":"I absolutely loved this movie, watching it at least 5 times in 2 days. This movie is a wonderful contemporary adaptation to one of the best-loved classics of all time. It is incredibly romantic and makes us believe in the power of the human heart. Yet it is also tastefully funny, preventing it from being too dramatic or serious. I highly recommend this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic best ever cinderella story","review":"This movie makes you fall in love with the main actor and truly like Drew Barrymore's work as an actress. Everyone comes out shining in this movie. Where can I find a guy like Dougray Scott? :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing!!","review":"This was a movie that i had to go see twice in the theaters because i loved it so much. drew's character was tough when she needed to be and calm and ladylike otherwise. prince henry was a sight for sore eyes, he can play prince charming anytime he likes. but by far the best part of the movie is when danielle popped her little blonde twit of a stepsister in the head.... i almost fell off my chair laughing. an all around great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever And Ever After","review":"This is one of my fav films. Drew Barrymore stars as Danielle, a modern 16th century woman. She is no wimp. Faced with the death of her beloved father & then the cruelty of her stepmother and one of two stepsisters, Danielle still has optimism & a sunny view of life. She uses her brains as well as her charm to win the admiration and heart of the dashing Prince Henry (newcomer Dougray Scott).When Danielle is sold to the evil Pierre Le Pieu (the deliciously wicked Richard O'Brien), Prince Henry goes to rescue her. But Danielle needs no rescuing. She has the situation well in hand as Henry discovers when he sees her exit Le Pieu's castle, her freedom & virtue intact.As always, Anjelica Huston gives a winning performance as the Baroness, Danielle's cruel stepmother. She & Richard O'Brien give villainy a new name.I think everyone will enjoy this version of the Cinderella story. It is one to watch over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever After is one of the classics! A wonderful movie.","review":"My 12-year old daughter and I saw the movie in the theater and loved it. We purchased it as soon as it was released on video. It is a heart-warming and interesting film with great performances. Drew is perfect as the insightful and compassionate Cinderella (Danielle) and Dougray Scott is a hottie! Angelica Houston is a delight as the stepmother and the step-sisters are portrayed well. The French castles and scenery were superb and the costumes magnificant. If you like \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and \\"Little Women\\" you must add \\"Ever After\\" to your video collection today."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!","review":"How anyone could dislike this movie is beyond me.

The photography is lush, the locations and costumes are exquisite and at last there is a strong female lead in an action adventure. As the parent of a seven year old daughter, I am always looking for movies with intelligent, assertive female leads in movies that will keep a child's attention.This film has it all.Drew Barrymore and the rest of the cast are sublime. Highly reccommended !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie","review":"I just saw this movie today and thought that it was good, but not the best Drew movie I have ever seen. I am personally a Wedding Singer Fan. Anyway, this movie was a little too predictable in places and weak in some areas.

Definitely a must see for anyone who loves love stories, or any other kind of movie for that matter. I loved it!!! It had action, comedy, romance, and was a tearjerker all in one!

My 10 year old who is just discovering boys wanted to know if that was what it was like when her dad and I fellin love.(if only) I highly recommend this movie for romantics of all ages.

I was proven to be delightfully wrong. Drew is a most believable Cinderella and the visuals were stunning. My compliments."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Movie Not Just For Children","review":"You might say \\"Cinderella\\" is a story ment for little girls. This is not so with this movie. Not only did it have the traditional love story of Cinderlla, it aslo had things a boy would like too. The sword fights were really great. Not mention that it had a lot of good humor. This updated version brings the longtime classic into the 90's. The story no longer portrays Cinderella a this weak girl who lets everyone walk all over her. It give the main character a chance to take pot shots at the ones who are making her life miserible. I aslo liked the scenery.Along with a few historical figures this has to be the best version of \\"Cinderella\\" I have ever seen. But, the best thing I really loved was the costumes. They were very origanal.I really loved Drew Berrymore's costume. I think this was the best performence she ever givin.Next to her performence in \\"The Wedding Singer\\". Finally, it gives a version of \\"Cinderella even an adult would enjoy over,and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST SEE MOVIE!","review":"I absolutely LOVED this movie, and I ordered it from Amazon as soon as it came out. I enjoyed seeing a Cinderella that had guts. She knew how to handle everyone, and didn't get pushed around by everyone. I'm glad to see that one stepsister actually helped her. This was a great movie and I recommend it to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A definte must see for all those romantic at heart.","review":"This film is exceptional. It is an adaptation of the beloved fairy tale Cinderella and captures the story exceptionally. The movie combines an excellent cast, vivid lines, and breathtaking costumes. Dougray Scott and Drew Barrymore have excellent chemistry together and make the movie come alive. You'll want to see this one again and again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Un-Cinderella, Cinderella Story.","review":"This is the Cinderella story for the strong, intellectual girls and women of the world. Our Cinderella in this story is educated and strong willed, she is not waiting for a Prince to come and save her, she makes her own choices, and is the better for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever After- An Excelent Movie","review":"Ever After is and exelent, brilent, exciting, I could go on and on but the point is it's great.I like that the stuck to the Cinderella part with the evil step mother but in this case there is only one evil step sister the other one is desigring about it all.And I also like the difference in the Cinderella part because it makes the movie more interasting and exciting. And I like it that Danille(Cinderalla) and the Prince knew each other before the main Cinderalla part. And I also like it that they had the part when the father dies and that they say where the movie is taking place. Oh and you never know whats going to happen next.Rent or Buy this movie today, you'll love it. Happy watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BELIEVABLE Cinderella Story","review":"My friend introduced me to this movie, and at first I thought to myself, \\"Great, another boring love story...\\"! I was wrong! Ever After: A Cinderella Story, is probably the most exciting love story ever put on video. Drew Barrymore gives an unforgettable and captivating performance! Meanwhile, her co-stars also play very compelling roles!Anjelica Huston plays the evil stepmother. To my experience as a performer, this is very hard to do, for many-a-time, you can easily over act the part, but Ms Huston is careful not to do so.Also, in this movie, there is one wicked stepsister, while the other one is very caring and not well liked by her mother.This movie makes you believe that Cinderella, her glass slippers, and Prince Charming really could have existed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the movie","review":"I LOVED this movie! If you are an incurable romantic I think this is definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderfully sweet romance for everyone","review":"i just loved this movie! i have seen it at least 7 times already! it's romantic and fun with rich characters and a heroine you root for! drew barrymore plays \\"danielle\\" the poor servant girl who steals the heart of the prince. as \\"prince henry\\", dougray scott is utterly (forgive me) charming! keep your eyes on him in the future, i believe he is the next major international star. angelica huston is wickedly wonderful as the \\"evil stepmother\\". this movie is warm,funny and romantic without being to sappy. i'd say more but i'm going to go watch \\"ever after\\" now. buy it, rent it, but dont miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can watch this movie again and again","review":"Ever After is my favorite Drew Barrymore film. Unfortunately, this 5 star movie can only receive 4 stars from me because of the lack of special features included on this DVD. There really isn't any. But the film is amazing. It is funny, sad, frustrating, poetic and victorious. In the film, it says that this is the true tale of Cinderella, and the story then proceeds to be told. Anjelica Houston is pure evil as the stepmother of Danielle. It really makes you hate her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable!","review":"This is a cleverly done version of Cinderella, nothing profound, but Anjelica Huston absolutely steals the show as the wicked stepmother. Drew Barrymore is surprisingly good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever After","review":"If you like \\"Time Period\\" movies you'll love this one. After seeing it at the theatre, well I just had to have it for my collection. I loved the fantasy feel of the movie. Drew did a great job in my eyes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!!!","review":"I saw this movie at the theater first and enjoyed it thoroughly. Then I rented it from the video store and still enjoyed it thoroughly. I even found some things in the movie that I missed in the theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best Cinderella story ever done!!!!!","review":"I have seen all the Cinderella storys and this is the one that beats them all. Drew Barrymore is a perfect choice for the part of Danielle along with all the other characters. This is a movie that I will want to watch over and over again. Children of all ages will enjoy this movie. I'm 17 and I don't watch much PG movies, but this movie is the exeption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Censorship at its Best (I mean worst)","review":"Warning: This movie is not what the director intended. First, it is the pan & scan version, meaning you are NOT seeing the entire picture. You are losing information on the sides because the film is \\"matted to fit your television.\\" You're just not seeing the whole movie.But even worse, this video tape has 3 profanities removed to force it down to a PG rating, although the theatrical release was PG-13. If you plan on supporting this video release, why not burn some books too? If you really want to see the ENTIRE film, rent or buy the DVD which maintains the proper aspect ratio and doesn't censor the director and writer's intended dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does everyone say this is great movie?","review":"Why does everyone put four or five stars for this movie??? Barrymore is completly miss casting as Cinderella. She is not a image of Cinderella at all to me. Only Anjelica Houston is correct at casting as the step mother. I enjoyed the \\"Disney Cinderella\\" more than this. I shouldn't of bought this video and I wish my money will come back!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sappy chick flick","review":"Nothing but the ruining of a perfectly good story...changing a historic tale is a diabolical sin"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow!.. How did this get made..","review":"I'm not sure if it's the pathetic script or acting that irks me the most. I had to sit suffer through this movie twice on an airplane ride to italy. What a terrible way it was to start a trip. I'd like to know if anyone actually has an opinion on this.. all of the 5 star reviews just say.. great, fantastic, I loved it! Why? When the acting so stiff you want to press your face into the seat in front of you (maybe to make it go away), and the script is so jagged (all of the erroneous time references - i.e. DaVinci.) I guess I just feel like I could have vomited up a better work of art. Don't waste your time.. if you have the option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertainment It's Not","review":"This movie is not even close to the original Cinderella. Being rife with with feminism, Utopianism, class struggle and even some situational ethics, I felt that I was being given a political lecture rather than being entertained. Cinderella, in this version, rescued the prince and herself, certainly a departure from the origninal story. The prince was uncertain if he wanted to marry Cinderella because of her class. The gypsy-robbers were portrayed as being honorable while the prince apologized for his lack of honor.The scenery was pretty at times, but overall it looked low-budget, especially the scenes from the ball.The characters were miscast and boring except for Angelica Huston who played the role of the stepmother well. I don't know how this movie got 5 stars as it has virtually no redeeming features."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a wonderful love story, but it wasn't sappy. GREAT","review":"I think the movie was an excellent example of not going overboard with a Cinderella story. This was great, and very good acting was shown. I think that no matter what type of person you are, you need to see this."},{"rating":"2","title":"it made me want to see it over and over again.","review":"this film has touched me like only one other has and that was robinhood. this is a film that i will definately add to my personal collection so that i can enjoy it over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"A REFRESHING LOOK AT LOVE AND ALL THAT IT SHOULD BE!!","review":"I LOVE this movie! It left me with such joy to see that true love can conquer any situation or troubles that stand in its path. The prince was so arrogant and too proud to listen to his heart at first, but as he said in the movie \\"you are my match in every way. Please don't tell me I've lost her.\\" He eventually put his pride aside and gave into the one thing he desired most in life - a true love. This story also was a good example of all those nasty people in this world like her evil sister, who try there hardest to keep two people who should be together from being together. This movie made me laugh, get angry, frustrated and even cry. I have not seen a movie I have enjoyed so much since \\"The Princess Bride\\". Great job to the entire cast!!!!! This movie will continue to reach peoples hearts, especially men who can't seem to decide if the woman they are with is their match. (just like Henry asked Leonardo DiVinci in the movie) BRAVO!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good. Kept you on the edge of your seat.

He didn't have any desire to see it cause he thought it would be romantic, sappy and not have enough to keep him interested. He was pleasantly suprised. We saw it twice in the theatre together and he even went to see it again. He has even already ordered the video, and he is normally an all action flick kinda guy. It's a movie that anyone can enjoy because the story is so tried and true and it was so beautiful portrayed in this version. Its a must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairy-tale lovers get ready!!!!!","review":"Ever After is one of my favorite movies of all time!

I also bought the book, and the CD, which is so beautiful- all the memories of the film come rushing back to you!

She has an amazing talent and in this movie she proves that she can portray a modern-day Cinderella. This movie was wonderfully done, and the scenery you witness is breathtaking.

Yeah, it's the story of Cinderella, slightly revised. I know that, you know that, enjoy it for what it is. It's really not as trite as it seems. They did a good job expanding a relatively simple, 1-dimensional story line into something more reminiscent of Pride & Prejudice, I daresay! by turning \\"Prince Charming\\" into a spoiled snob, and \\"Cinderella\\" into a modern-thinking wit. Dougray and Drew are great in their roles and have wonderful chemistry together. And the addition of Leonardo da Vinci? Perfect!The accents are a nice try, but in their defense, to be \\"historically\\" accurate they would've had to speak French, so let it go.I have seen this movie dozens of times and I'll watch it a dozen more. It's just good fun. 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic you gotta have!!","review":"Always love this film and I needed to add it to my collection... it's the kind of classic you want, Drew B. and Dougray S. are perfect and you never get tired of watching this.... 5 stars and more if possible! ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised!","review":"Yes, I sure was surprised to like and even be somewhat charmed by this retelling of the Cinderella story starring Drew Barrymore and Anjelica Huston. I had been dragged off to the theatre by a friend--just being obliging, you know.Well, Drew Barrymore does a very good job as the more than slightly feminist Cinderella character, and Huston gives us a wickedly nasty stepmother. Interpolation of Leonardo Da Vinci into the film as a pseudo godmother works surprisingly well.Looking for some romantic escapism? Then turn to \\"Ever After\\" and have a delightful time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Blu Ray Quality Not Movie","review":"I love this movie, I would give it 5 stars if I was just rating the movie. However, this review is for the quality of the Blu Ray. It went on sale and I was very happy I was going to be able to replace my DVD copy. As soon as I started watching it I realized the quality was possibly even worse than my DVD. I would have to play them side by side to make an accurate assessment. The picture was grainy and in some spots blurry. The other odd thing was in scenes where Leonardo is wearing a white hat, there is a double halo/shadow effect going on. When there is a scene with bright light (for example any outdoor scene) the entire shot is blown out. When it's dark, the black is grainy with no crispness whatsoever. I literally felt like I was watching an old VCR edition. This movie is so beautifully shot and such a wonderful story I am so disappointed the blu-ray didn't live up to my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I absolutely loved this movie.

I swear if they go from dvds to something new, I'll go postal.Drew Barrymore is wonderful, Riff Raff from Rocky Horror Picture Show is perfect, as really is the whole cast.

As a native speaker of Turkish (I teach Turkish, thus I have the book) I find the dialogues and passages artificial. Some idioms and phrases are used out of place and depending on the context the learner may choose to use them, they may result in embarrasment on the part of the speaker and/or hearer.In terms of the organization of a language teaching/learning book, like many other non-English teaching books, it does not follow the criteria for a good book; such as presenting the subject matter clearly and in an organized way so that it is not confusing for the learner. The exercises are usually controlled, which is not a very good thing.All in all, it fails in three important aspects: The correct use of the language and grammar, the authentic use of them, and the organization of the material.I hope there are better alternatives around.

Those differences are vital in Turkish, especially for beginners (like me). My guess is that this is due to optical character reading problems.I suspect this will be cleared up in the future.

Put one slice of velveeta chees in while melting the butter (I melt the butter while the noodles are draining so as to melt the butter and velveeta faster) and add 1/3 cup milk. What you'll have is a less expensive version of the really creamy macaroni and cheese that Kraft sells for a lot more money. By adding extra milk and cheese they're even getting more calcium. My kids love it when I throw in hot dogs and even peas so feel free to throw in other things since it's so cheesy (the extra cheesy sauce will take things like peas that kids don't normally eat and make them taste good).

Hitting the key events with a perfect mix of detail and pace, Keegan presents a flowing narrative that is both extremely educational and greatly entertaining. At just over 400 pages of text, Keegan never gets bogged down in any one battle or national experience. That is not to say that Keegan ignores or simplifies important episodes of the war. For instance, his examinations of the French Mutinies of 1917 and the growing desperation of a starving Germany in late 1918 are first rate. His presentations of battles such as the Marne, the Somme, Verdun, Tannenberg, and others are all wonderfully fleshed out and informative. If you're looking for deep insight into any one leader or government, look elsewhere. If you're looking a grand, easy to read narrative of the whole war, which does indeed contain many new and critical insights, Keegan's book is sure to delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent military history from Keegan, as usual","review":"Very good overview of the war as war, with social, technological and diplomatic background. As this is a military history, you may want to supplement your reading of this book with others. Tuchman's 'The Guns of August' on the war's origins; Fussell's 'The Great War and Modern Memory' on the larger social context and impact of the war; Winter's 'Death's Men' for the soldier's view. I also recommend the novel 'A Very Long Engagement' by Japrisot.I would give Keegan's book five stars, but, as others have noted, this book desperately needs more maps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timely and relevant.","review":"This book provides an essential education that puts current events in Europe into the proper perspective. Having recently read \\"Citizen Soldiers\\" by Stephen Ambrose, I found myself wanting to explore the causes of World War II. Keegan does an excellent job of showing how the aggression of Germany in the 30's was a direct result of the outcome of WWI. I enhanced my reading of Keegans book by simultaneously reading \\"Back to the Front\\" by Stephen O'Shea, who walked the length of the trench lines to give us a contemporary view of the physical scars that remain to this day. Keegan's book is very readable and I highly recommend it to anyone who is at all curious about European current events."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Textbook","review":"But a very difficult read if you're wanting to learn more about the experience of the war. You get plenty of names, dates, battles, armies, but it becomes a jumbled mush of facts without anything to make it really interesting. I found that I had to keep notes to manage who was on what side. Like the Russian officer Rennenkampf. That's a German name, fittingly because Rennenkampf was Prussian, but so many names come at you so fast, it just messes you up.This book is hardly a page turner. More of a \\"read that sentence again to try to clear things up\\" book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down by lack of maps","review":"Leaving aside Keegan's leaden prose style, the major problem I have with this (original hardcopy edition, 1998) is the of the lack of maps. Because of this I got no further than the chapter dealing with the Battle of the Frontiers and the Marne. It's very frustrating to be told in great detail about army movements without being able to see a pictorial representation. It's meaningless (and dull) to be told how X Division moved from town A to town B, failed to caputure town C, lost control of town D and then was forced back to river E without being able to see where they are. This is typical of the level of description, and yet there are only 10 maps in a book of 450 pages. All in all it makes for a dull and monotonous read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Which Way and Where","review":"I must concur with many of the reviewers. A plethora of place names, regiments, and troop movements, and a dearth of battle maps negatively impacts what is otherwise an incredibly lucid history. I can only suggest using a fairly detailed atlas to complement one's following the battlefield action. Otherwise, this is a tremendous work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Detail drowns analysis","review":"Could not agree less with professional reviewer who said the book does a good job of making technical detail understandable. I thought the detail was excessive when compared to the analysis asserted. May be a good book for historians, but not the general reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good historical account","review":"This is a well researched and very inclusive book, but the author is no Stephen Ambrose in that his account is often dry and not that readable. This book is best for those who want an overall narrative about the war that includes every aspect (the section on the Gallipoli campaign is particulary enlightening). Keegan also does a good job in documenting just how much World War I has shaped subsequent historical events. Overall, a good read for history buffs but probably not for the average reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"British\\" First World War","review":"I found this book quite unsatisfactory. The main focus is always on the Western Front (shockingly leaving out the Americans and their indispensable human and logistical support). The Eastern and Italian fronts are almost completely left out. The Author seem to ignore that millions of soldiers fought and died far from the Marne and the Somne (being Italian myself, I would like to remind the Author that the Italians had 600,000 dead and millions of wounded in the Great War). The sacrifice of Russian and Italian soldiers kept hundreds of German and Austrian divisions far from the Western front and the British troops. And what about the big blounder of the Peace of Versailles? Is still too embarassing for Mr Keegan to talk about it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A massive disappointment","review":"John Keegan has written military histories that transcend the genre, giving a reader insight into how technology and social and economic forces have shaped the face and outcomes of battle over the millenia. This ain't one of them. The first 50 pages is a traditional and readable account of the beginnings of WW I. While I disagree with Prof. Keegan's premise that WW I could have been averted by better communication, the beginning was at least interesting. The book thereafter degenerates into the minutiae of troop movements, offering little insight and no maps to help the reader follow what Keegan is talking about. I expected more from this master and was greatly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive but very dense","review":"There is wonderful detail in this work but for me, as a casual reader, it was a little too dense and academic. As other reviewers have mentioned, the maps provided are too few and somewhat confusing. Additionally, Keegan's accounts of individual fighting units need more context and explanation for the beginning armchair historian. Keegan assumes his reader already has a working knowledge of warfare generally and the Great War in particular. If this is your first book about WWI, perhaps you should chose another one to familiarize yourself with the basics - then choose Keegan to deepen your understanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done!","review":"John Keegan's latest book is another must read history tome by the master himself. While I prefer war novels such as The Triumph and the Glory, Cold Mountain, or The Killer Angels to nonfiction histories, Keegan's style is so readable I always make an exception for him. The First World War is an excellent book by a world class military historian."},{"rating":"1","title":"World Bore One","review":"Like sominex in a dust jacket. Keegan covers familiar ground in thuddingly dull fashion. Tough sledding even for history buffs."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"This book misses its point. It's written in a novel style rather then in style of documentary prose like it should be. There is also a lack of exact informations and I expected more maps, more dates, names, weapon-types...At some spots a little bit confusing too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"The lack of maps is only one probem. This book is far less a narrative than it is a litany of facts (armies, corps, battles, leaders, etc.). Only rarely does Keegan employ compelling, elegant prose as described on the book's jacket. His paragraphs, at times, ramble beyond an entire page. Keegan also appears fond of changing subjects completely within the same paragraph. An apt question would be, \\"Where were his editors?\\" I found Keegan's \\"The Face of Battle\\" to be a wonderful, fascinating read. This book falls far short of its potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turning excitement into boredom","review":"I have heard Mr. Keegan speak in person, read his other books,I have taught World War I and find it a fascinating subject.So I was anxious to read this book. What a disappointment! Is this another case of author burnout? riding the wave of past glory? I am more than 3/4 of a way through the book and I am tempted to stop. He has taken an awesome topic and turned it in to something as dry as sawdust. Historians usually agree that this war was a turning point in so many ways. This is not coming across in this book. The human dimension is missing here-much too technical. His writing style gets in the way. About every 3 or 4 pages he produces a sentence structure that leaves me wondering \\"What was that?\\" Where was his editor? Missing like most these days? Or once you become THE John Keegan, you don't need an editor? This book is historian/writer burnout at is worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review Addendum","review":"I reviewed this book previously and did not like it (see below). I just finished a competing volume, The Great War, by Spencer C. Tucker. The Tucker book is half as long and superior in all respects to Keegan's book. Readers searching for a good introduction to WWI should go to Tucker's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Keegan at his best but still good work","review":"While not as eloquent in depicting the true nature of war as fictional accounts are able to because of their more flexible formats, 'The First World War' can measure up to and even exceed the popularity of spellbinding war novels like 'The Triumph and the Glory' and 'All Quiet on the Western Front' because John Keegan has such a great understanding of conflict and presents it in such a manner that the reader can't help but turn the page. I hope he keeps writing military history for a long, long time. Bravo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cries Out for a Rewrite","review":"I have finally finished the book. In an earlier review, I choked on the poor writing style--you can see this review a few weeks earlier at Amazon. Keegan needs to revise this book, and this time, he must take control of the map making. There are not enough maps (lots of earlier reviewers have complained about this), and the person who made the maps did not read what is written in the text. First, there needs to be five times as many maps. Secondly, the towns that were involved in the battles must be shown on the maps. Thirdly, the maps must show topology--we need to see the mountains, lakes, and bogs (and how about boundaries between the countries?). Can you believe that there is only one major map showing all the Western battle fields from 1914 to 1918 and that appears on about page 125? I am going to the library and search for a better book on WW1."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first history book I have ever read in two sittings","review":"This is the first history book that I have ever read in two sittings. I just could not put it down. I know people have varied tastes and expectations, and I respect this. But how anyone (not trying to be unkind) can give this book one or two stars bewilders me. Mr. Keegan's writing style is so lucid, so coherent, so easy to read and understand, so unpretentious that he took a subject that I knew very little about and made it come alive. He gave me an overall picture of the european political, civilian and military mindset of that era. I am a layman, maybe that is why I so thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated this book. If I had a PhD in history, maybe I would be more critical. For anyone who, like myself has (had) limited knowledge of the Great War. The war to end all wars, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A balanced treatment","review":"A balanced treatment of the First World War. Much emphasis is spent on the military aspects of the conflict. While the social and economic issues of the war are mentioned, the bulk of the book is concerned with tactics and command decisions. Keegan gives an excellent treatment of the war on all fronts, giving a virtual blow-by-blow as the conflict dragged on. For those looking for details about how the war was fought from a technical, command perspective, I highly recommend it. If you are looking for a book that will give you some feeling for what the war was like for the average soldier, I would look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent ... but","review":"A brilliantly compiled work with some interesting and original analysis, especially on the inevitability of war once mobilization on the part of the French and Germans had commenced. My only criticism was on a part of the first war that I particularly wanted some insight into: The relevance, or otherwise, of the peripheral campaigns, especially in the Middle East. Most historians dismiss this theater either as an irrelevance or completely overplay its importance. Although Mr. Keegan addressed the Russian front in detail, and touched on the Italian, Balkan and colonial fronts en passe, I was a little disappointed that a little more detail on Allenby's campaigns, and their importance (or otherwise), was not forthcoming: I would like to have seen Mr. Keegan's keen insights on this aspect of the war expanded upon. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this otherwise superb work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A readable text book!","review":"Keegan does it well! This book illuminates the war to end all wars and captures the sweep of the first global conflict. Keegan details the primary causes and the primary instigators of the conflict. You really come to understand how about 15 individuals and a lot of national pride led to the deaths of millions. While not a truly \\"modern\\" war, many of the instruments of death were well hoaned (e.g. the rifle, the machine gun and artillery). This book describes the horror of trench warfare, details the attacks and defenses, the general's attempts to break the stalemate, the mathematics of attrition, the political motivations, and most importantly, the effect on nations that established the groundwork for the second world war. No modern history, military history, or the 20th century history collection is complete with out a text such as this! Keegans book is dense and detailed, well researched, and yet understandable and a pleasure to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment.","review":"Not a good book to understand the suffering and pain carried by the generation of WWI. There is almost nothing in the personal experience of the little guys. Too much about armies and corps and divisions, not enought about people and soldiers. Not enought maps for the great number of unfamiliar locations. I want my money back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"War of the World, 1914","review":"This is a fine one volume history of the Great War. Yet in spite of the dense factual material, I found myself confused by the repetitive numeration of military units, without enough maps to help. The book is stronger on diplomatic activities that led up to the fighting, but does not provide the rich full description of the personalities leading the fight, which is done better in Guns of August by Barbara Tuchman.Descriptions of the titanic battles on the Eastern Front are helpful, and the explanation of the collapse of Tsarist Russia is an eye-opener for those who prefer to focus on the Western Front. TEN MILLION died for nothing, only to see greater tragedy 20 years later. How foolish were the elite diplomats, generals, and royalty; so much of classical European civilization destroyed. Here are the roots of problems in Eastern Europe and the Middle East."},{"rating":"1","title":"Detail juxtaposed with generalization","review":"Hoping this would be a good, one volume overview of the war, I was greatly disappointed. The explanation for the outbreak, especially Russia's role, was oversimplified and in error, especially regarding Russian mobilization options.Despite some detailed explanation of various campaigns, the treatment of the East (which was critical to the outcome of the war) struck me as a bit superficial.I'm still waiting for \\"the\\" WWI survey history."},{"rating":"1","title":"The writing is flat and there are way too few maps.","review":"When I bought \\"The First World War\\" by John Keegan, I was looking forward to a my first comprehensive military history of World War I. I was disappointed and I wonder why the reviews have been so glowing. The first months of the war are desperate maneuvers by both sides to encircle and avoid encirclement. But trying to follow Keegan's description with the sorry minimum of maps, I was constantly frustrated. The key battles have no maps whatsoever. There's just a few summary maps. Keegan's descriptive style is as flat as the terrain of Ypres. I'm struggling to stay with the book. Arrgh. If you want to read a really good book about the initial stages of World War I, read Barbara Tuchman's \\"The Guns of August\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"My kingdom for a map...or two....or try lots!","review":"Well-written and interesting account of the events of the first world war. The text would be better elucidated with the aid of maps indicating troop placements, battle field movements, as well as the geography and topography. Words are fine, but maps would have replaced half the text and saved some trees. Great book for filling in the history gaps, next time try a few maps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Use of English Language for an Important Subject","review":"You should believe the other reviewers when they say the writing is poor. Let me give you an example from page 27: \\"Though A.J.P. Taylor was flippantly wrong to characterize the outbreak of 1914 as 'war by timetable,' since statesmen might have averted it at any time, given goodwill, by ignoring professional military advice, the characterization is accurate in a deeper sense.\\" Do you get the idea? Every paragraph has sentences like that, making this book difficult to read. On the positive side, his knowledge is deep and wide, but you are going to have to dig.I just finished Barbara Tuchman's \\"The Guns of August\\"--what a difference. I wish I knew of another book on this general subject so I could recommend it. Tuchman's book covers only about the first 30 days of the war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try this instead of a tranquilizer dart.","review":"The people who have said \\"BORING\\" neglected to say \\"depressing\\" and \\"pompous\\". Certainly it is about a depressing and wasteful war, but it is unfair to those who died, to render their sacrifice into a stultifyingly dull intellectual ego trip. I have a couple of degrees in history, and this is the kind of stuff that makes other people hate history, so I doubly resent it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty deep stuff but enlightening","review":"I'll readily admit that reading good war novels like War of the Rats or The Triumph & the Glory or Gods and Generals is easier than wading through serious history, but the effort is worth it with John Keegan's books. He has a grasp of the human element in conflict as well as a manner of presenting the political and social aspects of the era in question that render the topic, if not as fascinating as a Grisham thriller, at least interesting enough to pursue. One always learns some lessons from Keegan--lessons that were won at a horrific price by the generation in question."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good history but lacks emotional impact","review":"I agree with the earlier reviewers who pointed out that historical fiction is a better forum for recreating the emotional trauma monstrous events like global war trigger. \\"The Triumph and the Glory\\" comes to mind, as does the great classic \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\". Keegan of course is a world renowned military historian and cannot be expected to alter his fine histories to appeal to those of us who prefer fiction. HE IS good at what he does, and \\"The First World War\\" is definitive in describing the FACTS at hand. But world war is more than facts, it is raw visceral emotion unleashed to such an extent that mass killing is not only accepted as necessary but applauded as glorious. If Keegan could have addressed the WHY of WWI with the same skill he explored the factual context this would have been a five star book."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Aproach","review":"I knew very little from this war, that's why I would be careful with my own point of view. Besides that, I found this book really entertaining, not too detailed as to result boring, yet not too vague as to lose you, you get a general idea of what the entire process was I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very concise overview","review":"This is a great book if you don't have time to go too in-depth into any particular part of the war. It has a good balance of detail and grand strategy and is very well written. Also integrates the social and political context seamlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Overview of the War","review":"The First World War by John Keegan will give the novice on World War I history a wonderful overview but will also be a thrill to those obsessed with this period as the author is unafraid of making his opinions loudly and, sometimes, gloriously known and will often challenge established ideas. This reader can sometimes get a little lost in the details of battles but the author is quite able at making these skirmishes clear and understandable (even if my head did swim a little still). The book covers more than battles, though, as personalities and politics become an important part of the mixture and the author clearly presents the impact of the evetns on the countries participating. The author is a historian with an edge and the skill to get away with it. This books should be enjoyed by anyone who wants to learn about this horrific war or those who want a fresh look at old arguments. A marvelous read."},{"rating":"2","title":"So,So....","review":"It does what it said it will... It is a low end telescope but, it gives you exactly what it says.. I do recommend this scope for anyone wishing upon a star and anyone looking for a cheaper way out with decent results... Go for it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another side of Jack Nicholson","review":"Not your typical role for Jack nicholson, but one he nails. A wry, dark, funny slice of life from Midwestern Americana. Kudos to Kathy Bates for a superb supporting role and for personal bravery (nude scene) Hope Davis and Dermot Mulroney are good too. Not a fast paced film, but full of dry humor, ironies and stuff that makes you sigh and laugh. See it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Heartwarming","review":"About Schmidt is a heart-warming, funny, and clever movie in the life of a widower who's reflecting on his life as his daughter is about to be married to a man he sees as a \\"buffoon.\\" I wish there was more of a reason for WHY Mr. Schmidt disliked his new son-in-law, so his emotions about his daughter marrying him would have made more sense. I didn't really find anything wrong with the guy. His family might have been a bit dysfunctional, but nothing so egregiously horrifying or bad that he nearly had to beg his daughter not to marry him. That's the only reason why i gave this movie a 4 star rating. Other than that, this was a refreshing film, and a great performance by Jack Nickolson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Is Back","review":"What an amazing film \\"About Schmidt\\" is. It is a wonderful look at examing what happens when we reflect upon the choices we've made and how those choices may rub off onto our children. I read someone describe this as a remake of Ingmar Bergman's \\"Wild Strawberries\\", that sounds about right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack saves his best for last","review":"Jack Nicholson is one of the greatest actors of all time. This movie was wonderfully made. It especially appeals to people over 50 who have personally experienced events that occur in the movie. Everything has already been said in earlier reviews regarding this movie except for emphasis on the last 10 seconds of the movie. In an age where movies are computer generated and performed by untalented super models, one is able to experience acting in its purist form, and performed at its highest level. In the movie, Jack reads a book and jumps to the last page to see how it ends. If you do this with this movie, you will experience one of the greatest acting performances ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Terrible","review":"This movie is vastly different from the book. The only part similar is the very beginning, the rest doesn't relate to the novel at all. It's incredibly boring, it starts off sad, ends even worse. Incredibly depressing, would never watch again nor ever recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"About nothing!","review":"This movie is the worst Nicholson movie ever. It tries to be a comedy but there are no punch lines. It tries to make a statement about the futility of growing old, but fails there also. The director himself admits he was not sure what he wanted to say in the movie (see extras). He wanted to say something about growing old. He would have been much better off trying to make a comedy or a drama instead of attempting to blend both into one. This movie fails completely on all levels. It is not worth seeing for any reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new","review":"Hearing all the buzz about this movie, I went into it expecting something original. But it seems like they made the movie specifically for Oscar buzz. I know, it's based on a book that I haven't read, so I can't comment on that, but the movie brings forth no interesting points. There's nothing for me to chew on at the end of the movie, because I've seen it all before. Yes, the unexamined life is not worth living. I know this, you can at least present it to me in an interesting way. We just go through the motions of Schmidt's life and what eats at him. He hates that he's old. He doesn't know how to deal with his wife's death, or take care of himself after she's gone. He has a broken relationship with his daughter. All these things were presented with poignant music, expecting me to feel for him. But I don't. He's bland, the story is bland, and nothing was interesting. You might like it if you haven't seen many movies, but I've seen this story done before."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Boring Peice of S**t Ever Made","review":"I will regret wasting those two hours viewing this movie my entire life. Never see this movie, no more said. It has no plot whatsoever and there's nothing funny in it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies","review":"I still don't get what was so good about this movie? It was Just awful and my only regret was paying $2.75 to see it. A movie with Jack and Kathy bates should have been at least worth that but this movie horriable. I did't care weither Schmdit turned left or right by 1/2 way threw this movie...Do you self a favor and skip this dud!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring as hell","review":"I found this movie to be boring. It seemed to drip on an on without much a plot line at all. Follows the life of a dull, depressed man, to whom nothing really interesting ever happens. I would only recommend this to people that enjoy movies that are dull, depressing and where nothing really happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Want to Know Schmidt","review":"I went to this movie because I love Kathy Bates and Jack Nicholson. It's a slow moving depressing movie. I have NO idea what the academy was thinking when they nominated those two for Oscars for this film. Kathy Bates gets one for going naked and Jack Nicholson gets one for crying? If you have to see this film wait and rent it don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie I EVER saw","review":"Where's the 0 stars rating?By far the tiredest, lamest movie I have ever seen. I've never been Jack's biggest fan, but this is sooooooo bad. I can't believe he did this. Go get Anger Management instead.Story: Old guy retires, he hates his weird wife who smells funny and makes him pee sitting down, and he's secretly pleased when she dies. So he buys an RV and drives around the country. He tries to get with some married lady at an RV park, but he gets slapped and kicked out. Spends the whole movie writing letters about his sad lame life to a boy he sponsored through Save the Children. That's the entire story. Just makes you wanna run right out and buy a copy, huh?Just so you know it's not just me, my husband and brother-in-law saw it with me and hated it every bit as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be skipped","review":"I purchased this DVD after reading favorible reviews and was very disappointed.I am a big Jack Nicholson fan but this is one movie he should not have made.It began on a low level plane and went downhill. It was depressingly boring and a waste of time.Jack plays a character who retires and goes on an odyssey not worth watching. It is sad to get ripped off by a piece of trash like this, but you open the DVD, no refunds. My only resourse is to warn others not to repeat my mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic and surprising","review":"Great script and masterful work by Jack Nicholson. He's mostly toned down his trademark slyness and instead channels Warren Schmidt -- sad, anxiety-ridden widower, to perfection. At certain points in the film it is completely unclear what decision he will make, and wonderful waiting to see what happens (for example, in the scene at his daughter's wedding). This movie would be just depressing if Nicholson weren't so perfect at subtlety in this role. This is the first film also that I've seen where the deleted scenes are actually really good, and would have added a lot to the film in spite of time concerns. Kathy Bates adds spark to this picture in the second half -- my attention was riveted."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good, a good look at how hum drum things can get","review":"not an uplifting film, so rent it when you are ready for a kind of \\"grey\\" filmnicholson is good at portraying this atmosphere, a couple of good twist and turns, and excellent story line"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"After retiring, Schmidt finally has an opportunity to ask himself \\"what is the point of my life?\\" I really liked Jack Nicholson in this movie.

This movie does both."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie worth seeing...","review":"Ok, I must say that I have had this movie for quite a long time and watched for the first time a few days ago.This is not the usual caracter Jack Nicholson will play, you are used to see him as a bad, tough guy... but in this movie, more than in any other of his movies, he is human..... he is old.... he is afraid.That\`s the main reason why I liked the movie... because it shows a human being at the end of his life.It makes you wonder what would you feel when you will be in this situation.At the end, I ended up crying....Good movie.... and worth seeing it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Turkey Of A Movie ...","review":"Despicable, disgusting, and depressing ... one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life.

That said, this film is a turd.Schmidt is an unredeemable character who discovers upon retirement that he failed as a human being and wasn't even great at the work he traded his humanity for. The movie chronicles Schmidt's banal post retirement pursuits that result in nothing but personal pain, alienation and deeper desperation.If you enjoy sticking bamboo splinters under your fingernails, cutting your tongue and squeezing lemon juice on the wound or ripping the hair out of your armpits with tweezers, you'll love this movie.

What a shame.","review":"Many of Jack's movies have a little humor, action, and somewhat of a plot. After the first hour of watching this story of a lonely man who corresponds with a mail-order sponsor child, I began falling asleep. I have never seen a movie more boring and plotless. However I gave the movie a chance, dragging for over 2 hours, which ended in bitter sorrow. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. If you like slow and depressing movies, this one is for you. Sorry Mr. Nicholson, stick with action and real comedy movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Craptastically fecal flavored","review":"This movie is about as interesting and fast paced as your average retiree's life.

I mean, really, it's not a bad acting job, but it's the same darn role over and over. And now he did it again in that Diane Keaton movie. Really, he plays the same role time and time again and the critics go nuts with praise every time and the public eats it up. It makes me want to gag. Throughout this movie, I kept expecting a bandaged Greg Kinear or Helen Hunt to appear at the home of Kathy Bates, or for him to take a spin with Shirley McLean in a t-top Corvette. I think he's a fabulous actor, but play something else for a change, Jack! Please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where have you gone Jack Nicholson?","review":"I am a consumate Nicholson fan, but this offering defies description.

His pitiful attempts at getting on alone, making passes at his his new found acquaintance's wife, etc. are just sad to watch. The daughter is pathetic too, in her choice of a to-be-husband and his oh-so-interesting family, although Bates was really the only funny thing about this movie.I felt for Schmidt, his emptiness, loneliness, wandering and ultimately feeling like a total failure except for his one small but important contribution to the world.

They were, as usual, great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Done Good","review":"I've never cared much for Jack Nicholson. I thought he played the same character in every movie. Not so this one. This movie is sweet, touching, funny, sad, depressing, and thought-provoking. The movie was filmed mainly in Nebraska and as a resident of Omaha for 26 years, I can tell you Hollywood did a pretty good job of getting it right. I don't think either coast will ever get over the stigma of seeing us Midwesterners as hicks and simpletons, but I can't complain about this movie because I enjoyed it too much. The story is about a man who retires after several years at an insurance company, loses his sense of worth and has no idea what to do with himself. This subject doesn't get talked about much probably because it is mainly a \\"male issue\\". This phenomenon deserves awareness and understanding and that's why this film is a gift. Sometimes good movies are better than a therapist."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Your Consideration","review":"I don't like that the movie has the words \\"For Your Consideration\\" at the bottom of the screen for much of the movie.

What else is there to say?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like watching paint dry","review":"I rented this with a friend of mine after hearing positive reviews. I would like to take this opportunity to warn others that, in spite of the positive things you may have heard, this movie is not good. Sure, there are a few minor chuckles here and there, but these don't even come close to making up for the slow pace of this movie and the dreary, dull plot (if you want to call it a plot).This is a movie that meanders on and on. This wouldn't be so bad if it was leading up to something, some kind of climax, but that isn't the case. When this movie ended it was both a disappointment and a relief!The two stars are for Nicholson doing the best he could with this pointless, wearying, slug of a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Isn't it supposed to be bland?","review":"I mean, come on. The pale emotionless expression stuck to Jack's face in the opening scene as he stares at his office clock with an almost corpse-like demeanor should be enough of a hint that this isn't neccesarily an 'action packed' flick. It is, after all, a movie about a pathetic old man.Yes this is about an old man who feels he has nothing to show for his long life after he's retired, but it's really not as boring as it sounds. After a startling revelation about his deceased wife, Schmidt begins a soul-searching journey across country with the intent on preventing the marriage between his ungrateful spoiled daughter and the mullet-wearing waterbed salesman that she's chosen as a husband. And yes, it is as funny as it sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear Ndugu,","review":"This movie is a masterpiece. I don't know if it is more comedy or drama, but I do know that this movie is destined to be a classic. It will make you cry, it will make you laugh. It will make you want to tell everyone you know that they have GOT to see this movie. And the scene with the Hummels sliding around on the top of the RV-pure genius!! I LOVED that part!! There are countless moments of subtle humor all through the movie-so if you are more into the obvious, in-your-face sort of humor that even an 8 year old would appreciate, then you probably won't be very impressed with \\"About Schmidt\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST ENDING OF A FILM EVER","review":"I wont spoil the ending but while many people may say its depressing I think it is one of the most poetic and open endings I have seen since Raging Bull"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weak and Uneventful..","review":"Jack has done alot of great movies but this is definately the WORST one I've ever seen...Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"About the best movie I've ever seen","review":"By no stretch of imagination is ABOUT SCHMIDT an uplifting movie. This is a movie about \\"misery refusing to take itself seriously\\"--and it's superbly written.One of my favorite things about this movie is how realistic it is. It doesn't follow the conventional conflict/resolution formula, which is always refreshing.Additionally, the dialogue, the story, and the acting are excellent. I recommend this movie very highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Nicholson","review":"anybody under 55 years old will not understand this movie. Nicholson has just placed himself as the male version of Meryl Streep. The man puts Marlon Brando to shame, Brando couldnt polish his shoes. There are so many scenes that are so real, the intensity leaps from the screen. My wife hated this movie... I loved it. Why Kathy Bates wasted her time in this bit part, I'm not sure for anybody could have played that bit part in the movie. It is the first movie to my knowledge that addresses the male issue of aging and loss. His attempts to reconnect with anybody at all levels is just heart breaking. In reality when men get old, it seems nobody wants anything to do with them (working class men that is) I'm sure millionaires don't have that problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they make it?","review":"...It is the most depressing movie I ever saw in my entire life. I am not very young, so I don't find it funny. I do see a lot of people similar to the main character who never figured it out... It is not funny at all, from my perspective. It is scary and depressing, because it is too real, if you come to think about it. The emptiness of existence. It was pictured with obvious talent. Maybe, it makes sense, so more people can realize who they really are? I wish they also point out at some re-aasuring optimistic direction though."},{"rating":"1","title":"God, what a depressing movie","review":"What a depressing and movie. I kept watching it hoping that at some pivotal point in the movie Schmidt would have some revelation and find some purpose. Well it kind of comes at the very end but is still real lame with the reading of a letter from a Sister at his sponsored childs home. The movie drags on for over 2 hours showing a depressing man leading a boring, depressing life. There is no character development, and at the end of the movie you wondered what the purpose of the whole film was. I can never decide if it was supposed to be a comedy or a drama. The few funny moments are overshadowed by the dark and depressing tone of the whole movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money","review":"Jack Nicholson is the only reason I gave this movie one star, otherwise I would not have given it any. About Schmidt is the slowest, absolutely most boring picture I have ever viewed. The movie kept going on and on---I was waiting for it to go somewhere and it didn't. It was very depressing and disappointing and I wish that I would have saved my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!!","review":"This was the most depressing, miserable, boring movie. The music overpowers the narrative. The story line is long and boring and DEPRESSING. I realize that some movies are sad, but this movie was incredibly boring. I'll give it this much, it is realistic. BUT who wants realistically boring and depressing when watching a movie. I could have watched paint dry at a nursing home and been more entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"About Sh&t.....","review":"After watching this all I could think to myself is \\"now I'm two hours older\\"...what a waste of time.Enter \\"Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest\\" in the search box if you want a Nicholson movie to laugh, cry and reflect upon."},{"rating":"1","title":"commercial for ChildReach","review":"This movie was very boring and depressing. In the end it turned out to be a 2 hour long commercial for ChildReach, which is like Save the Children. There is even literature for ChildReach in the DVD case. The hottub scene was not as daring or fun as reported. Avoid this at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of their talent and my time","review":"I guess to just come out and yell THIS MOVIE SUCKED BIG TIME would be rude.Hmmmm.... (She is desperately trying to find something nice to say about this total waste of film.) Ok. At least we have two great actors in Nicholson and Bates who were obviously suckered, blackmailed, or otherwised talked into doing a really boring movie. Nothing was a surprise, you didn't like Nicholson's character, and quite honestly, who cared if he decided to put us and his movie family our of our respective miserys by running the RV over the nearest bridge.The critics loved this movie and I haven't a clue why. BORING BORING BORING is about all I can say about it.Anything Nicholson and Bates have done is better than this stinker. Borrow or rent them instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"A grim film with a weak ending- just when you thought it might get good. Anyone wanna buy a cheap DVD? It's your's for the p&p."},{"rating":"2","title":"what about Schmidt??","review":"This movie was very well acted. Jack Nicholson is in nearly every scene, or narrating them.The previews are slightly misleading, as they seem to indicate alot of humor. There is not much there, as the theme is pretty grim. Things such as aging, death, rejection by family, are some of the things that take place. Anyone expecting a lot of laughs will be surprised and maybe disappointed. But over all I would give it 4 stars. Nicholson and Bates are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bitter Lesson","review":"Did not leave the theater feeling good but it was certainly a thought provoking movie. Schmidt was actually a rather pitiful person who did not learn about giving back until very late in life. A good lesson that balance is incredibly important!Nicholson was fantastic as usual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat Schmidt","review":"To all the people that think 'About Schmidt' is boring...Morons dismissed Kubrick's '2001' for being \\"boring\\". Well, space is probably boring. And I imagine old age/retirement is just as boring. This is a great movie. If you suffer from ADD and just want to see Keanu Reeves doing Kung Fu moves every 12 minutes, this movie is SO not for you. If you want ridiculous slapstick and predictable gags, this movie is SO not for you. If you lack intelligence and think Meg Ryan is a great actress, then this movie is DEFinitely not for you. Go back to your Men In Black and Fast And The Furious, you morons."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"I loved this movie. Its what you'd call a \\"dark comedy,\\" which is probably why alot of people don't like it. Its basically about an old guy who retires, and is forced to question the meaning and value of his life. It has you laughing at the way this guy feels he has wasted his entire life, but at the same time it makes you wonder just what you're doing with your own life that is so great. Its kind of painful to watch, if you really let the themes sink in. Its not all depressing, though, because it does end on an up note, and its hilarious throughout. Jack is brilliant.If you like comedies that offer more than just fart jokes, you should really enjoy this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below average guy in crisis","review":"This in't a movie about an average guy who retires and then suffers the loss of his spouse only to find himself grappling with the meaning of his life: it is the story of a very below average guy in that situation. This character was as dull as dirt. Unbelievable, literally. This is for people who are not in touch with average people or who simply want to believe others are dull to feel better about themsleves. Sorry, but is doesn't make it even with the good acting. Just depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack Nicholson deserves a better script!","review":"Jack Nicholson is an outstanding actor. His performance in this movie continues to exhibit his great ability. This movie is one of those examples as to how even the best of actors can only do so much with the script he is given.A story should move toward a climax and then finish with a conclusion. This movie just seems to have Jack moving about aimlessly. Although there is the hint of a story line and one might argue a conclusion, the movie just doesn't make the grade. You sit there and keep hoping something will happen to salvage the movie and it doesn't (until the credits are rolling and you get to go home).If you want to see Jack Nicholson then please see \\"As good as it gets\\" or one of his other great performances in which he had better material to work with.Eight of us saw this movie together and only my wife said that she liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Film That Sort of Grows On You","review":"Funny at times, sad at others. Jack Nicholson gives the most \\"different\\" performance of his career. If Anger Management and The Shining were on one end of the spectrum, About Schmidt is on the other extreme. The film is directed by the talented Alexander Payne who received great recognition for Sideways. Mr. Payne has a great eye for extracting humor from uncomfortable situations. In this film, Jack has plenty of those. There are some heartfelt moments, particularly at the end. I did not like the film the first time I saw it; it seemed to me that Jack was so reserved that he was sleepwalking rather than acting. But upon further viewing,it has grown on me the past year or so. Perhaps it'll grow on you too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paint your TV and watch it dry instead-it's more interesting","review":"Okay, repressed guy who missed out on dreams retires into boredom. Wife dies, so guy wants to find meaning of life. May have found it.Took me 20 seconds to summarize the whole plot. Took the movie two hours to do it.Nicely nuanced performance by Nicholson, which is the only reason to even consider this movie. Beyond that, though, this thing is dull, dull, dull. Don't bother unless 1) you're an insatiable wonk about acting techinique, or 2) you're into examining your own navel for any reason other than the discovery of lint.-gvi"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicholson must be desperate for money to make this film","review":"This movie was so facinatingly boring that I had to watch it to the end to see what would *not* happen! bleh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet Genius","review":"I can't believe all the bad reviews for this movie. Although it isn't one of my favorites, I was very impressed with Jack Nickelson playing an average joe, who is actually somewhat pathetic. This movie wasn't as great as Election, and was a little better than Sideways, in my opinion. Sure, it isn't action packed, but there is subtle hilarity throughout. Kathy Bates does an excellent job, and I enjoyed this movie very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply put, boring.","review":"Of course, opinions are relative to the persons offering them and unless you're familiar with that person...well, you understand. I'm a Nicholson fan, I'm a guy and I'll never see my twenties again unless in another life. The only reason I would consider for the making of a movie such as this is to entertain those who get excited over watching characters out of touch with reality; people who've gotten close to the end without ever having had a novel thought or who simply never stopped to figure what it might be all about. Personally I view movies for the sake of being entertained, taken from common place events to bigger than life happenings. Honestly, I couldn't wait for this movie to end and only stayed with it because I was so sure Nicholson wouldn't have bothered with such tripe. Yech! Not only didn't I get it but I haven't a clue who would want to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yow!","review":"I watched this dvd while wearing \\"Pampers\\" training pants, just to be safe.

The entire film is based on the life of some clown Schmidt, who is starting to get really depressed because his days drag and suck probably due to the fact that he is getting older.....don't we as viewers get it? His life sucks...your watching a film about his life...it sucks. I will say the film's director accurately portrays the boredom and complete lack of entertainment Jack Nicholson's character was experiencing but that in turn means the film bites. I don't know who the fossils where who said this movie was good but I can tell you these are not the people to call for a fast paced Friday Night, or even a slow paced Sunday evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific waste of time","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever watched.

About Schmidt is one of the year's most disappointing, overrated films. It's not a bad movie per se, but it's flaws outweigh it's good things. The film is slow and sluggish (not to mention overlong) to an almost excruciating level, and although the acting is good, most especially by the quirky Kathy Bates as Roberta, the movie is flat and dull. Perhaps what makes this so tedious is the fact that Warren Schmidt (what a TERRIBLE name) is such an uninteresting, monotonous character. We have absolutely no reason to care for Schmidt (or his inert life). As one critic noted, \`it's a boring movie about a boring man'. About Schmidt was penned and directed by Alexander Payne, who also brought us the exceptional Election. Despite one or two neat observations (and a touching finale), Payne brings us nothing sharp, audacious, or funny as Election. What a pity..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This was the worst movie I have ever seen. After I saw it I looked at my friend and said I want my 2 hours back.

One thing I remember in this movie that really sticks out is that before his wife passed she told him that she thought their daughter was too spoiled and he need to stop sending her money and thing but he didn't listen to her so I guess it was kind of his fault that their daughter turned out to be a spoiled brat. What were Jack and Kathy thinking of when they agreed to do this movie? If you want to see good Jack Nicholson movies watch As Good As It Gets, Somethings Gotta Give, The Shining and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and if you want to see some good Kathy Bates movies watch Mysery, Deloris Claibourne, Fried Green Tomatoes and Annie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most overrated film of the last decade","review":"election was not the best film ever, but it did show alot of promise for new commer alex Payne.

Nothing gelled in this lazy, boring and deeply depressing film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack's acting is wonderful, but the movie is not","review":"First of all, let me start by saying that Jack Nicholson gave a wonderful, Oscar-worthy performance in this movie. Unfortunately, I did not like the movie, in spite of his acting. It's a movie about a midlife crisis, which starts with the main character's retirement and the death of his spouse, and ends with him in tears when he realizes that his life has mattered to one person (who he's never met, which is why it doesn't work for me). There's a lot of equally depressing scenes in between. I had expected this movie to be somewhat humorous and uplifting, but it was just depressing. So I'd give five stars to Jack Nicholson for his acting, but only one star to this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL!!!!!","review":"I am a huge fan of Jack Nicholson, but this movie bored me to tears. It seemed quite pointless and dragged through what could have easily been a 30 minute movie.Warren Schmidt is a recently retired man who loses his wife and has a bad relationship with his daughter who feels that her father never cared for her. He is miserable in every state of his being and sends these lengthy letters to his foster child in Africa that he adopted through one of those Christian Charity things where he contrives things to make himself look better.I did enjoy Kathy Bates character. She is another one of my favorite actors and I wasn't disappointed in her.I don't know, I really was disappointed in this movie.

It would have been as the package intended but the toy's magnetic element is weak and light.The bars and balls do not stick together that well as the magnets are small, thus have a weak magnetic pull. The bars and balls fall off quickly and even a basic shape such as a cubed square do not stand up. The joints slide off easily.Overall, it is flimsy and not worth the price, although the packaging and website claims it is \\"super-strong\\". It's not even a little strong. It was frustrating for our little kids to attempt to build a structure with this toy, despite adult assistance and supervision.Don't waste your time or money with this toy.

But we found the magnets are not strong enough to build even the simplest vertical structure, such as the cube pictured in the advertisement. The only thing we could get to stay up was a pyramid. Anything else collapses. I tried a couple of different ways to construct the cube, even trying to construct the \\"walls\\" on the ground and lifting them up (like they do for houses!) but no luck.

This book was great. It's great hardboiled pulp that crosses the line over into literary fiction at points, with a subtle James M. Cain vibe that I really enjoyed. For a book that only really features four characters, it's gripping and exciting, and the way the central mystery carries through the story--an abandoned boat floating on the Gulf of Mexico--is not only engrossing, but ultimately heart-wrenching.

All of his tension and emotion in present in this novel, but he still had yet to develope his style and language that has made him, in my opinion, one of America's best writers today.It's a story about privacy. Private lives at home and secret romances of sorts and the return of a Vietnam vet who has a constant reminder of his time In Country, but he never tells the secret of how he received the injury to his ear.It's an excellent debut novel, but don't be discouraged if this is the first Tim O'Brien novel you read, he only get's better.

The installer also found out that the iCruz will only load Playlists up to 99 songs. The installer got it to run once very, very slowly before it locked up for good. I did some research online and found lots of people with similar problems with these units. Do a web search for reviews and opinions and check it out yourself!

I contacted Monster and they sent a replacement along with a pre-paid return envelope. The second unit worked fine for about 3 days. Then it quit working with the display flickering like a strobe light. It's final failure mode was with the display lit up and blank all the time. I've contacted Monster and requested an RMA #. They got my payment info so they could refund the money and once that's done, they'll call me with an RMA #? We'll see.

Lots of action.. GREAT scenery and camera views during the entire movie. This is not your every day superhero movie, it has Patrick Stewart (Picard on Star Trek Next Generation) as the main character and as always with him, there is a feeling of realism to it that especially comes out when he is with children. Overall, the movie makes one wonder that if there were real X-Men in the world, how would the general public feel toward them? I would give this movie 5 stars, but like I said, it's a little unorganized in the beginning, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"X-Men taken to the 2nd power","review":"From the opening sequence, I knew this was going to be even better than the original X-Men.

I was excited to see night crawler who was the best charecter in this lame movie. He is the reason i gave it a 2 becuase i used to use him as a character in an old xmen game for sega genesis. The reason i gave it a bad rating was becuase it was so boring. I sat their in my seat wishing for more action, but it never came, just constant talking. This had less action than star Trek Nemesis did. It was bad becuase there was no action, not alot of fighting scenes. In total, about 5-10min of fighting seens, the rest is either talking, arguing or flying their ship. I thought it would have more action then the first one, but i was wrong.

Not only the movie has a lot of action and cool special effects but it also brought back that metaphor of prejudice and placed it two steps further. Very reminiscent of post 9-11 and the vibe around the time in which it was filmed. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little better","review":"I hated the first movie and gave it one star. This movie got two stars because it had more action and the characters branch out a bit. It still has plenty of plot discrepancies and I'm pissed off that Sabretooth didn't make an appearance.

The opening scene is perhaps one of the coolest in film of late.Can't wait till X3!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Original","review":"Rarely do I like sequels over the original films. Sequels tend to lack richness, development, and quality (Cadyshack 2, Rocky II, etc) but X-2 really impressed me. Hugh Jackman deepened his role as Wolverine and made him less mysterious. Anna Paquin also improved. Other characters in the film stayed the same, but they weren't in need of change (Storm, Mystique) All in all the film definately improved. The first film wasn't horrible in any aspect, but the sequel definately outshined its predecessor. One of the best films of 2003."},{"rating":"2","title":"exciting action-packed film","review":"Just as they did with the first X-men film, the producers did a masterful job of bringing the characters to life on the big screen (in this case the Widescreen DVD).

The special effects in this movie are excellent. The storyline is nice, picking up where the first movie left off. I espeicially enjoyed the featurettes that came with this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy successor","review":"In this day and age of lousy sequels, it's great when a filmmaker manages to up the ante and deliver an even better movie than the one that precedes it. \\"X2\\" is one such example.Although it's recommended you see the first movie to familiarize yourself with this one, it's not totally necessary. This one has a bigger budget, and goes further into the character development without sacrificing any quality.If Bryan Singer can make the third movie as good as this one, we'll be in for a real treat.

It's way cooler than daredevil, which was too dark and violent, and it is much better than the Matrix Reloaded.First of all, the movie HAS a storyline. The Matrix movies are only made so that they can show you the action scenes, but the story is poor and imitated.While Daredevil was violent and had a heavy rock sounftrack, X2 had a good theme and an extraordinary plot.I think the movie is based too much on evolution, it exagerates.

In X-Men 2 its weak army men vs. mutants. A bit lopsided. I found the battles boring and uninteresting. The Nightcrawler scene was pretty sweet and the invasion of the mutant school, but other than that the fight scenes were lame(I didn't really enjoy the Deathstrike scene) X-Men 3 looks like its returning to the first ones style.

Plus the fight scenes are MUCH better and Storm isn't so wimpy with the use of her powers.The film features my favorite X-Man: Nightcrawler.

And they seem really nice, most of them, just misunderstood and feared by mean human people.And why are there no Neanderthals left?

Aside from Halle Berry, the rest of the cast is enjoyable and fun to watch. We really get to delve deeper into their universe and deeper into certain characters. We learn more about Wolverine, Prof X, and Jean Grey, just some of my favorite characters. Nightcrawler is also a fun new character. The plot is quite interesting and engaging.

To me besides a few ( and i mean few) movies of this Summer, X2 was one of the only few sequels that lived up to its anticipation and delivered the goods. The storyline was brilliant, the effects pretty damn good for a 125 million dollar budget and the acting top notch. So if u haven't watched the movie, watch it!!!

If you liked the 1st X-Men, you will LOVE X-Men 2. When I first saw it at the movies, I wanted to watch it again, and again, and again... so you should see X-Men 2.You'll like it alot. Even though it's PG-13, it is a great family movie. I would reccomend it for kids 7 and up. The special effects are great, and it is a very interesting story, like The Matrix but X-2 has less swearing and stuff. Hope you like the movie if you plan to see it!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"X2= Twice The Action, Twice The Fun!","review":"X2 starts out with the character of Nightcrawler (a big comic fave) breaking into the White House. From there, it goes on to show Wolverine's return and the movie begins. While I thought X-Men was a wonderful movie, albeit a bit stifled due to the need to explain characters, I do believe that X2: X-Men United is twice as good. I nearly jumped out of my seat so many times due to the wonderful actions sequences and suspenseful parts that I lost count! A major new addition (other than Nightcrawler) is the enhancement of Iceman and Pyro. You can obviously tell that Iceman cares deeply for Rogue, and that Pyro feels like an outcast. Now, I dont' want to give away the ending, but a painful sacrifice will show you just how much you have come to care about the characters, and how good a movie this is. X3, here I come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait until X-men 3!","review":"I thought that this was a great movie, but I don't want to talk about the movie a whole lot. The visual affects in this movie were great and the acting was awesome. This movie should hopefully throughout the weeks beat the rather dumb Marvel comic Daredevil in the box-office. This classic Marvel comic X-men had a better plot and it had some really cool characters. The best actors in a comic book movie ever so far! Huge Jackman, Halle Berry, Alan Cumming, Rebecca R. Stamos, Brian Cox, and many more great actors. I don't want to give the ending away or accually any of it away. It was an awesome movie and even Erbert and Roeper both gave it thumbs up!

ALSO THE LEFT IT OPEN FOR A SEQUEL. I HATE THAT! THERE WERE TO MANY GOOD ACTORS IN THIS MOVIE THAT THEY WASTED. I THINK THAT IF THEY WOULD HAVE DONE IT ANOTHER WAY IT WOULD HAVE TURNED OUT GOOD. IF YOU ASK MY OPINOIN I WOULD SAY IT DOESN'T MATCH THE QUALITY OF THE FIRST ONE. I GUESS THE STUNTS AND CRAP WERE GOOD BUT I DON'T LOOK AT A MOVIE JUST SEEING IF JACKIE CHAN CAN FLIP A GUY WITH ONE PINKY. I DON'T CARE!

Some are better than other, and these pears are a little on the less good side. They are a bit gritty and not very flavorful. The dried peaches, for example, from the same seller are much better. These pears are not chewy or tough enough to make them appealing from that aspect, so the gritty texture and lack of flavor stands out. The shipping rates charged by the seller are very high, and unless you buy in quantity the rates are too high to make it worthwhile to shop from this seller.

I received it a few days ago. I am totally impressed. I have a weight bench, dumb-bells, a bar and a heavier weight set at home. I use my light weight dumb-bells all of the time, but I always wanted to use my work bench and heavier weights for sculpting, but was afraid of hurting myself from improper form. This tape makes it so simple. Jake walks you through each procedure and explains exactly which muscles are being worked. Most tapes perform the procedures in such a fast pace that I was always skeptical about even trying them out. Jake explains, as a model performs the procedure with proper form and technique in a slow smooth pace. Well, I'm on my way to the body I know I was meant to have. Thanks Jake for making a tape for beginners like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"body by jake","review":"This was not something to work out with, but an instructional video to gain information from for when you are ready to begin lifting.

Very full of action and certainly not for everyone as it is very graphic. I have never seen the movie. The characters are very well written and the interaction between them quite interesting. VERY DESCRIPTIVE at times which makes it a little tough to get through but would definately reccomend for a thrill ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Read","review":"To start: although I read this NOT having seen the movie, the movie is enough of a part of American Culture that I knew the basic plot points. LOL - to the point where I was hearing Dueling Banjos in my head as I read the book. As a result, there were no real surprises.However, in spite of my foreknowledge, this was a good, solid piece of storytelling. The characters were interesting, if not always particularly likeable and the story moved along at a good pace. It's an emotional story and brings up some interesting moral questions.The famous scene in question (not wanting to spoil it for those of you who grew up in a cave and have no idea what I'm talking about) was well done and as uncomfortable to read as you can imagine. As as such, it's very well written. Dickey leaves you feeling horrible for the characters involved and like you want to take a shower and do something incredibly innocent for a while.All in all, a well written novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest of Our Time","review":"James Dickey's \\"Deliverance\\" is one of the great works of late twentieth Century American literature. It combines the excitement of the modern novel with the symbolism of the classics.I find Dickey's masterpiece to be strikingly similar to Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" another favorite of mine from a very different time and place. Superficially, the plots of the two are almost identical - a journey down (or up) an uncharted river, a questionable, even unknown destination, confrontation with \\"natives,\\" a descent into madness, and an escape that changes the main character forever. Both give a frightening insight into the darker sides of the human psyche.I first read \\"Deliverance\\" in high school some years ago, and I recently dusted it off for a long train ride. I can't recommend it enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great over time","review":"I first read this book back in the 70's and around the same era saw the movie. I don't think there is ANYONE in my age group (30-40-50-60) that does not know those few notes played on a banjo (you are picking them off in your head now, aren't you?) that does not know the book/movie they came from.I just happened to come accross it in the kindle listings while searching out something else and decided to give it another read. I did NOT waste my time by doing so. This book was as great in 2010 as it was in 1970.If the story line was not so dark, I would say this is a timeless classic.....no, I take that back - THIS IS A TIMELESS CLASSIC!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunted By Unknown Forces","review":"For my English Honors class we were rezuired to read a fiction book of our choosing. I chose Deliverance. Four men venture out on a canoe trip down a large Georgian river. The wildeness surrounding the river is extremely dangerous, and the men barely escape with their lives. The author portrays these characters very well, and I feel like I can relate to the struggles they are going through. The one thing that I did not like about the book was all the profanity. I think that maybe the author put the language in there to give the reader a realistic sense of what everyday life is like out in the country of Georgia. I feel like the book does a great job of grabbing the readers attention, and describing the events very well. It caught me by surprise when I read the book within 3 nights because it was so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is better; first person narrative does not read well","review":"Movie is better; first person narrative does not read well.

I know, the publisher sets the price, but I'm not happy at the cost of books for Kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruel and silly","review":"But apparently it appeals to the manhood of chickenhawks like Dick Cheney. It's got some mystical stuff from the Lewis character about the rural people being braver men. Well, it's really just being accustomed to your surroundings. I've seen both rural and suburban people nervous in a perfectly safe inner city neighborhood. I've read about battle hardening, where men and women stop jumping at their own shadows in a combat zone.I dislike the book, mainly because of its cruelty. I think this is the sort of book that made the 1970s such a meanspirited era, and was take too seriously by some impressionable people who gained power in the 90s and early 2000s.After further reflection, fairness compels me to add the following to this review:James Dickey knows how to write a suspenseful story, and he probably was sincere in his message; he wasn't just a hack writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull from the gitgo","review":"Typical of a lot of 70's era novels, it takes a good one-quarter of the book to get to the actual action.

Yaaaaawwwwwn."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a screenplay.","review":"This was advertised as the screenplay for the film and it was not. It was the book. With a screenplay the format is structured as so one page usually equates to one minute of screen time. In a \\"shooting script\\", each scene is numbered, and technical direction may be given. In a \\"spec\\" or a \\"draft\\" in various stages of development, the scenes are not numbered, and technical direction is at a minimum. The standard font for a screenplay is 12-point Courier.Fortunately I wasn't shopping for bowling balls. I may have been sent bowling ball pins.I was extremely disappointed to receive something so misleading and to have payed for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick A$$","review":"Best novel that I have read in a decade. Dickey pulls the reader down stream through the entire book and doesn't disappoint with the finish. A must read for all people who are literate."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book \\"Deliverance\\" sucks you right in!","review":"I saw the movie when it came out eons ago and it came up in a conversation with my friends which jogged my memory. I knew I had to have the book (books tend to be much better than the movie) and what better way to own a book when it is instantly streamed into my Kindle upon payment online!!!! I applaud author, James Dickey for an incredible story that kept me on the edge of seat throughout the entire book. I recommend this book to everyone who loves suspense and twists and turns of events throughout the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great survival novel for urban slaves","review":"I was drawn to this book as a fan of the 1970s film, infamous mainly for one scene, though the whole film is epic. The story, though fairly simple, is so terrifying in that the situation very well could have, and has probably happened to someone in the great outdoors. Dickey's novel further examines the tranformation from office worker to hunter when the main character, Ed, is pushed to the limits. With great dialogue, a humble writing style, and clear narrative voice, this novel is definitely worth a glance. This is not the typical thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Top Quality","review":"I was expecting a good item, but this is just another stamped product for the masses. Cheap plastic fasteners was the initial turnoff, but the flimsy strapping leather was not worth further effort. My pistol fit the holster tightly (as it should) and would undoubtedly break-in in due time, but overall the quality of this product reminded me of a halloween costume accessory. For the money, go out and get a Mitch Rosen Stylemaster Express. Oh, and I'm no newbie to gun leather either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding the true self of another","review":"After his wife Kath's death, Glyn is going through all her paperwork and finds a folder with \`DO NOT OPEN: DESTROY' on it. Of course he opens it, only to find a picture of his wife holding hands with another man. Glyn then sets out to find out about the details of his wife's life that he never knew about, and he finds out that he really didn't know his wife all that well. As he finds out more and more, he needs to enlist Kath's friends and her sister Elaine to fill in the gaps to the mystery, \`Who was Kath, really?'This book is about marriage, friendships, and family relationships. Who takes precedence over whom and why. Who really knows the true soul of a person and why. How does one even go about trying to find out the true self of a loved one? This book really engaged me because of the intertwined, complex relationships of all the characters and how they related to the \`mystery' of who Kath really was. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A JUDGMENT OF QUALITY","review":"Certainly my rating should not be taken as any sort of objective judgment of the quality of this work. It only reflects my impatience with the kind of work that reflects upon reflections upon memories that are reflections of limited evidence, and so on and so forth. What I had hoped for was a light entertainment in which a discovered fact led to something more than an infidelity in a distant past and a trouble-making raking over of dead coals. Not, as they say, my cup of tea. My fault, I failed adequately to find out beforehand what I was getting into. Can't remember just why it happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"Oh my goodness, this book was just so slow and awful. I hated the main characters. Glyn was just so boring and you don't wonder why Kath strayed, but you do wonder what she saw in Nick. She seemed the nicest person in the book, even though she's only described in flashbacks!I couldn't put this book down - I was too anxious to reach the end; I'd hoped it would pick up, but it just dragged on and on....my first and last book by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"This book has so many decriptive details but they are not part of the build of a bigger story. The premise is so promising, an old photograph revealing the potential of intrigue and betrayal. However, we are completely let down as the story goes absolutely no where. If the journey is the point, it is populated by characters that are bland and uninteresting. The reader could hardly care about any of them. This is very much a completely pointless and plodding book. Any one aspect of the following, if well done could have saved the book, a good plot, interesting characters or descriptive details that point to some coherency. Unfortunately, we are not so lucky. The writer is well equiped as her writing is good and her descriptive style is compelling. Too bad that there is simply not enough of a framework to build on. When the core is so lacking, not much can be done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving","review":"Penelope Lively's \\"The Photograph\\" moved me to the very depths of my soul. I can't rate this book high enough. We are allowed to peer into the minds of the characters as each one discovers a new meaning, a new understanding of life and of those people who inhabit our lives. We begin to understand how little we know each other and the more we read, the more we see ourselves within the pages. It left me vowing to take the time to get to know the people in my own life, the important parts that we so easily ignore or neglect throughout our daily lives.If a book has ever moved me toward change, this one has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite Writing, Once Again","review":"Penelope Lively is a world treasure.

I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I'm missing something ...","review":"but I found this book rather uninteresting and predictable.

I struggled to finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transparent","review":"Predictable. Obvious. This book left you with no burning desire to finish, becuase you could determine for yourself the ending. It was clear how Kath died without reading to the end. The author spent more time describing the gardens than Kath. The only reason I finished the book was because it was short."},{"rating":"1","title":"dispassionate account","review":"I found this book to be a dispassionate account of a pedantic researcher who methodically seeks to fill in the blanks of his wife's relationships. The author failed to convey to me any sense of passion, pain or failed moments. (...)..a book more suited to a short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah Blah Blah","review":"The PhotographI have to admit that I could not finish this book! I am even allowed to write a review for something I didn't complete? The point really is-I couldn't bear to read it.Both the fact that this was a Today book club pick and that the mere premise of the story intrigued me, the prose drove me absolutely crazy! Yes, the characters were very well developed by pages and pages of text but the story went missing. I understand you want to develop the characters but this was way over the top. I felt the plot was lost in the midst. The first sixty-nine pages could have been condensed into about twenty. Such a disappointment.I also (as someone else mentioned in an earlier review that I read) only paid a penny for this book plus $3.99 shipping & handling. I'm glad about that and wish there had been a return policy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I only paid one penny.","review":"This is the second book by this author that I've read. Which is two to many. I would have never picked up this one but it was on our book club list. I thought the subject sounded good, but as others have said the book went no where. I always feel like the little kid yelling \\"he has no clothes on\\" when I read things like this. Am I missing something? Maybe I'm not cerebral enough to appreciate a book like this. I will tell you this, reading the back of a cereal box has about as much excitement as this book.I should have known if it's selling used for a penny then it probably isn't even worth the penny. I was right."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN EXERCISE IN MINUTIAE","review":"Really, I hardly meet a book I don't enjoy on some level, but this one qualifies as an exception. The adjective used by a previous reviewer - plodding - is simply an understatement. I \\"slogged\\" through it for about 2 chapters, then skimmed the rest, hoping to be stopped in my tracks with something, ANYTHING, that might capture my interest, but it never happened. And while I do enjoy reading at bedtime, I really began to fear that I had a serious case of narcolepsy until I realized that my symptoms started only after initiating this book. The few positive comments I can muster are these: the author clearly has a good command of the English language, an admirable vocabulary, and an ability to write clearly and intelligently. She merely failed to include a captivating plot. While not always devastating (e.g., where the subject matter is highly entertaining and therefore supports itself), it was definitely a fatal omission in this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, despite its flaws","review":"A husband discovers, several years after his wife's death, that she had an affair. This challenges his whole view of his marriage, so he sets out to discover the facts about his wife. In so doing, he learns about himself. A picture of the wife does emerge, as she touched many lives.I liked this book quite a bit, though what the man discovers about himself is not that interesting, and the picture of the wife that emerges is a bit exaggerated: think Audrey Hepburn in \\"Breakfast in Tiffany's\\". The secondary characters are all well drawn, the book is well plotted, the man is entirely credible, and the wife, no less than Audrey Hepburn, is endearing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unremarkable","review":"This story had great potential, but I think that Lively's storytelling, in trying to be understated, leaves much to be desired as a result. The 2 star rating is for her \\"painting\\" efforts, in that she does write very descriptively, but the overall big picture is hugely disappointing. Until the last 30 pages, I was hard-pressed to find a reason to pick it up again. The ending was, of course, the most intriguing part of the book (yet still predictable and therefore somewhat anti-climactic), but the preceding 200 pages were an absolute bore."},{"rating":"2","title":"A consistently excellent author","review":"Glyn is a widower who unexpectedly finds a photograph of his deceased wife, Kath, with a group of people. This leads to alterations in relationships, recriminations and adjustments in values. Each chapter is told from the perspective of those thought to be closest to Kath, which gives us a gradually evolving view. Penelope Lively is at her best in revealing the essence of her characters in a thoughtful, subtle way. As with all of her books, this one leads to thought-provoking questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck?","review":"Moon Tiger is one of my all-time favorite books, so I started The Photograph predisposed to love it. Wrong! What a boring book! What happened? Who learned anything -- readers OR characters? I gave this book a second star only because I had to look up a few words and thus improved my vocabulary. Beyond that, the plot was boring and predictable, the characters unappealing and pompous, and the conclusion weak and wanting. Depressing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A picture is worth 1,000 words","review":"The Photograph is one of the most satisfying reads i've had in a while. Well, right after Stefan Zweig's The Post Office Girl and Stephen King's 11/22/63! Multiple points of view had me riveted, each chapter building on the previous. What happened to the woman in the photograph? Who was she? And the people surrounding her? What was their role in her life? Excellent prose, the height of suspense. Terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Psychological Thriller That Leaves You Sad","review":"Well written, a superbly drawn series of characters and moments of tension, happiness and sadness. A book that is well worth reading, yet it leaves one wishing for more or perhaps for something slightly different, as if something was left unsaid, as if the story could have gone in another direction (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). Still, a very good book and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interlocking Puzzle of Characters","review":"\\"The Photograph\\" is a brilliant puzzle of deftly created characters. Ms. Lively takes a simple premise of a discovered photograph and then proceeds to carve it apart into the individual people who are depicted plus the husband who finds it and learns of his wife's affair with her sister's husband. The great success of this book is the crisp and clear representation of each person, their thoughts, and their relationships to the others. Though this is a modestly sized book, it is resplendant with large meanings. Beautifully written and wise."},{"rating":"1","title":"the photograph","review":"It is meretricious pap like this that threatens the good name of the vaunted Booker prize, once bestowed on its author.This contrived tale of a found photo brings together some of the least likeable caricatures of the contemporary English in print. Aside from the opportunity to show off the Latin names of some very ordinary plants and to riff briefly on the history of landscape, the author has woven a predictable and dreary tale of lovelessness better suited to the Ladies Home Journal (if it still prints short stories) than to hard or soft-cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY TOO DESCRIPTIVE and BORING!","review":"I love details in books, but this book had way too many details. This book was written in a way that caused me to not even be able to use my own imagination when reading it. Everything was described in details, which isn't such a bad thing, but most of the details were not even relevant to the main topic of the story. The author lacks description when describing important characters, however. Overall, I was drifting off trying to read this book, and I barely could finish it. NOT WORTH READING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully Obnoxious","review":"This book begins nowhere and continues to go nowhere, slowly. There is really no plot and no action, just the usual self absorbed, convoluted musings of pretentious \\"British\\" characters who often fill British books.

Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"This is the worst book I've ever read. It's mind-numbingly boring. So much so that it's about the width of my pinky finger and I couldn't make it through half the book. I skipped ahead every 30 pages or so and figured the outcome. I'd like to rip it to shreds in anger. Literally. It's one of those books where the author tries to awe you with her intelligence and instead you end up more bored than you ever thought possible. If I can save one person from boredom and anger, then this review will have been worth it. I'm ashamed that people thought it was a good idea to publish this. So ashamed, in fact, that I've almost lost faith in the human race. PLEASE, don't buy this!

And it wasn't really worth the wait. Altough it was very good, come on, it is the first X-Files movie, it should have been better. It would have been an excellant story for a two-parter though.

The film, however, is very, very good, because it is truly the last of the best episodes of The X-files before they moved into the aforementioned continuing storylines.FIGHT THE FUTURE is very visual, and some of the best sets and buildings ever in modern cinema are incorporated in this film. Many of these great sets are brought to gloomy excellence by the dead-on direction of Rob Bowman (check out his THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS for more great visuals - nice cars/effects, lously story). Anderson and Duchovny are, as always, perfect in their roles and they seem to be having a lot more fun, what with being able to swear and such.This is a very accomplished film and you don't even have to be a fan of The X-files to enjoy it... but it doesn't hurt at all if you are."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie was just like the series, but even better.","review":"I loved the way the movie keeps you in suspense.

How then, will it translate into a movie? The answer? Quite nicely. The film is both engaging and intelligent, and the production design is top notch. It's accessible to both fans of the TV series, and those who have never seen it, although it will be more appreciated by those who are familar with the show. I haven't seen the DVD, so I can't comment on the DVD quality, but the film itself is highly recommended to fans of the sci-fi genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fight THE Future","review":"This movie is absolutely awesome, the extra features offered by the dvd format along with the THX encoded sound is beyond description! Again, the on screen chemistry between Anderson and Duchovny is superb, though Chris Carter said there would NEVER be a physical relation with Mulder and Scully, it was handled very well none the less! There is no comparison of the vhs format to the dvd..dvd is far superior in picture and sound and this movie proves that point so well. Buy it and you will watch it over and over again..it is that good, even if you are not a follower of the X-FILES tv series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Zzzz-Files.","review":"*** This comment may contain spoilers ***Considering the amount of money that was obviously invested in this project wouldn't you think that they could have made the effort to come up with a decent script? Think again!There are more plot holes in this outing than I care to number but here's a couple:1. Why did the Arctic facility implode when Scully got injected with the serum? No reason that I can tell other than they had to draw this hokum to a close somehow.And 2. How did the pair get out of the Arctic alive? They were both wet through, Muldar had no coat and Scully had wet socks and no boots so they can hardly have walked out of there - and where did Scully's trousers come from anyway?! Moreover, nobody knew they were there so what chance was there of being found before they froze to death? I'll tell you - no chance!I sat through this for two hours for what? To have my intelligence insulted? Note to franchise co-ordinator: Must do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"X files","review":"My wife is a huge fan of the show so I got her this as a gift she loved it and said it fit in well with the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Necessary for enjoyment of the series","review":"This movie was uncomfortably long, and was not even among the best storylines that could have been chosen for the movie. I don't think making an extra-long episode is the same as making a movie. Too much of the mystery surrounding the X-Files was revealed-making the movie necessary to understanding the continuing TV show. Forcing the public to pay for the movie just so they can continue enjoying the TV show is not a good practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenominal","review":"I've been watching The X-Files since the night it premiered, and this 1998 big screen adaption is everything that long time fans of the series could have ever hoped for. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson bring FBI Agents Mulder and Scully to the big screen flawlessly, and veteran series director Rob Bowman (who would direct 2002's Reign of Fire) gives the film an extremely stylish look as long time fans finally get some of the answers they have been looking for since the show began (although we also get more questions popping up as well). Series vets Mitch Pileggi (A.D. Skinner), William B. Davis (Cancer Man), and The Lone Gunmen are also on board, as is Martin Landau in a pivotal role, but while long time viewers will get the drift of it all, new comers to the show may feel a bit left out. All in all, The X-Files film is a great film in it's own right, and it stands as an important chapter in one of the best and most recognized syndicated shows to come along in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"The X-Files was a great show and I loved the idea that the movie was just the continuation of the story. It was a giant episode and I ate up every moment of it. There were great reveals, wonderful character moments and every second was exciting. But don't watch this as a stand alone. This needs to be seen within the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"The X-Files","review":"I have seen the complete series. They were excellent mini movies. The movie, The X-Files was as entertaining as the episodes of the series. In the movie, the action and the characterization were outstanding and enjoying in a much larger scale. It was worth buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Film of 1998!","review":"In my entire life of watching movies, I've never watched one as much as this. At least once a month do I pop this into VCR and sit back. Like one of the great episodes of the series, this film keeps you coming back for more, and each time you see something new. I'm ecstatic to now own the DVD version, with it's amazing picture and sound and it's extras! Unfortunately the \\"extra footage\\" that is shown on the back does not exist. Unless I'm just unlucky. But the rest of the extras are worth it; 3 trailers, a 30-minute look at behind the scenes footage, and commentary by Chris Carter and Rob Bowman. And of course widescreen, the way the X-Files was meant to be seen. But who cares about that, the movie alone is well worth it. BUY IT NOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did we really need this?","review":"Here's the inside scoop folks: it's nothing more than an hour and a half EPISODE.

They should drop this whole alien plot arc altogether... it does not make sense, and is getting more incredible with each episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"X-File Movie....or Show?","review":"Another hit... show? I thought the show was supposed to be a movie? Thats what probably a lot of you are asking. But, the movie is literally just like a show! The only real big thing was when Scully gets stung by a virus-carrying bee and, well, I won't tell you the rest, just go and watch the movie/show for yourself and see that the movie should really be called a show. Go on, stop reading the reviews and see for yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There Is No Truth","review":"Save your money and buy some videos of the classic episodes like Deep Throat. This movie lacks the magic and uniqueness that made the show special to begin with. A total disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're not a fan, save your money.","review":"I had never seen the X-Files on TV when I saw the movie. However, I watched with an open mind and high hopes. Unfortunately, the byzantine plot is impossible to get a handle on. Call me a whiner, but I have a thing for movies that actually end with some kind of plot resolution, instead of just arbitrarily stopping. Seeing this muddled combination of nasty aliens and conspiracy theories just reminded me how much better \\"Independence Day\\" was at the former and \\"Enemy of the State\\" at the latter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the X Files!","review":"I loved the weekly episodes of the X Files, so I wasn't disappointed with the movie. This 1998 film version of the Science Fiction series focuses on Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully as they try to determine why a bomb was used to cover up the true reasons the bodies of three firemen and a young boy were found in the wreckage, but they died earlier and in a different location! Dana and Fox soon find themselves tracing a deadly virus with extraterrestrial origins. When Scully is infected with the virus, Mulder races to find her after getting his hands on the antidote."},{"rating":"2","title":"X Files on the big screen, what's better?","review":"The X-Files movie is Fantastic.

However, it is a very good movie, and I suggest anyone who reads this to watch it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I watched this dvd never even seeing one episode of the tv series. This made it all the more enjoyable because everything was fresh from the actors, script, and subject matter. It didn't make me want to start watching the tv episode but I'd still recommend this movie as a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for any X-Phile.","review":"Awesome playback quality-- No noticible artifacting when I used software decoding (PowerDVD) on my Creative 6x DVD drive to view the movie. The movie, while more like a 2-hour TV episode than something that would really rock a movie theater screen, is definitely a keeper for X-Philes... Especially since it took the relationship between Mulder and Scully to new levels. A must-have for any X-Phile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fox Home Entertainment & DVD problems with Some computers","review":"I am not able to play this DVD on my system.

Pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left the theater before it ended","review":"UUUUUGH! This movie sucked to high heaven. Horrible acting...and I mean HORRIBLE. I'd rather watch Object of My Affection TWICE than this movie again (that's how much I hated this film). What a cheesy plot. The first 15 minutes (the part with the cave man) made me laugh out loud.

They lost three of my packages in one month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Played like a second rate TV episode","review":"This film was a total disappointment. From the offensive Dallas Building Bombing (That looked like The Oklahoma City Bombing) to the appalling treatment of the secondary characters, it was obvious this film had one purpose, to con the fans to shell out money! And the editing was absolutely horrid. A film is not supposed to be edited like its a 2 hour TV movie. Every time the scene faded to black, I was expecting a commercial! Now that it is almost 2 years later, and the ratings have plunged for the show, I hope the industry has learned a lesson. You should never make a film of a television show until once that show is completed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm........okay","review":"I have only seen a few episodes of the tv show, and I have to say it's, well, different. Besides being the only show left on network televisoin with no sex whatsoever, some of the episodes are so complicated, they are almost movies in themselves. I did however enjoy a few episodes. When I saw the movie, I found it extremely complicted, and almost boring. Basically, it was like watching two episodes in one sitting, wich I would only reccomend for the hard core fans. The hallway scene was very lackluster, probably because the two of them have hardly even brushed hands in the tv series. At the end of the movie, I still had no idea what the hell their trying to get at with this whole alien thing, and if you ask me its getting very tired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling!","review":"This movie was thrilling, awesome, & exciting as I expected it would be. Anyone who has been following the X-Files TV series obviously needs to see this movie as a part of the continuing, on-going plot. The intrigue is definitely still there. What a cool idea to put part of the show in the movie theaters...as in all my movie/book reviews, I don't want to give away any of the plot or exciting parts because I don't want to ruin it for you, so I'm going to remain non-specific. Let's just say, you won't be sorry for buying or watching this DVD, it's well worth your time & money, & a MUST for any true X-Files fan like myself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Disappointment","review":"This basically played like a 2nd rate mytharc episode withoutcommercials.Badly written and convoluted, this film marked the beginning ofthe end for this once great show.It made me realize the truth isn't out there and that the creators of the show are only in it for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"Good movie but the box was crushed when it reached my house.

I give it a four, not because of it being a bad movie, but because of the quality of shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who hired these writers?","review":"What a piece of garbage. What kind of cover up is this when they blow up an entire building just to destroy three alien virus infected dead bodies and those bodies weren't even in the building so that Scully can perform her little autopsy and so that the movie can show you an awesome explosion of a building. Is this necessary??? What about those other firemen that worked together? Don't they know something's going on??? FEMA, a secret govenment? lol, now this is funny. Too bad for Michael Brown, our short live secret idiot president."},{"rating":"1","title":"theyre all kids","review":"all these people writing 5 star reviews must be ten-year olds that checked the \\"Im over 13 years old box\\" before sudmitting their review. this was an spectacular example of film-makers on every illegal drug you can think of at the same time. its an insult to the entire world and anyone with any kind of intelligence. i cant believe i had to even give this crap a star."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best film I have ever seen!","review":"This is an amazing film.

It is fairly predictable and you almost always know what will happen next. The bee and alien scenes were excellent but effects could have been better. In short the movie is lame most of the time and I would suggest watching the TV series."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A MOVIE!!!","review":"At first i thought the show would never work as a movie I WAS SOOOO WRONG!This movie blew me away.Great acting great story and great special effects.Now that it is comming to DVD we can see it with extra footage and a comentary.If you have never see the show before do not worry the movie is stil watchable and ejoyable with out have seeing the show.I cant wait for more movies from this great show!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EVERTHING YOU WANTED AND MORE.

In the TV series the endings are predictable, but not for the movie. It is a best buy,not a waste of money. The hallway scene was great. I think a kiss would be better for the series, true fans of the X-Files should only be able to see them kiss. I've watched the show ever since it started airing, how many fans can say they have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely out of this world!","review":"Watching the series then watching the movie answered quite a few questions i have been waiting for the last five years for. The special effects and acting is superb, and the storyline is top notch. It is bigger and better than the series and matches any big blockbuster of that summer. Definately worth watching being a fan of The X-Files or not, it caters for both sides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie , good characters and script","review":"This movie was a great movie and one anyone could enjoy- X-Phile or not. The characters were easy to relate to, and the actors brought a certain amount of life to the screen. Although this movie is a drama, the writers also put in humor in just the right spots to ease tension and make it one of the best films of 1998. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys a good drama/sci-fi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for X-Philes","review":"Okay, I only watched the first two seasons of the X-Files. I can't speak for all you X-Philes, but the average person who doesn't watch the show will like this movie. A great plot and good performances highlight this film. I can see why Gillian Anderson gets all that fan mail. A great movie for all sci-fi fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is Grotesque?","review":"I always thought that the ISU would make a great story someday. And here it is.

Even for a \\"non X-Filer\\" this movie would keep you entertained and may even get you interested in watching the whole series. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Movie","review":"The movie was roughly the half-way point of the series. After the movie, the show shifted production from Vancouver to Los Angeles. The movie itself is pretty good, I just wish they had included more characters from the show. However, I can understand why they didn't, since they wanted the movie to appeal to non-fans of the show. Many of the themes and cinematography of the film were incorporated into the show as it went on. The blu-ray itself is great, the gag real is probably the best feature, although the menus can be hard to navigate."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies of all time.","review":"This is a great movie with excellent actors and a well-thought plot.

At the end of the fifth season it was widely reported that the show was over, so I went to the movie thinking that it would be a nice wrap-up to one of my favorite shows. Instead, I found out those reports were a ploy to get you to come see this movie. I was disappointed, very disappointed.

Just look at where the show went to after the movie. I still can't believe how stone cold awful it got.As for the movie itself, it's alright, but it's a very Hollywood version of The X-Files. It doesn't hold up to the better episodes of the earlier seasons - they're the real X-Files, and very cinematic."},{"rating":"2","title":"X-Files Movie rocks!","review":"This definitely caps off what has gone on in the X-Files for the past several years. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson both shine in this wonderfully directed (by Chris Carter) production. Also, those of you who are shippers will find this movie to be a real treat.

The movie is very weak, there is neither acting nor plot in it. The alien looks like my old carpet. I think we could make a better alien with computer special effects today. Have you seen aliens in Independance Day ? these look like real aliens ! The movie is very representative of the eighties, that is to say with an american family of the middle class, with a good dog and a great barbecue. The music is often tearful with a lot of tremolos. I don't think honestly that E.T could be appreciated by children nowdays, the poor E.T looks like a fake doll. Poor E.T, if i were him, i would go home immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"An incredibly overrated movie.","review":"Being born in the E.T. generation, one might expect me to be more nostalgic about this film. The problem is that E.T. is one of the most boring, emotionally shallow movies of the last 30 years. It's only point is to make the viewer depressed over the terrible treatment of an alien being. The creature E.T. is completely unlovable and unbelievable. Spielburg is very good at pushing the viewers emotional buttons, but little else. This movie lacks substance and direction, and I've never felt more bored than when watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF I COULD I WAOULD GIVE IT NO STAR!","review":"This film is among the worst, most pointless, and most inane garbage that I've ever had the misfortune to view. Contrary to popular belief the alien was not cute he was CREEPY! The little boy was extremely annoying, and his relationship with the alien made me ill! Actually it made me more than ill, it was down right disturbing! His bond with the alien was one of the most freeky thing I have ever had to witness, and the kids family was just obnoixious. By the time the alien go home no one really cares anymore. You are just relieved that the film is finally over.

This is such a classic story and John Williams' soundtrack helps drive it -- so the music enhancements alone make it worth investing in this DVD. The live performance of the soundtrack option is fantastic and a one-of-a-kind feature. Throw in that it also includes the original E.T. release on Disc 2 (in simple Dolby Surround) and it's an even better deal. I'd rate it a must buy for any John Williams soundtrack fan as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, great set","review":"Let me explain something that I feel a lot of people are forgetting. This set doesn't only include the new version, but the old as well. That's a great deal, since you can choose which one you would like to see. If you hate the new effects and CGI, don't watch it. It's that simple.Now don't get me wrong. I think the newer version is very silly, and I wonder if Spielberg really thought it looked good when he did it. Maybe if he were to do it in around 10 years, it wouldn't look so animated.I did like the deleted bathroom scene though, even though it was done with CGI. It would have been nice to have seen that in the original, but I guess that would be having my cake and eating it too.There is nothing flawed about this set, it simply just gives some options that not everyone will want to choose. If you enjoy the movie, you will enjoy this set.

Despite the theme being somewhat tried and tested several times before this does emerge as a unique and absolutley fantastic fantasy movie with still very stunning visual effects and wonderful performances. Alongside, THE WIZARD OF OZ, this possibly has to be the greatest child fantasy film of all time! Its blend of humour and sometimes highly emotional scenes add to the greatness of this film and the ending is sure to get a lump in even adults throats. An excellent classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blasphemy!!!!","review":"How can they do this?!! THIS IS A CRIME AGAINST MAN!!! I imagine that you're wondering what I'm SO angry about. If you don't know, Mr. Spielberg went back and changed the policeman's shot-guns with walky talkys for the DvD release. Why, you may ask, is this such a big deal? Well then just imagine Indiana Jones swinging across a ravine filled with cottonballs using a candycane. Imagine the shark in \\"Jaws\\" spitting candy at it's victims before carrying them off to timeout. Imagine the D-Day invasion with troops armed with walky talkys and blood replaced with Jello.

To me, this is purely kids stuff. I find it boring, badly acted, an unimaginative plot, and sappy. Emotionally, it does nothing for me. The crass commercialism of flashing brand names such as Reese's pieces and Reynolds Wrap is offensive to me. Calling one's brother \\"penis breath\\" hardly rates as family fare, and zillions of kids must have emulated that line. One minute E.T. can't talk and the next minute he's speaking the human language and understanding everything--it's all too silly. I have no empathy for the poor, ugly creature--Sorry! Aside from the language, I guess it's an OK older kids (say ages 8-14 or so) film, but a yawner for adults.

Bad choice by Universal, and one which I hope will be quickly rectified."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDER-FILLED","review":"Steven Spielberg's childhood fantasy reaches so deeply into our collective youth that it becomes real to you. No wonder it broke box-office records everywhere, and remains one of the most successful films of all time. This movie oozes the heart and soul of a man who yearns to have back the wonder and joy of being a child. All of the performances are winning, from Henry Thomas' wide-eyed yet melancholy boy, to Dee Wallace Stone's believable mother, to Drew Barrymore's truly hilarious and adorable Gertie. John Williams' music will forever engender the magic of a boy, his bike and his beloved alien friend cycling past a full moon.

I think that is because the movie leans so heavily on the culture and technology of the '80s. However, kids will still love it because the story is realistically told from a young boy's point of view and because the theme is one of love and hope.

Drew Barrymore turned in the only good work of her professional career. There was an occasional touch of humor (E.T. hiding among the stuffed animals in the closet, for example).But overall, it was maudlin and lacked consistency, and was diluted by the cheap laughs that Hollywood garners by having little kids use vulgar language. Also, It doesn't take a genius to see the pseudo-religious allegory in the story. That probably says a lot about our society; people reject traditional religion, but still have a yearning to believe in something bigger and better than themselves. They satisfy that yearning by believing in warm and fuzzy aliens. Hence the hordes of people who give this very unexceptional movie 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extra Terrible","review":"The makers of this film believe that an 11-year-old calling his brother \\"penis-breath\\" is funny.

The original and re release) and a bonus features disc. Each of the other DVDs also had special features as well. It also included a CD of the remastered complete score. A hardcover coffee table book on the making of E.T. with incredible images. A COA and a matted 35 mm frame of the move! NOW THAT IS WAS A COLLECTORS EDITION! Not this Toys-R-Us horse shit for $140 bucks! I'm definitely buying E.T. on Bluray but not this version.

It is hard not to be enamored with this movie, as it has a bit of everything from humor, to adventure to drama, really something for all. For me I loved the deleted scenes and the behind the scenes, making of the movie bonus features, as I always learn so much more about the movie but also about what was going through the minds of the creators when I watch these.

It's the only film I have ever cried during. When E.T. dies, I cried. Yeah, I fell for Spielberg's magic touch. It's truly a wonderful film. No explosions. No computer graphics. Just pure Spielberg genius. It's surprising that this film was never followed by a sequel. If the film had been made today, then Universal Studios would have demanded a few sequels to this great film. This film is worth owning on VHS and it really needs to be released on DVD. This was probably the best film released during the eighties.

I strongly recommend you buy it. Go to the video store nearest you an purchase it. Its a superb film that was scrubbed out of an Oscar by Ghandi.

And my biggest reason of all for giving this 1 star is because of most of the movie, we can hardly see E.T.

One night he finds E.T (voice of Michael Patrick Bilon) in his backyard. At first he tells his family and they don't believe him. But when E.T comes back, Elliott shows his family (except his mother, he shows him to his brothers and sister). I can't even believe this is a children's movie.

The night I saw E.T., my perspective on life was changed forever. Before the 'T' Man (That's what I like to call my bud E.T.) I used to collect barbie dolls and watch moths mate in my windowsills. (Of course that isn't a very good way for a 47 year old man like myself to pick up women. Nights would pass, I would ponder the meaning of life as I lined up my barbies for a tea party. I was always devastated when Ken showed up, I got so jealous. He always stole Barbie from me. One night I set his corvette on fire to get even.Anyway, back to 'T'. He has inspired me so. During the lowest times in my life when I about hit rock bottom, T lifted me up.T overcame his struggles as a young street tough from the projects. He used to sell lemonade by the spoonful to the chimney sweepers. If that is not enough to inspire you, there must be something wrong.

This book seemed to be rushed and not a lot of attention was paid to detail. Oh and let's not forget the 50 plus year old woman with a three year old!

I enjoyed how each character's story ended, but hated Wellington in the end. Jada got such a bad rep from everyone about her past decisions, while Wellington lived like a king trying to be a \\"ladie's man\\". I wish death on no one, but his end was fitting because of his vast wrong-doings. Darrius and Fancy learned so much about life and grew together as a couple.

Very flexible without feeling too flabby. After several on/offs realized I only had to set the tension chord once - because the stretch fabric makes it easy to take off and put back on without readjusting. The cover is versatile enough to allow carrying lighter items along with keyboard. Have taken to putting small plastic music stand inside before stowing keyboard in travel bag - keeps it from sliding around and possibly getting chipped or worse.

But keep in mind, this was summer 1989 when a series of adult contemporary ballads by Bolton, Richard Marx, and Grayson Hugh were hits. I still think that he got better with \\"Time Love and Tenderness\\" and \\"The One Thing\\" (his best album).

National Park Ranger Terry Carmichael must guide the grounded and stranded Hale across the demanding desert landscape--and ends up fighting beside him against an unimaginable menace.

First she attempts to arrest a US Air force pilot (!) instead of offering assistance and then she turns into John Rambo for the duration of the film! She is a Park Ranger for crying out loud!As for the rating, it should have been PG-13.Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off, primarily due to the writers.No masterpiece here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burning Up","review":"Broken Arrow (a lost nuclear missile) takes off as an explosive action-packed movie of treason, courage, and beauty. John Travolta's performance as the rogue USAF pilot Deak is unpredictably terrific. And Christian Slater is the true-blue soldier who has to save the day. Samantha Mathis is plain beautiful. Gun-drawn hesitation on the part of the nuclear extortioners is slightly on the unrealistic side. However, there are lots of awesome chopper crash-and-burns in this film, a prominently incredible one being a military helicopter going down from an EMP."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty damn good","review":"A favorite of mine when i was a kid. here i am 10 years later still watching it.

The action scenes are occasionally stilted. Sometimes, they're good (the car chase) and sometimes downright bad (train finale, need I say more). John Woo is a brilliant director in his own right, but he disappoints here. Luckily, each of his films in American release have been getting significantly better (M:I-2 is incredibly entertaining and Face/Off has some great shootouts). Even then if you enjoy the action scenes in Broken Arrow, who can forget the cheesy lines of dialogue which are meant to be humorous but end up sounding downright painful. What about the special effects, which look cheesy half the time? There's too much wrong with this already dumb action/thriller. I really recommending avoiding it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Depth, nauseating....trite, for fans of flat, uncharging films","review":"everyone should burn this dvd. Horrible acting, slow, moronic script, lackluster dialouge, Travolta is truly second rate B actor in this, Slater is appalling as per usual, (with the exception of Pump Up the Volume, which I found rather delicious as a feel good film)The film just doesn't go anywhere, it's a movie you forget about a week later after you watch it. It is simply a 'fair' film, with frosh dialouge from a liberal arts major at a state college. In this reviewers opinion, it is probably in the top twenty or so worst acting films in the cinemas history. No emotion, no depth, a zero star. Horrendously crafted.

A fight ensues and Slater is ejected from the plane while Deakins steals the nuclear bombs....This movie is a high action film with two good actors playing the key roles. The military are looking for the nuclear bombs and they are blaming the wrong guy for the crime.

The only thing worse than the acting is the writting. Rather than make a good action movie with decent writting, John Woo tryings to impress people with numerous explosions. At least 4 helicopters explode when the would not have in reality; one is shot down with a handgun, another starts leaking fuel for no reason (which is imediatly ignited by another gun), etc. I would not recomend this to anyone, under any circumstances.

There is never a dull moment in this movie. John Travolta does an outstanding job portraying a villain. Christain Slater plays the role of the hero just as well. The character that is played by Travolta literally steals some nuclear warheads with the evil intentions of making a profit. It becomes the duty of Slater to apprehend the bad guy. There is an exciting chase across the country that will keep you on the edge of your seat. One of the nuclear devices is actually detonated.

Slater tosses a can of gas on the hood of Travolta's humvee and that slows him down for, what, 15 minutes? 20 minutes? Not probable. Not remotely.

Rather than trying to help overcome our sensitivity,Dr.Aron provides necessary information as to why we're sensitve and our place in the world.A great self-help tool that doesn't instantly provide answers,but makes us aware that what we really need to sustain ourselves is already there inside of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost no information","review":"I bought this cassette hoping that I could get some information about this subject in a format I could listen to while walking.

And cheap is what you might find. My front tube went two weeks riding on the flat paved roads every other day for 8 miles--that's 50 miles. Then out of the blue it popped a 1-foot rip with a loud \\"BANG!\\". I was on the level and close to home, fortunately. You may not be so lucky. The tire was pumped to 52 lbs. pressure at the time and there were no punctures to the tire or spoke problems. Just buy Specialized tubes, or a reputable brand and you will have normal success with them. I won't be buying these again, and I'm worried that my rear tube is still a Sunlite brand. I suppose it is possible that the front tube was a lemon, but I've never had a tube rip on the seam like that before.

A light comedy with an unpromising plot that delivers an original, but slightly boring story about a family and a new woman that comes into their lives. Some of the scenes are quite funny, such as the sex talk scene, but nothing really stood out in this movie as all that great. I liked it, but I had a hard time paying attention the whole way through. And, to be honest, after I finished watching it I put on Pride & Prejudice and fell asleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful film that did not get a large audience","review":"This is a delightful true story of a boy who grew up with a somewhat eccentric father, an inventor, in a large estate in post-World War I Scotland; the boy, age 10, later became an important figure in British TV. The film was made some years back before Colin Firth, its star, won an academy award for The King's Speech. The film is delightful to watch and audiences who saw it enjoyed it, but the film never made it because, according to its director Hugh Hudson, Miramax who owned the film did not push it. He claims that Miramax did not want it to succeed because they were pushing another of their films, one that won an academy award."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely, gentle true story","review":"The film takes place on an estate in rural Scotland right after WWI. Three generations live together in the huge house, really a castle, there are servants to keep the place immaculate and serve wonderful meals. The pace of life is slow but with ten young children around, and an eccentric father, there is plenty of life. People fish and swim and listen to Beethovan on the phonograph, play the piano and sing, and have dances and curling matches. It's like taking a vacation from our over-stimulated lives to watch this family.Sure there are problems...the father becomes enamored of the brother-in-law's young French fiancee, there is competition for who will inherit the estate and then there is the problem of how to run the place. But somehow things work out and you're left with a very pleasant feeling.There are fine performances by all, led by the wonderful Colin Firth. His presence and the spectacular scenery make this a film worth seeing. Plus, it's a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"artist on the book","review":"This book reflects the life and work of a major independent figure. The work spans the second half of the 20th century and shows an alternate answer to the dilemma of post second war Art. Not abstract while dealing with the heavy burden of the great Holocaust and the use of the Atomic bomb. That history had changed forever what violence could become. The artist answered with a figurative art rather than chaotic forms yet his images are provacative and disturbing. The formal means are convincing, even beguiling. The text by Mario de Michele a model for writers on Art as it is not jargon or intellectual ballet but filled with exciting and revelatory ideas of a liberal thinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: Awful!","review":"It seems to me that most reviews are positive - usually written by readers who enjoyed the book.

Instead this book is a overly lenghty diatribe about valiant Poles being betrayed by, well, everyone else.

After that, it's still hard to use with the case on: basic navigation is okay, but when you do lots of button presses you need to take it out of the case. I hear it causes a GPS to float, which could potentially be a good thing (knowing my clumsiness) and it does do a good job of protecting your GPS. Perhaps the Garmin brand case is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pay attention","review":"All of you who said \\"I am a lesbian, so I can comment on this movie honestly,\\" or said that this movie is \\"anti-gay\\" weren't paying attention. Paulie isn't a \\"lesbian\\" (whatever the hell that is), she is a person in love. While the script isn't full-tilt perfect, and yes, it is Canadian so the cinematagrophy is very TV-esque (haven't you ever watched any other Canadian films?), Piper's knock out performance is worth it alone, and the girl who plays Mouse (and also plays a girl in love with a girl on the excellent TV series Once and Again) deserves credit just for the amazing projects she's been associated with in just the first few years of her carrear.

I rented this dvd with the greatest hopes. After about half an hour I realized I was in for yet another plotless, uninspired, repressed look at teen sexuality. Politically it's a complete horror - of course the girls must all suffer for their sins. Symbolically it rises to the level of bad junior high school poetry - barely. Yes the performances all all very good. And its great to see Jackie Burroughs in anything. But for a REAL treatment of similar topics get NICO AND DANI or SHOW ME LOVE. Both show that on this subject, like most (other than mindless violence or overpriced special effects) European filmmakers are still light years ahead of us sophomoric Americans...."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIDICULOUS !","review":"What is wrong with all you people who liked this film. The writing was so bad that I found my self laughing at times. The ending is ridiculous and the acting was awful .... I am a teenager, so I know what teenage angst is like and that is certainly not it. This film is full of petty melodrama thatis completely cliche. If you are looking for a good film see Kids, Gummo, Ghost World, or Bully. I'm sure the people that liked this film that are reading this review are and thinking that I am too young to get it or something like that, which is not true at all. I asked for Citizen Kane on my fifth birthday ... . I have loved film since the day I was born and I know a good movie when I see one. Anyway, I think that I am done ranting for now.P.S.

The acting is surprisingly genuine. The moment that Tory realizes that she just betrayed the love of her life after telling her younger sister that Paulie has a thing for her and that she is not \\"like that\\" and she bursts into tears...it seemed very genuine. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone. It's obviously a relevant topic and source of conflict that many people can relate to. I like the movie \\"Imagine Me & You\\", but Piper's acting was a lot better in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Made, if Cliche Story of Teen Heartbreak","review":"The symbolism is a bit heavy-handed, the parallel stories of the wounded hawk re-taught to fly and Pauline the damaged teen whose rejection by the girl she desperately loves is too much for her. But the exquisite music, fine acting, sharp photography and editing, and the physical beauty of the three leads combine to give power to this simple story of love and loss. The handling of the setting -- a girl's boarding school -- is not exploitative but sympathetic. Pretty good all around. An English treatment of the theme -- forbidden love at boarding school -- is Karel Reisz' excellent 1982Another Countrywith Colin Firth and Rupert Everett."},{"rating":"2","title":"Piper Perabo fan","review":"I liked this quaint, quirky film. I don't know why. I found the storyline mostly light fare, but at times deeply troubling, yet introspective, about peoples acceptance level of other peoples lifestyles and choices.

Highly recommended viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"superb acting, but a mediocre script","review":"When Mary (Mischa Barton) arrives at boarding school, she quickly finds out that her roommates Paulie (Piper Perabo) and Tori (Jessica Paré) have a lesbian relationship. When Tori's younger sister also finds out, Tori feels forced to end the relationship, because she thinks her parents will never understand. Paulie can't take this and goes mental.So far so good. This could actually make a very interesting movie. But unfortunately, the rest of the script kills it. The movie unfolds in dramatic clichés upon more dramatic clichés, from the passionate reciting of poetry to a duel between Paulie and Tori's new boyfriend. It all just gets too over the top dramatic, which is a shame, because the entire cast gives out a superb performance and really deserved better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie I have Ever Seen","review":"This movie is one of the best movie si have ever seen.

So many good reviews for this movie, so my criticism is valid since I was expecting it to be good.This movie was sophomoric. The visual look was like a made-for-TV movie, which always means the story isn't any better. The acting was plain jane bordering on Cheesy(except for Piper Perabo). The characters weren't interesting or unique--and there were a few cliches: the token minority girl (the Asian); the wise Native American man to give the movie some male presence.The story wasn't so bad. Just the delivery of these components made it such a failure.Avoid this movie.

Mischa Barton does an excellent job as the new girl sent to live at an all girl's college. She quickly becomes close friends with her two roommates, Pauline and Tory, who are also lovers. The imagery and cinematography in this film are done brilliantly, some of the best I've ever seen. Great story outstandingly told as well. The acting is occasionally a bit overdramatic, but still quite superb. The ending is a little predictable, but I think most people (the smart ones anyway) would find this film to be quite evocative and most excellent nonetheless... And they would definitely be right :).Based on the book The Wives of Bath by Susan Swan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good idea, considerably poor execution","review":"I really did like how the movie was emotional, tastefully sexual, and heart-wrenching all at the same time. However, I do think that the script could have used a bit of work. It got the message across, but not as strongly has it should have. At times it seemed like the actors were using incredibly unrealistic words to communicate to each other, and these words seemed out of context. The poetic readings were good, but could have been better. Overall, I think the movie was good and it is a decent way to spend time in front of the TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly bad","review":"I have to say, usually I find Amazon reviews to be a helpful place to find out more information about an item, and I usually find that the reviews are at least relatively on target. This movie is a shocking exception. I'm amazed at the large number of positive reviews for a movie that I nearly couldn't watch all of the way through, it was so painfully overwrought. Add together an overdose of teen angst with some overdone dark symbolism and you wind up with this film.I expected so much more. I think the film tried really hard to be artistic, deep, meaningful, and powerful. But it just tried TOO hard, and instead ended up being self-indulgent and irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"I liked this movie for a few minutes, then it became a frustrating exercise in misery.The ending was a complete bummer...and I couldn't help but notice that the one character (Played by Picabo) spent a hell of a lot of time running aimlessly all over the school grounds.Get into fight with girlfriend...run.Get upset about girlfriend...run some more.Get caught in bed with girlfriend...run, run, run.This chick runs everywhere!It gets tedious.I'm in the minority on this one.

It brought me to tears, it made me laugh, and it really screwed with my emotions...I was crying for 3 days after I saw it the first time, then 6 days later I went back to see it again. I would be honestly surprised if Jessica Paré doesn't become high demand after this amazing performance as a girl torn between her true love and what her parents expect out of her. I loved it, I can't wait for it to come out on video so that I can watch it every day. You can watch it from different views, as it is told by Mary, but you can also see it in Polly and Tori's perspectives. A must see for everyone, but be warned that there is a shocking ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Experiencing Piper","review":"Piper Perabo shows why she is a brilliant young actress with many wonderful performances ahead of her.

Lost and Delirious further proves that I can never go wrong with movies made by any Canadian film-makers. However, I'm frustrated that I've been searching for the OST for the whole night in HMV and on the net but to my surprise, I COULDN'T find it!!! Can anyone tell me where I can purchase such a perfect soundtrack by Yves Chamberland or if the OST has ever been released? I really wanna get it!

I know that this movie was made by lesbian director, Lea Pool and I want to support her efforts. However, this movie, besides having an overdone, hackneyed plot, was full of trite and affected dialogue. Ok, so I'm a realist, sue me, but I'm sorry, no one I know would who's in high school would jump on a table in full fencing regalia and recite Shakespearean soliloquy. In the end, heterosexuality wins out and the poor lesbian, being tortured as she is, must put herself out of her misery. I can't recommend this and hope that if you must see it, by all means rent it.

It is a tale of friendship, dispair, obsession and destruction. Piper Perabo delivers an unbelievably good performance and marks her place as an excecellent actor, and as a mega star that you WILL hear of and see again and again. This woman can make a speech with her eyes. A true great. VERY loosely based on the novel \\"The Wives of Bath\\" and the first english language movie from Swiss-French-Canadian director Lea Pool. Jessica Pare as Perabo's par amour is beautiful and perfectly suited for the part of the woman who puts fear above love. If you don't feel for these doomed lovers you ain't human! Beautiful movie, beautiful music, and truly moving. 700 obsessed fans can't be wrong. Watch it soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely, tortured love","review":"I've seen movies where the plot, dialogue and symbolism seem contrived. For some reason this movie always resonates truth, no matter how many times I've watched.To me, this movie is about how beautiful love can be and how quickly it can be changed from outside influences. It illustrates the delicacy and intamacy of passion, how precarious of a perch that we put ourselves on when we are truly ingrained in another, and how quickly the bubble can be pierced by our own doubt or the doubt of others.Movies (or books!) are just stories that we like to take part in to educate, entertain, or express ourselves within. I liked this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"(Please pardon spelling)L&D defentally deserves five stars.

Not growing up lesbian, but now an out lesbian, I understood the feelings of rejection and hurt. My partner, however, looked at me with tears in her eyes (not a \\"crier\\"), and said to me, \\"This is why most adult lesbians are f***ed up.\\" It really hit home. The level of devastation, not only to be rejected by your lover, but a denial of ever being involved...whew.

I'm so tired of these melodramatic films where lesbians are always portrayed to be \\"head cases\\" or drug addicts. In my own opinion I found this movie hard to watch and actually couldn't wait until it was over. Pauline was a definite nut and if I were Tory I would've been happy to finally realize what would've happened if they had stayed together much longer. I give this movie 2 stars simply because of the great pyschotic actions of Pauline. She was really SCARY!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, just another teen angst flick...","review":"When I first heard of this movie, I thought had to see it. But by the end of the movie, I found myself wishing it was over a lot sooner. The situations Piper Perabo's character continued to put herself into, i.e. the library scene, the father/daughter dance, and the duel, were long, drawn out, and highly unnecessary. Halfway through, I found myself wishing that Piper Perabo's character would just kill herself already and get it over with. Jessica Pare's character was at least believable, but it definitely wasn't necessary to make sure we knew she didn't go \\"that way\\" when she watched the girl and guy do it against the tree (she only got turned on watching the hetero-sex).

The music is sappy. There are too many unimportant unfulfilled subplots throughout. The reference to \\"The Raptor\\" is never completely explained. And last but not least,wonderful, wonderful Graham Greene is wasted in this film.I truly wanted to care about Paulie - but I found her unsympathetic. I didn't care if she was happy - I just wanted her off of my screen! Mouse (Mary) seemed to have a very pointless role - it seemed as if she just wandered into the film, mistook it for realife and got snagged into drama that was too far fetched to be believable.I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived creased","review":"The poster arrived with a rather distracting crease spanning it lengthwise, and was lower resolution that I had expected (though the latter could be due to the original painting being a smaller size perhaps)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Have this one framed in thin black frame.

You will want to get to know her through this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artistry In Storytelling","review":"Recently I finished a fascinating book by Betty Dravis. 1106 Grand Boulevard is an emotional rollercoaster ride through the life of a character named Billie Jean. There is glitz and glamour, but also a lot of heartache.Ms. Dravis's ability to seamlessly mix truth and fiction leaves the reader with an impression of reality through the whole story. The talented way in which she uses Billie Jean's childhood home as a recurring location to provide cohesion is simply brilliant.I love the description of each and every setting in which the book finds Billie Jean. The artistry of the storytelling painted locations for me to imagine as I watched this shocking life unfold. Page after page is filled with the very fabric of the past.I really enjoyed reading this book. It is definitely a stand-out-in-a-crowd. Thanks Betty, for writing such a captivating story."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to admit - this ones got nerve!","review":"Harsh, brutally honest film from Woody Allen is certainly no holds barred in the language department. Film depicts the life of writer Harry Block who only has himself to blame for the chaos he finds himself in. Woody makes himself quite unsympathetic this time around - far from his lovable nerd in 'Play It Again Sam ('72). Film lacks the romanticism of \\"Annie Hall\\" and \\"Manhattan\\" and therefore may not be as easy to take to your hearts but it's certainly a sharp and ferocious piece of work which succeeds 100% in its intention - throwing us a long remembered slug in the guts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The half of the sin is the scandal!","review":"This film is the most acid and bitter in all the filmography . Don't expect you are invited just to watch another film of Woody Allen . This work plays hard and challenges you . Allen literally makes a social surgeon abou a lot of aspects considered as normal by mostly of us .Allen has never been so merciless in any other movie . There is a remarkable point what the creation means : all creation demands the destruction of the previous order .With this advise in mind , just proceed to watch it . You will laugh but the result may be in many cases a forced smile ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writer's Block","review":"When a writer faces that inevitable bugaboo...writer's block...he reviews his life, trying to examine all his mistakes, character flaws and foibles.

Woody plays a conniving author who manipulates and scams his way through his life's relationships. The clever premise of the film is that his life becomes the basis for a screenplay. The problem? It is not funny or ironic. Only foul mouthed and rude. How I long for the magic of \\"Broadway Danny Rose\\", \\"Manhattan\\" or the other Allen classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fans of Woody Allen will like it","review":"This was a pretty good Woody Allen film packed with well known celebrities. Woody Allen is playing a novelist named Harry who written books based on people he knowns. He doesn't tries much to disguise them and upsets his friends with his tales. There are funny moments when the movie segues to his fictional characters. My favorite is the one with Demi Moore. The one with Billy Crystal is pretty funny too. In Harry's real life I got a kick out of Cookie the goodhearted prostitute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loathesome film that makes Allen look pathetic.","review":"The usual Woody Allen neurotic schtick, this time enhanced with insights into his heretofore unexamined racism and self- hatred. How is it that this man has made umpteen films about heterogeneous New York City, but only in this movie does he have non-white characters? And why are these characters both \\"exotic\\" prostitutes? Why are observant Jews treated so harshly? One gets the sence that deep down, Woody Allen is uncomfortable with anyone who isn't a WASP. His enfatuation with the shiksa and shaygats ideals gets tiresome."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can a once talented performer turn out such garbage?","review":"Is this just another tiresome examination of his neuroses by Woody Allen? It is much worse than that. Is it reflection of the era we are in that a once gifted writer/producer/actor allows his name to be linked to a piece of foul-mouthed garbage?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deconstructing Harry","review":"This is Woody at his absolutely lowest point. The film is not remotely funny, and we see a sad and unintentionally revolting parody of the Woody character that appeared so brilliantly in his earlier films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...This is a Stinker","review":"Usually there's at least a few laughs in a Woody Allen movie, and many of them have more than a few.But this one was just AWFUL. Ten times the neuroses and ten times the vulgarity of a typical Allen film. Overall a totally graceless, droning film experience which I regretted having. I really can't believe this movie get so many glowing reviews here. Not to mention that most of the humor is quite adolescent.A low point for Allen."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great movie!","review":"I believe this to be one of Woody Allen's new classic films. It's fun, sexual, and of course a bit weird. What else do you expect from Woody? I own this DVD and give the movie a full 5 stars but the DVD itself lacks a bit so it gets only a 4 star rating. Couldn't they at least put the trailer on the DVD? I also wish Woody would do running commentary like on some other titles but no such luck. The only real extra on this DVD is the Cast List/Biography/Filmography for almost 20 known actors. Also, the DVD has no art and is double-sided, this feature allows you to watch the film in full screen mode or wide screen mode. Apparently you must physically flip the disc to switch between the two modes. All in all this DVD is worth buying . . . unless there is a new release with more features (I seriously doubt that will happen). Enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this movie","review":"I am a big Woody Allen fan; Broadway Danny Rose is still one of my all time favorite movies. But I found this film mean-spirited and depressing. Mr. Allen has made several terrific movies, revolving around the basic story of the compassionate and intelligent underdog struggling to try to comprehend the human condition, and the importance of interpersonal relationships and trying to help others. He appears to have given up on relationships and people as a whole. Perhaps he has become more cynical. Perhaps more realistic. In either case, I just found it saddening. I heartily recommend Broadway Danny Rose, Annie Hall, Manhattan, Stardust Memories, Love and Death, and Sleeper for anyone looking for funny and thoughtful movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Allen, your shtick is old, old, OLD!","review":"Another Woody Allen film, another parade of pointless cameos of Hollywood stars clamoring to be in a Woody Allen film. I've enjoyed Allen's previous films, but after viewing Deconstructing Harry, I 'm afraid Woody Allen just grates on me now.

Many remember him for \\"Annie Hall,\\" while others appreciate his darker side in \\"Crimes and Misdemeanors.\\" I lean toward the latter, and therefore find this film among his very best. Brilliantly conceived, the jump cuts that create the sense of memory at work begin early with the arrival of Judy Davis at Woody's apartment, to give him hell for having depicted their relationship in his recent novel. Davis is at her best, a fulminating monster of rage. Memory and guilt fill the story of this tormented writer who has no sense of loyalty, save that to his art. The actors are fantastic: Richard Benjamin, Billy Crystal, Philip Bosco, Robin Williams. This film was made when Woody was at the top of his form. His cast and crew fully fulfill the tormented inner life of the writer whose needs are insatiable."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"I was forced to watch this movie for college. It was the most vulgar, unnecessary piece of junk I have ever seen.

But the man obviously knows his Fellini; remember the insufferable bore who stood behind Woody and Diane Keaton in \\"Annie Hall\\"? The most irritating thing about the guy is that he was probably right--Fellini was indeed a very indulgent filmmaker. He's just too loud about it. But who wrote the dialogue that he spoke? Woody Allen. He's made a viscious, vulgar, and funny movie in \\"Deconstructing Harry\\". But oh Lord is he indulgent. Few people have so lavishly exposed their emotional and personal ticks to the world, with such faith that everyone will care. He's still extremely talented. But someday, someone will make a movie in which the hero stands on line in front of some jerk who says, \\"I just thought Allen's last film was so indulgent. It's true, he's really one of the most indulgent filmmakers...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"quirky","review":"The film was the usual oddity by the director, with a number ofhumorous vignettes: The fight with his analist wife during hersession with a patient, a visit to the lowest level of hell tovisit satan and bump into the inventor of aluminum siding, anda serial cannibal.

Not b/c I am glad people were offended by it, but b/c it makes me realize that I am right in deciding to view Woody's films several times before forming an opinion of them. The Woody persona has new life breathed into it by this film, and the master proves that he does not need to be mostly dramatic to still make a seriously wonderful flick. Judy Davis is too good to be true, while Woody succeeds in showing his adoring fans and newcomers how his enemies think of him. I rarely am so sure of my opinions in the face of credible opposition, but I know that this is a masterpiece, and it does require a few viewings to be truly appreciated. Woody usually creates two absolute stunners per decade. Along with Husbands and Wives, Deconstructing Harry is probably one for the 90s.

I was distracted by the foul-mouthed Allen character; made to feel uncomfortable. Which was the point I guess. The film opens with a vicious argument and a strange, repeated image that unsettles. If you were expecting something else, you have to adjust.I adjusted better the second time through and enjoyed it much more, hence this edited review. There are plenty of good jokes (like the out of focus actor, played surprisingly subtly by Robin Williams) and set pieces. The scene when Harry visits his sister is particularly funny - classic Woody Allen.On the whole, I felt the film was treading old ground perhaps a little more than usual. I don't think of it as one of my favourite Woody Allen films, but it does stand repeated viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roth's influence is clearly seen and felt in this film","review":"I won't bother repeating what's already been said about this wonderful movie.What I will do is recommend that those who enjoyed this movie pick up Phillip Roth's classic *Portnoy's Complaint,* the stream-of-consciousness rantings of a successful 2nd-generation Jewish lawyer about his upbringing, his past, his guilt, his sex drive, and all the things that they drive him to do.-J."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jerusalems Heart","review":"Book arrived quickly and in shape described.

After the publication of Shiloh Autumn, however, I found her subsequent books to be a bit dry and uninspiring. Even the first two books in this series, though good, lacked the passion and eloquence of the earlier Thoene writings. In Jerusalem's Heart, though, it would seem that the Thoenes of the Zion Chronicles, Zion Covenant, and Shiloh Autumn are back with us. This new book captures all the action, drama, spiritual depth, and character development of the authors' earlier novels. A wonderfully written and powerfully moving story, Jerusalem's Heart is a good read for anyone interested in middle east politics, good fiction, or vintage Thoene writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but long","review":"I love the Thoenes, but I did not really like this series. While descriptive and interesting, the pace of the books are so slow (in time, not action--i.e, one book only takes place over only one or two days) that I did not make it all the way through the books. They are meant to be slow, but personally, I like to keep things moving. I would recommend Zion Covenant, Zion Chronicles, A.D. Chronicles, or, my favorites, the Galway Chronicles and the Shiloh Legacay over this series, especially if you are a first time reader of their usually wonderful work. (By the way, something I really like is that her series often overlap with characters. If you want to get to know all the characters, the order kind of goes like this: Zion Covenant and the Shiloh Legacy, then the Zion Chronicles, and then this series.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong ISBN","review":"This is a discouraging product to deal with.

I bought top-of-the-line at a cost which should have provided me equipment that would work. First the little spring that holds the stylus in place gave out. HP/Compaq did cover this by stretching the warranty, so the only cost to me was the hassle and a couple of replacement styluses at $5 a pop. Then the battery died, after I'd had the unit for about 18 months. What was really distressing was the refusal on the part of the service \\"support\\" people to recognize this as any sort of problem -- they were so busy trying to think of creative explanations involving things I might have done wrong that nobody would acknowledge that if customers who buy an Ipaq have to budget $50.00 a year for battery replacement that represents a quality control issue at the old Ipaq factory.

The deciding factors for me where the stunning screen on the 3975, the 48Mb of flashrom which allows instant backup of your contacts and calendar, the built in Bluetooth capability, and a plethora of available accessories. The downsides are the built in non-changeable battery, the relatively high price, and only a SD memory slot (no built in CF slot). All in all, the 3975 was the winner, having more pluses and less minuses than the competition.

This book was written to sound more like a general discussion, rather than a well thought out, soul searching commentary, which was surprising considering the 'suffering' the author is said to have endured. Where is the questioning? Where is the pain? Where is the substance that those who have suffered and endured for so long are searching for? Having said that, there is some merit to the book, in that it gives a general commentary on Job - nothing you couldn't find in a meatier book though. I'd recommend books like: 'God and Human Suffering' (Hall); 'Where is God when it hurts' (Yancey); and 'Prayer' (Yancey) as an alternative to exploring pain and suffering in general.

British five-piece Gomez have always had their share of jam-rock influences, but have managed to tread a cautious line between the infectiousness of \`90s Brit-pop and the extended solos of a Bonnaroo Festival, without giving into either side's dangerous excesses. Out West is no exception, finding the band alternating between effectively concise songwriting and long-winded instrumental passages, often in the same song. The twenty tracks here are mostly comprised of Gomez originals, plucked from their four previous albums, with a couple Tom Waits (\\"Going Out West\\") and Nick Drake (\\"Black Eyed Dog\\") songs thrown in for good measure.- Landon MobladSynthesis.net"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Gomez fans and faithful","review":"This album disappoints. The album is poorly mastered and the songs do not do justice either to Gomez's sound in concert or to that on their albums.

The Heroine, Princess Iona, didn't have the fears of a normal woman of that time, because she trained as a warrior, a leader of her people and a healer. She had gone through a horrible experience as a child, and thought she would never marry because of it.The Sinclair was the Laird of his people, he too had gone through adversity as a child, and had overcome, and reclaimed his people and land. He thought when he married, it would be a \\"marriage of convenience\\" politically. So when he met Iona, and her pride and courage was something he thought only men had, he defiantly was intrigued. And the more he was with her, the more he wanted her for his very own.But both still had enemies, and both had to learn to trust the other.A very good example of Medieval/Viking story, with believable people, motives and actions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did the Job","review":"Replaced front Door weather strip and did the job in 15 min will order again in a year or 2"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pegagogical Nightmare","review":"I am so glad that, when I took my first Greek course 40 years ago, my teacher had better methods than this textbook.

WIthout this background, or without a great instructor, you will be lost, because Chase & Philips most often introduces a knew form, gives one or two paradigms for it, and nothing else.

I ordered this product, plugged it in near the bookcase, and hoped for the best. After about a week, our cat sprayed the diffuser. So the product obviously hasn't \\"calmed\\" her. Also the product isn't odorless as stated. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works","review":"This product really worked. I had my cat fixed, moved into a new home, new furniture and all in the same day. Not to mention added a dog to the mix and he HATES dogs. I pluged the comfort zone in about 3 hrs before I brought him home and he's been even happier and better behaved than he was before. We even had a baby shower a few weeks after with lots of strangers, which he doesn't like, and although he did hide from ppl he didn't scratch or pee on anything like he had done in the past after just one person came over. I intend to never not have one of these things plugged in. It was a god send for my kitty. He's just so happy and in love with everything. Its like the world is in catnip to him. He's much better behaved and even plays with the dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"This had no effect on my cats. I recently got a kitten and the adult male Bengal that I have is VERY displeased with the new addition to the family. I tried placing the unit near the food dish since that is usually where they are when they run into each other. I tried moving it to different places in the house and there was no noticable difference in his behavior. Granted, the little cat is either really brave or really stupid because he does nothing but torture the bengal but overall, I saw not change in behavior from this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us","review":"The Feliway electric diffuser did not work for us.

It did not work for mine, however. They both became super aggressive with each other and other cats in and outside the house. It made them restless, coming in and out of the house all day. One of them started crying incessantly at night and the other still peed on things. They went back to normal (well, as normal as they get) when I unplugged the diffuser and opened all the windows. I think it's worth the price to try this product, but don't be surprised if it doesn't work or makes things worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for my cat","review":"My cat has hyperthyroidism and he was under additional stress as my parents had left on a vacation. He was yowling at all hours and generally unsettled. I bought this hoping that it would calm him down and maybe he'd stop yowling at all hours of the night. Unfortunately for him and me it didn't work. No noticeable change in his level of discomfort. What eventually worked was my parents coming home and even then it took a couple weeks for him to get fully readjusted.It may work fine in other conditions or other cats, but just a warning that it doesn't always work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feliway works!","review":"Highly recommend!My younger male cat was stressing out my older female cat.

This doesn't work at all for my cat. He's got an anxiety disorder and the Feliway brand diffuser really changed him back into the lovely non-destructive kitty he was before I moved to a new apartment, whereas the Comfort Zone brand only marginally improves his behavior and he's back to howling in the middle of the night.Comfort Zone is manufactured by Farnam, Inc. and includes Feliway (an artificial hormone patented by CEVA) among its ingredients. CEVA makes its own line of diffusers that are just called \\"Feliway\\" and are also available on Amazon. Maybe I'm crazy (or my cat is!) but I find CEVA's Feliway brand to be much more effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like magic...","review":"After living many years with feuding cats in too-small-for-cat-territory-comfort spaces, I can say that this product is the closest thing to science being magic that I've ever seen.

My big male cat still chases the other cats, and my skittish cat still goes outside the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for my cat","review":"Although this product did drastically reduce the amount of fighting between cats in the house, it did nothing to deter the one cat who likes to mark. In fact, we noticed her starting to mark places she'd never marked before, so we unplugged both diffusers about three weeks after plugging them in. If fighting is the only issue between cats in your house, I'd say this product works pretty well.

I have three cats, one with a mild aggression problem and one that likes to chew. This product made no difference in their behavior. I placed it in an area that they traffic a lot, and the room is not super-big, so I'm sure the \\"smell\\" would have reached them. One of the cats (the aggressive one) did seem to react when he got close to the diffuser by wrinkling his nose up, but that was it.I would definitely not buy this again, especially for the outrageous price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for me . . . I think","review":"I'm not sure if things would have gone well without them, but I installed two of these when I brought a third cat (1 year old) into my home to introduce to my two existing cats (both 5 years old). There was a little tension, but nothing as bad as it might have been; they were sleeping on the same bed by the end of the week (completely isolated for the first three days). I kept Feliway canisters in all month in two areas of my condo. The only thing I don't like is that when the little canisters get empty-ish, they tip a little and sort of fall out of the outlet, but it's not a big issue. I'm glad I bought them! I guess I should buy more just in case they are the reason for the successful integration:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well although rather expensive","review":"We have used these diffusers for quite a while as we are a multiple-cat household. No method is ever going to completely reduce the friction between such territorial animals, but one of our cats in particular seems to be calmer and less fractious since we've been using Comfort Zone. My only complaint is that the refills are so expensive and that the diffusers have to be replaced every couple of years."},{"rating":"2","title":"We were desperate!","review":"Our cat, Twiggy, who is 7 years old became anxious, unhappy and generally unpleasant.

Thanks..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try the spray, instead","review":"The diffuser only lasted about a week and I saw no change in the cat's behavior. I went to Pet Smart and bought the spray in a bottle. Within 48 hours of use, the cat in question was as calm and friendly as, well, a pussycat. He's normally quite aggressive and spends a lot of time in seclusion. With the spray, however, he became sweet and docile and very tolerant of the other cats. I spray it on his bedding and scratching post. He rubs his face on it and rolls around like it's catnip. Whatever is in it, it works for my cat and has made life a lot calmer in my house. The concentration of active ingredients is much higher in the spray than in the diffuser so it makes sense that it works better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive product with no clear benefits...","review":"After reading a bunch of reviews I ordered this for my two housecats to ease the transition into a new home. I have had the Feliway diffuser plugged in for the last month and have not seen any change in the behavior or disposition in my cats. Vertical scratching and irrationally fearful behavior when new visitors arrive still persist. It has definitely not helped \\"comfort\\" the cats in the ways advertised. Of course I don't expect miracles but I expected to see some change. Now that 30 days have gone by I am reluctant to spend another $20 to refill the diffuser. Maybe a Glade plugin will work just as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. Doesn't work.","review":"I wish it did.

I worked slowly introducing them but the older kitty was not happy. He had just lost his 14 year old buddy and I'm sure he was a bit lost... adding a new kitten was hard on him. This item was recommended so I bought it. It's been plugged in for a few months now and yes they are doing much better. Did this product do the trick or did they work it out on their own? I can not be sure but I was willing to try anything. Add to that the surgery of spaying the kitten and her being down for a few weeks and the Diffuser still plugged in and things are going better. I don't think it's a overnight success product. Working much like a plug in air freshner ...I found no visible odor from the product. Worth a Try.........."},{"rating":"1","title":"No visible results for agression","review":"Brought an 8 month old female in to live with a 12 year old female and, not surprisingly, the older cat had some serious territorial issues. Although she never really tried to hurt the smaller one, who is herself rather assertive, she hissed and growled and sulked. I bought three diffusers placing them in all the cats' haunts (near food, sleeping places, etc.)and also tried some of the spray. After three weeks there was no real difference. I then tried Bach's Flower Essence Rescue Remedy. Now, after eight weeks of cohabitation, the older one is no longer sulking and is hissing less. Feliway and/or Bach's may have contributed but it is impossible to tell, more likely the imporvement has come from time. Perhaps in such a case patience would have been the best--and cheapest-- recourse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire hazzard","review":"This seemed fine for nearly two weeks of use. Ran quite warm but not hot. Then today, thankfully someone was home to notice the burning smell before it was too late. It emitted a distinct odor of burning electrical components. It was plugged in to a fully functioning outlet and was not \\"sagging\\" in the outlet. I believe this event could have developed into an electrical fire if not no one was home to notice the stench and unplug it in time. These are dangerous. Whether or not the pheromone is effective is a mute point here as the delivery system is hazardous. If you dare to use one of these be vigilant. I requested a return authorization based on the defective nature of the product and received a pre-paid return shipping label with no hassle so I give credit to the seller for that good customer service. Purchased from Monster Pets (Fulfilled by Amazon).

I have previously had her on Prozac which alleviates that obsession and keeps her urinary tract healthy, but I was hoping to be able use this product instead. I began using the Feliway right as I started weening her off the Prozac. I put 2 diffusers in our house to make sure I covered the areas she spends all her time. I tried it for a month and during that same time I also gave her 'Vetri-Science Composure Feline' supplements. Unfortunately, no luck. The obsession and stress returned. (Incidentally, she continued her bad habit of scratching the couch as well.) She's back on Prozac now and I'll just have to learn to be OK with that.There are other reviewers that have had great luck with the Comfort Zone Feliay diffuser, so I think this is a product worth giving a try. It does work for some cats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me, unfortunately","review":"I got this with the hope of stopping the inappropriate elimination by one cat (of 3), but the problem still occurred after two days. I had tried almost everything else (and nothing medical was found, either) so I opted for this. Perhaps the air circulation was too strong or the room too big (a standard living room) but I won't need to get any more refills.If you have one of those Plug-In things you don't need to buy the diffuser.

I have one cat who is afraid of the other two and has been too nervous to interact with them for weeks. My cat stays in the bedroom and hides when the other cats enter the room. Occasionally one of the cats, who is particularly aggressive, attacks my cat. When that happens, my cat sprays. I thought that the cats would get used to each other and things would calm down. When they didn't, I did some online research and decided to try Feliway after reading that a veterinarian was recommending it for just this type of problem. Well, the diffuser has been plugged in for three weeks and there have been no noticeable changes. I don't recommend this product.

Not necessarily a miracle but she now willingly leaves the safety of under the bed to eat. I have now taken to only leaving out food while I am around to encourage her to be in my presence so obviously some behavioral intervention needs to take place as well in cases like this but I can't imagine she would have come out on her own so quickly"},{"rating":"2","title":"Miracle change in one of the cats","review":"This product worked amazingly well on one of three cats.

After two days of this product he was starting to come up to us, meow, and now loves being petted. The product seemed to have zero effect on the other two cats. However, it is absolutely worth it for the change to the one cat.

It is kind of like the air fresheners which plug in, except humans can't smell it. Based on the cat's favorite spot now being right beneath it, where she sleeps contentedly, I would guess that it works quite well.Of course, we picked a nice spot for it, in a corner with a soft thing to sleep on, but her wanting to be there all the time suggests there is more going on than that. I guess maybe there is more to this pheromone thing than I thought, and I should stop snickering at those ads in the back of Popular Science magazine for pheromones to attract women! ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Xanny for Kitties","review":"I recently rescued a 2y.o. cat who was pretty rough on the edges.

I was closed to giving him away or taking him back to the shelter when my JRT mix started acting terrified around him. I know the poor dog got swatted twice. This dog loves cats. I guess she got hurt while I wasn't around. After 2 days of getting this diffuser I have seen the cat calm down, stopped hanging out and sleeping on my nice chair, he started sleeping in my room & never seen him swatted me or my dog as his game.

So I got this hoping it would help, since the box said it was for marking, and a few people said it quieted their noisy cats. Seemed like it was working the first two days, but then it started again.

I have an indoor cat that occasionally sprays urine on the enclosed porch of my house. The Feliway diffuser deters this tremendously. You should talk to your vet if you are having the same problem so you can find out why your cat is doing this (it may be a medical issue) and get some tips for resolving the issues. You will be lucky if this diffuser alone with no behavioral management stops your cat from spraying in the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just made the cat gag...no help here!","review":"Read the reviews and took a chance on the product.

Cat came into the room almost immediately, put his nose in the air as he was catching the scent, then started gagging and ran from the room. Unplugged the unit and tried again another day...worse reaction the 2nd time. Done, unplugged it and threw it away.

She withdrew to a tiny space in our living room and only came out at night. Couldn't be held or petted. With a lot of work we were able to get her out in \\"public\\" but and eventually would allow me (only) to touch her. This phase took a year. Smudge also began scratching our wool carpet repeatedly in one spot. We put the Feliway diffuser in an outlet near her hiding space a month ago. She's now out in public almost all the time, let's me and my family pet her, and in the past few days my daughter and I have even been able to pick her up!

They tolerate each other, but get into spats daily and I was so hoping that this would calm them down a bit. I didn't expect them to cuddle up together, but hoped at least for SOME result. I purchased two of these diffusers - one for my bedroom, where they sleep all night and one for the living room, where they sleep all day. But I didn't see any difference at all, unfortunately. I guess it was worth a shot, but it just didn't work on my cats. :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Tried it out, Looks like it works","review":"We have one cat and then introduced a younger cat and the new kitty soon became the dominant one. They get along for the most part but we started noticing that our original cat became less sociable, hides, does not sit on our laps or cuddle with us anymore and seems tense or anxious. We bought one comfort zone plug in just to see if it has any affect before buying more and he's gotten better! Not completely since we only bought one plug for our big house. He doesn't hide as much, has become more sociable, sits on our laps more frequently. He's still anxious and still avoids us here and there. From the changes we've seen so far, it works. We just need to by more plug ins to put around the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only product that has worked for us","review":"Moved to our current home 2 years ago. Our then 10 year old turkish angora cat was extremely upset by the move and started using the hallway carpet both upstairs and down instead of her catbox. She would no longer go outside and hid for the first few months. After much research my husband found this product on the internet. Since both my husband and I are now retired, she is used to our being home most of the time. When we go on vacation, in spite of hiring a cat sitter who spends alot of time with her, we need to make sure the diffuser has not and will not run dry while we are gone. As long as we continue to use this product, the marking has stopped. When it runs dry, she doesn't mark unless she sees another cat outside or her routine changes. Getting the smell out of the carpet has been challenging, even using the enzymatic cleaners, so we try to make sure the Feliway is always plugged in both upstairs and down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not effective at all","review":"I tried everything to stop a newly adopted 2 year old cat from peeing on the floor.

My vet had assured me that medically, kitty was fine, that the behavior was probably due to stress or depression. Unfortunately, my sweet but stubborn Angora simply would not take the anti-anxiety meds the vet prescribed. So Comfort Zone was my last chance.Three weeks have passed since I pligged the units in; kitty has totally stopped his inappropriate peeing, a behavior I'd previously seen him exhibit on a near-daily basis! And, as an added bonus, he and my female cat have stopped getting in sparring matches (the female never has cared for other animals).

The vet has recommended Buspar pills and/or tranqs. Was hoping to avoid that, but either we try a pill- it works -- or we haev to sadly return him to shelter.

The \\"new\\" older cat and my younger alpha cat, have been having a pissing match, literally, since almost the first day. All three are females, fixed, and healthy. None of the above products has made any difference, and I feel they are a waste of money. I have also tried every trick/suggestion found on the internet.

Maybe it works better once animals are fixed and don't have any pheromones at play determining social structure and all of that. My kittens had to be kept completely separate for the first two months, and I was praying this would not cure the problem, but at the very least ease the tension a bit. I had it plugged in right by the cat tree, and I saw no effect either way in those two months. I finally removed it once it was dried up, and the kittens have come to terms with eachother on their own. Maybe there's a psychosomatic effect when the owners think that this little white dome in the wall is going to cure all ills, or perhaps, as I said, it could not compete with my female kitten's pre-spay hormones.

We believe the problem was triggered by the December death of the male who ruled our house... now the 8-year-old is the male in charge, and he was marking his new territory.The spraying didn't stop until we put him on prescription meds -- he's on Prozac, compounded into a topical cream at a local pharmacy and rubbed into one ear each night.

(She has no behavioral issues)I was talking to my mom about the product and come to find out that they had tried it with my Grandma's new cat (at the time) a couple of years ago. Apparently Grandma's cat was rather high strung and always chasing people down the halls. So, my mom got this same product to see if it would calm Sissy down and she said it didn't work for her either.All in all, it sounds like this product works really well for some people which is great.

My veterinarian suggested a Feliway diffuser. I tried it for the full 4 weeks, as recommended on the package, and it had no effect whatsoever. Moreover, each bottle of liquid only lasted 2 weeks, not 4 weeks as stated on the package, meaning I had to buy a refill just to complete the recommended 4 weeks.

We've been keeping her out of our bedroom when we aren't in there lately. In any case, I started using Comfort Zone about a week ago and I have to say that so far, I have seen ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGE IN HER BEHAVIOR.

I bought this to help ease the aggression and it seemed to do absolutely nothing. At first I placed it in a small room with one cat who was an indoor/outdoor and now very stressed about his indoor existence and initial isolation, it did nothing to ease or calm him. Later once I integrated the cats I placed the plug in the small living room next to a highly trafficked bottlenecked area where all cats had to pass to get to food and litter.... again I noticed no significant improvement on cat behavior.

In fact, the objects nearest the plug-in diffusers are now getting sprayed the most. This includes my Christmas tree and my poor living room sofa, which I'm going to have to get rid of.

The one who is not the aggressor seems so anxious as a result (extremely skittish and hesitant whereas she wasn't prior to getting the other) that she does not use her litterbox.I got the second cat about 2 years ago, so maybe it's too late for them, but bottom line is it didn't work for me so I can't give it a high mark. They MIGHT be fighting a little less frequently than before, and with less intensity (they're easier to separate: clapping my hands from across the room sometimes works as opposed to before I had to go over to them and stomp my foot nearby) but it's still almost a daily problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I read so many reviews on this product that were positive, I was excited thinking something like this could help our \\"house of feline unrest\\" but what a complete waste of money. It has done nothing to calm the blind cat we have, nor the very timid cat. The most agressive cat who is mostly the whole problem, is not 1% different and all 4 cats get nothing but 200% love; affection and all their needs met in a calm and peaceful environment. Anyway, I'm glad I bought it here and not at the vet as it was twice the price and it would have been just that much more disappointing. I've even tried moving it from one room to another (the main room)in hopes that was the issue. Sorry to have purchased but had it worked, would have happily paid for the refills monthly."},{"rating":"1","title":"No changes","review":"I expected to see my cats behaving a little bit better or to see my scary cat a little more calm when he sees people but there were no changes at all.

I am not able to tell if it ever worked because within two weeks, the walls above the diffusers were stained with a sheen/oily appearance.

I used up the entire cartridge, and when it ran out I decided to wait a couple of weeks and observe for any changes before buying another cartridge. The cats continued to behave in the same manner they always did--before, during, and after this diffuser was used.

I didn't want our other cat to bother her because she was scared all the time. Anyway, it did not work. It did nothing.

I also have an older female who is very upset with her new little \\"sister\\".After the feliway was plugged in, the new cat became very aggressive with my older cat, which in turn put her in a higher state of stress. Plus, the new cat has not become any more relaxed near people. She will weave in and out of my legs at feeding time, but she has always done that.There has been a lot of drama around here since I added the plugin.

This is about the same frequency as before the product. The product composed mostly of ethanol. The other ingredients are \\"a mixture of fatty acids or derivatives thereof and a compound of vegetal origin\\". The vegetal orgin compound is Valerian. The company wants you to believe these ingredients simulate cat cheek secretions. Feliway also claims that cheek smell on an object will prevent cats from peeing on that surface. Furthermore, Feliway claims the cheek smell will generally calm cats.There is no US government agency verifying this company's claims, certifying the ingredients, or even guaranteeing that synthesis of cat pheromones by fatty acids and Valerian is possible.

DON'T BELIEVE A WORD OF IT! The spraying has actually increased dramatically while using this product including five times just this morning while prior to using the product it was once maybe every three or four days.

The new cat is extremely energetic and playful.I bought Feliway Comfort Zone because a friend recommended it to me (so I know some people have success with it-hence two stars). Nothing has changed in my cats. At first I was hopeful because as soon as I plugged the thing in, the cats were sniffing it. Unfortunately, their behavior didn't change at all. My older cat is as stressed out as ever. At this point, I'm just crossing my fingers that they'll eventually get used to each other.I'm happy if this product worked for you, but for me it was a waste of 30 bucks.

Within a few days of plugging it in, I started to get the absolute worst allergy attacks of my life. I was completely miserable. I didn't attribute it to the Feliway at first, I thought that it might be an allergy to our new kitten or something. Finally after a week or so of being so miserable I could hardly stand it, I realized that the allergies started when I plugged the Feliway in, so I unplugged it and within 24 hours the allergies were gone. I immediate threw away the Feliway and I will never use one again. I also didn't really see any noticeable effect on our cats in the time that I used it.

He was depressed and hid in our closet for hours and no longer \\"talked\\" to us. He was one mad, sad cat. I thought we would have to return the little girl to the SPCA. I researched, found this product Farnam Comfort Zone Plug-In Diffuser 48 mill. and plugged it in. within 48 hours Carl was talking, rubbing against my legs and rejoined the family. A month later he is tolerating Carly and sleeping near her. I even caught them chasing each other (nicely)! The Plug-In went dry and I didn't notice and Carl pooed outside the box and was surly.

If you want no story, no likeable characters then I suppose this graphic novel is for you. This comic much like Dead West and Containment attempt to make a very action oriented ( poorly drawn ) and next to story type of zombie read. Those sort of stories work better on film but when you have to read it you want something more like Walking Dead ( which I loved ). They dont really explain why the odd looking man starts this whole scenario..... they go into some very minor character detail about the annoying blonde character but still not enough to explain why she is the way she is. The guy who I guess is suppose to be the main character isnt even very interesting and then the cheap attempt at a love interest thrown in at the end has no sustence either. They make no attempt to explain really how or why the zombies start evolving..... everything felt very very rushed and pointless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesomely drawn and fun","review":"I disagree with that other guy. I thought this comic was great. It's a fun zombie apocalypse story and the art is great. Its drawn almost like the anime movie \\"blood: the last vampire\\" with things in and out of focus.

It displays a vulnerable, human side to that particular character, brought about via a brief scene where the heroine recalls an incident from childhood involving both herself and the said villian. The character is strengthened by this and made less arch and less caricature as a result.

It also has a really good mixture of deep growl vocals and some of the best melodic singing I have heard from a band like this. The song The Remembrance Ballad is my personal favorite and has an awesome chorus. And for some reason that I can't really pinpoint this album keeps reminding me a lot of Pantera's \\"Cowboys From Hell\\" so maybe if you like that album than you will kind of have an idea of what this sounds like, only with a new age twist, and more of stuff like \\"Cemetery Gates.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good disc","review":"Its a really good up beat listen thru and thru.

The solos are cool and I really enjoy the overall guitar tone on this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different but still good.","review":"Atreyu seems to have lost most of the screaming and added more radio friendly singing and breakdowns. People who bought or listened to their last cd might be upset about these changes. It's still a great cd for those who have yet to hear from Atreyu or those who are willing to except that bands can vary their style. Amazingly, this cd was able achieve #32 on the billboard charts in it's first week. Whether that's a good or bad thing, I'll leave up to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then sn","review":"Well, at first, i remenber hating atreyu when i got to the chance to hear their second album sn"},{"rating":"1","title":"Abomination knew exactly what I was thinking","review":"First of all let me just say I was one of the guys who liked Atreyu before because I easily fell sucker to poor riffed, easy to listen metal. This meant when they released -The Curse- and radio hits like \\"Right Side of the Bed\\" and \\"The Crimson\\", I instantly fell for them. Now I've matured and grown over this slop like I did with Linkin Park and a heap of others.Read Abominations review, as he is a man of sheer brilliance! He only speaks the truth! Listen to worthy Metalcore like God Forbid, Trivium, Shadows Fall, Lamb of God, Darkest Hour, Killswitch Engage, Maroon (no not Maroon 5 you ignorant retards who actually purely enjoy this), Underoath, and Zao. There, I just took a minute of my time to give you GOOD stuff to listen to!

This CD isn't super terrible, but it's just too trendy and not really metalcore, at all. People buy this Cd and think that atreyu is so hardcore and heavy, its so stupid. If you're a 13-14 girl then you'll probably love this CD and think the dudes in atreyu are hot and sexy goths. Go ahead, follow the trend with Senses Fail, Killswitch Engage, and Avenged sevenfold. But if you want some non trendy true metalcore listen to: Zao, The Agony Scene, Glass Casket, Preminitions of War, etc. And if you're a true metalcore fan, you'll stick around longer than this fad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Victory Records and all the bands signed to them SUCK!","review":"Avoid at all costs. Atreyu's vocalist does not know how to do a proper metal scream. A song called \\"Right Side Of The Bed?\\" Are you kidding me? What a joke. Victory Records sign the worst bands on the planet, and will even tell them to change their sound. They rip-off the artists they do sign and don't give them much money. They are polluting and flooding the scene with loads of -core bands, far too many of them who have little to no real talent and the vocalists can't do proper screams and sound forced. Check out Chimaira, Diecast, God Forbid, Killswitch Engage and Shadows Fall if you want good metalcore."},{"rating":"1","title":"are you serious?","review":"this is absolutely terrible!... wish i could give it negatives!... not one good thing to say about it but that it gave me a good laugh when i heard it and to actually think that these guys are serious... the so-called \\"screamer\\" sounds like he's gargling water while brushing his teeth... the singing is just whiney and annoying and sounds like Good Charlotte... this is just another one of those \\"hardcore\\" bands that become really popular because they sound like hawthorne heights and britney spears... mainstream crap!... but, there is a good thing... i fortunately did NOT buy the cd and only heard it at a friends house..."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow","review":"this is seriously awful. i liked suicide notes enough to buy it, but i really only like lipgloss and black. and i only like that song because of the finger tapping intro. this is some of the worst wannabe hardcore crap out there today. if you want to listen to something that will annoy your parents, at least listen to something like cannae, nevea tears, or summers end. i could go on and on with some actual good albums, but ill let you figure it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute garbage","review":"i am a fan of hardcore. let me just say that first. this.....this is not hardcore, this is (...) matter. atreyu has got to be one of the most confused, cleched, un-original products of post-hot-topic generation that i have ever had the displeasure to lay my ears on. it manages to be gratingly whinny, and excessively growly at the same time-to the point that its just laughable. their lyrical content is hackneyed and forced and doesn't fit with the music-what the hell is with all of these neo-hardcore bands and the psudeo-goth thing? skip this and pull out you old gorilla biscuits records."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda shitty","review":"I was really disappointed with this CD.

Are they death metal? No, because the vocalist cant sing deep enough for that, perhaps when he gets through puberty he can get close. Are they Black metal? No, because he cant sing fast enough for that. Are they even metal? Well yes, I mean they do use a lot of guitar riffs from 80's metalica, but then again who doesn't these days.One minor thing worth mentioning about this group is that their name is the same as the brave little indian boy from the Never ending story. But musicaly this band is just another group of imitators that cant match the quality of anything they try to copy.They might have good lyrics, but we may never know because the singer cant seem to open his mouth wide enough to make any sounds beyond growls i could hear by monkeys at the zoo. And at least monkeys have some emotion to the sounds they make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music?","review":"Demonic.......violent.......warped. More music for the brain dead.

The singer on this album is amazing...I didn't know it was possible for a vocalist to sound like a sea lion on steroids and a crying preteen all on the same album! The guitars....goodness....they must be the gods of self mutilation because they ruined my life. this is an insanely horrible album and I truly do not understand why this band is popular. I read an interview in a magazine I bought (it had dillinger escape plan on the front) and read an interview with Atreyu. They were talking about how good they were....they are not good. they make me want re-eat my own entrails. Don't buy this album and if you do..I hope it makes a nice coaster for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trendy...","review":"The worse band besides slipknot,killswitch engage,bleedingthrought,korn,limp bizkit,mudvayne,selltallica, to me is, the guys from atreyu. I have a thirteen year old brother so he is into all that goth/nu-metal image, which i can't stand...So some times i have to listing to this trash that these little horny kids call\\"music\\" when it's mediocre at its worse. Upon listining to this cd? I finnaly knew what made kids commit suicide and every song here is the answer. Why bother with mediocre music when you can listing to music with talent? Atreyu's \\"the curse\\" has nothing to offer you, at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the f*ck... Is this ?","review":"Atreyu is horrible and any one that loves true metalcore can see that their posers. I mean, whats with the vampire thing? Stop ripping of cof and having emo like lirycs, do not make you a blackmetal band. Infact, what the hell do the guys from atreyu are trying to be? Lost little children. Trust me, atreyu's \\"the curse\\" is not worth nothing. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angst","review":"As if metalcore wasnt a chainsaw to your head enough, its absolutely ridiculous when metalcore bands mix emo with there already inoriginal sound. This band sounds like a even more flaccid Killswitch Engage, a Hawthorne Heights/Silverstein with downtuned guitars. As if it wasnt an abomination already, they even sing about vampires. Yes, thats right, vampires.And you couldnt get any g*yer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing wrong here","review":"Well for starters this record is way better then Suicide notes and Butterfly Kisses, I loved SNABK i thought there would be no way Atreyu would be able to pull off another record better then it. When i heard they were coming out wiht a new record i was eager to go out and get it, so i got this special edition with a bon jovi cover of \\"You give love and bad name\\" and for the record Its not that great of a version of it.Now the rest of the record the intro sets you up for a powerfull record then a powerfull scream comes on and the beginning of bleeding mascarea and that is the start of a incredble record, going from hardcore to emo in a single verse, its amazing.If you like bands like Killswitch enagge, From autumn to ashes, and possible Rancid this record is for you BUY it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is fake music.

A Deathgrip On Yesterday is horrible. This album deserves way more than 3 stars!! A deathgrip On yesterday got like 4-4.5 stars!! That makes this album like 70 stars!I really expected this album to get better reviews, but maybe its just not some people's taste..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atreyu - The Curse","review":"I belieive Atreyu did a good job on the record, but didnt work to their best ability. It almosts starts to feel like they just started getting lazy and wanted to just make more songs but not work at it. The guitars are good, but sometime the vocals just annoy you. But, overall, The Curse is by far the best Atreyu CD they have put out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked from the first listen","review":"This was really the first hardcore CD I ever listened to, as my friend tried introducing me into the world of bands like Atreyu, Underoath, Avenged Sevenfold, and more. After two listens through, I was hooked. This CD is amazing from start to finish with the screaming complementing the singing wonderfully, and the passion behind each song clear and moving. \\"Right Side of the Bed\\" is the standout track, and the best for first time listeners also. Overall, from the lyrics to the stunning guitar solos, this CD is incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"...What a horrid excuse for music","review":"I have a few friends who are big Atreyu fans so, I was told to download a song by them. When I first heard Bleeding Mascara I think I literally died laughing. The music is full of ridiculous screaming that sounds like someone is conspipated, the drumming is awful, and the guitar is just repetitive. I have no idea who decided to call this \\"hardcore\\". If you want real music go listen to Fear Before The March Of Flames, or Love Lost But Not Forgotten. But, if you like Good Charlotte or Simple Plan you'll LOVE this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My, how times have changed...","review":"Back in the 1980's punk bands like the Dead Kennedys and alternative/new wave bands like The Cure and the Violent Femmes ruled over 80's music, now we have to suffer through rap, emo and worst of all, metalcore. All metalcore bands have the same lyrics about death, pain and all that **** and Atreyu is no different. Generic music, generic lyrics, generic everything. Well, at least there are bands like A Perfect Circle to make music that kicks ass."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAHAH","review":"I didn't think it was possible for such a horrible band to sell out so bad!!!! Man, every emo fag in the world likes these guys. They are everywhere... and it's terrible! Singing, drummer, EVERYTHING is horrible. I don't understand how people can like them!

You people are so childish, if you don't like it, don't like it. I, in fact, love this cd. I am a big fan of screaming vocals and this album has a lot of them. I think the guitarwork is beautiful. Throw in all the other instruments and you have pure beauty. How is that 'sell-out' or whatever you want to call it?Get over yourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big difference in production from last release","review":"I think it was the sticker on the CD shrinkwrap that caught my attention, proclaiming the band as a successful mix of Pantera and the Cure, combined with Alkaline Trio and Killswitch Engage. I figured if they were good enough for Ozzfest they'd be at least a little more accessible for someone like me who hasn't listened to metal in like 6 years. I was pleasantly surprised, and this is currently my favorite album. I've never been heavy into emo or goth but I like what Atreyu does with it.After listening to this album though, it was hard to get into their prior release \\"Suicide Notes...\\" because I think they're simply a better band now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mehh... another wasted talent.","review":"Being a huge fan of \\"Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses,\\" I eagerly awaited this follow up and in the end I couldn't have been more disappointed. Atreyu showed a lot of potential on their first two records and their live shows were top notch. For this album the raw aggression captured on the early records was compromised in favor of watered down vocals, mediocre songwriting and a strong emphasis on a psudo-goth image. I have no problems with bands trying to break the mainstream and getting their music heard, but it's apparent what the intentions were we it came to \\"The Curse,\\" lay down a couple of singles to win the hearts of the pimply faced Headbangers Ball fashionXcore crowd and fill the rest of the album half assed works and cover them up with a little \\"studio magic.\\" Do yourself a favor and skip this one completely and go for Suicide Notes.., and while your at it pick up the new Unearth which is a much more promising listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible excuse for hardcore","review":"This is one of the worst bands in the history of music. This cd is just terrible. That and they are one of the worst live bands I have ever had to watch. Victory records needs to stop releasing albums. If you think this is \\"screamo\\" then you are an idiot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geez, I wonder why metalcore gets a bad reputation?","review":"Or maybe because mixing emo and metal is like mixing bleach and ammonia, not a good idea and you might get the bad luck of hurting yourself(don't mix bleach and ammonia). Musically nad lyrically, this music is very sub par, guitarring in my opinion is very weak, bands like Fall out boy, Avril Lavigne, Linkin Park, Simple Plan, Blink 182 and many others destroy this band in that department(sad aint it) The singer sounds like a 40 year old angry guy who was dumped and just to cry out to get her back he makes and annoying song about her. Maybe instead of picking up poor bands, pick some good metalcore from Mastodon, God Forbid, Shadows Fall, Lamb of God or Trivium. And also pick some Tool, Slayer, Sepultura, Obituary, Rammstein, White Zombie, Meshuggah, and Cryptopsy. Don't try to save this band by saying that their music is very deep and emotional, because emotional equals immaturity and a lack of self esteem."},{"rating":"1","title":"victory records SUCKS","review":"This is not music.

This song takes my attention away from the good tracks because it IS so INCREDIBLY AWFUL. It's sometimes hard to think a worse written and a worse produced song than \\"The Remembrance Ballad\\" in the history of rock.

I had seen Atreyu's name all over the place, but hadn't heard it, so I ordered a couple of copies of this album for the shop.When it arrived, I put it on and bought it an hour later. It was that catchy and that good.The intro builds into what I believe to be one of the strongest Metal riffs since At The Gates, and it's catchy as hell. The album continues in a similar vein and it just doesn't get tired with me.

So, you have to buy this album if you're a 14 year old who wears tight pants and horn rimmed glasses. The fact of the matter is, these emocore bands are not really emo. Real Emo (emotional hardcore) is Rites of Spring, Fugazi, Moss Icon, or Jawbreaker. Bands that are branded emo by Victory Records and MTV are just pop-punk with whinier vocals and depressed lyrics. If you like music marketed to the masses that has no real musical value, this is for you. If you want a challenging listen or innovative instrumentation, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's rather funny...","review":"...that normally I'm a pretentious Gothy type who listens mostly to goth-rock and progressive metal, and normally, I dislike modern punk stuff.

You have to hear it to believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Orange County sucks","review":"What's the difference between Bleeding Through, Eighteen Visions, Beauty to Ashes and Atreyu? They all perpetuate the worst fashion style of any music. They all wear eye liner, faux-hawks and gothy hairstyles.

I guess what makes me so mad about this band is the fact that all of their songs suck, they're labelmates with taking back sunday (a band which has talent) and they really don't have any unique or individual sound among them.

If you are interested in the larger global or at least European issues that led to the conflict and impacts of Nelson's victory, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"details","review":"the book for nelson's death. took pages to die. many collected letters from survivers. cold and detailed. covers the battle but left me almost bored. It is however the book to read of the sea battle. Did not like it but it does cover the battle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thorough and engaging history...","review":"Although I'm inclined to agree that the original British subtitle of this book (Biography of a Battle) is a more apt description than the hyperbolic and somewhat breathless American title, there is a germ of truth in the latter title as well that Adkins catches with this well-written examination of Trafalgar.Adkins covers the events leading up to and including the battle of Trafalgar, in which the smaller British naval force defeated a larger combined fleet of French and Spanish vessels, with great care. Attention is paid to every aspect of XVIIth Century naval warfare, interweaving things like the source of seamen; the quality and preparation of the food; the firing of the cannons; and so forth--all without interfering with the main events.It's well done and accessable to both the novice and the military historical junkie. A good read if you're interested in the topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-written study of a horrific sea battle","review":"This was a superb book, a biography of a famous battle, the story of the men (and women) who fought it and their ships. Adkins effectively weaves personal accounts of the battle with historical analysis as well as his own insights.Ordinarily I don't like to read books of military strategy but Nelson's Trafalgar is so much more than that. It's the telling detail that bring it to life, the individual accounts and the author's knowledge of life aboard a ship-of-the-line. This book should appeal to those landlubbers who aren't familiar with all the salty jargon sailors and geeks like to throw around, yet the author never condescends. If, like this American, you sometimes wonder what all the fuss over Trafalgar is all about, this book is for you.If I were to only ever read one nonfiction book about the Napoleanic wars at sea, this would be the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, heartwarming stories for any age :-)","review":"I purchased Second Chances last year for my 9 year old son so I knew this book would be just as good. If you want to read very short stories about stray dogs who found loving homes, this is the book. It will make you laugh, cry, and just feel good all over.Everyone should \\"adopt\\" a shelter or stray once in their life. There is is no better feeling...they seem to have a way of \\"finding you.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Book.","review":"This book is ok, but as a Rescue worker, I could write stories definitely more inspiring. Short, easy reader though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Found Dogs","review":"This is an incredible book. I have owned it for several years and each time you pick it up to revisit its pages it makes your feel wonderful all over again. If you aren't a dog lover, you will be after you read this book. It stays on my coffee table in the den and has been the topic of many interesting conversations with fellow dog lovers. I guess this book is so close to my heart because we are fortunate enough to have a \\"found dog\\". I am looking forward to Ms Lufkin doing a second book and perhaps including our \\"Found\\" dog in it. Buy the book - you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring out the kleenex - this book will steal your heart","review":"I can definitely relate to these stories - our own 'son' is a stray we adopted from The Animal Defense League. He was the only one our 'daughter' didn't lunge at, just growled at. She was used to being the boss and we had just put her sister to sleep recently. Three days after we adopted our son, the two were inseparable.Believe me, strays definitely show how grateful they are for the second chance they've been given. The stories in this book show that. Sometimes it seems the people are the ones who need saving. If someone ever wanted to know how much saving a dog (or any other animal stray) can make a difference, READ this book. The story in the introduction is just wonderful. You won't be sorry and this family gives it 2 paws up :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me proud to be owned by a found dog.","review":"This book has great photographs and essays to go with each. You can see the love for the dog in the owners eyes and the joy of being found in the eyes of the dogs.

This, in turn, fails, to do what the writer hoped to accomplish, which was to show the fantastic chemistry between people and dogs, and demonstrate that dogs are capable of thinking and emotions far more complicated than humans have believed thus far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Found Dogs hits the mark","review":"Whereas many tales of homeless pets end with less than stellar results, this book and its companion book, Second Chances: More tales of Found Dogs, concentrates on the happy endings of many pets who found loving homes.

They're rather fun to assemble and pose,and while this kit seems like it would be good, the plastic in my particular kit was extremely shoddy. A number of ball joints were larger than the sockets, and the plastic was incredibly stiff, which ultimately led to the pirate figure being physically impossible to assemble. A number of the pieces broke during assembly. I am unsure if it was my individual kit or if there was a problem with this particular line, but either way it was incredibly frustrating.Just the same, should the pieces prove durable, this kit has a variety of options for assembly, and the toy line overall is great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trampoline Safety Pad","review":"Was told by salespeople at various stores that it would be more cost effective to buy a new trampoline.

If you like a great live CD packed with energy, this will do the trick.

They really run the gamut on this by doing material from the older days and a lot of newer stuff too! It's also a double-cd so there's plenty of room for the greatest prog-rock band of all time to cut loose.

I took one listen and wished I hadn't bought it. The music is almost the same but the voice isn't. I play two for the show quite a lot as this is what Kansas is to me. Live at the Whiskey was painful to hear with Lonely Street the only redeeming factor that was added on. Now if Kansas had added 70's footage to Device Voice Drum then I would have given this review more than one star(or if Steve sang just one song such as Lonely Street like long ago)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD sounds great","review":"This new CD is a must have addition for a Kansas fan.

But it does hint that Walsh'svocal prowess is diminishing.There's no hint aboutit here. He throws his weak, geeky tenor aroundhere like a fry cook slinging hash when he wouldhave done everyone a great favor by playing it cooland making sure the notes and melodies were strongand sharp. Further, he's not much of a keyboardplayer, and I think the band needs to get back tofull strength with a Livgren type multi instrumentalist.This live disc is a fiasco. I can't believe they putthis gruesome thing out. If you love \\"Two For The Show\\"you'll be feel [cheated] by this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOISE! JUST NOISE! ONE GOOD SONG ONLY.","review":"I first heard Taste of Ink on the radio and said Wow. Who's that?

For noise I would prefer Rob Zombie, Disturbed, Soundgarden, or anything but The Used. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I The Only One Who Thinks This Cd isn't any good?","review":"Alright, well it isn't ALL that bad. There are a couple songs that are really good like \\"Poetic Tragedy\\" and \\"Taste Of INk\\", but the others really didn't meet up to my expectations.

It had many meaningful songs some louder than others which is good to have a band out there that is so vercitile. I have recently been to there concert and it was awsome. I could tell that the band had worked hard to get to where they are now. So I am personally just writing this to say that The Used are a good investment for someone looking for a good semi-hardcoar punk cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing album","review":"This album is amazing from the first track to the end it rocks. I'm an old schooler I grew up listening to The Replacements, U2, REM, The Clash. So I very rarely like the new stuff out today it all sounds the same. But I picked up this cd after hearing them on MTV2 late one night. I'm glad I did to say Burt McCracken sings with emotion is an understatement. The song writing is outstanding he wears his heart on his sleave this album. My favorite tracks are \\"Box Full of Sharp Objects which is my fave on whole cd, \\"Maybe Memories \\"Buried Myself Alive, \\"Bulimic. Very well produced album but still has a gritty sound to it. More intense band than the stuff out today with intelligent lyrics that still rock hard. Great live in concert too. One of the best if not best newer band out today.

I cannot stop listening to this cd. It has excellent vocals, this guy can do it all, amazing guitar melodies including my favorite acoutic track \\"On My Own,\\" and kickin drum beats. Its perfect for whatever mood you are in. The songs range from \\"I Love You,\\" to I want to beat your face in!\\" to \\"I'm so lonely\\" to \\"Go to hell\\"! BUY IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LaLa","review":"I like the Used a lot and I enjoy this CD to the fullest. Maybe the fact that they sound an awful lot like glassjaw and other bands makes some of you angry or whatever but I think the Used deserves all the credit they're getting for this album because its a damn good one. I saw them live last October and they were super and put on a great show, infact I thought they were better than the band I had went to see, which is why I bought their CD. I love this CD and I think most people will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used and Abused","review":"I saw the Used live in Utah just after they had signed their record deal and I have to state for the record that I was not impressed. Maybe these guys appeal to someone, but I am not that person. I think of myself as a pretty open minded individual when it comes to music (I listen to a WIDE spectrum of stuff, from KORN to country), but these guys are painful to listen to. I think that someone needs to give the lead singer a hug and some throat lozenges. Heaven knows he's going to need them after screaming like he does. The only thing I can find to appreciate about them is that they know how to play their instruments well enough to be recognized by a record company. Beyond that, I have no \\"use\\" for them. To all of you who enjoy the record, more power to you. Maybe they sound better on disc than they do live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow you kids are stupid...","review":"okay:1) Bert McCraken. What a name. The poor guy. He vomits on stage. That's soooooooooo cool.2) Mr. McCraken used to date Kelly Osbourne, until she was stolen away by Chad Gilbert of New Found Glory. He couldn't even keep the ugliest/stupidest girl in TV Land from running off to a pop-punk goofball.3) Guess what, \\"emo\\" kids... The Used don't write their own music. They are just as prefabricated as a boyband.4) The band Glassjaw did this about 3 years ago, and did it about 1000 times better.5) The Used are NOT a hardcore band. They are a phase that lots of 14 year old kids will go through before they are ready to handle music with any real substance. When you decide you are ready, go pick up a Planes Mistaken for Stars or Breaking Pangaea record.6) If the Used are a part of Rock's \\"comeback,\\" I hope Rock crawls back into the hole that it was supposedly hiding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why people think that they're badasses when they listen to My Chemical Romance and The Used. Guess what morons, the entire youth of the country is listening to your music, and you're not rebelling against anything in particular, except maybe yourself. Let's face it, the message behind this music is that cutting yourself and writing songs about the same thing over and over again will get you famous. All you need to be able to do is scream. F*ck singing, that doesn't matter. Screamin is badass. That'll get me my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"generic music has never sounded so good","review":"People who listen to music for superficial reasons will adore this crap.

I saw them live when they were on tour with Taking Back Sunday and blink-182. All they did was tell everyone to stick their middle fingers in the air and say \\"f***you\\" to the people on stage that they got to come up. The lead singer looks like someone out of a heavy metal band. He has a high pitch whiny voice that gets old and annoying quickly. The only thing that makes me puke more than this album is when the lead singer makes himself puke when he screams. Don't buy this CD. Buy Brand New, From First to Last, Matchbook Romance, etc. But don't waste your money on this lame excuse for a CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im shocked.","review":"To the braindead reviewer who said \\"one of the best rock albums of the year easily\\" too bad The used are pop.

I don't understand why the people that give it a bad rating think there is someomthing wrong with anyone who doesn't share their musical tastes. I wouldn't have even looked at this CD if it wasn't for the fact that the majority of hard rock music out right now is terrible and therefore has kept me searching. I don't get why someone else is a \\"retard\\" for liking any type of music. Is someone who likes hamburgers a \\"retard\\" to someone who doesn't? no. its all about personal preference. its what the people who are complaining about fabricated bands are complaining about - they want people to be \\"different\\" even though different means having the same opinion as them. anyways, great cd. box full of sharp objects is one of my favorites. I dont give it 5 because no album is absolutely perfect on every song."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is Some Powerfull Stuff","review":"Wow. This CD is so loud and powerfull. The vocals alone blow you away. I heard the used live and i thought they wouldnt be as power full as they were on the CD but they were and they kicked ass. If you ever get a chance to see them live do it. Songs like the Taste Of Ink and Poetic tragedy are really basic but the vocals add so much to the songs. good tracks are \\"taste of ink\\", \\"poetic tragedy\\", \\"burried myself alive\\", and \\"box full of sharp objects\\". There is also a secret track on this CD. After the last song you have to wait about 5 minutes and then you will here the band talking and about a minute later the song starts. But if you like bands like Taking Back Sunday you will like this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could get Used to this!!!","review":"The Used is by far one of the best bands I have ever heard. They are so good instramentally and Bert is a very good vocalist.. Plus they have a different sound to them that many bands don't have... They have some of the best chorus' i have a ever heard... The Used was a great debut album for them... Watch out!!! The Used will Blow up into something huge.. Everybody will love them... If you don't like their music, you don't have a heart... seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly awesome","review":"I wasn't overly excited to listen to this CD, but my friend told me about them and borrowed me the CD. I think this is how The Used survives, they aren't a big band yet they sell out concerts because of word of mouth. When a band is this good, they don't even need to promote like other bands...the fans tell 10 people, who tell 10 people, who tell 10 people.It's an awesome CD, worth a listen definately."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Used...such a good band.","review":"When I first bought this CD, I wasn't really open minded.

I kinda feel dumb for putting it away for so long. I'm a new fan of these guys.

Okay, if you've seen my other reviews, they're normally not good, check out Avril's CD, and the Used by far are the best band I've rated, because I havent rated any of my favortites. But nonetheless, the USed are semi okay.

I am myself a wide listener of music and appreciate all kinds of music. However, there were only two things going good for this band on this cd: the song \\"taste of ink\\" and the lyrics. When I say lyrics, I mean the lyrics for most of the songs, not just \\"taste of ink.\\" Anyway, The Used's lead singer is not even close to being anything good, and at times gets on my nerves. He needs to tone it down some. Some of the songs were decent, but nothing compares to \\"Taste of Ink.\\" That song just made the cd. Buy the singley if they have it out and bypass this cd. It'll save ya 5 or 6 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emo rules....forever","review":"The used are great, there very melodic and...heavy yay!

They are a pop-culture novelty, from the same vein as Good Charlotte. This is the record industry taking trying to capitalize on a mostly underground musical movement of hardcore/emo and spoon-feeding it to you through these tools. The music is cheesy, at best, and, while I'd rather listen to this than Good Charlotte or New Found Glory, that doesn't mean that The Used have any more integrity as a band. If you want to hear music of this genre made by real bands who don't care about getting face time in magazines or on TV, go elsewhere.

I bought this cd because i heard from friends it was good band.The lyrics/music flow together really nicely, I cannot say which songs I like most because I listen to the whole cd. I fully recommend this cd, especially if you like Finch and Its more hard rock than NOFX, so if your looking for a softer more settle band then this isnt for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOW CAN YOU NOT LIKE THIS!!!","review":"This cd is amazing.After hearing \\"box of sharp objects\\" which is a great song I had to hear what other songs they had,and let me tell you I have to say that it is probably the best cd I have ever heard.Berts (lead singer) voice is so unusual he makes the songs sound so incredibly good!!!Out of all the 12 songs the best songs are \\"the taste of ink\\",\\"noises and kisses\\",and \\"bulimic\\".Simply because they have such good beats,and not to mension great lyrics.Lets make this short and sweet if you don't already get this cd!!!I mean it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Charlotte?","review":"Uhhhh...Why is Good Charlotte listed under similar band? Im not seeing it...ANYWAYS...This band is incredible, and definently the best screamo band that Ive ever heard. Berts vocals are incredible;his screams are glass shattering and he can sing suprisingly high. The top songs I think are the orchestrated ones(\\"Buried Myself Alive\\", \\"Greener with the Scenery\\", and \\"On My Own\\"),but there is honestly no weak tracks on this album.Other good screamo bands: Glass Jaw, Thursday, Finch, Taking Back Sunday, Coheed and Cambria and My Chemical Romance"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Whoever the 5th review down from me is, well, he doesn't know what he's talking about. Selling out is when people change there music just to suit other people, and The Used only has one CD, and they obviously have not done that since they only have one CD out. I rate this CD a 4 because during some songs they could lighten up on the screaming, but the rest makes up a very good album and is well put together. You can definetaly expect good things in upcoming albums from this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"well","review":"I first heard of the Used At work.. the first song I heard was \\"The Taste Of Ink\\" and ya know what?

I also recommend the \\"Maybe Memories\\" CD/DVD, it has a documentry on the band, showing you what they went through to get where they are now, as well as some live footage and all there music videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Used","review":"I first heard of the used from a guitar magazine and decided to check out their new catagory of music, now being dubbed, SCREAMO. I bought their cd and after listening to it i was dissapointed, but like several cds, the more i listen the more i liked it 'til I was hooked on the used, they dont have alot of tuned down guitars (which can be good) but they do have some of the catchiest riffs and amazing screaming vocals. If you are a metal fan or a punk fan check out the used and some of the other up and coming screamo bands like Glassjaw and Thursday."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"i really like all the music on here . but its just the singer's voice that gets on my nervesi love taste of ink and a few others but i cant remember 'em considering i took this cd to the pawn shop a while back...taste of ink is so catchy i listen to it over and over again. i give that song a 5. i would have given this cd a 4 or something but the guys voice bugs me THAT MUCH"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Used, maybe.. their music has been USED before. Ehuh!","review":"So, Bert vomits on stage and while listening to this album I vomit a little inside my mouth. And that my friends is about all I have in common with this album. But, here's the review!I'm giving it a strong two stars for the two songs they got right. Which are Maybe Memories and Box of Sharp Objects. Otherwise this album is one terrible song fallowed by another.Here's one for you, Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Silence... GlassJAw was here five years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"enhanced? alright!!","review":"if you love the used and found yourself thinking, i just love this new used album and i just wish there even more to it, then not only are you probably a total retard but you will also be super stoked about this enhanced cd!it's just like the same horrible, totally pathetic wannabe punk used album you've come to love, but now with special features!yeah, special features!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It HURTS!!","review":"Oh man, where to begin??? I was so disgusted by this album I couldn't get past track 5!!! I love punk music & whatnot, but this album stunk so bad. They sound like Stabbing Westward wannabes with no direction at all.. who scream more than they actually harmonize. I'm not fond of someone who can't carry a tune screaming instead, because in that case he's like nasty, can't understand when to give it up,.... If you like punk/alternative/rock/heavy metal you're like millions of the rest of us, but The Used isn't one I'd ever recommend (unlike you enjoy having your eardrums blasted by amateurish screaming & guitar playing)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't punk, it's crap","review":"Why do people keep calling the Used punk?

Their music is unoriginal and their singer sounds like a cat when he sings. It's desguisting. I never want to hear his voice again. It's pretty sad that people call this stuff punk. I'm not someone who worships the name of punk, or who even claims to be punk! But this band certainly isn't punk. The Sex Pistols were punk. The Misfits were punk.The Used doesn't even pass as emotional music (emo.) There is no emotion at all in their music. It's such forced music, and such a forced image. If you want the real thing, then get the band that these guys are trying to look like; AFI. They have a much better singer and much better songwriting."},{"rating":"2","title":"one amazing band","review":"the used is an amazing band . i must of listened to there cd a million times . i saw them live at the warp tour 2003 and i fell in love ! usually i hear some bands cd's and there good and then you hear them live and your like wow they suck but the used is a different story there just great live ! some of there songs really helped me out a lot . and i love the screaming that burt(lead singer)always incorporates in the songs it just makes it that much better !! the used is my favorite punk rock band cause they write there own songs and there not about being famous they just want people to hear good music . all and all i think they are one excellent band and i recommend there cd to anyone who likes good rock music !! i love them and you will to !"},{"rating":"2","title":"I would give it more if I could","review":"This has to be the best cd that came out in 02. I bought the cd back in august, and i haven't stopped listening to it yet. It has a great blend of slower songs, and songs that will make ya jump and go crazy too. Berts voice is one of the best by far. He can scream with the best of them, but can also sing so amazingly. Every song on here is a hit and you can listen all the way through. Each song is unique and none really sound alike. They all have their own good qualities. My favorites are Poetic Tragedy, Greener with the Scenery, Noise and Kisses,The Taste of Ink, and Peices Mended, oh and even though its not on the cd, another great song by them is Just A Little. Ive seen them live twice so far, and they are so good in concert, if youre lucky enough to have them come to your town make sure you dont miss them. Theres not much else to say but these guys are one of the best bands around, go pick up the cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent album that gets better the more you hear it","review":"The Used's self-titled CD is the best I have heard in a while. Easily one of the year's bests. Though I must say, I wasn't as impressed after a first listen, but after really listening to what Bert is saying, you realize the beauty of the album. Some seem to take away from the album's greatness because of some screaming, but it actually adds to the emotion of the songs....Bert has a great singing voice which is displayed in \\"The Taste of Ink\\", \\"Poetic Tragedy\\", and \\"On My Own.\\" This album has more emotion and flavor than any other I have heard this year, and is truly ground-breaking with their ability to mix the heavy rock with a melodic sound. Buy the CD already."},{"rating":"2","title":"best album i bought last year","review":"i bought this album last year after having a friend tell me that they were really good and let me tell you...it was possibl the best album i could have bought last year. it doesn't really remind me of any similiar bands (that i listen to at least). it has its on flavor. bert (the singer) can be screaming one minute then singing the next and it sounds really good. my favorite songs on the cd are \\"The Taste of Ink\\", \\"Bulimic\\", \\"Buried Myself Alive\\", and \\"A Box Full of Sharp Objects.\\" these guys are totally one of the bands i expect to be a bit bigger this year and apparently so did MTV or TRL for including them in their New Band Week on TRL. These guys rock and so does the album so i suggest you buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING! MUST BUY!","review":"This album is a great reflection of most people's life's. The lyrics they come up with are absolutely phenomenal, with great instrumentals to back them up! His screaming is different from others, and is one you just fall in love with! They help capture the true feeling behind the lyrics. I can't say enough about this band, especially this album. Don't judge because they're a so called \\"emo\\" band, emo is just short for emotional, and these songs are very emotional, and beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"great delivery","review":"Besides the guys being pretty much completely creepy and just like them because of this albums musical genius (not lyrics), it was a great delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterfuly done!","review":"I love this cd, its my favorite one! The Used are amazing! Just the right amount of Screaming. Nobody screams better than Burt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine album","review":"To start out, I like this album. What it lacks in complexity is made up by interesting song structure (which is complexity in itself, I suppose). Anyway, this band clearly knows when and where to place things in song. Take for example, \\"On My Own\\", the vocalist's screams/growls over the string arrangement make for an incredible emotional experience. Personally, this is true talent in music (placement) rather than complex solos and such..Anyway, this is an extremely fun album, that rocks hard...My only gripe..at times the vocalists screams/growls seem slightly weak,a minor gripe, but on certain tunes it takes away from the overall quality of the song...but, give it a try"},{"rating":"2","title":"This sounds familiar...","review":"Now dont get me wrong...I really like this CD but it sounds really really familiar.

I turned on MTV the other day and there they were doing a concert. The lead singer kept on whining around and then after awhile he just started screaming for no reason at all. It was the most pathetic thing that I have ever seen. I could only understand maybe 5 words in the whole song. All I can say is please do yourself a favor and dont buy this. And if it can be avoided,dont even listen to this stuff either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please....","review":"Where to begin. I absolutely hate this band. It's one thing to completely jump on the bandwagon of this simply dirivative band, but everytime someone goes on and on about how \\"original\\" and \\"awesome\\" this band is I think, Give me a break! I liked this band in their much superior form named Glassjaw. Glassjaw is the band that should be getting your attention, NOT THE USED! Half of you out there probably only like this band because of Kelly Osborne and just want to think you are cool. Now before you all start hating me, I'm not talking to all of you. If you have never heard of any REAL emocore bands and The Used is the only one you have been forced to endure, then I suggest you dig deeper and find something with more substance. You can thank me later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"I first heard about these guys last year from a friend of mign, and have been completely blown away by there god givin talent to make great music. from start to finish this C.D is amazing. Not only did they have to over come homelessness, and drug abuse, but they also had to over come growing up in one of the most conservative states in the nation. this a graet C.D for whatever mood you are in, it has its harder and heavier songs such as Maybe Mermories, and Box of Sharp Objects and both of those songs are awsome, but then if you are into something softer try Poet Tragedy, On My Own, and Blue and Yellow, I give this C.D 5 stars out of 5 simply put like the title says simply amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I still can't find why people think this album is so good.","review":"I keep reading these reviews and try to find what is so good by listining to it over and over and this is what I constantly get from it:Pop punk, with hardcore vocals. Now its not poorly done, the actuall music is pretty well done but this album lacks Origionality and emotion. I know I know, you are thinking, \\"what the hell? this is the most emotional album I have heard.? Basically this is hardcore's version of Good Charloette. User friendly music that sounds good to people who are new to the genre. This is basically a pop album. It is not inspired and honest, or even slightly origional. Its about all that boring stuff you can find in any pop punk band.Rating it against other bands on the radio I guess I could give this album a pretty good rating, but its still very lacking. I suggest you check out the band Hopesfall."},{"rating":"2","title":"No path ahead at all.","review":"Good book. If you are a beginner on this matter the book is for you. It has a lot of details, a careful explanation and a very complete reference list. But if you have some information about this matter the book may be a little longer. The data about both countries are very balanced and both convince me that \\"we have a problem\\". It seems that 300 years of slavery will take centuries to be erased, supposing it well be possible. At the end my conclusion is that there is no easy scape from this drama.

Well, the truth is they're certainly back, but they've changed much since Secaucus. The first thing you'll noticed is they've lost a bit of the edginess on display in Secaucus. Instead of up-beat, immediately catchy pop tunes, the Wrens sound has matured into down-beat, immediately heart-wrenching songs of failure and endless breakups. As a result, with Meadowlands, the Wrens have reached a new emotional level not only in their own work, but in their genre as well. When \\"Happy\\" blessed my ears for the first time, I knew then that this is the best album of 2003.

I listen to a LOT of indie guitar music, and this is among the very best ever.

It is the melodies that rule here, not the protools.If you like Dido, Slowpho, Olive and especially Beth Gibbon's of Portishead's solo CD, \\"Out of Season,\\" then you will love Kosheen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cd but not dnb","review":"Some people reviewing this cd said it was drum and bass and that is absolutely false. This is an electronic pop cd that incorporates dnb and breakbeat elements to create a sound that is unlike any other pop act out there right now. With the dissapearance of Portishead we needed a good electronic band that did something groundbreaking and I feel that these guys gave it a good try. (I'm not saying they sound like Portishead though) Hide U is of course my favorite but there is a lot of other great tracks on the cd. The remix of Hide U could have been left off because it's not a very good one. Anyone who likes more poppy techno should check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just can't Resist Kosheen","review":"This CD is great even if your not a junglist. Styles range from up-beat DnB to more chilled out breaks all with the amazing vocals of lead singer Sian Evans. Standout tracks are Hide U, Suicide, Catch and Hungry. All around a good well produced CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"Once again, I'm not disappointed. Kosheen is always a nice change from the same old crap being played on the radio/TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"resistance is futile","review":"Resist is a great album for fans of D&B or dance pop. I'm not going to lie to you, there are a couple of uninspired songs sprinkled amonst the gems but those gems elevate the album all by themselves. Catch is takes catchy to a new level, Hungry makes me hunger for more and Gone is just great. This album is worth buying just for those three tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best dance Album Of The Year","review":"This album easily takes the title of best drum & bass album of the year.There are some amazing tracks here. The obvious ones beingHide U, Hungry, Catch, Empty Skies. However the whole album works, with hardly a weak track to be heard.I definately recommend this album for anyone who loves dance or even pop music."},{"rating":"1","title":"BE CAREFUL>> ENHANCED CD IS CORRUPT!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought this special enhanced CD thinking it was all that much cooler (well, it should have been) but the Video part DOESN'T WORK!!!

Be careful buying this version, if you really don't need the video, save your money and get the regular non-UK version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catch this!","review":"Good production. Stimulating lyrics. One of the best new cd's. Not so much drumm'n base, but who cares! Better for your mind than for your feet.\\"Call it love, call it fate, call me beautiful to my face\\".This is the cd to have and not to hide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kosheen lives up to expectations","review":"Kosheen managed to live up to all the hype placed around there first release, this disc spans over 15 tracks, most of which will remain memorable and have the potential to be so catchy as to be stuck in your head for days. We've all heard the John Creamer + Steph K remix that has been toted in the boxes by the likes of Tong, Seaman, Nick Warren and the like, the floor filler made the disc. Also look for a D&B wonder of a song in Suicide(track 6) needless to say the Bristol Trio did a marvelous job and is a welcome addition to anyone's D&B down tempo section of their rack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone needs to hear this","review":"Among the travesties of popular culture that sicken me most, is the effortless, almost immediate dismissal of Nico's musical brilliance. Her voice, her lyrics...anything to do with her so as to fail to admit to one's self, the true curiosity she evokes.This album blows away any cares I could have about that, or so many other things, as her resonating emotions carry me away with her every phrasing. The sounds evoke the highest of superlatives with inexpressible passion kindled in my brain. Each song is a powerful testament to the ominous wonder that ebbs and flows throughout this life we live in, with heavenly melodies that leave me aghast, and attain ageless prescience within my inquiring soul.Think what you like of my glowing compliments, but the mideval, and worldly-lyrics-by-way-of-the-otherworldly-sounds, will never cease to amaze me. Nor will any other voice chill me to a glorious rapture as does hers.This album is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great voice, some beautiful songs","review":"I have all of Kate Price's CD's, and if you like one, you'll probably like them all. She has a beautiful voice, clear, vibrant, and pleasant. Her songs in this album vary; I like a few. (I convert the ones I like to another CD as to only play those I really like). She goes well with Loretta McKennet if you like to mix music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading listing","review":"This item lists as \\"Duvet\\".This is what I thought I was buying. Unfortunately it turned out to be a duvet cover, which I didn't need.I went ahead and kept the items, but was not pleased. All other duvet covers were listed as covers and I believe this listing to be misleading.I have started to use one of the 2 I received and it appears to be good quality and I do like that it has a nice wide flap at the bottom, that comes up about 10\\", instead of buttoning at the bottom.This makes it impossible for the duvet-corners to poke out of the cover, which is nice.Unfortunately the cover also is a lint and feather catcher.The material is texturized and picks up everything and hangs on to it.I won't be buying any more of that style, and because of the misleading listing, probably won't buy this brand, unless I have a chance to physically inspect the item, so I can be sure I am getting what I am trying to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly what I thought I was getting based on description.","review":"1. Tools are included for calibration.2. An instruction manual is included with an image that shows a refractometer with a split measuring gravity on one side and brix on the other which would have been handy since I didn't receive the disc that LTB claims they ship alongside. You can find conversions online in a pinch.3. The case is nice and durable.4. I don't have a point of reference to tell whether the item is accurate since my calibration went fine and my brix consistently shows up lower than my specific gravity listing on my hydrometer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Include all Items","review":"The refractometer was pretty much what I expected to receive, though it has Brix scale twice, instead of Brix and specific gravity. Conversion is easy so this is not an issue.My main complaint is that the refractometer did not come with a complimentary book as promised in the description. Promising something in the price of a good and then not actually including the item is a seriously bad business practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the money","review":"Fairly solid refractometer. A reasonable amount of plastic and no internal light. Mine did not need to be calibrated. Comes with an eye dropper for sampling, a little rag for cleaning, and a little screwdriver for calibration.As mentioned in other reviews, no software is included with this item.Also as mentioned in other reviews, this type of instrument cannot provide an accurate gravity reading for a solution containing alcohol. That means it's fine for determining original gravity, and for finding out if the gravity of your brew is still changing. You will still need a hydrometer to determine the final gravity though. Using this tool does limit your need to use your hydrometer to once a batch. Since hydrometers are very fragile, that's a nice benefit.Considering the price point of this hydrometer, I'm actually very pleased. The next tier up in quality is almost double what I paid for this instrument, without a huge increase in apparent quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've listened to the pro...","review":"I bought this refractometer for homebrewing beer against the recommendation of my LHBS owner, who argued they are far more handy for wine makers. Either way, I liked the idea of simply taking a few drops of fermenting/ed beer to check my gravity. Our first batch measured higher brix than we expected- we just accepted we screwed something up while brewing. Then another batch that was clearly different SG and FG came out with the same brix as the prior batch! We then tested it against our hydrometer (should have done this in the first place) and, to our surprise, got pretty significantly different results.I wish I would have listened to the pro..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!","review":"The product works great and arrived really quickly, way ahead of the estimate.

In addition, the guide has numerous misspellings and was for a different scale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tool","review":"The refractometer is a great tool to test the sugar in wine and/or grapes.

I contacted the seller and promptly received a reply. They said I could return the item and suggested some options. They also sent a BRIX/Plato to Specific Gravity conversion table. The refractometerSainstore Refractometer for Measuring Sugar Content for Beer or Wineis very high quality and, now with the conversion table, meets my brewing needs very nicely. I will be keeping the refractometer. As I said, the refractometer is a five star instrument but so is the service of this seller. I'm very please and changing my rating for this product to five stars. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refractometer","review":"Excelent refractometer and great service. Delivery was within two weeks of the order. Easy to use, solid feel. There is a focus adjustment at the eye piece. Right out of the box the zero needed no adjustment. I haven't tested the high end with a properly made standard solution, but with what can be accompolished at home, the high end is also right on. This product is an outstanding value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine was defective","review":"I must've gotten a bum unit. The second time I used it, the readings were off by 15 points even after I calibrated, recalibrated, and re-recalibrated the unit several times. The first time I used it, it needed to be calibrated nearly every time I took a reading, even if it was just recalibrated a half hour prior. The little hinge pin for the cover plate isn't secured, either (I'm assuming this is to make cleaning easier), but if you're not careful, it will slide right out and disappear on you. I don't know if they're all like this, but for the money, I think I'll just go back to my hydrometer. Anyway, I contacted the folks at Agriculture Solutions, and returning it is no problem so I'll be sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent wrong item","review":"Normally I wouldn't have rated this at all, because I returned the item for a refund. But the seller, sportswarehouse, keeps sending me e-mail asking me why I haven't reviewed the purchase. So here goes.This is billed as a refractometer for measuring sugar content in beer or wine. What I received was a refractometer for measuring salinity. There was no included conversion chart or anything to compensate.So, why 1 star? Not for the item, but for the seller, because they very clearly described this item as being for homebrew use and saying that it measured in deg Brix. I bought this knowing that many other people also got the wrong type of refractometer, which means that this seller either is completely incompetent, or they just don't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salinity refractometer","review":"May be a very fine salinity refractometer, but it will never measure sugar content.

I'm a 48 year old white guy, and I was dancing in the aisles of Barnes and Noble like I was in the Breakfast Club...I think thats a ringing endorsement!...This is pure fun, catchy as hell...and these guys have a great sense of humor from the lyrics to the liner notes....when all the dust settles, the Kaiser Chiefs are going to be one of the few bands from this year, that people will still give a damn about....Bank on the Kaiser Chiefs"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Live British Music","review":"I looove this CD.

From their carefree pump-fisting social commentary of I Predict A Riot to the brooding self-flagellation of What Did I Ever Give You?, you can't help but enjoy Employment. Are they like the Zutons, Killers, or Franz Ferdinand? A little of all three, I suppose.I just saw them live on the day of the CD release(3/15) here in Atlanta and, suffice it to say, Ricky Nelson just plain brought it on lead vocals as did the rest of the band mates - especially with the incredibly ebullient encore of Oh My God. If given the opportunity, check them out live. This week's Rolling Stone lists them as one of 10 Artists to Watch. And for good reason. Good stuff. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"All hail the Kaiser Chiefs!","review":"Wow... this band was nothing, now they're the new \\"in.\\" Yes, the live tracks are GOOD QUALITY and definitely good music.

Although that would usually hurt the rating, most of the songs are very good even if they are pretty silly. I don't think most people will like it even though \\"I Predict A Riot\\", especially, is very instantly catchy and memorable (later on I found out it was a hit in England). After \\"Born To Be A Dancer\\" things start to go a little downtown, but the rest isn't bad. Musically it sounds like late 70's/80's punk, or for a more recent comparison I suppose a cheesier Maxmo Park. Post-punk fans might enjoy it, and open-minded listeners probably will too. Basically the album is worthy of a purchase if you're looking for some silly-but-fun punk songs. Not for everyone though. Recommended.Highlights include:\\"Every Day I Love You Less & Less\\"\\"I Predict A Riot\\"\\"Modern Way\\"\\"Na Na Na Na Naa\\"\\"You Can Have It All\\"\\"Oh My God\\"\\"Born To Be A Dancer\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Alright, but not great","review":"To be honest, I would actually give this album 3 1/2 stars, but I'll just round up here. This is a fairly decent album, and has a nice beat throughout the twelve tracks. The two songs that are already singles, \\"I Predict A Riot\\" and \\"Oh My God\\", definitely stand out, but the rest of it seems to just be filler.Rolling Stone has said that Kaiser Chief may become the next Beatles, but I see that happening only because of massive publicity and overhyped music. Personally, I didn't hear anything too original, just some rather hackneyed tunes. Enjoyable if you're looking for something to dance to, but there are plenty of better artists out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good energy...good fun...good music","review":"There are a stack of bands you hear when you play the album, The Clash, The Damned, Gary Numan, Depeche Mode, even a bit of The Specials. All very urban and brit, with a good sence of humor. Sure, it would be fantastic if every band could be 100% fresh, but that dont happen much.

Oh screw it, they're all superb. 5/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kaiser Thiefs","review":"A shameful collection of borrowed sounds and techniques. Further, any attempt at originality falls flat.

Just like Placebo reveals such influences as Pixies and Smiths with every breath - while maintaining a constant flair for originality and unique brilliance - Kaiser Chiefs give new life to old sounds; draw inspiration from familiar chords; and more importantly, bring back all the raw, unbridled energy that once defined the pop music world but is now so freakin' rare."},{"rating":"2","title":"With the flair of Franz Ferdinand","review":"Four former losers from Leeds -as they call themselves with a sense of self-mockery- finally start making a living; that is why the first album of Kaiser Chiefs is called Employment.Although heavily leaning upon British tradition (Blur, Pulp, Clash, much la-la-la, humour, catchy), the group has its own style; energetic rhythms, sometimes somewhat hysterical singing, and at times rather complex melodies. Most tracks start out quite plain, but have great breaks and sudden changes in rhythm which make the music very enjoyable.Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't know what the problem is!","review":"I have no idea what the other reviewer was talking about. While they aren't my favourite British band (Bloc Party has quite an edge) they are an excellent band. I saw them in Vancouver the other day and their stage presence was fantastic.

What else could you say about a band where the frontman crowd surfs while still belting out the lyrics?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New oldness","review":"This album will immediatly bring to mind an artists like The Clash or any other 70s era brit punk. Some would be turned off by this, but I find their ability to recreate this style commendable. Yes, one might argue that they could just throw on some old albums and get relatively the same effect. But, there's no reason to feel guilty about indulging in the Kaiser's naustalgic Employment. In addition, I would like to ad that if one is going to write a review, it would be best to review a style of music that you are actualy familiar with. I hate country. So it would make no sense for me to review country albums as I would give them all one star.

However after buying this CD I haven't listened to it more than a couple of times. Some of the songs are downright annoying and stupid, while the rest have repetitive lyrics and seem to be trying to copy British 60's pop music.

Ricky Wilson lit up the stage with obnoxious dancing that created the very riot in the audience he predicted.

I have not bothered to see the Stones since about 81, and watched this out of curiosity. Everyone says they're \\"better than ever\\", but... What's with all that junk all over the stage? Why do they need 3 keyboard players and a 5-piece horn section? Why do they need huge inflatable things, 10,000 spinning lights, and flashy pyrotechnics? It all makes the Stones themselves seem utterly ridiculous and unimportant, as if their music alone is not enough entertainment. No wonder their tickets are so expensive.KR and CW are a great rhythm section, and they should not need ANY of that unimaginitive, hi-tech slick show-biz crap to pull off their tunes live.

The sound is terrible, it is biased so much to the music, when the sound from the crowd comes in, its like somebody in the editing studio simply turned up the volume on the crowd track. Very low rent. Worse, the Stones were never known for their live music skills, so the 95% bias to their music leaves all the warts out in the open, with no Stones Live (from the crowd) atmosphere.I went to this concert, and it was so so so much better in person, I must give the sound crew an F on the DVD, it does not capture the audio side of the experience, while the video side is covered excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rolling Stones -- MAXimum Strength","review":"If you love the Stones, you really shouldn't be without this video in your collection.

I laughed a lot and found many essays very poignant. Especially since September 11th, I am conscious of the importance of the people in my life and this book made me see that in a positive way, not just a sad way.The authors (all real sisters) have a point of view about life that I found really refreshing: It is important to nurture connections, laugh out loud, support and encourage your friends and see yourself as part of a larger community. Amen, sisters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved them in Oprah Magazine so I bought their book","review":"These sisters are hilarious. I read their regular column in Oprah Magazine and listen to their radio show, so when I saw the paperback in the store, I grabbed it. You know how you feel when you spend a fun night with your girlfriends? That's how you'll feel after reading this book. The five Dolan sisters are all very funny but their points of view about life are very different. It's organized into a series of separate essays about their lives growing up and their lives now. This book is a pleasure and I've already bought it for a couple of my friends for their birthdays and they agreed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to the show","review":"I'm told the radio show is better, and I believe it. This is the story of the Dolan sisters and their somewhat unbelievable childhood growing up in a family of 10. As the oldest of seven, I can say that I found the story sugar-coated---note that the parents are largely absent, which probably wasn't the case but that's how it feels when you're part of a crowd. The \\"carry your skis\\" section certainly rang true, as is the assertion that in a large family one learns one is not the center of the universe. But the book is pretty superficial and a little too cute for my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful humor and humility","review":"A friend who is addicted to this radio show gave me this book as a birthday gift. I was skeptical reading about five sisters because I do not have any sisters myself, but so much of their attitude and approach reminds me of all my friends. Their self-deprecating humor is such a nice relief after too many books by people who think too highly of themselves (think Bill O'Reilly!) Their messages may be simple, but in these times it is nice to remind ourselves that yes, it is important to laugh, have fun with your people, and even count our blessings. It is not themselves they think highly of but the people who have been important in their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like reading their radio show","review":"I enjoyed the sisters' book.

WAY TO GO UNCLE JOE!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heathers this ain't","review":"At first veiwing, I thought this would be a dark comedy, and it starts like one: death of a long-time friend first evokes panic, then is replaced by an almost callous attitude ( as seen in the high school bathroom ) and eventually deception and betrayal follow. The bright settings and clothes are a stark contrast to their grim deed, and Rose Mcdowell plays her role wonderfully. Unfortunatley the plot soon turns ho-hum as the movie progresses, losing it's scathing humour and becoming cliched in its \\"thwarting the evil ploys\\" of Mcdowell. Also, there were numerous plot holes in the movie, especially concerning the \\"crime scene\\" and the police' acquiring of the suspect. I guess the only comparison to this movie would be Heathers, which far out shines this pale copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Watered Down \\"Heathers\\" for the 90's.","review":"\\"Jawbreaker\\" is a Title, a Title looking for a Premise. It may have found a Premise, but someone should have been looking for a Script, cause this film could have used one. I had Heard the Excruciating Reviews, so I waited for video, I wasn't expecting much, so I wasn't really dissapointed, but still, it's not a great movie, it's barely a good one.The Three Stars, Rose McGowan, Rebecca Gayheart and Julie Benz are all Great Looking, Funny, Charismatic young Actresses. It's a Shame they have to Spew such Lame Dialogue. McGowan is lucky enough to get a Few good Zingers in, but they're too few and far between.Pam Grier has an amusing extended cameo as the Hard Nosed Detective who see's that something ain't right, and the Cameo by Marilyn Manson is Subtle but Effective and ultimately Vital."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome film","review":"The only reason I bought this movie was because Rose McGowan was in it. She played my favourite character in Scream and I was dying to see her in something else. So when I saw this in a shop for 6, I bought it. And am I glad I did! Rose McGowan was excellent playing Courtney. Rebecca Gayheart was good as Julie and so as Julie Benz as Marcie 'Foxy' Fox. I would recommend this film to anyone, so long as you can cope with several close ups of a greying corpse with a massive lump in it's throat. If you haven't done already, rent it out, especially if you're a fan of Rose. She really does give an excellent performance you won't be disappointed by. Well done Rose!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself","review":"This was one of the five worst movies I have ever seen.

I do think that it is a bit more dark and definately more warped than heathers, but enjoyable and funny. Rose McGowan was great in this and absolutely gorgeous. The transformation of the ugly duckling and her revenge was perfect. In twenty years it'll be just like those b horror movies of the 50's and 60's we all love so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Satan in heels\\" described it best","review":"The first time I ever saw Rose McGowan was when the previews for this movie came out. I was blown away, and looked for her other movies ASAP. Honestly, this isn't the Doom Generation, which is the best movie, in my opinion, for watching Rose at work, but you will have a lot of fun watching her in this one. Jawbreaker does not pack the punch of The Doom Generation, probably because this movie had a wide release and had to satisfy censors, etc. It's more of an eye-candy type of movie... getting to see Rose in a very glamorous role, an in-control queen pulling strings and keeping everyone around her on an edge between laughter and terror (the lunchroom scene, \\"I'd better never have children...\\" is priceless). On the socially-redeaming front, she \\"only\\" kills one person in Jawbreaker, much less than her body-count in Devil in the Flesh."},{"rating":"2","title":"...........perfect funny movie!","review":"this is a kind of movie u could watch every day in fact it is very funny and well made. the actors are very good and rose mcgowan is perfect in her part. there are no boring scenes and everything is ok. anyway it isn't a kolossal or something like that...a commedy that works and that will make u laugh 'til the end! i can't give it 5 stars because the performance of the characters isn't perfect but still good. watch it and buy it! believe me.."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible terrible movie","review":"Even if you are in to the teeny-boper movies, you may not like this one.

I was just looking for some mindless fun. Uhh, no. It wasn't funny, wasn't creepy, wasn't even entertaining in a campy kind of way. The story makes no sense, the acting was atrocious and the whole high school situation was *completely* unrealistic. I kept expecting the film to get better, but it didn't. Rebecca Gayheart was the best thing about this movie (and - while I'm sure she's a great girl - that's saying something). Marilyn Manson's cameo is just gross. I like satires and black comedies (e.g. Ravenous), but this movie just left a sour taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"this stinks. it's that simple","review":"c'mon. if you want to see a flick that deals with cliques, and high school pranks and splintered friendships, then see the classic \\"Heathers\\". this movie tries so desperately to be something it's not. the script is horrible...the direction is horrible...the movie is horrible. get \\"heathers\\" and see what this movie wanted to be yet ended up falling flat on its face."},{"rating":"2","title":"jawbreaker","review":"Jawbreaker-Rose Mcgowan, Julie Benz.Not much original ground but worth it for Rose Mcgowan fans.It extends the evil high school temptress theme beyond Rose's surprising Devil in the Flesh.Devil in the FleshThese two companion films are not of the gore variety Rose recently starred in. They would rate in the PG-13 area at most. The soundtrack for Jawbreaker is a good sampling of teenbeat featuring the Donnas.Nor are they at all romantic. Neither film has any kind of healthy love interest for Rose; and the romance between the couple who team up to stop Rose is a very offhand device without chemistry.For me, these are curiosities of interest based on Rose's role in Charmed. These are more fun than anything from the other Charmed witches except Kaley Cuoco's comedy hit Big Bang Theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"this is a funny and interesting portrayal of gender roles in teenage society.

Well it has Marilyn Manson playing a small part, which I'm sure Rose talked them into (thats over), and great music- check out the sound track, and great acting. It includes Rose McGowen who is so great at acting (she leaves you hating, admiring, and wanting more out of her) among many others. Although it has a somewhat dumb plot and a couple of very annoying blonde girls, I like it and it's essence. I'd recommend it to everyone who does or doesnt like teen movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever and cynical","review":"Okay, okay, I understand that the plot of this movie is somewhat stupid, but as a teen girl, I loved it. The dialogue is clever, although unrealistic. My favorite character is Courtney \\"Satan-in-heels\\" Shane. Marcie Fox is your stereotypical dumb blonde, Julie is the angelic one and Liz Purr is the \\"perfect\\" teen. I watch this movie so much my parents are sick of it!!!! But, I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"this movie rocks !!!!!","review":"Jawbreaker is a must see movie. it's totally cool. Rose McGowan potrays her character perfectly, and i love the clothes she wears in the movie.

Everything is wrong here, girls change constantly from being quite evil to being saints; I can buy Rose McGowan, she is evil and stays that way (although her performance is basically one-note). But Gayheart's part is a joke. Why did she hang out with McGowan when she has such a good heart in the first place? This just doesn't add up. Certainly, \\"Heathers\\" it isn't, no way! There is a commentary track on the DVD and obviously the director had fun making the movie.

Although her character was written as 2 dimentional and left no room for any depth or development, she did give an almost \\"oscar-worthy\\" performance when she slammed the jawbreaker on the table while trying to intimidate one of the girls. You go Pam! I watched in discomfort as Pam (who so brilliantly played \\"Jackie\\" in \\"Jackie Brown\\") tried to no avail to bring her lame character to life. I only saw the boredom in her eyes. The entire time i viewed this piece, i wanted to take over for the director and do this film some justice.

A jawbreaker maybe?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop making it out to be something it's not.","review":"This is not a deep, well planned, sophisticated movie.

Eventually one of the three friends breaks away and wants to tell police the truth about their dead friend. Eventually as an added twist everything goes wrong when the now popular nerdy girl becomes more popular than the evil McGowan. This movie is only good for frustrated teen boys. Another thing that bugs me is that there is odd peppy music almost pornoish in sound and as you see on the cover everyone wears bright colors. This is the worst movie I have ever seen, and it is more like a T&A teenage fantasy than a suspense movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame High School Dark Comedy","review":"This flick is strictly dullsville. Unappealing characters and boring and derivative plot. You know you're in trouble when you constantly look at your watch during an 87 minute movie. Sole redeeming point is a performance by the Donnas, an all girl rock band from the Nineties, at the senior prom. \\"Heathers\\" covered similar territory ten years earlier to better effect.

Maybe I'm just too old for this drivel -- although I could watch \\"Clueless\\" and \\"The Craft\\" until my DVD player breaks -- but whatever entertainment value this movie was trying to push, I just didn't get it. The movie wasn't funny (which is sad to say when one of my favorite comedic actresses, Carol Kane, couldn't even elicit a smile out of me), the plot was full of holes, and the writing seemed very rushed and contrived. I wasn't expecting greatness when I watched Jawbreakers, but I was at least hoping for 1 1/2 hours of mindless entertainment.

It is utterly horrifying in that it portrays the desperation of the popular to stay popular and the need of the outcasts to enter their fashionable ranks. But is their delicious perfection all that it seems? How far are they willing to go to stay on top? And what happens when one of those so-called outcasts has to be grudgingly groomed to become one of them -- because she knows that they are covering up the (accidental) murder of a friend?Jawbreaker is a joyride of a bitchy, biting comedy that will strike a note with everyone who ever attended high school -- no matter what group you found yourself in!Don't miss Jawbreaker!

Not only were the girls extremely hot, but the story was hilarious.Courtney in particular was cool. My brother says I'd be her if I was a girl. But, since I'm not, I'll settle with marrying her. I feel bad for Julie though. Her life took a bad turn, but so does Courtney's at the end. I like the ending of the movie, it was good.Even Marcy turns away from Courtney in the end. Too bad for Courtney. When she's talking to Vylette at one point on the phone, she says \\"Courtney Shane is priority number 1\\". That was hilarious.No clue who that band is at the prom, but their music is cool.All in all, good movie.

For everyone else, GET IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible shallow movie","review":"I can't see how anyone can like this movie. It tries to be clever and sadistic(like Cruel Intentions) but it just sounds stupid and shallow. The actresses who play these high schoolers are closer to 30 than 17.

They could have simply bribed her by putting her in the spotlight, not redirecting the spotlight toward her and then marveling at the monster that they created.Great cameo from Marilyn Manson as the greaser in the bar.

Casual Canine has really high quality polos for dogs. I have purchased several of their polos online and at boutiques. They are typically cheaper online at around $13-15.00. You can pay as much as $25 in speciality boutiques. They are thick, colorful, and sturdy. They wash well and retain their color--little to no fading. However, I recently ordered the chateau pink polo and it does not quite measure up to their normal standards of quality. The pink is muted and unappealing. It does not look at all as pictured. I have this polo in neon green, grass green, royal blue, basic blue, and purple.

Sigh, I had high expectations for this movie based on the trailer and the opening scenes. In the opening, a former CIA hitman is doing a hostage rescue from two high speed cars rolling thru a desert somewhere in the middle-east. Starting with only a high-power rifle, he starts the ambush. A very impressive setup and execution. From there it all went wrong. The hitman character is toally flat and 2-dimensional. Trying to achieve a rigid army-like character, the actor achieves a total boring, don't care, uninteresting character. Our hitman is talked into taking one more job before he retires. As he starts to plan the hit we get the feeling all is not right. Yep, after he hits the target, \\"they\\" will hit him. Frankly, the action ain't so good; the characters are bland and don't care. For a movie with potential, this turned out badly. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex and Beautiful","review":"This updating of The Return of Martin Guerre is as beautiful and compelling as it is complex, with intriguing characters who tackle questions of integrity, morality and hope.

Foster was brilliant as usual.Richard Gere is not that bad. However, in all his films, he seems to use the same mannerisms and way of strutting/walking that could be identified easily without ever seeing his face.It did not seem believable that everyone in town is fooled. Also, it seems that the change of 'yellow Lawrence' into a great and brave guy is hard to believe without any explanation such as a religious conversion.

Rumoured that Foster only accepted the film after more lucrative contracts fell through, it remains a pale travesty of the original French film. A weak attempt to make the film palatable for US audiences goes totally against the original medieval European story that has been unsuccessfully updated to the period of the American Civil War. The deception that was just barely believable when set at the time of the Hundred Years' War, where it could play off the superstition that a man might be transformed by war becomes totally unbeleivable in its present version.

This, the band's third album, is supposedly marred by an outside producer's unwarranted additions of strings and brass to many (but not all) of the tracks. Personally I don't mind those touches so much; they add sonic interest to the album, though I admit sometimes they work better than other times. But my real problem with this album is its overall songwriting blandness. None of these songs are memorable, and certainly not forty years later. There is some good drumming here, and some solid vocal performances, but hardly any melodies to speak of; the band seems to get by on their solid, energetic performances. Had they been given some catchy songs, and/or tried a few more sonic experiments, they might have been worth remembering more. Even the Rolling Stones had some great melodies and hooks in those days, and this album pines for a few."},{"rating":"1","title":"They weren't successful for a reason","review":"well, i read an article explaining that the pretty things were poised on becoming huge in the british invasion years, but tragically did not. this album justifies their failure. from the horrible tunes to the horn section (added later by the record company) to the dreadful lyrics, it's a total flop. there are 19 tracks on this album. 5 are doubled and 1 is tripled. also, the cover's typeface was clearly grand theft from the beatles 'rubber soul.' so there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy!","review":"Received this about a week ago and I have already used it in tacos, black beans and rice, salsa and Chinese stir fried chicken and vegetables.

It's a child's memory of the summer -- with four aunts, an uncle, his unmarried mother,a free spirit father and, always present, the magnificent green countryside of Ireland. A countryside so beautiful that one can hardly believe that suffering could take place there. Still,as the summer slowly unfolds, the viewer takes in the real complexities of the family's life, with worries about food and money and work and love and loneliness and the future. This is not a \\"message\\" movie,however. No preaching, thank you very much. The child's story is allowed blossom and speak for itself. And along with the suffering, there are glowing moments of clear pure joy that point the way to what life is really all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"ACK!!!!!","review":"To those unacquainted with Brian Friel's wonderful stage play of the same name, this might be a mediocre, possibly even enjoyable film. Those of us, however, who know the REAL Dancing at Lughnasa are sure to hit the stop button on the VCR after the first five minutes. Oh, to be sure, the characters and BASIC storyline are the same in both the movie and the stage play, but there the end. In the movie, too many \\"behind-the'scenes\\" scenes are shown, depriving the audience of the brilliant \\"memory\\" feel of the stage play. One almost wonders if Friel collaborated on this terrible adaptation, or if he is instead pursuing litigation. There are some good points, however (I'm not ENTIRELY negative). The acting was pretty good (although some of the actors could have used a bit more dialect coaching) and the scenery & locations were outstanding. However, these were simply not enough to save this movie from a grisly end in my trash bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre, at best","review":"I really looked forward to the arrival of my copy of this video. Yes, I actually bought it! Only because it's impossible to find at video rental stores.

I found myself frequently glancing up at the clock wondering how far along into the movie I was. I kept waiting for *something* to happen. It never really does. The emotional and moral (?) conflict and differences between the sisters was flat, uninteresting and petty. And the resolution of those differences...well, all ended in a very anti-climatic, boring ending, hardly seen as a resolution for anyone.This movie might be watchable...but only once, in my opinion.

I am a huge fan of both Meryl Streep and Michael Gambon, and I know Brian Friel has written some wonderful plays and screenplays -- so I couldn't believe what a dismal bore this turned out to be. As other reviewers have said, practically NOTHING happens, except that these five lonely, pathetic, spinster sisters sit around and bicker at each other. Streep's character is a priggish, joyless nag who makes her sisters even more depressed than they already have reason to be. At times the film seems to be building up to some climactic event (somebody will die or get knocked up), but then... nothing. And the sisters' big, exuberant dance scene near the end seemed totally fake and tacked-on to me -- I suspect they included that just so they could put it in the movie's trailer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"This is a great product I have only recently started using.

To be fair one has to credit Dedalus with printing this along with it's expansive list of rare and obscure occult themed fiction, it fits right in. However this one was best destined to remain out of print. The Fiery Angel is a weak blend of touristic occult nonsense and weaker still Gothic romance. It was a real grind to read as it was full of awkward turns of phrase and frankly terrible occult flirtations that illustrate that the author knew nothing of the topic. In fact he ends the book with an explicit and heavy handed catholic denouncement of the entire practice. One wonders if he did this to save his reputation or to admit that he was ignorant of all occult matters. This book is saved only by a amusing but ultimately pedestrian description of the Witch's Sabbath.

Thea goes veiled and poses as a widowed countess while requesting Gabriel's help. She needed the help and expected Gabriel to win through, but she never expected to become his lover.Another member of the Bar Cynster hits the matrimonial dust, fighting all the way. Gabriel is a bit slow in determining that Thea is the countess. Duh, Gabriel, there aren't that many tall, feisty woman running around London. Yet the story is wonderful and engrossing. Laurens never disappoints. It appears we will have at least two more books in the series to look forward to, Lucifer and honorary Cynster, Chillingworth. I can't wait!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah....","review":"Okay. So I have read the five Cynster men books. My favorite is Scandal's Bride.

Can anyone, please, explain to me the purpose of the Countess being covererd as if she was in a Moslem country and Gabriel making love to a women he could not see? I am guessing that that was supposed to be \\"romantic\\" but how many people make love to people they can't even see????? Also, is the fabled August meeting of the clan ever going to take place? What was nice about Scandal's Bride is that we actually get to visit with the Cynster men and their ladies after their stories end. I hope the book with Lucifier brings us back to them again. Also, why are the time periods so rushed? It is as if one man marries, the next month the next, and so on. How about a few years in between? Again, this book was, really, sort of stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great plot and very likeable characters!","review":"This being only the second of the series that I have read (Promise in a Kiss really lacked what this book had!), I found the characters Gabriel and Alathea very charming in their own ways...There was actually conversation between them and the added mystery of Alathea's hidden identity was what urged me to buy this in the first place. Their love scenes were lush and very sensual although Gabriel had no idea who the countess really was during them. As Lauren describes Gabriel's feelings for this mystery woman, it proves quite an ironic situation as readers will learn that Gabriel and Alathea, when not in disguise, are almost always not on good terms with each other. After Gabriel realizes that it was Alathea all along, his rash decision to marry her along with Alathea's own stubborness brings the story to a great climax that presents Gabriel with an ultimatum regarding his love for her. Readers truly will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Series","review":"Okay Cynster series fans, this one is the best so far. I don't like to rehash what everyone has so aptly said about the plot. I will however add, that the review at the top of the page by Amazon has spelled the female protagonist's name wrong. It is Alathea not Althea. At any rate, you will enjoy this story, I believe, because their passion is both romantically told (not just raw) and mysterious.

Once we started the book we couldn't put it down. We really got enthralled with the characters and went from sadness to cheering for the good guys (lizards that is). From the beginning of the book you are thrown into an intense battle between chameleons and lizards.

The few images of the creatures are poor, especially when taken by a 70mm IMAX which is 4 times the size of a 35mmm slide. The lack of creatures shown, the poor descriptions of them , etc. make for armchair reading that will put you to sleep unless you're enthralled by the California mystique of a director's name and little substance.

The kids are left at home with no money and little Blonde supporting the family while their mom has gone to Euroupe with her Boyfriend on a Busines Trip. The plot is a real bad one. Its the summer time with their mom on a business trip. After that I went Zzzz! It was snooze central. My brother kept watching it and I got sick the same night we both watched it. But anyway, back to the Plot. The 5 kids are being baby-sitted by a 100 year old woman.

The premise in a nutshell is simple. Mom takes a much needed vacation in Australia... Apart from her kiddies and rather than trust her 17 year old daughter to tend to the little ones she hires a babysitter to watch them while she is away for three months (More a sabbatical then vacation, Mom). Once Mom is out of the picture the sitter goes militant and the kiddies dreams are turned to jagged, shattered nightmares. But then the kiddies find out the babysitter's dead and a free-for-all begins! But soon play-day turns to payday when they find out the sitter had the money to care for then on her when they dumped her at the funeral home and Sue Ellen must get a job.

She was hot and sexy back then and still is today.This movie is about the kids in a family who thought that they were going to spend a lazy summer with their mom gone on a trip when they, to their dismay, find that their mom has hired an old lady babysitter.Christina plays the oldest sister in this great comedy as hilariousness ensues. Boyfriends and dates, pot smoking and skeet shooting with dishes, young love, sports, and money all come together in this movie as the kids learn how to work together and survive on their own until their mother comes home early and ruins the fun.While there is some sexual innuendo, mild drug use etc I think this movie would be good for PG or PG13. It's great fun and one of my most favorite movies and I highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"The movie is amazing like always, but the quality on the copy I ended up with was very poor.

I don't understand why TV Guide gives it only one star. It deserves more than that.Mom is going to Australia for the summer and the kids are being left home with a babysitter, a kindly woman, but old. Well, she dies on the kids and they cart her body off to the funeral home and plot how to get along without telling Mom. Suellen (Christina Applegate) decides to get a job so the kids can have a summer on their own. This is when the fun really begins. Suellen applies for a receptionist job but winds up being hired as an executive assistant to Rose, played by Joanna Cassidy, in the garment industry.We watch Suellen go from typical blonde teenager to mature keeper of her younger siblings and their well-being. We have fun along the way on her journey. If only life could throw all of us such a great boss, great opportunity, great good luck, and a big adventure.

That said, the DVD version I just purchased is the absolute pits. It looks as though it were shot on a home video camera, and the ambience of the film is totally altered. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because the movie is good enough to keep even the worst DVD authoring to merit a one-star.

The DVD, however, is something you want to steer clear of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly Good!","review":"I can't remember how I got ropped into watching this but I did.

It's also a bit nostalgic, since this was made right before cell phones and the Internet were a part of daily life, so young'uns today are in for an experience when they watch this.Mom has chosen a old lady as a babysitter while she goes off, despite the insistence of her teenaged daughter that they can take care of themselves.

I hate it when they have movies where they make fun of Bill and Ted's because Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is one of my favorites of all time.

It's an excellent film to reinforce the concept that education is essential and adult responsibilities require adult committments. The tables are turned when the 17-year-old daughter must support her siblings for the summer -- and finds herself saying the things Mom says and hearing the excuses she gave to Mom just weeks ago. I use the film in the classroom to underscore the point that a good resume gets the interview and sometimes the job, but the education to back it up is required to keep the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUCH BETTER THAN THE TITLE SOUNDS!","review":"One of the better teen comedies of the time period and way better than the title leads you to believe!

Her frustration with the way natural disasters in general and avalanches in particular are reported in the popular press rings very true.The the author's acquired humility from years of wrestling with this natural phenomenon is much appreciated. One comes away from the book with a clear picture that nature will ultimately have the upper hand in a struggle with humanity, but humans can at least manage their risk taking as well as their own tendency towards arrogance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous, educational, interesting read!","review":"I read this book after taking my Avalanche Level I class and reading Fredston & Fesler's Avalanche Field Guide (a must!!) and completely loved it.

Although Mr. Van Buuren's mixing techniques are still consistently top-notch, this set of mix simply does not engender the kind of applause that was instantly recognized and continuously reinforced by listening to some of his earlier works. Coupled with the disappointing experience of his \\"Universal Religion 2004\\" and in light of higher quality trance mixes presently created by other notable DJ's, Mr. Van Buuren should reevaluate the current \\"state\\" of his \\"trance\\" selections and recreate the kind of magic that \\"A State of Trance 2004\\" so unmistakably demonstrates.

I love Armin. He is one of the best DJ's ever. The first six songs on CD1 is just about the best mix I've ever heard, but it doesn't go anywhere after that. Also, the first 4 songs on CD 2 are good, but where's the rest of the two albums???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Armin Van Buuren: pure genius","review":"When I saw that Armin had done another State of Trance CD, I got it right away. The man is a genius, pure and simple. Listening to both discs, it is impossible to hear the seams between songs because he does such a brilliant job at mixing. The songs are all uplifting, and it's easy to see why this is called trance music. On disc one, my favorite songs are \\"I Found You\\" and \\"Beyond Horizon.\\" On disc two, my favorites are \\"Twelve,\\" \\"The Deep Show,\\" \\"Emotional Void\\" and \\"Ballerina.\\" Seems to be a pattern there. I think I like disc 2 better, because it has such a strong line of songs in the middle of the CD. But overall, both discs are worth 5 stars, and this album is a must-have for trance fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to basics","review":"If you've been following Armin's \\"A State of Trance\\" radio show, then you know that Armin's tastes have undergone a transition of sorts over the last year or so. The so-called \\"progressive\\" sound that is found on his new CD is really nothing new; Sasha, Digweed and Fortier have been spinning material like this for years.What is new is a movement away from harsh, techno-like sounds, away from sappy pop, and away from overwrought anthems, back to what Trance is all about: simple, euphonic, minimalist, and... well, entrancing.This is a big mix with a lot of material that won't be an easy listen for a newcomer to dance music; however this is an outstanding mix that captures the heart and soul of what is happening in dance music right now. It is a snapshot of everything a magical night in the club could be. Buy it, and listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"State of Trance 2004 is so much better!","review":"Ever since I listened to State of Trance 2004, I was rather disappointed with this one. I am a pure trance fan who is not into background female vocals mixed in. Thus CD1 was not for me. CD2 is darker, but not interesting enough.

The first disc definatley has more emotion involved but some of the material on the second disc ov very upbeat and enjoyable. Of course there are some boring tracks, but definately more good than bad, and nowadays with any music that is hard to find! I must admit that these CD's took some time to grow on me, but it was more than the worth the \\"break in\\" period. The female vocals on the first disc are amazing on a good stereo, or headphones, and overall the recording quality on these discs is very good.

Highly recommended CD's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Massive CD","review":"Definitely worth 4.5 stars. This is definitely an evolved CD, with songs or mixes from some huge names in the trance music world. I'm really enjoying what trance music has evolved into (what is being referred as the 3rd Renaissance of Trance Music). Definitely digging the slightly slower BPM pace, although he does give a huge ode to 'epic trance' in the later half of the 1st CD, which is always good. I'm suprised that the 2nd CD is being frowned on so much. Andy Moor's Halycon is just amazing, and his edit of KvAs Made of Sun (Hard Dub) is as they say in the Guiness commercials BRILLIANT!I held off from 5 stars because he hasn't quite mastered Ableton Live, and First Time should have never made it onto this CD, plus he cut out a few of my favorite seconds of I Know You're Gone.

I went to my doctor for a check up and she gave me a copy of this book and it has literally changed my life! I didn't realize how sick I was making myself feel through all of the stress I was heaping on top of me. The Hurried Woman is really 4 books; A book on fatigue, one on weight control, a book to improve your relationships, and one for getting control of stress all in one.

While it does offer medical information (on a basic level) of causes for fatigue and other points on the modern day stresses women face, it does not reveal any new ideas. One example is the idea behind weight management. The approach is similar to Weight Watchers -- using formulas and diaries.

Without their backing, Germany would have fallen into a communist state in the early 1930s. Certainly, the high-powered money interest of Europe preferred the Nazi Party to the communist. This is why the \\"money\\" interest supported the Nazi party. Understanding this truth is key in understanding the Nazis rise to power.We all know what Hitler's views were, but we haven't until Pool research, addressed what powerful forces were instrumental in his rise to power. As a history major, Pool represents what the craft of history is all about. A high recommended reading for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very thorough and easy to read","review":"James Pool is very detailed and knowledgeable regarding the rise of Hitler and National Socialism after World War I. Pool shows that it took Hitler a long time to win industrialists and the wealthy to his cause. His knowledge on the subject shows he did a lot of research and uses many cross references. Once you start reading, you can't put it down.This book is only the first in a two-part series and half the story. After reading this book, you really need to purchase Hitler and his Secret Partners (Contributions, Loot and Rewards, 1933-1945) so you can get the whole picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"mom of player","review":"Not what I was looking for.

Julia Roberts gives a fine, nuanced performance as a Victorian woman scarred by neglect and harsh work, but the director can't get away from close shots of Julia's face to give us a clear view of the action. Malkovitch is his usual superb, dangerous self, but he is crippled by the director's obsession with Julia's visage. The book is worth a lot more,the movie is only useful as background noise for a game of Scrabble. Better luck next time, Julia!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I absolutely loooove this movie! Julia Roberts' BEST performance is right here folks!

The movie had a good premise, but the heavy direction ruined it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If negative stars were a rating option, I would use them","review":"This movie had an interesting idea going for it in the beginning, but the bad acting, bad script, bad lighting, and horrible accents, killed it. I feel I lost brain cells just watching it. The only \\"scary\\" or \\"disturbing\\" part was Malkovich's face, which hardly ever changed into a believable expression. Robert's accent changed from scene to scene with upsetting regularity, which was extremely disappointing.If the point of this movie was to show how \\"misunderstood\\" Jeckyl and Hyde may have been, it did a thoroughly awful job.I would recommend a root canal over this movie, as it may be less painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOn't care about Julia","review":"I don't care about Julia's acting being good or bad in this one. All that I care is that this movie stincks. It's bad directed, bad screenplayed, the actors are uninspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"dark atmosphere in this chilling little story","review":"This movie is so, so creepy and gothic and weird, without being too bloody or too gratuitous. It's silently creepy and disturbing, that's its power.I didn't buy the Jekyll and Hyde being two different guys because anybody with half a mind can see its Malkovich in both roles, so I find it hard to believe that Mary Reilly and others wouldn't recognize that, they should have disguised him better, not just different hair color.Other than that, everything in the film works great. Malkovich is superb as always in his subdued sophisticated decadent villain acting mode, and Julia Roberts really shows her range as an actress, playing this timid mousy little maid with a sad past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julia's got moves you never knew","review":"This film marks the rebirth of Julia Roberts. The casting agent picked a peach when they made this one. Julia is perfect opposite the lush Cameron Diaz who sparkles in her role as the naive bride-to-be. The movie has a heavenly sound track which brings many decade-or-so old classics back to life. Whilst the dialogue is laden with hilarious inserts from Rupert Everett who is the epitome of gay charm. As romantic comedies go this one is up there: one for the video rack- hey, buy the soundtrack too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the casting director thinking?!?","review":"I don't know why this movie got so many great reviews on here. The movie is not bad, but is certainly not good. However, what makes this movie really horrible is Julia Roberts. I am a HUGE Julia fan, but her performance in this movie is laughable. She can't hold a stead Irish accent-- at times she sounds like good old American Julia, and at other times, a VERY strong Irish accent comes out of her mouth, with no explanation for the sudden change. I believe this must have been a critical point in her career, at which point someone must have told her, \\"stick with what you do well... romantic comedies!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work.","review":"The dvd did not work.

Perhaps, Malkovich heart was not in it; which completely showed throughout the film. Indeed, it was double role that he offered onscreen; displaying a lack of creativity; and hopelessness. Perhaps, it was the added pressure of re-creating a masterpiece; regardless, the film made no great leaps and jumps; instead it was stagnant with no beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great underrated thriller","review":"I just got done watching this movie on tv.It was very good.I would highly recommend this film,to anyone that loves a good mystery or who is a fan of the tale of dr jekyll and mr hyde."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roberts is fantastic!","review":"When I first saw this film at the video store I wasn't sure if I should rent it.

That said, it's still a good to very good film. The cast is impressive: Sean Connery, Kate Capshaw, Laurence Fishburne, Ed Harris, Blair Underwood, Ruby Dee and then child actress, Scarlett Johansson. The Florida Everglades gives it a raw and spooky quality. Harris is borderline over the top but it works. Based on a novel of the same title by Jeffrey Katzenbach.STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; TWISTS/SURPRISES: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: early October 2011; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"SEAN CONNERY AND OTHERS","review":"Sean Connery does his customary highly professional job as the Harvard Law professor who is called in to review the case of a man convicted of murder, sentenced to death eight years previously. The sentence is to be carried out in the near future. In a flashback we are all made aware of the evidence which makes his confession and conviction invalid. Laurence Fishburne, as the sheriff and one of the interrogators in the eliciting of the confession is almost stereotypically over the top, as is his deputy. In fact, while the remainder of the cast work competently, only Blaire Underwood has a chance to look good as the convicted killer.While the film is reminiscent of others in the genre, Connery is so good as the law professor investigating the case, that he holds the production together. Most should find it sufficiently diverting to overlook flaws and key in on the puzzle and the lead characters. A decent though not excellent film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another lost cause for Connery","review":"Just Cause is one of those films that at first makes you wonder quite why it was so heavily slated when it came out - nothing special but competent enough and with an excellent supporting performance from Ed Harris. Then you hit the last third and everything starts to get increasingly silly until you've got a killer with a flashlight strapped to his forehead threatening to fillet Sean Connery's wife (a typically mannered and unconvincing Kate Capshaw) and kid (a very young Scarlet Johannsen) in an alligator skinner's shack. The kind of movie that's probably best seen on a plane, and even then only once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Cause Review","review":"The movie starts off nicely but ends up to be ridiculous and unconvincing. The actors are basically wasted. The only good thing about this film is James Newton Howard's fine score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Acting + Good Suspense = Good Movie","review":"The acting in this movie was superp. Ed Harris showed his versatility as the convicted serial killer on death row. Sean Connery and Laurence Fishburne put in their usual stellar perfomances. The video transfer was very good and the sound on my home theater was decent -although no DD 5.1 soundtrack was disappointing (when are studios going to make that a standard for all DVDs?). Some extras would have been nice but maybe I'm asking too much for my $10. Definitely a nice addition to any DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie!","review":"As mentioned in the other reviews, the movie starts out very slow and very predictable. It's only in the last 40min where things start to get interesting. Definitely worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you dont like this your in the wrong genra","review":"Every aspect of this entailed thriller is very well made. This is not your run-of-the-mill Hitchcock ripof, this is a murder mystery, that has an originality you rarely see anymore. From the violent opening scene, to the outstanding actorial performance by Ed Harris, This is a great film. You could compare the performance by Ed Haris, to that of Jack Nicholson in, THE SHINING, its that good!. Each actor is right for his/her part, and there performances are impecable. The U turns that this movie takes are what makes it entertaining to watch over and over. It so keeps you guessing what's going to happen, especially in the middle of the film, after the major court scene, where the movie seems to be over, its only just begun. The storyline speeds from one mans' freedom, to grafic images in a seemingly christian home, to the early execution of an unlikley propriator. This is an all around great, film and I strongly recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A triple-twister!","review":"Our favorite twist-plot movie. Gotta see it! You think you figured it out and...

Yes, it does talk some about different literary-related fields, and I stress some, but the book lacks serious discussion of those careers. Plus, it gives limited resources for finding out more information....no websites and no mention of other literary career-related books. It only lists a few professional associations for each career. Also, there were no surprises as to which careers were selected, such as...becoming a librarian.

The central theme is that we judge people and their abilities (intelligence) based on the job they hold, and that in dismissing the job as unimportant we also dismiss the individual as unimportant. The thesis is important, but the book belabors the point and spends too much time covering points that otherwise could have been stipulated. The greatest problem with the book is the notes style that is used. It is worthless. The latest trend in publishing is to pull a phrase from the text, highlight it under a notes section at the end of the book, and then present a collection of endnote and bibliographic information. Not only is this format cluttered and unhelpful, but the pull quote is not numerically referenced within the text. This lack of direct reference makes the notes utterly useless.

That's due to the fact that Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker work together beautifully; Chan being the serious dedicated cop while Tucker is the maverick loner. Tucker's voice in itself is unique--whiny, high pitched and that in itself often makes his lines funny even if they're not. Oscar nominee Tom Wilkinson makes a cooly malevolent villain, and the movie moves at a frenetic pace with the expected well executed fight scenes. Elizabeth Pena makes a nice fall girl for Tucker's jokes and she's never looked lovelier either! But the movie is all Chan and Tucker, and being a box office smash, we got the inevitable sequel which I haven't seen yet, but hopefully it will be as mindlessly entertaining!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What huh yeah!","review":"This movie is so funny! i cracked up when i first saw the movie i like that song in the movie that says what huh yeah! what is it good for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Great!","review":"I love this movie.

Great Action scenes and a lot of laughs from Tucker (who definitely seems to be a cross between Eddie Murphy and Jaleel White - aka Steve Urkel).

It's also one of my favorite Jackie Chan movies. Let's face it: Jackie is the man. Without him, action movies [would not be the same]. It's thanks to his risky stunts and his goofy attitude that action films are where they are today. Now for Chris Tucker. Personally, I like him. I've seen him in other movies and I think he's funny. Other critics won't agree with me, but I think the guy is hilarious. In this film, the two play Carter (Tucker) and Lee (Chan), two cops on the search for a young girl named Sooyung (or something) who has been kidnapped and held for a ransom. We get the predictable buddy-cop movie cliches, but it's the humor and awesome stunts by Chan that makes this film a sheer delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie ever made!!!","review":"this is the best movie Chris Tucker and JAckie Chang make a great duo.

I didn't like the movie, I must have been out of my mind. It just proves that Hollywood is so out of imagination and ideas it has to recycle dated movie genres from years ago (the buddy cop flick) to make a few hundred million more dollars. And do you know what? We fall for it! This movie made a tonne of cash. God only knows why. Tucker is as irritating here as he was in Fifth Element, which was VERY irritating indeed. There is no real plot worth mentioning. The ending is the usual bad-guy's-suitcase-full-off-money-rains-down-on-hero junk too.Please save your money. Don't buy this and don't listen to the other reviews. I'm telling you the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Entertainment - Funny & Exciting.","review":"Rush Hour revitalized the buddy action flicks of the 80's and has become a modern classic. It is a movie in the tradition of 48 Hrs and Lethal Weapon, and like those two movies, it has perfect casting. Chris Tucker is hysterical in his best performance since Friday, Jackie Chan is in top form, complete with incredible stunts, cool martial arts and hilarious broken English.The story is well-written and full of funny situations for both Tucker and Chan. Look for the scenes where Chan is in a predominantly black pool hall and Tucker buys some Chinese food from a cart. The chemistry between the two leads is probably what makes this movie so great. Great individually, but even better together. All this makes Rush Hour a guaranteed good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate to admit it, but...","review":"I loved this movie. (Shhh! Don't tell my friends; they'll all laugh at me--and they do that enough with my musical tastes!) It wasn't meant to blow your mind, and make you leave the theater wondering about it. No, it's just 'mindless entertainment'...and pretty funny mindless entertainment, if you ask me. If you're looking for something with depth, go see AI. Chris Tucker has some of the funniest lines, the best being \\"Alright, which one of y'all kicked me?\\" I loved the credits, where they showed the bloopers...but I always get a kick out of those. I can't wait for the sequel. I'm hoping that, maybe, it will be one of those rare things like Jurassic Park, where the second is better then the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly funny - DVD awsome!","review":"That about says it all, I guess (although tastes differ).

I was filled with shock.Because this wasn't a plain Jackie Chan movie.This was an exciting, entertaining,and real funny movie.Jackie Chan was funny too,but Chris Tucker rocks!(With his bigest mouth in the West,Chris Tucker is always funny)And Jackie Chan,without using a stunt man and jumping off the ceiling?It was cool....So I think you should also have a cooool experince."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun ride","review":"Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are a good duo, and there's plenty of great comedy.

Action-packed yet funny at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make up your own ending","review":"I got interested in this movie and had to finish it. Good actors, good acting, good story and sympathetic characters. I had to finish this movie just to see these poor people rescued from that bone-chilling cold. And the daughter, sick, needing medical attention, \\"reading\\" from a diary she found.I wish someone could have warned me about the ending. So some people consider this \\"arty?\\" How someone could watch a movie like this over and over is beyond me but that is just my own opinion. If this film had an ending, a real ending, good or bad, I would give at least 4 stars. But I felt like I had been slapped in the face. Ha ha, the joke is on me.I hope to avoid films by this director in the future.

Don't waste your money or time."},{"rating":"2","title":"More great storytelling by John Sayles","review":"Sayles scores again with this substantial story about a woman who wanders from one man to another with her troubled daughter in tow, eventually ending up in Alaska among some questionable denizens. The first hour is spent establishing the setting and characters, whereas the last hour focuses more on the challenges facing the man, woman, and teenage girl as they becoming unwittingly caught up in a situation that could get them all killed.Beautiful scenery and great songs help to develop the film.Sayles has the courage not to spell out the ending or to feed us formula as so many other filmmakers would have. That makes this film a good choice for those who are tired of the same-old same-old."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOMETHING ELSE","review":"Limbo is a fascinating movie - no Hollywood stuff, but independent film-making of very high quality. Most of all I like the two main characters played by David Strathairn and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. The way they get to know each other is very tender, very convincing, and also funny at times. I particularly like the scene in the bar when she comes to his table after singing a song, and they start revealing little bits about themselves to each other - that's fascinating acting, and fascinating dialogue too.As for the much-disputed ending - oh well, I don't want to give away too much, but director/writer/editor John Sayles says in his DVD commentary (highly recommended) that it was the only ending that seemed appropriate to him, and maybe he's right..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quiet film that lingers in the heart.","review":"Not for everyone, this film. If you insist on tidy Hollywood-style endings, you should pass this one up. If, however, you enjoy a story that tells of the evolution of human relationships in extraordinary circumstances, and you're willing to reflect on a rather unconventional ending before passing judgement, give this one a try. The commentary by John Sayles seems refreshingly free of self-absorption, and only adds to the appreciation of his story-telling magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will blow your mind","review":"Attention reader: pay heed to what I say. LIMBO is, perhaps, one of the most well-done films of all time. It's a shame it was only in limited release, damn shame, because it's such a wonderful film. It encompasses every emotion one looks for in a movie, and the ending is not only unpredictable, but totally mind-blowing as well. Buy this film and cherish it always, because a movie this wonderful hardly ever comes along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, Great Score!","review":"I had very little expectations for this DVD, I just rented it because it seemed mildly interesting in the package. I was completely consumed by the story, performances, musical score, and even the vocal offerings of Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. She has a beautiful voice with a raw, unpolished quality that hits you right in the heart. As for the ending, listen to the commentary by John Sayles(a feature available on the DVD)and you'll realize it ended the only way it could. Anything else would have been a cheap commercialization of a story that meant so much more. If this flick leaves you disappointed, you didn't get it! By the way, I just ordered my own DVD, and the soundtrack CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BOTHER","review":"Read the other reviews, The movie doesn't end, it just leaves you hanging, What a waste of time"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope this movie stays in LIMBO a long time...","review":"Horrible motion picture.

As \\"deep\\" as some may think this movie was, does take make up for the fact that it is simply a bore. Through the whole movie you are waiting for something even slightly interesting to happen and it never does. How this movie ended, made absolutely no difference.

I wish I could get my rental $'s back."},{"rating":"1","title":"i wish i could give this movie one less star","review":"This was terrible. We watch a lot of movies and i have to say this gors down as one of the worst. It introduces to the viewer about 20 characters in the beginning - for no real reason - since only 3 of them end up being in the movie. The acting was fine - but the movie is dull, dull, dull.

I couldn't believe I sat and watched the whole thing just to be tricked with NO ENDING. Cheap Trick! The entire movie seems like some new kind of \\"fill-in-the-blanks\\" project, with a plot that goes absolutely nowhere.

When the movie finally ended, there there was the sound of a large group people groaning in unison coming from the viewers.There were many sub-plots that had absolutley nothing to do with the main plot in progress. They were never resolved. They could have been interesting if they were main plots themselves, but as it was, it just became some stuff that happened.The ending was similar to that of the famous \\"lady or the tiger\\" story. It built up an uncertainty about what was going to happen, and then left you right when it was going to be revealed.I didn't like it. But it was more than just that, it was the fact that there were many interesting plot points that had great potential that went absolutley nowhere. That is what made the movie bad.

Its so breathtakingly beautiful - it is very, very pretty without being fussy or effeminate.A thing to note though, another reviewer made a mention about the color & she is not wrong. The color of the product is actually closer to sage rather than the light dove grey depicted. I personally find the sage much more refreshing than grey, after all it is \\"Breath of Spring\\", so sage seems like a more appropriate color.I have not used it yet, but the fabric feels smooth & the quality of the embroidery is good - no loose stitches. I have looked at more than 200 duvets online and in-store before buying. My husband agrees the quality, & especially the look is definitely more than we expected for the price.We are very pleased we got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing, poor quality print. Look elsewhere!","review":"The print I received does not match the image shown -- which appears bright and clear. My print has a strong yellow cast, an overall muddiness and lack of contrast. Blacks aren't very black, white's aren't crisp whites. And there's an odd texture to the print that suggests this came out of someone's badly maintained inkjet printer.And, read the description carefully. The image shown is in a black frame -- but you'll only get the print and mat... no frame.

It allows you to program a nice range of channels, you can set 6 stations and it gives you 3 sets of 6 for FM for a total of 18 FM programming slots. You also get room to program 6 AM channels. This is a pretty baseline radio however, and doesn't have much more than a CD drive to speak of for additional features. It would be great if it had an aux in or something of the sort, however it does not. Overall it does get the job done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really???","review":"Funny this got nothing but good reviews. One of the worst movies i have seen in a while.

I saw other stoves that looked nicer, with fake bricks and bigger windows, but for the price and excellent reviews I choice this stove. They said that customer service was great and let me tell you they are. I called several times for stupid reasons and the staff was so nice and helpful(and spoke English which was great for me). The stove also comes with a instructional video, which was wonderful when my husband had to change the gaskets and do the yearly maintenance.

If you have any reservations of getting the Slider - GET IT! Money well spent and great for panel cuting and it is as smooth as can be! Dust collection works great and motor ripped through oak with no noticeable loss of power. The only reason this saw doesn't get a 5 from me is I was rather disappointed in the paint job.

Geez, they should include a bottle of touch up paint with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost worth every penny.","review":"I have been using the Super Saw for a month and love it.Setup was easy, but it does take some time to fine tune thesliding table. The saw is quiet, powerful and rock solid.More bang for the buck than the Dewalt. My only beef likemost people is the fence. I find it to straight and it doeslock securely, but the bubble has got to go. You spend moretime trying to adjust it than it's worth. I resort to usinga tape measure which I'm not to pleased with after spending (the money)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weekend woodworker","review":"It's a good saw but I have to wounder if Jet rushed this one out the door. I found the sliding table difficult to install and even harder to adjust. The fence does not stay accurate very long so I found myself using the tape to double check often. Something I was trying to avoid. It is a stable soild saw and the motor seems plenty powerful. With some modifitcations and a new fence this will be my saw for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engineer","review":"This is an excellent table saw. It took about 2 hours to assemble. If you buy this saw remember to buy a blade to go with your purchase, as one is not provided. The installation manual is rated a \\"C\\" in my estimation as the manual leaves you hanging in some areas as to when to tighten bolts on some assemblies. Once you set the saw up you will be pleased with the performance. I have no regrets in purchasing this table saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't my idea of quality","review":"I have read many of the other reviews, but I don't share their satisfaction. I bought the saw about a year ago, I use it weekly. The fence has not been as stable, straight, or consistant as I would have hoped. The table only has one slot, so my tenoning jig doesn't work properly. I agree the sliding table is very heavy, it is also difficult to align and mine is not very flat. The sliding table is not worth the extra money. I would put a few hundred extra into a cabinet saw and pass on this one in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Covey, don't buy this DVD","review":"I am a very big fan of Stephen Covey, his writings, and especially the 8th Habit. The book is excellent and I recommend it to anyone. The Live DVD is, I hope, Covey's worst live performance ever. He looked uncomfortable and nervous like he was struggling to remember his text, some of his slides were written incorrectly from the book version, his clip mike appeared to not be working so he was awkwardly grasping a hand held microphone that looked ridiculous, and the performance overall was poor. I was also surprised at what they chose to use as a quick 35 minute version of the lecture. It was not as coherent as it could have been. If you have ever seen Covey speak live or seen it on video, this is not the man you have seen before. I am still not sure what was wrong - off day, not comfortable presenting the new material, or if I am overly critical. It was a big surprise and a big disappointment. Buy the book, skip the DVD, and hope this was an anomaly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My husband, and now my son, are great fans of Stephen Covey. They each purchased his 8th Habit book and enjoyed it immensely. Some editions of this book were to have included a CD, and I thought I was purchasing that DVD (one for each of them) when I found it on Amazon. Most unfortunately, this DVD captured more of an outline of lessons during one of Mr. Covey's seminars. Instances already covered in the original book, and, worst of all it looks like it was an amateur video taken from some not-very-professional vantage point during one of his seminars. Hugely disappointed with the product for $29.95. The producers need to give an accurate description of this product and they should lower the price for such bad audio/video quality and sketchy coverage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought it was pretty good ...","review":"I'm not sure if Covey was off, or not, this DVD was my first introduction to his material. I thought there were several stories and concepts in here that were motivational/inspirational and that definitely moved me to think about what I was/am doing in my life. It seems this is an abridged version of the book, but the points are definitely made and definitely well taken. I especially liked the four assumptions for your mind, body heart and soul, and his telling of a story at sea, an allegory that appears in the naval manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"not made for large dogs","review":"This back pack definitely doesn't work for larger or stronger dogs.

I'm so glad this book published in paperback so it will be more affordable for others.... still expensive though :("},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing first introduction to Ed Abbey","review":"This was my first introduction to the well known author, Edward Abbey. My impression was that Abbey wrote with a strong environmental voice and was an advocate of wildlands. Instead, I read about a man who kicks animals that don't get out of his way, who drags trashed cars through the Australian outback, who tosses his empty wine bottles into remote canyons,and who expresses a superior attitude to just about everybody. His writing style is highly variable, ranging from sophomoric (usually) to pure Americana (very occasionally). When he hits the latter, he can rival Mark Twain, which is probably why he enjoys the reputation he does. However, this reputation obviously wasn't made with the essays contained in this anthology. Folks looking for an introduction to Abbey are advised to try another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Abbey","review":"This collection of previously published magazine articles is vintage Abbey, alternatively moving and funny, sacred and profane, flip and dead serious (well almost) and at all times entertaining. Divided into three categories - Travel, Polemics and Sermons, and Personal History - the subjects range from the Great Barrier Reef to technology to women to Winnebagos to hallucinogenic drugs - with many stops in between. The introduction, wherein Abbey comments on nature writing - and various nature writers - is itself worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"hillarious movie!!!!!","review":"i grew up when kiss ruled the world, this movie is funny how often do you see a priest high on mushrooms? shannon tweed is gorgeous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Material!","review":"I bought one these handgrips and it broke after only about 1 month of light use.

Why ? Because apparently there are a big deposit of bird and bat's droppings in the caves that can produce nitrogen. Off course, at the end, Lundgren ended up helping the local.The acting and direction is good, much better than Lundgren's later movies and you can see a glimpse of Charlotte Lewis's beautiful body. The DVD's picture quality is very good, bright and sharp. The jungle scenery presented beautifully on the DVD. I happened to watch this after Emerald Forest DVD and this one looks much better. I would have given it 5 stars if Disney bother to give 5.1 sound to it. But overall, a must buy of Dolph Lundgren fans or action fans in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title, excercise caution.","review":"The book title is misleading.

With this said, if you enjoy building one quarter scale \\"Jugs\\", you might rate this book higher that I did. The book outlines almost step by step building of all the currently popular 1/48 scale kits. There is little discussion of which kits are the best, but once chosen for the project the flaws of that kit are pointed out for correction. This includes sanding down the raised wing sections of the Academy 47D kit. I don't know about you, but my inclination is to start with a better kit. Yes, there are good model construction instructions to follow and learn from but you can get a lot of these ideas from other how to books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duets..","review":"If you liked Grivious Angel, you will love Duets by Ane Brun, She is beyond wonderful, and then some.

If you've never traveled that way...go! Mr. Duncan brought me back to my travels as a youngster with my family and reminded me of how much I enjoy going west with my husband and young daughter from our home in New Hampshire. He takes the road less traveled where it's not the destination but the getting there that counts! That's how we go, too. Mr. Duncan just gave me a few more travel tips that I'd forgotten about or never thought of. It's not just a story of his adventures following the Lewis and Clark Expedition trail...it's a travelogue about HOW to travel. It still holds true today...it's just more expensive now (gas, food, etc.). A worthwhile, easy, educational read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bland West","review":"Mr. Duncan sets out on a journey that registers on the odometer but fails to touch the raw nerve of the West.

God bless factories and tenderloin, we are supposed to cajole!

Fourth, There are no footnotes at all (not even translations when Locke cites non-english quotes). Fifth, there's no introduction. Sixth, there's almost no publishing information at all. Seventh, there are cheesy advertisements in the back.

But it is only too soon that Adam forgets where his house is, and has to rely on Eve, a beautiful but hurting young girl, to help him get home again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I very solid funny movie","review":"Perhaps some people didn't like this movie because of it's lack of naked people and dirty language. I found it refreshing and wholesome and I recommend it highly. Brandon Fraser is one of the best looking men in Hollywood and Alicia Silverstone is a very talented, beautiful woman. Cissy Spacek was great and I liked her out of her usual role and Christopher Walken was perfectly casted. I didn't find it one bit boring and although the ending was pretty predictable, it was still a very, very good movie. It's nice to see a movie today that proves you don't need to swear and show certain body parts to make a good movie. I give it a 5+ star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy Comedy","review":"Blast from the Past is a good comedy that the whole family can enjoy. It's true that Alicia Silverstone is lacking in the acting dept., but Brendan Fraser's talent more than makes up for it. The dance club skit was absolutely classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and Quirky Comedy","review":"We enjoyed this comedy immensely. I have not belly laughed so hard in a long time. And yet, there were a lot of subtle and important points made: the power of fear; the place of religion in our lives; the strength of a pure heart and the power of love. I had no idea that Sissy Spacek was such a great comedienne, and Christopher Walken is one of my all time favorites. Best of all is Brendan Fraser who was TOTALLY believable in his role. I highly recommend this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"Not Oscar material but still enjoyable.

Take a really inexpensive chance & spend a movie night watching this flick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Thoughts","review":"- Calvin Webber is on prepared guy.- I would go NUTS underground!! I think I would be a lot like Adam's mom.- This was a pretty funny movie. I laughed a lot.- I am not a Brendan Fraser fan. In fact, I usually shun movies he is in, but he was good in this one.- Growing up in Genola in my parents house, I kinda feel like Adam sometimes. For instance, Abbott and Costello are my favorite comedians!- I enjoyed Dave Foley's character. He plays a fun gay man. I want to be his friend.- This was a fun and cute movie. I enjoyed it, and I thought I wouldn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well thought out, quirky little movie!","review":"I love this movie! It has lots of fun little lines.. \\"Can he *skate* around your *block*?\\" I love it! Very fun, and that dance sequence was so cute! I looked at my boyfriend, and said 'We're going to learn to do that'. Dave Foley was great, and this is an inprovement for Alicia Silverstone acting-wise (not a huge one, but an improvement none the less)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best all-around family fun movies in years!","review":"My family and I went to see \\"Blast From The Past\\" 3 times while in theatrical release. It was funny, heartwarming and depicted good family values. I held Brendan Fraser's character of Adam up to my daughter as \\"the kind of guy her Dad and I would like to see her bring home\\". Fraser as Adam, Christopher Walken & Sissy Spacek as his parents and Dave Foley as his new found friend were all tremendous and very, very funny! Alicia Silverstone turned out a fine performance as well. There are scenes in \\"Blast From The Past\\" at which I laughed so hard I could hardly breathe. The moment I found it was out on DVD I raced to my favorite store, Amazon.com, to order our family copy. Hope we don't wear the DVD out!

Remember the fallout shelters?I first saw the video with a group of friends at one of their houses. We were all in that age group and laughed throughout the entire movie. Younger folks might find it a bit too corny - kind of a \\"had to be there\\". Wanted to share it with some other friends and my kids (in their 30's) but couldn't find it anywhere - even to rent. Thanks to Amazon I now own it. Great cast!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a movie that Blast it's way to the Past","review":"This is one of the worst movie I have seen.

Thirty five years later their son (Brendan Fraser)goes out into the REAL world and meets a very beautiful girl (Alicia Silverstone) and her gay friend Troy (Dave Foley). Some parts are funny, some parts lag. Christopher Walken and Dave Foley are what makes this movie very funny, especially Walken. I liked it alot but, hey, just not may favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Premise, But...","review":"Interesting concept, solid performances from Walken and Spacek, and a very funny cameo character in the form of a malt shop/bar owner turned mystic. But that's it. The main character's return to the service never delivers on the comedy and the complications one anticipates. And he and Silverstone never really click. Light, entertaining, will not offend, but doesn't live up to its potential. In addition, the first half-hour is somewhat adult, pleasantly so, while the rest of the film is somewhat juvenile, irritatingly so."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cute, feel-good comedy.","review":"Okay, maybe the idea is a little far fetched, but it's a comedy.

He's HOT!","review":"What a wonderful movie. As usual, all good ,movies end too soon. We need to see how they all handle the real world in the 90's together. A wedding, children. I loved the dancing and the way he fixed her hurt knee and the way he loved the rain and the sky. I am going to buy this one, as well as all of Brendan Fraisers other movies. Alicia could have had better lines, etc., she reminded me of her clueless character, ALOT of which I have that movie and watch it over and over, and I am sure she was meant to be older. Brendan needs another regular hunk role in the future. No nudity, no language just his sweet self."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely hysterical","review":"I've seen this at least 6 or 7 times now and find something new to laugh about everytime I see it.

When the movie first played here I was enchanted as it took me back to remembering what I faced as an American woman representing my company in a country that slightly resented Americans and woman with control. It was a joy to remember and to realize how Australia has changed--forfiting some of its uniqueness as it mirrors all the developed countries.

Beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please release this in UK format","review":"I have tried to buy this before in UK VHS or DVD but with no success.

The video is completely faithful to the book, and it is one that you never, ever, want to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Corner of WWII","review":"I bought this video a few years ago by a stroke of luck. I had not seen it or even heard of it, but just wanted something new. It turned out to be some of the best video dollars I have ever spent. I watch it yearly.Helen Morse' character, Jean, is a refreshing and welcome depiction of a strong woman. The first leg of this saga takes place in Malaya during WWII. Jean and a group of English women and children are forced by the Japanese army to walk for two years in search of a camp for women prisoners of war. The highlights of the movie are Jean's adaptability and the meeting of the English, Japanese and Malayan cultures.Once Jean arrives in Australia, the tone of the movie changes a bit more than it should. The pace becomes tedious. Each time I watch it I feel the time in Australia should be just as compelling as the time spent in Malaya. However, I do watch it, again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie of all time!","review":"Excellent adaptation of the wonderful Nevil Shute book.

All five hours of it. I was able to purchase a full length version on (one) VHS tape many years ago and put on white gloves about once a year to bring it out of storage and watch it. I am never disappointed, it gets better every time and I have shown this masterpiece to family and friends who now love it as much as I do. A very well done, gripping, human interest story of love and war made so real by the wonderful cast without a lot of gratuitous flash and whiz-bang. My VHS copy is still watchable, but my heart's desire is a remastered, full length DVD, with any extras (interviews etc.) that might be available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"A true romance of two strong people with different personalities and backgrounds, struggling through the tremendous hardships of war and captivity.

From the novel by Nevil Shute (remember On the Beach?), this story was suggested by a true occurance (in Indonesia I think) of a group of women and children who were prisioners of the Japanese during WWII. The brutal treatment they endured and what happened after the war is an amazing story of personal courage and character.The cast of Austrailan actors, mostly unknown in the US, is excellent and the story is compelling. Most people try to watch it in installments but get caught up and just keep going. It's too bad tha Bryan Brown didn't find an audience in the US; he is excellent. Helen Morse is lovely and strong.

I first saw it as a Masterpiece Theatre series back in 1981 and even years ago it wasn't easy to find a VHS copy. And now it is impossible to find it on DVD. Why is it that fine films like this don't make it to DVD? If you check out the list of choices for this film on Amazon you will see one that has no image and shows it as a DVD.

It arrived with the packaging open on the ends and the parts are in the box loose so they are scuffed from rattling around. The connector plate on one of the supports was bent so it took some muscle to bend it in place.

It makes sense after reading the book, but I doubt it'll be appealing to children. After a slow beginning, the story does pick up and I was eager to find out what happened to Misha. This is an emotional story, complete with all the terrible details of living in the Warsaw ghetto. But, by focusing on the events seen through Misha's eyes, the reader senses an innocence in Misha that is endearing. Knowing the realities of the Holocaust, I really didn't expect a happy ending, but it is a satisfying one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spinelli's best","review":"Milkweed is a rare find. It tells a heartbreaking story in a unique voice that is as appropriate for adults as it is for children. Spinelli's main character, Misha, is one of the most memorable I have encountered in young adult literature. The deceptively simple prose that Spinelli uses to describe the world of the Nazi-occupied Warsaw is right on target-- it makes the book believable and poetic.Although I felt that the book's ending was rushed, I think that this is the finest example of young adult historical fiction that I have ever encountered. Please read this book, and then pass it on to as many children and adults as you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I loved this book!!!! Jerry Spinelli should did her reserch!!! Her facts were spot on!!!! I loved how she showed the time of Hitler through a childs eyes. A child that didnt have parents or a family to protect and warn them about Jackboots. It is an amazing book and you should read it!! But before you read this book it would be a good idea to research a little bit about the Warsaw Ghetto."},{"rating":"2","title":"Milkweed from a teen's perspective","review":"This book deals with a boy who has to deal with the time and events of the Jewish past. The main character (Misha or Stopthief) has to learn what's really happening in the present time and how to survive it. The incidents of the past might confuse him on what was really happening and what's in the world. But luckily he doesn't have to do it on his own. Throughout his adventure he'll get help from his friends Uri and Janina.

They were in Warsaw, Germany during the Holocaust. Uri had made up the orphan's life and his name became Misha. He stole from the people walking down the street. Later all Jews and gypsies were sent to the ghetto.They lived in the ghetto for a while. Misha lived with Janina, who he called his sister. Each night they would sneak out a two-brick hole in the wall. When the trains started coming for the people Janina and Misha left. Janina didn't want to leave so she came back and was thrown into a train. Misha tryed to go after her, but Uri shot Misha and threw him out of the train. While walking along a farmer found him and misha worked for the farmer for three years. When he finally ran away from the farmer the war was over. Misha moved to America and got married. His name was also changed to Jack. His wife left him after she became pregnant. Jack later found his daughter and granddaughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 7th and 8th Grade Students Love This Book","review":"Have you ever read a book that just haunted your every thought? This is one of those books. This book absolutely should be read by students and adults alike. I am reading it to my 7th and 8th grade reading students. This book has sparked several meaningful discussions and has students asking for more about this time in history. I will pass this to my children's children, as I am sure this will become a classic.Don't pass this book up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile for kids and adults","review":"An interesting portrayal of the evolving response of one child to the Nazi program to exterminate Polish Jews, as well as his developing understanding of who he was as an individual within a community. While the transitions seemed to be a bit choppy at times, it reflected the inner and outer lives of the people involved. This book leaves enough space between the words and ideas to allow the reader to enter in a personal and imaginative manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"About the Holocaust","review":"For all you people saying that it's \\"so sad,\\" you should realize that it's meant to be like that. Which is one reason I like it so much. Unlike a lot of other books, this has a sad ending. It has more feeling then you can ever imagine, and I could even picture how the ghetto looked.If you love reading books about the Holocaust, give this book a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"telling it like it is","review":"I am a fan of Jerry Spinelli, but not of Milkweed. The book's sensitive subject matter of the holocaust does not make it exempt from criticism. The book seemed to be overly stylized, verging on pretentious. The ending of the book seemed downright lazy to me, and stuck out like a sore from the rest of the plot. To me, Spinelli's strength is his humor. While Milkweed is not entirely without humor, its excessive self-consciousness overshadows its merits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"I had to read this for a state-wide essay contest and I hated it.

This story about a young, slightly stupid, Jew is well written (even though it's in Dick and Jane style) and powerful. The main character, a boy called Misha, is niave to the destruction and persecution the Holocaust is causing, and doesn't even know his name. I think this story is like Aladin in some ways, because of the poverty and problems, and like the Diary of Anne Frank because of the horrible way they treat the Jews. I reccomend this novel to people who like a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I went to the National Book Fair yesterday, and bought this book. I even got it SIGNED by Jerry Spinelli! And let me tell you, it is GREAT!It's brilliant. This book is about the holocaust, but a different take. Most holocaust books are about the camps, this is about the ghettos. You learn about the horrors, and it truly makes you feel lucky to be born in the place and time you are.The plot is great, the way it's written is great....just amazing. If you loved Jerry Spinelli's other books, you'll love this too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Well Done!","review":"This is an awesome book that gives great insight to the Holocaust. It is from the perspective of a young orphaned boy growing up Warsaw, Poland. The story details what it is like for the boy, named Misha on the streets in Warsaw at the start of the war until the end. It was very sad and disheartening to read of the life Misha and others endured during this time period, however it was very eye opening and thought provoking. Jerry Spinelli did an exceptional job with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elizabeth","review":"This book is amazing!!! I LOVE IT sooooo much! Beautifullly writte.. totally worthyhe read.

Unlike his other, more fanciful novels, Milkweed seriously examines issues during the Holocaust through the eyes of a child. As a teacher, I would not recommend this book for students younger than high school for several reasons. First, it requires readers to have a significant amount of prior knowledge about the holocaust. Second, it is intense to read, with an ending that might be difficult to comprehend by less mature middle schoolers. Finally, it requires the reader to make quite a few inferences concerning difficult moral issues.More mature readers will gain new insights into a tragic period in human history. I definitely think this is one of the best books Spinelli has written--just not for kids. It is one of the few books for teens that I have read that I can honestly say has changed me. The ending, in particular, rings true to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Milkweed","review":"Milkweed is a book by Jerry Spinelli. You might not know Jerry Spinelli, but he is a realy good author. Milkweed is a book about the time when the Nazis are taking over. It is about a kid who lost his parents by the age of 3. The kid finds an older kid named Uri. Uri has no parents either. The kid lives with Uri under a barber shop. The kid finds out he is a gypsy instead of a Jew. The kid says he wants to be a Nazi when he grows up. BAD! Uri tries to tell him that he should not want to be a Nazi. The kid becomes a pro stealer. He can steal realy well. I know I am probably aggravating you with this kid stuff. Because I am not going to tell you his name. So read the book to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"This brought the spotlight out of my eyes","review":"I had to read it for a history project, but loved it.

Soon all the \\"jews\\" have to be put in the ghetto. Misha meets a girl there named Janina. Janina and Misha soon escape and go on the train. But Misha had a bad feeling and jumped off. The story the follows the rest of his life in the last two chapters.Overall, I loved it. I stayed up until 2:00 AM on a school night reading it. It has overt 45 chapters, but only 213 pages.

NO b-sides, bo mixes, no bonus tracks. Nada. First of all, what a waste of cardboard.

In general, there is very little operating information, but lots and lots of tear-apart instructions, something a new outboard owner would never attempt.A professional would want, I imagine, more detail. A recreational boater would want much more how-to-operate info.Not a great manual...the first pages are boringly general...do I really need info on checking a fiberglass hull in an outboard motor book?

Second downside alot of the best plants are refered to but information was in the previous book, which I was reluctant to get as we reside in Central Florida and it is for South Florida, so I did not expect many plants to be applicable in there for us. Ms Crawford mentions in the text she has a new book coming out which will cover the whole of Florida, which I have looked high and low for, however it appears not to be?

When you watch it though, you discover that the company recycles the same blurred out \\"artsy\\" video clips in every single video and throws in choppy simulations of silent films that, upon first glance, appear to be scenes from \\"Birth of a Nation.\\" They aren't. It is just as well that it's blurred because it covers up some of the defects of this low scale fiasco. The company is based in Eugene, Oregon, and it seems doubtful that they ever left that state even to take reenactment footage. A blurred out clip of Burnsides Bridge was used for both Manassas, Sharpsburg and Fredericksburg. I was expecting an in depth discussion of each battlefield with full colored realistic reenactment footage. If you are looking for quality and scholarship, you won't find it in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"A 4-DVD set for $9.98. Sounds like a bargain you say? NOT!

I've never been a big fan of hair-metal but this album really surprised me. Undoubtedly, anyone who really enjoys 80s hair-metal will probably hate it, but the whole point of the album was to be ironic. If you don't like it then that's fine; the guys who did this album are essentially just making fun of themselves. Any band that has a song called \\"Love On The Rocks With No Ice\\" can't be taken seriously.Despite that though, this album is definitely worth buying. Many of the songs are catchy and in particular, I Believe In A Thing Called Love has a really great sound. While the entire album isn't amazing, I think that as a debut it stands out and is worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I dont care what anyone says, The Darkness is not a joke.They are what rock is supposed to be.

I was expecting a Queen/AC-DC, ala Poison/Fasterpussycat sound.I didn't get what I was expecting. Though, the first chords of the first song rock, once the singer comes in, it's down hill. This dude's voice has potential, but he needs to know what his range is. His voice isn't meant to go as high as he tries to go. This band has potential, but their first effort isn't worth buying.

I'm not sure if it is supposed to be a joke (ala Spinal Tap) or these guys think they are actually making good music. To compare them to 70's rock music is inane. These guys sound like Saxon meets Poison meets Whitesnake. The heavy metal stars of the 80's have been long buried, let them rest in peace.If you want this kind of music, pick up something that actually came out in that era (1984-1990).

I have to admit, they have talent. They could go places. So why do I give this album only two stars? Easy:It's that [edit] lead singer.To front a good rock band, you need to have an at least halfway decent voice. But this guy sings higher and more theatrical than a c*strated understudy for Les Miserables. Next to him, Tiny Tim sounds like Phil Anselmo. Oy! It's a fantastic way to give yourself a migraine.Also, to the einstein who said \\"people who don't like the darkness are mad because they make fun of everyone else\\", umm, have you ever heard of THIS IS SPINAL TAP??

I hope their next album can keep this mini rock-revolution going. Album highlights are: \\"Get your Hands off my Woman\\", \\"Givin Up\\", & \\"Love on the Rocks With No Ice\\".

Other than two dudes having sex of course. I strongly believe that the song \\"Love is only a feeling\\" would be a HUGE hit if it were put out as a single. That to me is the stand out track on the album and I love all of the songs here. It's hard to say what the darkness could do for a follow up to this album without making sound exactly the same.

In other words, despite what all the navel-gazing, woe-is-me grunge and nu-metal bands would have you believe, rock is supposed to be Big Dumb Fun. The Darkness understand that.

First, you have to get used to Justin Hawkins singing which can go from a normal decent rock voice one second to sounding like he's just lopped off his babymaker with a knife the next second. On first listen I didn't think I would get used to it, but I did and now it doesn't bother me. Second, you have to like 70's hard rock bands like Aerosmith, AC/DC, Foghat, KISS, Cheap Trick, etc., because that's the style of music The Darkness play. I grew up on these bands so was thrilled to hear some good melodic guitar riffs and solos. Third, lighten up. These are not songs with messages. They are 3 or 4 minutes of loud guitar, overblown rock n' roll vocals and cheesy lyrics probably written while drunk. The Darkness are not a great band but they wrote some fun songs to listen to that will get your head bobbing and feet tapping."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Darkness is here to stay!","review":"I bought this album a while back ago, and have been listening to it ever since!!!

This is NOT heavy metal. Solos do not MAKE heavy metal. Cheesy vocals do NOT make heavy metal. Hair does NOT make heavy metal. Or metal. This is \\"heavy metal\\" for those who live by the radio. If this is one of the only bands that you know of that uses solos, you can not pass judgment on what metal is! Not all or even most or even a third of real metal and heavy metal is about hating or violence. Iron Maiden recently released an album. Hello?"},{"rating":"1","title":"THEY NEEDED A ROCK SINGER","review":"The singer for this band should have been in opera, and the band should have opened up their eyes and saw that fact for themselves. This band does rock and with a good rock and roll singer they could have been more note worthy, no pun intended. Ok some people dig it, but the opereta voice is too much for me. Maybe thats why they are noted for being a one hit wonder band, and made fun of in spite of it. There are a couple of songs on this one where the singer does stay in the lower register and sounds completely different and they are probably the best of the cd. If you enjoy it good for you , I bought it for 0.92 cents just to check it out and totaly rest on my review of it here. I grimiced thru the vocals just to enjoy the good rock music. But I gave it a fair shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Trash Deserves NO STARS","review":"What a piece of junk. The Darkness claims that they're going to save rock. It's big talk with little show; it's big ambition with little talent. If I could get past Justin's \\"singing\\" voice, would I actually like the cd? No. I wonder if his vocal antics weren't merely an attempt to divert criticism from the rest of the band.They claim that they model themselves after the classic rock acts of the 70s and 80s. I shouldn't point out that 70s rock was, generally speaking, far superior to the hair metal junk that came out in the 80s. 70s rock is classic rock. 80s rock is hair metal. That's an important fact that they should get straight. If they really think that they can save such a diverse genre of music, then they are using arrogance as a wall behind which to hide their obvious lack of talent.It's laughable when ridiculous jokes market themselves as rock icons, rehashing things that have been done before and long since forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"The real growing darkness is a hair metal comeback","review":"Commercial retro garbage from a flash-in-the-pan set of musicians who formed the band at a KAROKE SESSION when the lead singer capably sung a Queen number. These guys are like the retro Monkees, the music is so predictable and derivative that it's already trite, and the ideals of the music they espouse are so culturally backward that it's almost offensive that they're presuming to reintroduce them to the public. Go buy a reissued G n' R CD, or look up Judas Priest, or pop in your old Queen cassette, but avoid these guys like the plague.The two stars are for their capable musicianship, or should I say adept aping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Queen Pisstake? Most definitately!","review":"I largely agree with Nick. These Darkness dudes should really stop taking the piss. Queen were a fine band in their time and it's sad to see such irreverance shown by this new batch of rockers! \\"Permission to Land\\" is not grossly bad (by today's standards) but the boys need to invent a style of their own to stop being compared (and found lacking) with their elders and betters! That aside, 8 tracks of Justin vocals back to back is just a bit too much to take in one sitting to be honest. It would've been interesting to intersperse the album with the other guys taking turns at vocals to relieve the monotany. I hope for their own sakes they can be more inventive with their next effort - or the Darkness are doomed! Nice one Nick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i think its awesome","review":"ridiculous, gutsy, fun, driven, the kind of music that actually makes it happen.These guys clearly know what fun is about and they truly rock.I totally agree with the anti-linkin park, post-nirvana-ish critics which say that we've had enough of that pointlessly tiring and completely unfresh \\"suicidal- I hate myself\\" crap which we've heard since Kurt Cobain died. Its time for a change dammit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Metal MTV would never play","review":"this album was amazing in every way Robert Plant's vocals are way better than when he was back in zeppelin there's blazing fast guitar solos by glen tipton and kk downing well constructed in the fact that it's musical arrangements contained not only some of metal's greatest performers but also fun loving music with humour in it. the drum work is especially very active with thunderous double pedal (blast beats) and overall this album excells in speed faster and better arranged than any black metal band i've ever heard so buy this album"},{"rating":"2","title":"You're wrong neil!","review":"it's the sound and structure of the songs that make this a real rock and roll band.They got good lyrics and hard riffs and a lot of attitude!That is why they rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Album as a whole pretty much sucks","review":"I really only bought this cd because of the big hit \\"I believe in a thing called love\\". I really loved their silly video for that song. Lighten up people, they are just lampooning cheesey videos of the past. I rushed out and bought the cd not long after the video came out, but I really only like the hit \\"I believe in a thing called love\\". The rest of the album is pretty poor in my opinion.One thing I haven't heard your reviewers say is anything about the crappy sound quality. It just sounds really distorted in my opinion. If they could try doing a good remastering job on it that would be great. So this gets a two star because of that one song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aside from A Thing Called Love, this album is poor","review":"When I first heard A Thing Called Love I got very excited, like a combo of Sweet and Queen, how could you go wrong.

Buy the single, save yourself the pain of this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't work","review":"I bought this album last year and at first I didn't think itwas that bad. However, after repeated listens the lead singerjust grinds and your nerves! Some of the songs such as thehit single \\"I Believe In A Thing Called Love\\" along with othertracks like Love Is Only A Feeling and Growing Up are goodenough to survive the vocals...The problem is the rest of the album is filled with good guitarwork with annoying vocals.

On the other hand, I absolutely love Spinal Tap (despite all their deliberate lyrical silliness, they put out some excellent music), thus my dilemma...Suffice it to say that if you're looking for a band whose main vocal influence appears to be the lead singer from the 1970s glam-rock act Sweet (on helium), mixed with Guns 'n' Roses riffs as played by Bowie's Spiders From Mars, this is the band for you. Quite enjoyable if you don't expect great art, or originality, and infinitely preferable over other \\"retro\\" sounding acts (The Strokes, White Stripes, et al) in that they can actually play their instruments competently. Worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all!!","review":"Contrary to those disappointed by a hard rock sound that isn't authentic, this is actually a very good collection of solid rock tracks. If you like The Cure, Queen or Euro-rock, you'll be playing this album for a long time to come.Highlights are definitely \\"I believe in a thing called love\\", \\"Black Shuck\\", \\"Stuck in a Rut\\" and \\"Friday Night\\" (best song on this album!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Infectious, gripping, homage to the 70's and 80's!!","review":"IT must hav been a British band to accomplish all that!

If you want angst, anger and self doubt BS...keep on shopping.Lets face it, music today has gone to hell in a hand bag and I for one am glad a band has the cajones to stand up and fight against the \\"NORM\\". Being a guitarist myself I appreciate good leads and fun riffs.

The solos are so cool cuz in each song they have liek 2 or 3 solos. So what if they sound like queen, or \\"something i've heard before\\" you try coming out with something original.

There is a reason why over the top boring guitar solos are a thing of the past.

I am 42 and I hated these stupid apects of rock then and I hate them now. If you want something worthwhile go with Rocket From The Crypt, Lazy Cowgirls.

I didn't actually buy the CD, I downloaded it, just kidding, I heard it from a friend who bought \\"The Darkness.\\" The lyrics are cheesy, but some of the guitar leads are alright. No Hendrix, or Kirk. If you are wearing a shirt that reads \\"Journey\\" this album might be for you, otherwise, stay away. This album is in no way creative, it panders to our nostalgic days of old, you know that time duing the 80's when most rock sucked, you know the leather pants, the Poison, the REO Speedwagon, and all that other crap we've come to forget (for good reason).

If you are too young to remember at least the early 90's, and if you are looking for a reason to stop pretending that the White Stripes, the Hives, At the Drive-In and ALL HIP-HOPsters make good music, you now have it. The Darkness is what rock was and is all about. Aside from some of the fashion felonies committed by hair metal back in the 80's, the music was not only awesome, it was real. The Darkness have landed their time machine and bring an album chock full of guitar hits reminiscent of that music from the 80's. Their music is rockin, and they can actually play their instruments. A perfect blend of AC/DC and Queen, You will like them or love them. Listen to the reason why all 19 of there American shows sold out in minutes on one album, a Christmas single, and little to no marketing.

This is NOT a recreation of what was once good, this is a sick joke. The lead singer has the most annoyingly fake voice you could ever imagine.

But instead of paying homage to bands like Queen, AC/DC, and Van Halen, they simply rip off all their music, like most \\"fresh, new bands\\" do. Only this band does it in what seems like the campiest way possible. Playing music like those bands did is one thing, but having your hair like them, dressing like them, and acting like them? I wonder if they're at home laughing about how people actually bought their CD. This stuff was good the first time, but we don't need to hear it again.

How can it be so? I ask myself daily this very question.

God just knew in advance that people would fall for this marketing scheme, and many sure did. To all who still are able to do so, please pray for the kittens. Maybe those kittens were lucky.. I mean they don't have to put up with this garbage.I wonder where the idea originated that there should've been a band that will completely mock the bands that made it possible for people with no talent to sell garbage to the masses?

If I want to listen to Cheap Trick, AC/DC, Whitesnake, Ozzy, etc., I'll spin THOSE albums. The problem today is that consumers cannot bear to listen to albums repeatedly, so they search for replication of the things they're used to. Therefore, derivation takes over and bands like The Darkness gain fame. Ick. Folks, just purchase the old stuff--the classic stuff--you will never go wrong. Moreover, listen to it until you know the music inside-out, to where you can anticipate each note, each lyrical inflection. Just say no to the junk that clutters the racks and hopefully the music industry will get a clue. We'll still find the bands like Nirvana but in the meantime we can avoid garbage like The Darkness.

Its doubtful that they will enjoy a sophomore success. It didn't take long for people to realize that their novelty wears thin, and is not nearly as much fun as Spinal Tap. Even their bass player realized this, and made a wise decision to ditch this glorified cover band.I really have to laugh at the 5 star reviews from 40-50 something farts who are waxing nostalgic for the 80's and are still pissed at grunge for wiping hair metal off the face of the earth. Sorry guys, you had your day. This band isn't going anywhere. and they are certainly not going to reawaken one of the most godawful genres of music in rock history.If you want a current band that plays real and honest rock n' roll without sounding contrived, then check out Queens of the Stone Age or Clutch. If you want the real deal, check out Zeppelin, Sabbath, Cream, Hendrix, the Stooges and Blue Cheer.

The worst feature is the vocalist who seems to be mocking high pitched singers and if that's his best attempt in singing I rather hear a dog bark. their recent single is quite annoying to hear on the radio, this album is full of chaos without organization and therefore it has no harmony...in my opinion.

Now go listen to your Darkness cd because in 2 years tops, it's going to be in the back of your closet, gathering dust. And you will be ashamed you own it. For all of you thinking of buying this cd, Don't. Simple as that."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is funny. but we'll leave it at that.","review":"This joke was already made by the man who made This is Spinaltap. And so i recommend it instead of this, because it is funnier. As for actual musical quality, this is just bad. Some bands can have annoyingly high pitched vocalists and still be good, this band is just not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"return of classic rock","review":"this great group has come as a breath of fresh air in today's musical world and is hopefully the resurgence of classic rock music.this album is great and is among my best cd's ever.i give this my highest recommendations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Permission To Land?...............Sure!","review":"The Darkness may be wacky and at times horribly explicit however they make great music and this album surely packs a punch.Now personally I'm not that much of a glam-70's rock fan however this album has fulfilled most of my expectations in what an album should have. The only real problem is the obscenity of the lyrics and at times they sort of detract from the actual content.The guitars here are amazing they seem to soar and then drop and go all over the place with no trouble at all. All of the songs here stick in your mind for a long time. Songs such as \\"Black Shuck\\" are classic anthems that are just cool.Justin Hawkins has the most amazing voice and how can he get that high, his range is amazing. He sounds pure glam-rock.So with this album The Darkness have surely landed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica V. Diamond Head","review":"I really like this CD, it is a great debut album. I can only look forward to their future, less-raw albums.As for people claiming these bands are \\"ripping off\\" classic artists, I'm curious to what they think of Metallica's debut album, \\"Kill 'Em All\\". I'd challenge those people to listen to that album and then listen to anything by Diamond Head (preferrably their greatest hits CD). Is that Metallica ripping them off? Hardly - it's called influence. And Metallica grew into their own sound, just as I believe The Darkness will.This is a great debut CD - and it proves that rock isn't dead, it's only been sleeping for a decade and a half."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRAGIC","review":"This album is full of stale tired worn out riffs that have been done to death. The only originality is that Justin occasionally lapses into a shrieking holler that sounds as if he's caught his balls in his zipper. That alone is worth five stars for its hilarity! Being serious here though. This album is a sad reflection of the state that British rock music is in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Fun Rock-N-Roll, but that voice?","review":"The music is great - upbeat, fun, catchy - but I just can't get past the vocals. The Darkness' music is a refreshing break from the angry rock ruling the radios lately. The angry rock, of course, was a natural progression from the depression rock that killed the hair bands in the early 90's. Anyway, I was so taken with the tunes I thought I could get past the weird vocals, but I can't. The guy is fine until he breaks into what I can only describe as a yodel - sounds at first almost like the squeal of a hair band scream, but there's definitely a yodel going on. But if you like rock, and you have an open mind to odd vocals, you'll probably just love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I believe I'm in love!","review":"Okay, I know this band isn't going to be everybody's cup of tea. But if you love Rock from the '70s and '80s you have got to give this band a try, even if you don't they're still worth a listen. I wasn't too sure about them when I bought this cd, but here I am just a few days later and it hasn't left my cd player!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thin Lizzy meets Freddie...","review":"If Freddie Mercury or Phil Lynott were looking down to Earth, they'd like The Darkness. Good songs, outrageous vocals and Lizzy style guitars everywhere, but it works. Good rock album appealing to people who weren't born when \\"Jailbreak\\" or \\"Night at the Opera\\" were released.A worthy record which may ignite young fans for hard rock which hasn't been around since the seventies, delivered with obvious enthusiasm and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah","review":"OK. I really want their cd now. Guys singing in falsetto... only the bravest. The people that make fun of him are only jealous that they can't sing that high. he's like the \\"artist formally known as Prince\\" of todays' generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A RETURN TO THE GLORY DAYS OF QUEEN","review":"This retro band combines elements of Queen, Van Halen and AC/DC, just to name a few, and comes out sounding pretty solid. They probably will not click with today's rap-obsessed kids, but they sounded great to this old man of 54. Several very good cuts, most of the screaming-love variety, with some sassy language thrown in for good measure, and terrific guitar riffs. A clunker or two arises in this 10-song bunch, but when Justin Hawkins gets roaring and his brother lays down those Queen-ish guitar lines, they are hard to resist. Recommended to those who miss the 70s and early 80s."},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Anger's Actually Better Than This CRAP!!!","review":"Oh boy, I thought \\"St. Anger\\" (Metallica) was the most unorganized, poorly arranged and produced material ever, ... until I heard the Darkness. This CD is so bad, I pawned it off in 24 hours! Justin Hawkin's nauseating vocals, along with piss-poor musicianship, ... it's actually scary to believe that Avril Lavigne or Nickelback are WAY better than these guys! To think that this made the top 10! And this is comparable to AC/DC and Queen? Gees, this sounds more like a bad Sloan record!Justin Hawkins has my permission to land, ... in volvanoes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Comedy Album of the Year","review":"You have got to be joking, this album is the funniest thing I've heard in years, I played it a work the other day and we were all almost wetting ourselves from laughing so hard. This band seriously needs a new singer and some original ideas, Almost every song on the album is a rip-off of bands from the 1980's, such as AC-DC, Queen, Motley Crue, Van Halen etc etc.Anyway, if you want to have a really good laugh, then go and buy this CD an after you've played it a few times, put it where it belongs, in........The Darkness, at the bottom of your rubbish bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy","review":"The Darkness, i thought cheesy, bland, watered down, hair metal died in the early 90's? This is not fun. This is torture. Don't ever compare Queen and AC/DC with these bums. A much better comparison would be with disposable fluff rockers Poison and Warrant. All of you who are supporting this band because you're sick of the nu-metal sewage that gets played on radio, do me a favor and TURN OFF THE RADIO! It's that simple. Don't support crap because you're sick of other crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst CD ever?","review":"I just listened to the song samples on Amazon and I must say it is some of the worst cr*p I ever heard. First of all, to the reviewer below, NEVER mention AC/DC and this group in the same sentence again...ever. That is blasphemy. Second, the singer sounds like Smurfette after sucking a helium balloon and getting his n*ts caught in a vise. Third, for those of you trying to pass this off as a parody, as in \\"It's supposed to be bad, ha ha, don't you get it?\\", you're not fooling anyone. Spinal Tap is an obvious parody. This is an obvious pile of horse manure."},{"rating":"1","title":"We live in a land of sheep","review":"I can't believe people are being suckerd into buying this waste of plastic. I only played the sample bytes but it is clear what I hear. BAD!! 80's glam rock. This style was awfull in the 80's,I don't need to hear it again! And certainly not a bad version. As for those saying I don't get the joke, it's not funny. The first rule of satire or cheesy mockery is some level of intellect and talent. (even some wit wound't hurt) But none is found here. The lyrics are juvenile, the music is flat and the singing is non-existent. If you buy this disc you're the but of the joke, Barnum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Crap!!!!!!!","review":"I just saw \\"I Believe In A Thing Called Love This\\" on VH1 and i have to say it is, by far the worst song/video that i have ever seen before. The only reason I finished watchhing it was to find out the name of the band. I thought that VH1 must have been playing a flash back from the 80's. How did this crap make it on the air???? DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THE VIDEO, I FEEL DUMMER HAVING DOING SO.just thought I'd warn everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"OK, maybe i've listened to too many death-metal and prog bands, but let me tell you this:This is crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Limp Bizkit, but not better than real metal!","review":"The compare this band to Queen or Mercyful Fate for vocal or musical style is really bogus. I give them two stars and not zero only because they came out different which counts for something. They could have easily just been another meat-head group like Disturbed or System of a Down but chose to try and bring back metal. Keep in mind I said try! They are not the worst I've heard but far from the best, I really hate that cheasy/corny L.A. style of metal! If this is what \\"metal\\" is coming to then I'll just strictly listen to the classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider This...","review":"Without The Darkness the music scene would not be in the right place for Velvet Revolver.

Besides those songs, there was only one other song that I thought was OKAY and that is \\"Friday Night\\". Other than that, theres some really really crappy songs. \\"Get Your Hands Off My Woman\\" is possibly the worst song I've ever heard. The vocals are horrible, the music isn't amazing, and the lyrics are completely brainless and pointless.

The only song i like is I believe in a thing called love. All the rest make me cringe. I bought this CD for my dad for christmas. At first, he listened to it all the time, but then he realized that mostly all the songs had the F word in it and he's basically stopped listening to the album. We are christians, but we don't always listen to Christian music. Can't they express their feelings without using the F word?

Not!!Garbage lyrics, when you can make them out among the swearing (God, what a rebel!). Junk, trash, bile.

I don't even have a probelm with guys that have high vocal ranges. That actually takes talent. But this band is god awful. How could this be compared to the classic bands like Van Halen and AC/DC? Not to mention the lead singer can't even sing that high. He uses some crappy machine because he has no vocal talent. Even though they are really popular over in England nobody will give a [damm] about them in a couple years. You want a good under rated hair metal band? Check out Steelheart. The singer can sing really high but doesn't use a machine, has talent, and doesn't sound like a complete faggot. Hey, The Darkness. If your reading this i havea tip for you.

The Darkness brings a whole new demension to the modern music scene with superb guitar solo's and their unorthodoxed approach, in short, they rock! literallyI myself am into older classic rock and havent touched a band any more modern than U2, and now i have, britian once again shows they know how to put out bands that do rock justice, the Darkness brings a late 70's early 80's feel to their music and style, especially in their videos, dawning steven tyler-like outfits, its nice to actually hear a song that has a real guitar solo and arent complaining about how sad they are *cough pop-punk cough* seriously, buy this album, they'll grow on"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to like this band but...","review":"I just can't accept The Darkness. All their songs have that really annoying 'I've heard this before' feeling attatched to it. All my friends love this band but the singers whiny, out of key voice cuts through me and when ever it's on the radio I have to turn it off. This is the kind of music which can be described as 'rock music - but not really' and it only encourages pre-teen girls to think that they are real rock chicks when they listen to it. Why not try some great bands like KoRn, Queens Of The Stone Age and Disturbed?"},{"rating":"1","title":"How did these guys ever get produced","review":"Yet another fad band that will be around for no more than 6 months.

The whole time I was listening to this cd I was kind of confused, and then my friend looks over to me and says \\"Who lets this guy butcher their songs?

The vocals range from homage to incredibly slappy and not to mention the most insipid lyrics ever written. But that's the point. It's a hoot to the X-geners who grew up with a Bad Company or a marijuana leaf belt buckle. You don't know if they're taking the glam/hair band thing to an ironic point.

Granted, they are talented musicians, but they lack a real cutting edge. Their songs are hollow: peal off the flashy, shrill skin and there's nothing inside!And to all the people who go on about how great the lead singer's voice is... there's more to being a rock singer than just range! High range vocals are fine in the right circumstances, but they need edge and attitude. This guy sounds like a neutered cabaret singer!

Do the repair when the header is at ambient temp, you don't need to run the engine to heat it up as suggested on some blogs.

It's virtually inaccesible, even with the special hex wrench Jet gives you (lose that puppy and you're SOL). The guide wheels secure with thumbscrews that an average hand can't reach without mangling your flesh, and there's so little room you can't wear gloves. The guide base flops all around and is hard to see and almost impossible to align properly.

I wanted Flynn to stop with the ultimatiums and expecting everything to be HIS way. His last temper tantrum just disappeared the moment the heroine relented and decided to stay in town.

The props are absolutely perfect in authenticity. What sinks the film is the screenplay, Downey's one-dimentional depiction of Chaplin, and a director too clueless to notice what these were doing to his picture. According to his leading ladies, Chaplin was only depressed and brooding when he was creatively blocked. In Chaplin he is depicted as always depressed. There isn't one montage to show him as the directorial dirvige he was described as being by those who knew him. Instead of directing Downey out of this emotional rut, he plods along through Chaplin's life like a man walking from fencepost to fencepost.

Chaplin had one heck of a complicated, long life with many severe ups and downs! Fortunately for us, they got some of these important factors right. The film runs well over two hours, but I never felt truly satisfied with the detail of many scenes. The biggest flaw is that some areas of his life are whisked by so fast it's hard to grasp everything.Robert Downey Jr. should get a lot of credit as without his believable portrayal of this man, the movie could never work at all.
