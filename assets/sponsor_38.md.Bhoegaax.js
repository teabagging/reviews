But, the Black Box caught 2 of my problem gophers (they were killing our trees) in 3 settings. And I didn't have to try to fool the trap shy beasts. The Black Box gopher trap is a fantastic tool for getting rid og gophers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gopher Coffin","review":"These traps are the best. I used to have a wooden one but kept losing the trigger wire. When I did use it I used it in combination with one of the little metal spring traps (putting one each direction in the runway). This was a successful means of killing gophers until one day the metal trap disappeared into the ground and I never have found it. I even had it tethered to a stake. This was one tough gopher. The nice thing about the box trap is that it stops them cold and they don't move after it is triggered. They are toast.I purchased two of these Victor 0625 Blackbox Gopher Traps. They are very durable, made of very heavy, dense plastic plastic. I put one in each direction in the runway and catch them every time.This is a very effective gopher trap and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"My boyfriend set up the traps in the backyard, two traps back to back (like the box recommends), and we caught one 3 hours later.

The \\"little brains\\" are very funny to him and keep him interested. This book wasn't written for adults...so maybe we don't see what our children are getting out of this book. Last night, my son made a random comment, and I was able to say \\"don't you remember that all brains are different?\\" He understood that...and he has no idea that this is a book targeted to children with ADHD...even when I read the parents comments at the end of the book!

Any release of Al & Co (no matter if it's Ministry or any side project) has very good start, interesting middle and bad finish, it seems Jourgensen gets tired by himself and after good produced first 4-5 songs places some not finished (for my taste) tracks. As for style, this album matches good a term \\"industrial dance\\" and i think it has influenced bundles of artists in early 90's.

I had 2 concerns with the build quality of the sleigh, 1st the side rails were not mounted securely and were prone to wobbling which did not instill confidence in their safety factor. Secondly was with the mounting set-up for the runners of the sleigh, the surface that the runers mounted too was almost twice as wide as the actual runners themselves which caused the snow to build up under the sleigh creating a fair amount of drag, which could cause the sleigh to become unstable and tip over. I have since returned the sleigh and am currently looking for another that is built better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Flyer sled","review":"I bought this for a birthday gift for a one year old.

The \\"cozy factor\\" can't be emphasized enough--this thing really feels great against the skin and makes sliding in or underneath very enjoyable and welcoming. This bag stays warm and dry even when it's raining or damp. It rolls up to a small size easily and has an attached elastic band to secure the roll. The Ziplow zipper works great, with no snagging. 5 stars, for real."},{"rating":"1","title":"kids didn't like it","review":"I got this for my kids and me but it was so boring and not worth the money.

The songs on the album sound very dated (it's that early 90's dance/rap sound) and I guarantee you will be laughing hard when you hear Carmen's \\"singing\\" and rapping. All of the tracks are repetitive and if you don't listen closely you won't know when one song ended and when the next started. The only OK track is \\"Go-Go Dancer\\", but it's still a joke- a troop of background singers have to do all the singing (since Carmen's singing sounds more like talking) while Carmen raps in her thin little girl voice. It's hilarious hearing sweet little Carmen trying to sound tough and cool!!!If you want a good laugh, buy the album. Otherwise, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Veeck - Still a man for any season","review":"I was always a fan of Bill Veeck's, and was able to take advantage of his open door policy to all fans on several occasions.

Fine, fine writing. My only criticism is the fact that he uses a lot of full sentences of SPanish without translating them. For those who don't read Spanish, it would be tough! As the first reviewer said, he is a good replacement for L'Amour, only better. Another great read is ANYTHING by Kirby Jonas, whom critics call the New Louis L'AMour. If you haven't had the pleasure of reading his stuff, pick some up. He's another L'Amour/Kelton, and a surefire winner. Kelton and Jonas ought to make a great combination together, Kelton writing about Texas and Jonas writing about everywhere else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelton's Popularity Demands Reprints of Old Stories","review":"\\"Bitter Trail\\" is well researched in true Kelton fashion. Historical fiction at its best. Kelton's day job as writer for the Cattleman's Weekly sustained him long enoughto become the best Western Author of this decade. A true replacement for the voidleft with Louis L'Amour's death. The storyline is a page out of history, but BitterTrail contains believeable characters and TEXAS PRIDE."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Life Can Do to a Man","review":"Bitter Trail is not your typical western, but the lead character is. Frio Wheeler--no relation that I know of, except I've been told there were some Wheelers who went to Texas early on--but Frio is one of those strong individuals who after his freight wagons were attacked, his load of cotton burnt, his mules driven off, gets more wagons, more mules, and more cotton to haul. Even when he is captured and tortured in attempt to force him to quit hauling cotton he manages to escape and keeps his wagons moving. This is a story of how the Civil War affected people in Texas; it was a severely divided state. Elmer Kelton always does an excellent job incorporating history into his books. An exceptional read I think anyone would enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same","review":"I totally agree with the other review.

The mixture of romance, comedy, and realism makes for a good read for cuddling up by the fireplace on a snowy eve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, I have to agree with the Washington reader","review":"Compared to Outcast, this really was a terribly written book. It felt like the author rushed to get something on paper -- forgetting that he had to write a story with some relevence. It had very little depth and situations that I've read a hundred times -- only much better.There are a lot of truly insightful and beautifully written gay novels out there (The World of Normal Boys comes to mind). Unfortunately, this one is really a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"While Outcast was both charming and entertaining, this follow up seems to have been written by a 12 year old.

I couldn't put it down. I liked how Charrette picked his characters; taking the mysterious Wolf's dragoons and the Bushido bound Minubo Testuara and created this plot of friends torn apart by the hatred the Draconis Combine has for Jamie Wolf and his mercenaries. Really a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Testing Wolf's Dragoons","review":"This book, which is probably one of the best Battletech novels out there, gives us a look at how House Kurita and Wolf's Dragoons became enemies. Minobu Tetsuhara is the Combine's liason officer with the Dragoons after House Kurita hires the vaunted mercenaries. Tetsuhara must learn from the Dragoons as the Coordinator of the Draconis Combine, Takashi Kurita, orders him to create a unit that mimics the Dragoons' style. Events come to a head when the Coordinator arranges to keep the Dragoons contract and Tetsuhara must choose between facing off with the Dragoons or dishonoring himself as a samurai of the Draconis Combine. Set before the coming of the Clans and the just-finished FedCom civil war, this is Battletech still at its best (before major word limits cut out the legs of many novels). Highly enjoyable, especially if you read the Warrior Trilogy, Blood of Kerensky Trilogy, Heir to the Dragon, and Wolf Pack, a sequel to this novel also by Mr. Charrette."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book but the typos are driving me nut","review":"I was very happy to see that some of the classic battletech novels are now available for the kindle but there are at least one word per page that is hyphenated and sometimes many words. It really detracts from the enjoyment of the story. I just finished the Warrior trilogy by Stackpole which didn't have this problem. I would recommend not purchasing this until they re-edit the novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for all skill levels","review":"This book is just as useful for seasoned birders as it is for the beginner, or the person new to New Jersey. Beginners will appreciate its review of New Jersey's best birding destinations; seasoned pros will enjoy the depth of the information and the amount of detail on nesting species and accounts of rarities.For us locals, \\"Bird Finding\\" is great for those days when you want to hop in the car and travel to somewhere a little different, or if you want to explore a familiar destination a little more closely. The book offers detailed directions (although some of the exit numbers and streets have changed since its publication date), including which trail to follow, which tree to investigate, etc. Its accuracy is remarkable. It's clear Bill Boyle knows each location intimately and visits them often.This is a must-have for any birder living in the state (and there are lots), and any vacationer planning to spend more than a weekend in New Jersey."},{"rating":"1","title":"birding book","review":"This product appears as a book about birds.

I was also shopping for a WEGA but I noticed this was alot cheaper. Being a regular trinitron, it wasn't completely flat like the WEGA's I'd seen. It's only vertically flat but the horizontal curve is so slight that it looks very, very close to flat. picture quality in s-video and a/v is on par with the WEGA's I've seen. The only gripe I have is the lack of extra's. there is only 1 a/v and s-vid input on the back. I had to get a switch for it. I go online with my Sega Dreamcast and the text is very clear and easy on the eyes. The black is really dark and I can turn the color up high with no bleeding. All my game systems look superb on this set. There's no better 27\\" TV for the price. I can't really talk about the speakers because I've never used them.

A very bad sign.Yes this film is awful. An idea stolen from the french film Ills (Them), constructed without the key elements that made the french film so harrowing- tension, tight performances and realism.Basically, this film is about Liv Tyler's character asking- \\"why\\", commando crawling and knocking into every prop that makes loud noises. Her male co-star has a more complex performance that involves- pointlessly leaving his girlfriend alone more than once and saying \\"run\\".The Strangers has no scares or gore and the faux hand-held cinematography is the worst i have seen. This film should take the cake at the next raspberry awards.So if this sounds like 85 minuets of FUN, run and waste your $$ on another dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best scary movies I have ever seen!!!","review":"Without a doubt, this movie is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen!!

It is a movie in high demand because that is what big advertising money can do.As it's supposed to be true, it can't fall back on any supernatural element to help add to the story like HALLOWEEN, and it's endless sequels.If anything it is an indictment of our society that took place in the 1960's when it was decided by GOVERNMENT that we the people don't need gunsbecause we have the police to protect us.

Although her screams and wails were quite realistic and moving at times the movie itself failed to deliver any kind of thrilling horror. The storyline is not original but the fact that it was based on true events gave it some weight, unfortunately the movie had nothing. I couldn't help but see it as an extremely bad remake of 'Funny Games' the movie written and directed by Michael Haneke. The mind games took up all the movie time and built up the viewers expectations so much that when the end came it was kind of \\"YAWN that's it?!?!\\"Also this movie probably had 4 lines altogether so not much to say about the script at all.I'm sad to say another disappointment in this genre of film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow to enjoy","review":"The Strangers was way too slow paced to scare me much.

They made it clear there was no movtive.I thought the masks were creepy, the house creepy, and I thought Liz Tyler did a great job. Those were the only things I really liked.I felt the story was drawn out and yet too sparse. These strangers seem to have supernatural speed, and I HATE when someone falls and injures a leg in a movie.

I don't condone bootleg downloads ever but, in this case the makers of this movie do not deserve ant more money that they have already stolen from us.In short the Strangers sucked,the killers were able to appear and then vanish in the blink of an eye and the only thing that even came close to bothering me was the guys mask.Do not waste your time... oh, I hears there is going to be a strangers two in 2010... do we really need a sequelto this incredibly bad attempt at a horror film???

These strangers harass this couple all throughout the entire night for no reason in particular. They knock on their door, smash the car i think, break in but don't really do anything or take anything and eventually chase them outside.

It doesn't mean they have to use any elements of what inspired them...they were just inspired by some incident.So the murder behind Cain and Abel in Genesis could've \\"inspired\\" THE STRANGERS: somebody did something bad to somebody else.And not that you ever find out why or who the bad guys really are or why we're submitting ourselves to this ordeal. Call me fussy, but I like to know what's going on in my movies. I like to know why people do what they do.This isn't a terrible movie. It's well-crafted...but I knew as much at the end as I did when I started it. It's all style, no substance. I was thankful it wasn't a by-the-numbers slasher flick (because I do despise those tedious exercises more) but was it too much to ask for some insight or info or anything about what was going on here?"},{"rating":"1","title":"morbid waste of film stock!","review":"I actually give this film 'half' a star but that option isn't provided.I'm not going to waste time giving details on the storyline.It's your typical 'young couple get terrorized by Manson type masked freaks/ slasher thriller. It started out fine, and I invested my interest into the survival of the lead characters. Only, there is no pay off. After two hours of watching these poor kids get tortured psychologicaly, they get hacked up! I'm sure the director would defend this ending by saying it was inspired by true events. To that I say.....Many of us watch movies to escape from the real world, not to be reminded how F***ED up it is!

Also inspired by true events."},{"rating":"2","title":"SCARY AS HELLZ","review":"If you are looking to be scared to death, by all means pick this DVD up. Those who tell you not to watch this at night alone are not kidding, it's one of the most disurbing movies I have ever seen. First of all the cut up sacks on the heads of the Strangers is spookeeyyyy, really the site of them give you like a viseral scare. The movie has holes yes, I mean it's a horror film, they all do, I mean, right?..but really this movie is one that will give you nightmares, sort of like watching, the little girl crawl out of the TV in, The Ring, or the zombies in 28 weeks later, it's the way it's filmed and edited that makes this a real fright.

There are 2 characters in this movie basically besides the \\"strangers\\". A boyfriend and girlfriend. The stupidity of the boyfriend throughout this movie had me begging for his death, and the girlfriend does every cliche a woman in a horror does, complete with falling over while running to break her leg. Oh boy. The responses by the actors to what was happening was so unrealistic it was nauseating, and the cherry on the cake was the last scene with the 2 young boys. I won't say more, but it's hilarious watching it in how dumb and unrealistic it is.Horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs to be seen with good surround sound system","review":"I don't know why I never noticed it, but Liv Tyler is so beautiful in this movie. She is hot.. anyways this is a good HD movie experience. And it scares the hell out of females... so if you are a guy, with a good speaker system, watch this with a girl and she will be all over you! Good movie. I can understand why people don't like it though. I saw this in theaters. And when I just watched it on blu ray by myself I was kinda just waiting for it to be over. But there's no doubt that it is scary when watching alone. And I don't get scared from movies. I live in a dorm room so its not that scary cause that's not gonna happen here. I can't even imagine being a girl, home alone and watching this movie in an actual house.

After they paid for her to be in this film, they didn't have any money to pay the electric bill as most of the movie is shot in the dark. Scott proposes to Liv and has a nice evening set in a secluded home (one nicer looking than my dump). The only problem for Scott is that Liv said \\"No,\\" she is not ready, but she is still his gf and sex is still on the table.Rather than be happy, like most males, Scott mopes about and plays lousy tear jerkers. At this point I am hoping the intruders would come in and kill him, but they don't. The movie drags on. Scott leaves Liv, who is now subjected to people banging on the outside walls as we get to see her slither around in the dark all in a panic...no phone, no gun, just a kitchen knife. This is the intense horror that I didn't feel.Not the best home invasion film out there.PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bombs, near sex, back nudity."},{"rating":"1","title":"simple basic and just bad","review":"This is painful to watch, terrible sets, a soundtrack that makes you want to drink . The plot is predictable and moves at a glacial pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth my time","review":"Saw the previews and even the cover made me really want to buy it,, but after I went out and bought it was a big disapointment ,,you know those horror movies where the girl picks the darkest and scariest room to hide in and just happens to be where the killer is hiding and she gets it,, well kind of like this movie. I think they could of done so much better, the idea of the movie was good,, but the strangers appear and disapear scaring this girl to death, they sneak in move things and disapear again before any knows they are in the house and the girl frantically runs and crawls around screaming and crying while the \\"strangers\\" are hiding un seen watching her every move,, feel it is a very predicable movie- and I got more bored through it because you know what is going to happen and it is only a matter of time -- wouldn't waste my time watching it again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do NOT watch alone...","review":"This atmospheric - and undeniably horrifying - directorial debut from Bryan Bertino gave me the chills unlike any other film that I have seen in a long while.I won't go into the story, because most of you already know it, but I will tell you this: if you are as jumpy and as easily frightened as I am, do NOT watch this one alone. I made the mistake of doing that the first time, and I couldn't finish it. I had to rent it later on, and watch it with a room full of people in order to see the entire film. The thing that makes the film so effective is simply this: this could happen to anybody. Anybody could break into your home and terrorize you for no reason.The direction is strong, and Liv Tyler does an excellent job. You can tell that it was definitely inspired by Haneke's FUNNY GAMES, but it's not a rip-off by any means. Bryan Bertino has done an excellent job with his first film, and I look forward to his next film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strangely Entertaining!","review":"This film has some very creepy elements. The idea of a couple being randomly stalked by masked thrill-killers in a secluded home just screams horror! And the fact that it seems so random makes it all the more unnerving. Liv Tyler does a good turn as the female lead. And the behind-the-scenes feature is worth a look. All in all, not a bad flick to watch on an eerily quiet evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Strangers","review":"Product was delivered on time, in mint condition and packaged nicely.

A young couple is attacked in their cabin. This couple, is attacked by people with sheets over their faces, out of nowwhere. The things this couple goes through is stuff that people like Dalmer, would do. What is worse, is what the actress portrayed in the movie. She was beat, raped, and had to see her boyfriend die. I didn't like that. Unfortunately, it is still unknown who commited this gruesome crime to this couple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Frustrating","review":"If you like horror to be more than scary music buildups and villians in scary masks who don't talk and then disappear suddenly, then you will hate this.

I kept waiting for it to get good, but it never did. The movie says it was inspired by true events and starts off saying the events of a particular day are still not fully known. It turns out that the movie was only inspired by a would-be burglar knocked on the door of the writers home when he was a kid. Someone knocked on his door and asked if someone was there who didn't live there. That doesn't sound very inspiring to me! I guess that's why this movie was so lame. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"why was i home! to watch this movie?","review":"I think this is the stupidest movie in the world! Ok so they were 2 against 3 the guy and the girl had a gun and they were only outnumbered 1 in this whole movie they did not even fight back once! They just let it happened what kind of crap is that? Unbelievable that someone would not even fight for their life? You're telling me that if you're being attacked you're not even going to fight back? In every movie at least once the victims fight back for their lives in this movie that did not happened they were killed so easily it was even boring. It was very scary for some reason though all give it that other than that this movie belongs in the trash can and there's nothing scarier than the movie itself it still haunts me!Plus it was not even inspired by one story it was inspired from many stories the person making this movie probably just said that so more people would be interested and watch this stupid boring movie lame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"creepy","review":"I was dissapointed, a friend recommended this movie, but almost no dialoge and bad acting even for a slasher film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A couple good scares out of this...","review":"Basically this movie is summed up in the sentence \\"Hero and heroine get slowly stabbed to death at the end of a long, boring movie.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, to say the least..........","review":"I had been waiting anxiously to watch this, since it was released at the theatres, and never got a chance to go.

This was utter garbage. It is a cliche after a cliche after a cliche. I can't say that there is a single thing in this movie that is even remotely original or unpredictable.

I would give it no stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought it would be idiotic; it's not","review":"I watched \\"The Strangers\\" on TV, thinking it would be silly and mindless; I had other things to do. I watched and was held to the narrative, and kept thinking this is just another home-invasion, slasher film. I was wrong. Director Bertino put together an attractive cast, and found a sound crew of absolute perfection. This is psychological horror done quite well, without the blood and gore. It also helps that Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman handled their roles very well. It may have moved a little too slowly, and the 911 call at the beginning doesn't make sense, but it's a truly scary film. The final scene, with the Jesus freak kids, was clever. Not to be totally written off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't be worst than this, RIDICULOUS HORROR MOVIE","review":"The worst horror movie ever.

That is the best word to describe this movie.A seemingly innocuous beginning lulls the audience into what is going on. A little mystery lingers and is resolved through a flashback to hours before. But as soon as we learn why this couple is so miserable and separate from each other, bizarre occurrences begin and distract the audience's focus.A knock at the door, \\"Is Tamara home?\\" and suddenly the movie leaves the banal conflict between this couple and eases into a terrifying mystery of a completely different sort. Bumps in the night and then some make this film intense. You will be holding your breath in anticipation of what will happen next....No spoilers here--see it for yourself. I highly recommend it, but do not watch it alone ; )"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Strangers by Brandon M. Moskos","review":"I was really disappointed in this film. I had a lot of people tell me how scary this movie was, so I bought the dvd. The movie was weak, the story sucked, and I wasn't scared at all.

They basically terrorize a couple instead of just killing them like most horror films (not that they die for you 1st time viewers.)

The absence of bitterness, the appraisals of both the weakness and strength of his South Vietnamese compatriots, his views on the American intervention: all are fascinating.Overall, this is one of the best books I have ever read about the conflict: it's right up there with Stanley Karnow's well-regarded book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work great; no sticking or jamming","review":"These galvanized roofing nails really did the trick on my roof.

There is one picture per page with a very brief description on why the outfit is basically appropriate or inappropriate. As a previous review mentioned this book is about dressing the body shapes rather than focusing on additional issues plus-sized women have. My main pet peeve is that the photos on the negative side are very craftily staged. The models slouch, frown, don't hold themselves proudly and seem to do all they can to look bad. While on the positive side, they are beaming, standing in a great pose, holding their head up, (sucking in their gut when they didn't on the opposite side).

However, this book is really like a primer book for the absolute basics. personally, I dont think anything beats a computer program for pronounciation. On the computer, you can hear certian words over and over and have the program help you pronouce. But, I find the computer programs to be pretty much useless unless you already know the basics of the language, so I think this book would go perfectly with any material that teaches at a higher level. And in response to the person who gave this book one star I would say that this book is not designed to get you fluent, its for people who have no clue when it comes to the language and I think its excellent at preparing you for the real study of spanish"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best Spanish book I found for my purposes","review":"I never took spanish classes and wanted to learn on my own as I have a boring job but with lots of spanish speaking customers. I looked in the ... and...bookstore near us through all their books and this one was the best for my learning abilities. The #1 reason is that throughout the book it breaks down the pronounciation of each new and old word it gives you, without having to keep refering to rules in the beginning of the book. #2 it seems to have a logical lesson plan that I can follow easily, and not just touristy type lessons as I don't really plan on just asking where the hotel is, but need a practical more rounded learning experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for beginners","review":"I liked this book.

As a Spanish teacher, I think this book does a pretty good job introducing the language, formatting that's pleasant to the eye, and of course, grammar explanation. If you are truly teaching yourself, this is a GREAT place to start. It's conducive to skipping around if you get too bored with a particular lesson, and you can supplement with information when you need a little more practice.For the money, this is a great adult-centered teaching guide.For the much younger student, it's of course, WAY too intense, and not near \\"fun\\" enough to keep interest.Sra.

I bounce back and forth among them as each has stengths and weaknesses. Except for the this pretty useless Idiot's book, which is too heavy to be a phrase book and too light weight to actually teach you anything. Fortunately, I only checked this out of the library rather than wasting money on it. On the positive side, you can listen to and repeat the phrases on the CD to help with pronunciation.

Imran Khan & Genelia do a good job with their characters. This movie is partly typical Bollywood romance with some comedy thrown in for good measure; however, it is quirky enough to keep the audience entertained.

The compression of the dynamic range has made this remastered CD nearly unlistenable. The title track on the original 1986 release has a dynamic range of 13, while the same track on the 25th Anniv. remaster has been squashed to 7. The openness is gone and individual instruments are all at the same level: LOUD. This might be fine for dance music, but not for Paul Simon. Remaster engineer Greg Calbi of Sterling Sound can do incredible work, but this isn't one of them. Also, I don't own the 2004 Rhino remaster, so I can't compare it. All in all, my advice is to stick to the 1986 CD release."},{"rating":"2","title":"And old one but it needs to be revisited","review":"I forgot how wonderful this cd is untill i saw a documentary on public radio.

One of my all-time favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul Simon, world music impresario","review":"Tellingly, the tracks that I skip over most are the ones which have too much of Simon's stamp on them - 'Boy in the Bubble', 'Crazy Love', 'Myth of Fingerprints' (both of these latter tracks are frankly mediocre). It's in places where the musical setting is heavily borrowed that the album is excellent: the zydeco charm of 'That Was Your Mother', the heavy African flavour of 'I Know What I Know' and 'Homeless'. Lyrically, Simon has had better days, but he does creditably on tracks like 'Graceland' and 'You Can Call Me Al'. If there's one thing this album achieved, it was the opening of the ears of much of the world to sounds they had never heard before; and if bringing 'world music' (what an ugly term) into the mainstream was the saving grace of Graceland - well, that's not a bad achievement. I'd also recommend the less radio-friendly but equally strong 'Rhythm of the Saints'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul Simon is a poet","review":"I love this CD.

The buoyant rhythms of the South African music scene combined with Simon's truly creative lyrics are a wonderful combination of whimsy and significance. From the topical \\"Boy in the Bubble\\" to the participation of Los Lobos on \\"The Myth of Fingerprints,\\" there is not a misfire on this recording. Even \\"You Can Call Me AL,\\" is a delightful number when you separate it from the novelty video. With the participation of bands like Ladysmith Black Mambazo and others who play \\"township jive\\" Simon's music is given added authenticity. In Simon's long and storied career, GRACELAND is perhaps his finest work, an incredible synthesis of pop sensibilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the original","review":"This was a great album as well as video when it was originally released.when I played this remastured version after purchasing the first thing I noticed was this is not nearly as good as the songs on my vhs video.

It's great music, plain and simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of 'Miracles and Wonder'.","review":"This album is one of my all-time favourites. I can never get tired of hearing it. And now it has been re-released with fantastic cd-rom enhancement, featuring videos, interviews, photos etc. A wonderful addition to an otherwise perfect album. The booklet includes an 8 page essay by Timothy White as well as all the lyrics. Paul Simon and this album played a significant role in bringing the music of South Africa into the worlds consciousness. Before this, the music of South Africa was largely unknown, but this album changed all that. Ladysmith Black Mambazo were catapulted into almost instant stardom.This album is brilliant from start to finish. The lyrics, the music, the blend of African/Zydeco and Cajun, make this album an adventure, an experience not to be missed. This is an album that everyone should have in their collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"great recording","review":"I originally bought this album because i had to have the song, \\"You Can Call Me Al.\\" But after I listened to the whole album, I realized something about Paul Simon's style of music. Some of the lyrics might be strange, but it all goes with the music. What I like best about Paul Simon's songs is that most of them have great music in them, along with good singing. All the lyrics go with the music to create one of the most classic albums up to date. I'm glad that I stumbled onto this album, even if it was just for one song because the entire album is great!

On a five-star scale, I give it six."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"Graceland represents a brilliant compilation of works by an American Poet laureate. Soaring above the expression of Jewish urban angst, Mr. Simon speaks his truth- an American Truth- with 6-stringed virtuosity and a gifted pen. This is not about us feeling the artist's pain- rather, he understands ours. This is the finest piece of American Art to emerge from the 1980's.Graceland is nothing short of an American gift to a very confused world- now and for generations to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must-have for any cd collection.","review":"this cd has been part of my musical memory for as long as i can remember. it was released when i was only 8 years old, and my family wore out our tape of it, we listened to it so much. every song is an absolute classic. you will smile and laugh aloud at some of the abstract lyrics, you will be brought to tears by some of the others. this is probably my favorite album of all time, by any artist. it is addictively listen-able."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNDER AFRICAN SKIES","review":"I've gone both ways with Simon. Too often his efforts are at best sophomoric - \\"Hearts and Bones\\" - and unworthy of his talent.

A"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arguably, the best record of the 1980's","review":"Paul Simon's Career was practically doomed to the 1960's until he came up with Graceland. This was his come-back album and... he came back with a vengeance. This was a huge commercial and critical hit back in late '86 and '87. Most people born in the mid 1980's won't remember how big this album was, but will remember \\"The Lion King\\" soundtrack which was one of the biggest hits of the 1990's and was inspired by the South African rhythms heard here.

Recently I saw a PBS special about the re-uniting of Paul Simon with the South African musicians and I had to buy it again. I always loved Paul Simon from 1969 with Art Garfunkle, but now I realize what a talented musical genius he is, and this will always be part of my musical staples. The music is timeless and smart, and stays with you. The combination of Simon's music and especially the accordian, drums, horns, and the So. African vocals are so different and still fresh. Diamonds on the \\"Souls of her Shoes\\" is my favorite, but every cut stands the test of time.

It's the perfect warm weather album, along with paul simon's rhythm of the saints."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Masterpiece","review":"Paul Simon is and was an extremely under-apreciated, musical genius, and Graceland is an often overlooked work of art. It is an exploration of African music and an incredibly rare bridge between our culture and theirs. Every single song on the album has a good reason for its being there. Every single song, from the joyous opening song \\"The Boy in the Bubble\\" to the beautiful \\"Diamonds on the Souls of her Shoes\\" to the gratifying concluding song \\"All Around the World,\\" is its own masterpiece. They all come together to make one of the greatest collections of music I 've ever heard.

Anyone else should at least consider buying this masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Album Ever!","review":"I recently bought the ECD of Graceland.

(CRAZY LOVE VOL2) (THAT WAS YOUR MOTHER) and lastly, (ALL AROUND THE WORLD OR THE MYTH OF FINGERPRINTS) this recording is still a heck of a lot better than, the rythem or the saints or his latest the capeman,which nothing could be worse then that by him.

I replied that I did not receive them and, finally, the seller offered a refund. I did get the refund, BUT, by then it was too late to get them from another source, so I was unable to take them to China. Actually, I seriously doubt if the seller ever had them to sell and never really sent them as they claimed.

There are keyboards that has more functions, and I already had one of those before I bought this - the KeyRig was worth buying just because it's so simple. And no software! Logic Pro and Ableton Live instantly recognizes it, and I can start making music right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks too quick and too easy","review":"This is the worst midi controller i've ever used, production wise, because i've gone through 2 of these things in one year, and that is not right considering that these things can cost up to $150 a controller for these. The keys and hardware are made of cheap plastic, and easily break. My two that i had stopped working randomly and now have to send the second in for repair. But you know what, forget it. They are not worth my time. I'm just going to buy a Oxygen controller instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Right","review":"This is exactly the keyboard you need if have a computer that does it all.

Great for Apple-based studio (or Wintel)."},{"rating":"2","title":"not a stand alone keyboard - no speakers","review":"It doesn't matter so much to me, but it's important you know that the keyboard has no speakers to play by itself.

Great for producing/arranging music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap-O Midi Controller","review":"You get what you pay for. The M-Audio Keyrig feels as cheap as a Casio keyboard. The pitch bend and mod wheel are kind of nice,sturdy rubber, but the keys are light and feel like they could break under your fingers if you really whaled on them. There are no other controls on it other than a volume control. If you want a control surface with some knobs and sliders you may want to look at this model's big brother. I used to have an old version of the Oxygen 8. That controller was pretty solid, yet still inexpensive. You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it just stops working","review":"This is a nice inexpensive controller until it just stops working. The symptoms are; it still lights up, the pitch bend, modulation and volume slid still sends midi signals, but the keyboards goes dead.There may be parts available to repair it from M-Audio, but the cost is 25-45% of the price.Sorry M-Audio, I cannot recommend this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some glitches","review":"I bought this keyboard from Best Buy.It is not a very good keyboard.It has the following problems:When you are in the normal Octave (both octave lights on the left are on which is the default), when you go into G4 and above which are on the right, the keyboard produces a very muted sound. It is a drastic transition from F4 to G4 keys. It sounds OK when you set the keyboard to a lower octave.Also, in the normal octave mode, chords A minor and C sound the same. This is because when you hit the A minor chord the A note is hardly heard.Now I am looking at options.

I was looking for a crazier turntablist pastiche, ala Peanut Butter Wolf or Australia's The Avalanches. If you want nutty cuts that are surprising and will move your feet and have strong beats, check out towards the end of the album, the cuts Hip-Hopera and Miles Away, which is all full of \\"Sketches of Spain\\" horns.

You first hear it and you think to yourself... ugh, not another boy band. But it's just SO catchy. And then you find out he played all the instruments, did all the programming and producing, by himself, with no one else's help. The mixdown was done by someone else but the whole album is his work. He's a pretty good guitarist, he ain't no Santana, but he's nice to listen to. It's almost like it's from out of the 80's (minus the KILLER production). 4 stars for the same reason as one of the reviewers above, I'm into John mayer and bands like Vertical Horizon, so a record like this is usually not found in my collection. I'm into all sorts of music though.

Surprisingly enough, he did everything but mix-down and mastering for this album. normal good albums contain a couple of good tunes and the rest is sort of .... but as far as this album is concerned, there isn't even a song that i couldn't love. in some ways, he remained me of (tender part of)John Lennon. and i think his gentle vibes is somewhat similar to that of Madonna. apparently he isn't very famous at the moment. but i can predict that every individual in his country will know his name in the near future! if my prediction is incorrect, the world is wrong! let's start a revolution together and let every thing turn aroundc in that case. incidentally, i'm an artist, too. i have to say he forced me to start over creating a song i'm currently working on. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desert island disc.","review":"This is also a desert island disc for me. I still enjoy listening to it after owning it for years . .He has a new album \\"Landmark\\", btw. It's a bit hard to find . . I think he's trying to protect his Kevin Rudolf \\"hip hop\\" image. I have a complete disconnect when I think of Kevin Rudolf and Binocular. In fact, when I saw him on the Super Bowl preshow, I had no idea it was him. When I came to the realization, it was a complete shock . . that he had made it out of obscurity as a \\"hip hop\\" artist.Anyway, the new Binocular album is good, though not as immediate as his self-titled release.

They may work if you have extremly thin hair but do not even try if you have normal to thick hair. I tried it, and my family and friends who also tested all agree these are junk.

I much prefer the previous design. They were light and flexible and held the rollers in place. These clips are too small; do not hold the rollers securely, and they are made of hard plastic which is not the most comfortable material. Fortunately, I kept my old clips and they work fine with this set.The rollers heat up quickly, and as promised give great shine to the hair.

I get big bouncy curls every time I use them, and they last for 6+ hours. It really depends on the weather though which is kind of a no brainer.

I think I may just use a straightener to get rid of those, but still annoying. This product also takes about 10 min to heat up fully, rather than the promised 2.

The idea is actually very good- it has a side heater to heat up the clips as well as the rollers, a feature I've never seen before. However, the clips do not hold- at least not in my long hair. No matter how many times I tried, the rollers would always fall out within a few seconds. Even when I stayed completely still (very difficult when putting in the remaining rollers) they would still fall out. They never stayed in long enough for me to see how well the curlers worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"wire clips do not work","review":"rollers heat up but wire clips do not hold ....rollers stay loose and fall off.

They aren't nearly strong enough to hold your hair in place. I wish I could speak to how well the rollers work, but I couldn't get them to stay in long enough to find out. If you are lucky enough to get the clips to work, be prepared to sit very still until the rollers are cool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds a curl","review":"I bought mine in Bed Bath and Beyond a couple years ago and use it 2-4 times a month. It comes with a pouch of gray clips which you insert onto the heated rack. It is lined with sponge to protect hair and doesnt do damage. The rollers take about 10 min to fully heat up and if left in hair for 7-15 min, the curls will last all day.Now for the negatives. The slit design on each roller isnt good for long hair that gets tangled in it. Also, the pink edge to the roller cracks and hair gets trapped and pulls. The roller gets hot to the touch and you'll find yourself saying \\"ouch\\" when rolling onto hair. The clips heat up and do cause indent in hair. If you put too much hair onto the roller and try to clip it, it will fall out.I never use the small rollers, only the large and medium to get loose waves. Small rollers gives really tight curls and its not enough to do an entire head, so its pointless. Buy the conair with large rollers if you're only looking to do sexy loose waves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are they supposed to melt?","review":"&#65279;My wife just bought one of these sets and couldn't wait to get home to try it.

I simply open the plastic cover on that side to cool them a bit.The set features different size curlers, for different parts of the hair. It grasps nicely (even to fine hair) and is easy to roll. It's exactly what I anticipated and is working well.For those with hard to hold hair, I recommend a spray gel beforehand to keep the curl lasting longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melted","review":"These rollers melted - so bizarre - clearly defective.

Needless to say, I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"conair - dissappointed","review":"I bought the Conair instant heat rollers to replace my old Conair rollers which I was very happy with. Unfortunaetly I found that I did not like the new version as well as the old. It does not heat up as fast and whereas the old had a high and low setting this only has one. Also found that the heated clips leave dent marks in my hair which the wire clips did not. I use the Conair super clips which I bought separately instead, would use my old wire clips if only I could find them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot rollers","review":"I love them.

I have a feeling these curlers work best with average hair that doesn't go to far in either the super thick or super thin direction. I leave them in until they cool and then resist combing for my hair for until the last minute. I use hairspray with the curlers and that helps the curl stay a little longer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes a Decent Curl, But Not Worth Buying","review":"I have naturally curly hair, but I've always had a problem with frizz and my curls having a uniformed look.While these do give a nice curl towards the bottom, the top looks all wrong. The clips do NOT hold very tight. Many rollers fall out during use and don't keep the roller at your scalp. The clips also cause dents near the top of your curls. I had to resort to curling the top layer of my hair with a large barrel iron.If you can salvage the outer layers of your hair, the curls created by these hot rollers will last all day and look very nice. However, if you don't have a lot of time to spend on your hair, I wouldn't recommend these."},{"rating":"2","title":"hair setter","review":"I really like the Conair Ion Shine hair setter.

I could not find another set of these in the store so I \\"settled\\" on this product. Let me tell you, I shouldn't have... The curl does not stay in my hair for more than about 45 mins (if that) sometimes it does not even LOOK like I curled it. My hair is VERY easy to curl and will HOLD curl all day when the right product is used. The clips did not even work properly, I was always having to fix the rollers from coming out. I finally got wise, got on line, found another set of Caruso Molecular Rollers and ordered them. I will try to find someone who really does not want to have curly hair and give them this set....NEVER AGAIN!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great...........","review":"First - no blue clips came with it, as advertised. Second - doesn't curl very well. Edges of rollers pretty hot to handle, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"rollers work good","review":"I am happy with the rollers. They heat up quite fast and I like the variety of sizes. The only feature I don't like is that there isn't any holder for the clips. they came in a little pouch, which is made of very flimsy material.

The plastic clips do not work as intended. They put a large crimp in my hair near my scalp. I like nice soft \\"even\\" curls. I have long hair, but it would likely do the same for short hair. I cannot recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described","review":"I have used electric rollers (including Conair) for many, many years. The box for these rollers says it includes jumbo, large & medium rollers. I bought another Conair set that includes jumbo & super-jumbo. The jumbo size in this set is about half the size of the other jumbo rollers. So the box should really say it includes medium, small & super-small sizes. Also, the box says the clips do not leave crimp marks on your hair. That is a lie since they do leave marks that look terrible. I was extremely disappointed with this set. All I wanted to do was replace my existing set with the broken lid (yes - the lids always break) but instead they had to \\"improve\\" things & lie in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"First of all, my rollers came with the fishy shaped looking clips. I hate them. They do not hold my thick, wavy hair and they also leave a weird indentation that gets \\"burned\\" into the hair. So, in the middle of the curl, there is an occasional flat \\"whip\\" mark. Additionally, my hair gets caught on the hinge part of the clip. The lid cracked and broke off two weeks after I bought it.I really don't like these. I miss my old rollers, which had the velvety cover on the roller and a softer heat that seemed to do less damage to my long hair. Usually I use my rollers until they wear out, but I am going to donate these to the Salvation Army along with a NEW box of clips!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It!!!","review":"I'm returning this product. I found various opinons in the reviews on the Conair hair clips but I now agree with all those that weren't impressed with them. This comes with wire clips that just don't work. It's very frugal of Conair to sell this hair setter with cheap clips. To me that's like selling a vase that doesn't hold water very well. Unless you already own some good clips and you don't need the rollers very hot...I'd keep on looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great until they melted!","review":"Easy to use, made my hair look awesome, big improvement over curling iron.

Lame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The picture is wrong","review":"It would be nice if the product delivered actually came with the accessories in the pictures. I purchased this specifically for the wide clips for my wife's hair. After seeing my wife use it I find that it has those cruddy little metal clips that slide right out of her hair.

So I ended up buying just a set of metallic cheap clampy pins to hold them in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, ok","review":"This product claims to heat up in 2 minutes, but you need to leave it heating for 10 if you want the curls to stay.

I have long straight hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Like This Product","review":"I don't know what I expected....maybe something a little better since it has the Conair name on it. The rollers get plenty hot, but the clips are a pain to use and don't hold. They also leave crimping in the hair. Wish I had purchased the jumbo rollers with the regular metal clips that hold better. Now I'm stuck with something I probably won't use much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out with Hot Iron/In with Hot Rollers","review":"I wanted to go back to curling my hair the way I remember doing it before all the new types.

However, like the other reviewer said - I absolutely hate the clips. They are all one size, so they are too large for the smallest rollers. I also don't like them because they don't keep the roller still like the \\"U\\" shaped clips did, and they leave a dent impression in my hair. I don't recommend them primarily because of the clip system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salon results at home!","review":"I was shocked the first time I used these. I have used other conair rollers before with horrible results (a poof ball basically). These rollers are awesome. They are easy to put it (no burning fingers here!). The clips actually hold my hair really well. They don't fall out while you are waiting for them to cool. When I took them out I was shocked.

But the bottom line is they just don't curl my hair. I have noticed the same if I blow dry my hair with one of those ion round brushes too, so I think it is the ion thing that makes them not work. All the other hot rollers I used in the past would lock in curl that would last for days...so if yoy have naturally wavy/curly hair be cautious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Do not buy this machine.

They come in a separate pouch, which means it would be too easy to pack the hair setter and forget the pins. The top is flimsy, and although the cord can be wrapped around the bottom, there is no clip to hold it. How much would it have cost to add on a tiny plastic clip or two? The metal pins are difficult to place, although they do hold well. The curls made with the setter are pretty good, but it seems to me that this little appliance was designed by someone who had never used one and had never consulted anyone who did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"These hot rollers are completely useless!

I won't be a return customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clips don't hold the rollers","review":"The clips that come with this don't hold my hair up, in fact for most of the size rollers the clips are too small to even clip over the roller.

Curling irons were just taking too long, so for the first time in years I decided to try hot rollers again. I read a lot of reviews and decided on this set. I like everything about it, and know that it would do a good job IF the rollers would stay in! The clips are horrible. They don't grab very tightly at all, and for an area like around the face it is impossible to get them to stay. The ones that do stay in leave a really weird little crease from where they clip, causing 'cowlick' type problems. I've almost been in tears from the result a few nights when I had no option but to go the way I looked or start all over and be late. I just bought another set with the old fashioned skinny wire hooks, as most seem to use the clips nowadays and I don't see how any clips would not leave creases. These are going in my next garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with results","review":"Though they do heat up quickly, I don't care for the clips. The clips don't seem to grasp my the curlers well and they leave a crease in my hair (shoulder length and fine - but I have tons of it). The 'velvet' finish contributes to the curlers sliding right out. Also the edges of the curlers are too hot for my scalp."},{"rating":"1","title":"No No No","review":"I have used many brands for decades - these rollers have a few issues & I cannot not recommend them - I returned them.1. Putting them back in order is awkward as they have to be fit onto a holder2. The clips simply don't hold --- the pin type are much more secure3. Totally silly to heat the clips --- holds only three at a time and each time you take one off - you put another on - waste of time4. NO STORAGE for the clips -"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"The rollers and clips do not stay in place.

They are so slick that my hair will not wrap around the curler. There are no prongs to grab the hair to wrap around the curler. Hair sticks up all around the curler and when I take them out, my hair is not curled, it is stuck out everywhere. I boxed them up and put them up on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"These may work well for someone with fine, easy to curl hair-but not for me.My very hair is fine, but very thick & straight-so the curl lasts about 2 hours at best, and that's with spray or other holding product.The rollers never seem to get really hot, and the clips only fit properly on the large size rollers. The smaller rollers just fall out or you get \\"dents\\"-ugly!The flocking covering probably protects your hair, but it makes using product close to the roots very difficult-you worry about gumming it up.I've had many styling tools from Conair that I loved-but this is not one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't hold up","review":"I bought this product and have used it for less than 6 months. One of the heating rails has stopped working and the unit melted one of the rollers so it won't go back on the roller.

Too bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clips are terrible","review":"I really like this product, I like the rollers and the fact that it heats up very quickly; however, the clips to keep the rollers in are terrible.

So if there were better clips I would give a full rating, but I'm really disappointed with the design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not hot enough and won't stay in tight.","review":"These were useless.

This set is one of the many that I have owned and it's great! I mostly use the larger rollers, since my hair is longer and thicker. These rollers are easy to use and heat up quickly. The fabric around the outside of the rollers is velvety and doesn't snag my hair. I don't use the clips that come with the rollers, instead I use pins from another Conair set that I had saved. I've tried the clips a few times, but since my hair is so thick, I prefer my old pins. Either way, this is a great product, and I will probably order it again when I need new curlers."},{"rating":"1","title":"The clip design is horrible, doesn't hold rollers in place!","review":"My rollers came with cheap plastic clips that were designed to hold the rollers in place... only they don't hold the roller. These clips are absolute garbage and do not hold my thick, wavy hair at all. I'm 36 years old and have been using rollers for FOREVER, I have never had a problem with another other type of roller set. I have yet to use any with these plastic clips, rather than the traditional metal U shaped pins and needless to say, I will stick with the traditional pin sets from now on.In addition to the clips not holding the hair well, they leave a weird ridge or dent in the curl. It looks ridiculous.Conair, get with it... stick with the traditional U pins, there's a reason they've been used for years-- they work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The picture is deceptive on this product","review":"The clips shown are not the clips shipped with the product.

Needless to say I cannot use it, cannot turn it on or off. I never left it plugged in when not in use. It didn't get wet. And their warranty is only good for 30 days. In this day and age / throw away society I guess they don't expect it to last any longer than 30 days before you have problems. Prior to this I owned a Clariol hot roller set for 20 years before it died. I am so disappointed that now I have to add it to a land fill because though it looks brand new it sure doesn't work. The set was wonderful but now that it's broken with no hope of replacement it's BOO to Conair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burnt","review":"This is probably one of the worst products I've ever purchased. Aside from the fact that it burns your fingers (there's no way to protect yourself other than to wear silicone mitts), the curlers absolutely would not stay in my hair. It's not as though I'm a first time hot curler user. I've been using them for many years. My first try took 15 minutes to get three rollers in and then I gave up. I went back a second time thinking it would be a matter of getting used to a new product. But I just can't get used to a new \\"badly designed, never should have been manufactured product\\". I can't believe this product even got as far as the store shelf. I returned it after my second try which took an hour, I couldn't move my head or the rollers slid out and the end result was indeed lousy and I did have the creases that they said would not happen.

And now it says almost $8 shipping, and $29.99. So that's weird that it's so much more expensive now. (it's still $22.77 @ Walmart.)Anyways, these didn't curl my hair. They made my hair SLIGHTLY wavy. (I have naturally straight, thick hair.) See that girl who posted 2 pictures, one w/ curly hair and one w/ straightish hair? The straight hair is what my hair looked like AFTER I left the curlers in for 15 minutes. This is weird, because my hair is normally really easy to curl, and it stays until I wet my hair. My favorite curling iron is Conair's infiniti curling wand. (I have the pink one because it supports breast cancer).The clips also didn't hold very well. Pieces of my hair kept falling out of the curlers. (Don't think, \\"Oh, that's why it didn't curl her hair!\\" because that's not true.

I have an older version that I needed to replace and the quality of this new set is nothing like the old ones. The size of the rollers is a joke, unless you have very short hair.

I've taken good care of my set, I never leave it on or forget to turn it off for long periods, and I can't imagine it wearing out so quickly, especially because I only use them maybe twice a week.

Furthermore, the clips will shoot across the room like bullets and become almost impossible to find, while the lovely pink rollers clatter to the floor and manage to roll under any available surface (perhaps they're magnetic). So you're bending over to find them, and even more of them spring out of your head causing your long (but still straight) hair to cascade down into your eyes, making the search for the pesky little devils that much harder still. I'm absolutely sure that one of those little clippy deals is still stuck in a potted plant or embedded in plaster somewhere. Maybe two of them. Hard to say.

Just bad all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"I haven't used curlers in a while but I like these, have a hard time getting the clips and curlers to stay put once it my hair but I could be putting in too much hair. The curlers have been better on my hair than the hot iron I was using everyday. Again, can't beat the price. I returned a set of curlers that where cost over $80.00 because I didn't like them, these are great for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for thick, longer hair because of clips","review":"If you have medium long to long hair that is thick, this set of hot rollers might drive you insane. The concept is great, but the clips are completely inadequate. They burn your fingers as you try to secure them and just do not seem big or round enough to cover the entire roller around your hair. Several just slipped right out as I tried to secure them, even with small amounts of hair and they hung down instead of more secured to the scalp like they should for optimum curls. I would hesitate to buy them. As far as when you do get one to hold right, the curl comes out nice and if you give yourself some spray, it will turn out ok. Otherwise, I recommend something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I don't know how many conair hot roller sets I've bought over my life - 10, 15?

Conair is a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It Love It","review":"When I first opened up the box to this set of hot rollers, I though it was not going to last me long because it seemed cheap. Once I started to hook it up and everything it heated up quite quick, but it made this sound like it was working really hard to heat the rollers. But I found out that looks can be deceiving. I love these hot rollers so much. Pros: the velvet rollers don't burn my finger tips, it's gentle on my hair when I remove them and they are light when on your head. Cons: the lid is kind of fragile which break easily (I chips apart of mine); also I'm not fond of the pins that comes with the rollers so I ended up using bobby pins, which works wonderfully. Overall the product works very well, but how long will they last me, I don't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love These!","review":"These hot curlers are wonderful. I have past the shoulder hair that is very thick and got tired of curling it with a curling iron that left them flat by the end of the day.

I absolutely loved it and wanted the exact same thing but thought it would be nice to have the large and medium sized curlers as well, though I primarily use the jumbo. I was completely shocked when I opened this and saw the size of the curlers. Even the jumbo size were waaaay too small. I use them to give body to my straight long hair and none of the sizes were suitable for that. I immediately shipped it back and ordered the Travel Size like I had before. Very disappointed this wasn't what I thought it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for long hair","review":"I got these and tried them for my hair. I have somewhat thick hair so I got a set with lots of curlers but to my surprise they were tiny rollers. I had to use all the rollers.

Gunna buy the Babyliss 30 rollers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heats up fast","review":"I got this set for Christmas. I give it 2 stars because it does heat up fast. What I don't like about it is I really wanted bigger curlers. Not Conair's fault. Also, the clips do not hold your hair very well. Especially if you try to roll on the top of your head. They held ok on the sides if you were still. The teeth are just too short to really dig in and hold well. Another thing I don't like, no on/off switch. Plug it in, it's on. Unplug it to turn it off. I would just prefer an on/off switch.

To call this her finest book when each one is so beautifully crafted is high praise indeed, but I wouldn't hesitate to do so. A vivid setting, a memorable hero and a totally engrossing story combine to make this an excellent read, for, as Sutcliff says, \\"children of any age\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosemary Sutcliff's best book","review":"To me, this is the best of Rosemary Sutcliff's many fine books, and my personal favourite. I suppose I should find the basic premise that one man can successfully impersonate another from an entirely different culture with only a brief period of indoctrination, but somehow it hardly seems to matter! You see Phaedrus the gladiator growing into the kingship he has assumed, and finally dying for his people as he has lived for them over his scant year as ruler. As with all Rosemary Sutcliff's books, it works on one level as a really good adventure story, with all the fine detail of battles and riding and chariot driving, but it is far more than that, and every time I re-read it I see something new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book","review":"I really love this book. I picked it up in high school for a book report and got sucked into Rosemary Sutcliff's world.

All songs are predictable commercial sounding tracks that lack the charm and appeal of their previous work. If any McVie songs annoyed me, it was the ones on this album. Weak choruses and songs that seemed to have been written in 5 minutes - 'Little Lies' & 'Everywhere'. There's also the bland Buckingham tracks 'Family Man' & 'Big Love'.

It's like after five years they got all their emotions out on this album. It would be their last studio album with all 5 members and the last time they would work together for over ten years. From Little Lies to Big Love. From Seven Wonders to Isn't it Midnight. The album has magic all over it. The guitar playing is amazing. The best track of the album might not even be on it.

Information about artists and the music made is invaluable to the dj, music aficionados, trivia enthusiasts, historians, and regular people who just want to know what song was the best by the artist.For my money, Joel Whitburn and Billboard charts are the best oracles of musical knowledge around.

I understand the reasoning behind the two parts of the book, but if what Ms. Isaacs was trying to do was help us understand the main characters, Charlie and Lauren, then how come I did not feel that I really knew Lauren at all? She was not a well-drawn character - the way that her mother, grandmother, etc. were portrayed. I also was pretty surprised that they hopped into bed so quickly - that was really a letdown - without any real tension buildup. I don't really think that the two parts of the book flowed well together. why spend so much time with the prior characterizations, when the main characters are total unknowns?

Well, keep trying, Susan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two books pieced together as one.","review":"I have been a fan of Susan Isaacs and have read all of her previous books. However, what was she thinking with this one? or two as it were? The first half was about so many generations of these two families it was so hard to keep straight, and quite frankly, what was the point? The second half was a completely different story. Granted, these two main characters of the second half were related (third cousins???), but it was not an integral part of their story. I was very disappointed by this book. I would tell anyone who wants to read it to just start halfway through because that is where the real storyline begins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aren't They cousins or something????","review":"This was my first Susan Isaacs book.

She would start to develop a character, then leave you hanging by moving on to the next generation. This happened with several generations.

I hope she goes back to her old format."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to force myself to finish it.","review":"I have long been a fan of Susan Isaacs, and was de- lighted to hear of her new book. I found it to be dull beyond words. The characters, both the good and bad guys, had great potential for being developed into people about whom I would care, but it was as if Ms. Isaacs herself found them uninteresting,too.

I finished it only because I felt like I should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance novel or undercover thriller?","review":"This is the first Susan Issacs book I have read. Was this the first book she wrote? The storyline did not show up until about page 350. The remainder of the book was poorly detailed and seemed hurried to a finish. Dysfunctional, confusing generations of ancestral history could be a book all of its own. The two main characters needed more development and more insight into their common ancestry.Wrath was a poorly organized bunch of clowns, unbelievable as a serious threat to anyone with the exception of its one poorly developed sociopathic member.If Ms. Issacs has written better books, then I encourage her to return to that writing style.

I just hope next time Susan Issacs goes back to her witty, funny style that is so enjoyable to read. I loved Lily White and Almost Paradise, etc. Reading about Wrath was the most boring torture to have to go through!

Having just finished it, I can hardly believe it was written by Ms Isaacs, who's \\"Lily White\\" was a true joy, as were her other wonderful works. The difference between \\"R,W, and B\\" and all the other novels is startling.\\"R,W, and B\\" starts out good, going back in time and telling stories of long ago. This was the best part of the book, the most interesting, and the most Isaac-like. The second half, the Wyoming-FBI-terrorism part, must have been written by a ghost writer. There was no mystery, no depth of character, no surprises. It was almost embarassing to read, it was so awful. It was not possible to care about the two main characters, who were just too perfect. The shoot-out scene on the deserted road was nauseating while at the same time so implausable.I look forward to Ms Isaac's next book, because it can only be an improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced myself to keep reading until the end","review":"I should have known when I realized the book they were reviewing on the back cover as wonderful was her Lily White and not this one.

I've tried switching out the cable box the VCR even the coaxial cable the picture still deteriorates after no more than 5 hours of use. The use of the VCR tends to speed the occurence of the problem and can obliterate the picture in roughly 4 hours. Also when whatching cable TV I have noticed ghosts in the picture. I have tried switching cable boxes with the TV in the other room but the problem persits.

It got boring. Isn't that a cardinal sin for any writer? It had no momentum to carry me through it, and in the end I put it down far more often than most books.

I have to admit I was disappointed in Until I Find You. The story went on and on and on and didn't really say anything. Some parts of the book contained flashes of John Irving's humor and style but most of the book was just dragged out for no reason. I didn't like the ending and the story it told was disconnected. It's a shame to wait all this time for him to publish a new book only to have it be so disappointing. Pass on this one and reread The Cider House Rules or A Prayer for Owen Meanie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Until I find you terrible!","review":"How any one can enjoy this book is beyond me. The charactors are all obnoxious, and I didn\`t like any of them. I certainly didn\`t enjoy reading about Jack being molested,in great detail, by older women and girls. If that\`s not enough, then the mother, who doesn\`t seem to care what is going on with her little boy, is also sleeping around, and ends up in a homosexual relationship, which she doesn\`t seem to mind Jack observing. Only a pervert would think this book has any merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pocket Full of Pubes","review":"When I read one of Irving's other books while eating dinner, I nearly lost my appetite. There is something sickly obsessive about the main characters of Irving's book who all seem to have disturbed sexuality while enjoying wrestling. But after the dismemberments in \\"The World According to Garp\\", this is pretty tame. At this point, it would take a lot for Irving to shock me with his graphic sexual imagery. Only with a personal photo could he top himself.I read somewhere that it takes Irving four or five years to write each book. It only takes Stephan King about a week and a half. Anyway Mr. Irving, here's hoping 2009 takes a long time to get here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to the library...","review":"I didn't quite make it half through this novel.

The pages kept coming, the potential for a wonderful novel was there, but in the end: a big miss.My chief complaint: as John Irving has become more successful (and wealthier), the net worth of his characters has increased, and they manage to solve -- with relative ease -- the financial hurdles that ordinary folks would find impossible to conquer. Frankly, the emotional troubles of the well-to-do lack substance when these same problems would exert far greater woe upon those who work for a living. Mr. Irving seems to have lost touch with this concept, and lost touch with his faithful readers in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK AND DOUBLE YUCK.","review":"I always look forward to Irving's books, but this one is truly awful. (I won't summarize the plot; read the other reviews for that.) It's unbelievable (EVERY FEMALE WANTS TO ABUSE JACK, NO MATTER HOW OLD HE IS) and disgusting (EVERY FEMALE DOES ABUSE JACK; except for his teachers). While i was reading the book, i just got angrier and angrier. I almost threw it across the room. I finished it, but only because I HAD to know how it turned out. The twisty ending is interesting (Alice lied to him about everything) but that's about it. I'm tired of Irving's recycling of the same STUFF: prostitutes, rape/sexual abuse, wrestling. And now he's added child abuse. At least there were no bears in Amsterdam. This may be the last Irving book I spend money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"As a long time John Irving fan, I found this book very disappointing. I probably wouldn't have stayed with it as long as I did if it hadn't been for my past enjoyment of his other works. The first section of Jack and his mother moving from town to town working in tattoo parlors got a bit repetitive. Then, with young Jack at the Girl's school for grade's one thru four along with the older school girls' mistreatment and abuse, it became uncomfortable to read. The last straw was when the older babysitter raped him. At that point, I decided not to continue.I read fiction as a form of entertainment. John Irving has written some really good novels. From a social and personal perspective, this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get past the 1st 200 pages","review":"I couldn't get past the first 200 pages.

I've been there through repeat appearances of New England prep schools, bears, dress-maker's dummies, Vienna, sexual awakenings, wrestling protagonists, and sibling love affairs.

If you've read others of his you'll appreciate the origins of many of his story lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Until I Find You by John Irving","review":"A prurient claptrack of unrealistic, repetitious, and overblown writing contained in 816 unreadable pages. It was a good book to finish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After having read a fair number of John Irving's earlier novels, I was disappointed with the cardboard characters in this one and the endless elaboration on pointless details. Not once did I get to feel any identification with the main characters. I literally struggled through the 500+ pages of the hardback version.Apart from Toronto, Maine and LA, the book describes scenes in Copenhagen, Oslo, Stockholm, Helsinki, Amsterdam, Edinburgh and Zurich and Mr Irving has gone through great pains to insert local insiders info, rendering the book into something of a tourist guide. The author indulges here in a writer's trick to add interestingness to the novel, which I found irritating.The subject matter is fashionable, and only that, and as thin as the paper is was printed on.I would not recommend this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I can appreciate the author's talent, but I could not get past the endless, graphic child abuse. I got the message the first 5 times it happened, but he was abused by basically every woman/girl he came into contact with. It was too disturbing for me. This is the first Irving novel I have read and don't know if I will be able to try another."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"Good value with regard to the number of pages... but the story misses by a mile. None of the characters are in anyway sympathetic. The narrative jumps around various cities in Europe and North America providing boring descriptions of churches and their organs. Whereas in other Irving books the unlikely characters are somehow real, the tattooists or other people he describes are barely two-dimensional. The penis holding episodes, size of penis etc are just plain weird and appear without any relevance to the storyline. I could go on. By the end of the book I was just glad to have finished and I didn't believe in the characters or care what happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Indulgent!","review":"I have to agree with the editorial reviews who say this is definitely not John Irving's best work. I have read all of his novels, and I suppose when you have the reputation that he rightfully has, it's hard for one's own editors and publishers to criticize you. However, at least 200 pages could have been cut from this. Self-indulgent is the best description I could give it. At the end I was left feeling like I just didn't \\"get it\\". Irving's prior works usually contain characters most describe as eccentric. This book leads me to believe he's forgotten that the audience has to care about the characters, and that while the author may feel that you can't describe things fully enough, there is something to be said for \\"less is more\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NO \\"Prayer for Owen Meany\\"","review":"John Irving's characters are often quirky and sometimes you don't like them very much, but Jack Burns and all the women in his life evoke no sympathy, and little interest. Were I not a John Irving fan I would have stopped reading 50 pages in, but I held onto the faith that he would pull it out in the end. How could a man that crafted the genius of Owen Meany write a story with so little interest? Read \\"Until I Find You\\" and you will see that John Irving has missed the mark this time and has failed to make you fall in love with the main character!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste","review":"As a professional book reviewer of non-fiction books, I don't have a lot of time for fiction. I make time for John Irving. I wish I had skipped this one. I have been a huge Irving fan for more years than I care to think about. There was nothing salvageable in this book. Has anyone else here ever played Irving bingo? It's a card with bears, abortions, childless children, transvestites, boys boarding schools and so forth... I am also astonished that anyone on this site like this book--this stretches the credibility of \\"different strokes for different folks.\\" This book was objectively boring and awful. By the way, my other all time favorite novelist is Trevanian, who has also put out a horrible novel this year.His book is also about the trevails of a little boy abandoned by his father.... Hmmm. My advice to anyone who likes John Irving? Skip this one. Read Owen Meaney."},{"rating":"1","title":"NUMB!","review":"I think I have read most of John Irvings books. I always liked the quirky characters and the dark humor. This book has none of that. I am no prude, but I thought the abuse of Jack was to much. What on earth would high school girls find sexually interesting about a 5 year old! The older women of course were just flat out sick pedophiles. It was hard to connect with Jack, or any of the characters because we really didn't know what they were feeling. This is pretty amazing because the narration drones on and ond and on. I would not recommend this book to anyone. If you want to read a darky funny book about a pedophile, read \\"Lolita\\". It's much better written and a whole lot shorter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Done with Irving.","review":"After the monstrously bad \\"Fourth Hand\\" and now this grotesque piece of writing, one has to wonder if Garp, Cider House Rules, Owen Meany and Widow for One Year exhausted Irving's reservoir of talent. The resonance of echoed phrases such as \\"beware the undertoad\\" are now supplanted by annoying tics - \\"not in front of Jack,\\" \\"the little guy,\\" and \\"baby cakes.\\" There is no depth in or empathy for these characters. Perhaps Irving's eleventh-hour decision to hastily rewrite in the third person was a mistake - perhaps the work, from Jack's point of view...no matter how personally painful for Irving...would have been more engaging and would have eliminated his annoying need to explain and deconstruct every action or thought for us. After persevering for 300 pages, I threw this book down in disgust. Luckily, I'm a neat reader and was able to return my copy for full credit at Borders. (Review updated so as not to be anonymous)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and disturbing","review":"The first 100 pages were good, typical Irving. Then it was almost like someone else was writing it. It was missing all of the cleverness and witt of his earlier novels. I was left with a bunch of whiny characters that I did not like. Reading about a child being sexually abused once would have been enough, but for some reason this child was abused by almost every girl or woman he met. I found that very disturbing and it made me wonder just what happened to Irving in his childhood to write such a story. I do not recommend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This One was a Disappointment","review":"I love John Irving. I've read at least a dozen of his books, and he's one of the few authors that I've bothered to check out the website of. But, in my opinion, this was not a very good book. At all. It was the slowest moving stories I have read in a long time. I didn't think I would ever reach the end, and got no satisfaction when I finally did. The story is funky, like much of Irving's works, but very dark in nature and not memorable. A few weeks after reading it, I couldn't even describe the story to a friend. All I could remember was tattoos, organ music, and transvestites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Until I find You, by John Irving","review":"This was truly one of the most disgusting, perverted, and outlandish books I've read. None of the characters had redeeming qualities, the story line was ridiculous and didn't hold together, and the book should have been edited from 800+ pages to 150 pages. Don't read the book; it's not worth doing so. This is another John Irving book focusing on perverted sex, prostitutes and ridiculous story lines.Until I Find You"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read his others instead","review":"So, so bad. At his best -- A Widow for One Year, for example -- Irving is Balzacian/Dickensian/Sterne-like in his energy, robustness, tenderness, humor and sheer narrative pace and force. This misses out in just about every way. Irving is obviously a major, major novelist so my negative review of this piece is just an alert to anyone who has not read his earlier work that this is almost certain to be a disappointment; but perhaps part of being a great writer is risk-taking and pushing of boundaries so from that perspective this is just a push too far. Read Widow for One Year instead and marvel."},{"rating":"1","title":"same old same old","review":"I used to be a big John Irving fan. Now, however, I'm disappointed and BORED. Mr. Irving has become repetitive. Prostitutes, sexually aggrressive teenage girls, precocious children, irrespnsible/careless parents....I mean, come ON! The first three-four books were interesting/shocking/saddening/enlightening etc...but now it's like watching another movie sequel...Police Academy VII or Rocky VIII....I won't read John Irving again until he switches genre. Maybe he should try horror or mystery or sci-fi....anything different!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghost of Robertson Davies morphing into porn?","review":"I'm about 200 pages into this book and I have to say I detected strong notes of Robertson Davies during the European stage of the story. I would be willing to bet Irving had recently read the Depthford Trilogy around the time Until We Meet Again was being formulated.After that I find this book really descends into softcore porn. The age of Jack during his first sexual (abusive?) experiences is a bit disturbing. Not sure I'm going to finish this one.Bottom line is disappointment. The brilliance of Owen Meany will keep me trying every Irving book that comes out but this is one I'm likely to spit out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointing","review":"First let me begin by saying that John Irving is one of my favorite authors. I read some of his other books time and time again and give them out as gifts.That being said, I did not like a Widow for One Year, or The Fourth Hand (Irving's two prior novels). However, the strength of Cider House Rules and A Prayer for Owen Meaney made me pre-order this book.Being a true Irving fan, I stuck with this to the bitter end. Unfortunately Irving has become formulaic and, at times, tedious. I did not like the prostitution themes or the tatoo ones. They were boring and contrived and really did not contribute to the novel.Irving did have some flashes of brilliance (his character, Emma) but they were too few and far between to keep even the most ardent fan reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Dull and Soooo Long","review":"John Irving is one of my top 5 favorite writers of all time. I'm thrilled every time he writes a new book and can't wait to read it. This one, for some reason, I bought but didn't read for over a year. Then when I started it, I wished I hadn't.It's self-indulgent, mind-numbingly boring and needs an editor sooooo badly (why is it so many publishers allow their famous writers to ramble on with no editing? It's like they're afraid to edit them!) Such a disappointment, and the worst Irving book I've read. Please please please Mr. Irving, hire a good editor for your next one because, if I have to read another one this awful, it will be the last book of yours I buy :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"I had read a lot of John Irving when I was younger and was excited to read a new book of his. But this very long book is way below his usual standard.The characters are unlikable and not believable and it just goes on and on. If you want to read John Irving try his earlier work."},{"rating":"1","title":"800 pages of bizarreness & boredom","review":"Where was the editor to prevent this \\"opus\\" from having NO waistline?????"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Novel, Challenging Read","review":"As usual, John Irving has populated a book with quirky characters and situations. He has claimed that this is his most autobiographical work, which in a sense is a bit disturbing. He deals intimately with issues of child abuse and several brands of incest from some very unexpected angles.This is not a feel-good beach read, and it tends to loop back on itself from time-to-time in classic John Irving fashion, but it is well worth taking home. John Irving is truly an American literary master."},{"rating":"1","title":"John! You let me down!","review":"I've been a big Irving fan, pre-GARP. I used to enjoy how he'd defend his earlier work when everyone was singing GARP'S praises. He has since changed his approach, giving GARP credit for allowing him the financial freedom to have the luxury of time to invest in his books, allowing him the latitude to write the books he wants to write leisurely. So, how does he explain this overblown exercise? I became, sadly, bored by the hero's sex life before he had even turned 14. The world that tattoo artists occupy was much better realized in last year's THE ELECTRIC MICHAELANGELO (although I did like the phrase, \\"sleeping in the needles.\\") But this is a week I will never get back again. This also reminds of the later books of James Michener, which didn't show any sign of an editor's pencil. Has Irving reached a point where his publishers' feel every word he writes is golden and worthy of inclusion? This may have been a wonderful 200 page book, but it is a lousy one for 800 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Until I Find You","review":"I was hoping that John Irvings new novel would be better than his last \\"The Fourth Hand\\". What a disappointment, after reading all 800 pages I wish I would have put it away after the first 100 pages. This is the worst of all his writings and does not compare to \\"World According to Garp\\", \\"Hotel New Hampshire\\" or \\"Cider House Rules\\". This story could have been told in 300 pages and saved a whole lot of people time that they will never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Like","review":"A friend recommended this book. I had a very hard time reading it due to all of the child sexual abuse. In fact, I skipped the middle portion and jumped to the end to find out what actually happened to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's fun that he mentioned my home town of Halifax!","review":"It was alright. John Irving seems to be re-writing his own story the way he wished it had happened--the hairy sexually dominant older girl, for example. But a few things were left sloppy and the author's voice could be so frustrating. As with all John Irving novels, I wanted to shout at him for drawing all the wrong conclusions about people, yet I couldn't put the book down.For more, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I am a loyal fan of John Irving and in this review, there is no \\"but\\" following that statement. I loved this book. I got lost in the story. I never noticed how many pages went by as I followed his characters through one adventure/mishap after another. I loved this book because it tells an engaging story with unique characters who may not find what they are looking for, may never find redemption, but keep me white-knuckled at their sides the whole time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"Irving needs a new editor. Many chapters could be cut to a few paragraphs - Zurich would be my first choice to get out the scissors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Until I Find a Better Story , by John Irving","review":"John Irving said in an interview that getting through these 800 hundred plus pages would pay off in the end for the book's readers. The only satisfaction I got at the end of it, though, was the thought of not reading it anymore. It's not worth the time you'll spend on it. I think John Irving just needed to put something out."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a screenplay","review":"The reviewers seem to miss the point - it's written for a movie, as befits the book - If you like Irving stick with it, the middle get a bit monotonous but the last 200 pages are well done and the ending is made for Hollywood. Look for it in your local cinema soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Irving, but not this one","review":"I am a John Irving fan, but not about this book. I read the entire book in not too much time. But, I kept hoping that it would get better. In the beginning I was disturbed, his point I'm sure. In the middle, I was still disturbed. And then the end seemed trite. There was so much drama early on and so little to resolve it that is seemed over done. I agree with the other reviewers that it was his first book where I was bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I enjoyed this book. I wouldn't say it was the best I've ever read, but it flowed, and dealt with the theme of pain that is introduced in childhood and how it affects the rest of your life. I thought this was done in a reasonably effective way. Certainly not as good as Owen Meany or Garp, but definitely better than the Fourth Hand. Others seem to have been offended by the penis focus, which I wouldn't call soft core or offensive. It wasn't prurient at all. Overall, a good summer (or winter) read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desperately seeking an editor!","review":"Has John Irving become such a literary cash machine that no editor has the spine to tell him to delete his endless self-indulgent droning?This book is disappointing on so many levels that I couldn't stomach it after about two hundred pages. First and foremost are the sexual experiences of Jack as a child which struck me as disturbing bordering on sick. Some of the things done to him at his school would be punishable by lengthy jail terms.As a person who reads an average of three books a month, I can't remember when I disliked a book this intensely. Tomorrow I am going back to the book store where I purchased this and get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER should have been published","review":"Love John Irving; hated this book. If the author had not been JI, I believe this book would never have been published. The first 150+ pages are beyond boring. -- THEN, the 8-year-old begins having sex.There was not a single character that elicited any feeling other than boredom. A child was repeatedly molested and several main characters died, but they were such empty shells that there was no emotional impact.-- A horrible waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another story, please","review":"It took me a year to read this. First time a John Irving book bored me. The constant sexual abuse in the beginning of the book is disturbing, then tedious. I only finished it to see if I actually could! I don't recommend this book at all. Go back to A Prayer for Owen Meany or Ciderhouse Rules if you want to read a GOOD John Irving book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring--a terrible disappointment","review":"I own most of John Irving's novels, and have greatly enjoyed the majority of them. When I saw this novel at a church bazaar, for only $2.50, I was pleased to find such a bargain--now all the more so because it certainly isn't worth the cover price.Struggling around the halfway mark I am not enthusiastic about finishing this enormous tome. Simply put, it's terribly boring and redundant (frankly I'm tired reading about Emma holding Jack's penis), and none of the characters are very engaging, especially Jack. (BTW, I did NOT vote for George W. Bush and consider myself a liberal Christian.)This is not the John Irving of old ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A death march","review":"I too am a devoted John Irving fan who treasures \\"Owen Meaney,\\" \\"Cider House,\\" \\"Son of A Circus\\" and the like. So it was with great anticipation (and trepidation, 800+ pages!) that I started \\"Until I Find You.\\" And it is with great sadness that I join the others here who found the book to be a disappointment. I never connected or felt empathy for Jack Burns. The only character I rooted for was Emma and the novel falls apart soon after she departs. For the first time in one of his novels, Irving is trying too hard to impress us with detail. Characters are introduced with mind-numbing detail within less than 100 pages of the end of the book; characters who ultimately add nothing to the narrative or atmosphere of the book. I too was bored and finished it out of obstinance, not out of any sense of curiosity. This book could have been edited down to two-thirds its length, but alas, what would have been left wouldn't have been much of a novel anyway. I cannot recommond this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Until I Find you","review":"This is the worst John Irving's novel. It is boring, nonsensical and repeats the story several times. The prose is cumbersome, especially constant repeat of irritating phrases. Do not waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Irving's worst so far","review":"Wish I'd thought to read the Amazon.com review before buying this one, now I'm embarrassed that I've helped put it in 5th place on the best-sellers list. As a long-time Irving fan I felt I needed to finish it, what a chore! Yes, it improved somewhat towards the end, but I came away feeling I'd wasted a huge amount of time. But I suspect that a skillful (and ruthless) screenwriter might be able to salvage enough to make an OK movie if the first three-fourths are handled as very brief flashbacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!","review":"I am a huge John Irving fan and have been for years. And this was one of the worst books I have ever read. Maybe my expectations were too high. Where was John's editor? This was over 800 pages of child abuse, not-so-sexy deviant sex and tattoos. And it's such a shame because Irving is such a gifted writer and so great at character development. The last 100 pages felt like the Bataan Death March to me but I finished it. And I wasn't rewarded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I am a huge John Irving fan, but I really can't think of anything good to say about this story.Too much ink was devoted to young Jack, his penis and its appeal to older women. Although Irving is generally a master at introducing information that becomes important later in the story, I didn't find that to be the case with this book at all.Also, I think it is a story that took much too long to tell. Yet, it ended on a VERY weak note."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I usually love John Irving books, but this one is a bummer. There is an interesting twist midway through the novel, but not worth the pain of reading it all. The characters are completely unsympathetic, the plot drags and the ending is abrupt, despite the length of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he thinking when he wrote this?","review":"Horrible. Boring. Flat. What was he thinking? I actually had to double-check that this was written by the same John Irving as Garp and Ciderhouse, not someone else capitalizing on his name."},{"rating":"2","title":"maybe not the best, but still a great Irving novel","review":"What makes John Irving my favorite author is how his characters embody the best and worst of humanity. They could truly be real people; some of them you wish you could meet, others you're glad are not alive (but you're aware there are people out there like them). \\"Until I Find You\\" exposes an issue (sexual abuse) that is very real and does happen to people, much like \\"The Cider House Rules\\" speaks of abortion. And while this is only a novel, and should be read that way, I do think that people need to be aware of the power our choices have on not only our own lives, but others as well. It is a long book, but just like the other John Irving novels I own and have read, I couldn't put it down until I finished it...even though there are sections I would rather roll my eyes at. I agree with another reviewer that this is probably not the novel to begin with. \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany\\" might be a bette choice, a warm up, if you will."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's hard to belive how bad this book is","review":"This is probably the dumbest book I've ever read--and I read a lot. So many words, so little story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear John","review":"Dear John Irving,Please get a better editor, someone who will be honest with you about what you have written. I'm begging you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garp again?","review":"No doubt John Irving is a great writer. So why has he re-written, or re-packaged another \\"World According to Garp\\"? The names of the characters have changed, the locations - mostly, but the plot is a rehash. Too bad because he is a great writer. Time I think he needs to move on to different plots, step out and take chances, he has the chops, why does he hesitate? Come on John, we've read this already, go someplace new, enough of the absent father, we get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible author, maybe not so much this time","review":"Please do not be put off from reading other John Irving novels because of the negative reviews, including mine, of \\"Until I Find You.\\" Absolutely check out \\"The World According to Garp, \\"A Prayer For Owen Meany, or \\"Cider House Rules.\\" Irving is masterful at creating unique, quirky, endearing characters. But not in this one. Any likable character in this novel is miniscule and rare. In addition, I am still pondering Irving's eerily light treatment of the overwhelming amount of child abuse his main character Jack has to sustain. Sexual abuse is dished out by practically every girl or woman Jack encounters. This makes for a depressing book that also seemed to go on far too long. That said, I strongly recommend this author as one of the best at walking the thin line between comedy and tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry I read this novel","review":"Irving has lost his mind! This was sad to read as it just dragged on forever with no reward in sight. The taboo subjects were a little creepy but its main problem was that he wasted these developed characters on a dull, repetitive story. I think he is (was?) one of the greatest American writers alive. He must have a comeback novel next time out. If not, I think someone should check in on him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment","review":"Irving is one of my top favorite authors...but I was SO disappointed in \\"Until I Find You.\\" I could not relate to any of the characters. I thought they were all miserable and just plain pathetic. I held out until about page 600 until I gave up and put the book down. I didn't even care to know what happened to the main character, Jack, at the end.Jack's mother is a tattoo artist. The book goes into heavy detail about tattooing, which I found totally unnecessary and frankly, a distraction from an already convoluted plot. In fact, three quarters of the way through the book I still couldn't figure out what exactly we were supposed to care about with this plot.Was the whole point that that people are misguided, confused and damaged? Who knows. The characters were just so annoying and unlikeable that I found it to be a real chore to read this book.Read ANY of Irving's other books before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Owen Meany to Jack Burns","review":"Jack Burns is a taciturn one-dimensional character who can't say no. Not to his mother, his roommate, his dates, his teachers, nor any authority figure. We're supposed to think he had a hard life, but really he made his own hell.This book is one of John Irving's failures. I am glad I read it but will not give it to any friends unless they ask specifically for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"As someone else wrote: Boring, but I would also add......","review":"Tedious. I'm afraid that I can't see anything to like. Rather than continuing with the punishment I put it down tonight after 580 pages.I'm somewhat of a fan, I think that 'Owen' and 'Ciderhouse' are excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"If there was a way to give a book zero stars I would. This hurts because I adore John Irving and have used his books in several of my classes. I agree with the previous reviewer in that I would feel extremely guilty passing this book on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing For Any Irving Fan","review":"I've read everything John Irving's published, and this is clearly his weakest effort. One tires pretty quickly of hundreds of pages of penis-holding! The book is populated by the most self-involved, unlikable, tedious characters he's ever created; it just plain gets hard to care that much about them. I like Irving's quirks- I really do- but nothing rings true here, and the few attempts at humor fall flat. This was a waste of my time and his talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Just Couldn't Persist","review":"As you can tell from the reviews, you will either love or hate John Irving's latest novel, \\"Until I Met You\\". I tried and tried...and even though I got pretty disgusted reading about the main chacter, \\"Jack's Little Guy\\" (his penis), I tried to finish it. But alas, I got as far as page 500 (over half-way!) and just decided that LIFE IS TOO SHORT to keep reading bad fiction.I noticed that Amazon is offering a deal on this novel together with Nick Hornby's \\"A Long Way Down\\"...just get that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Irving","review":"When I was around page 300, I debated whether or not to stop reading this disaster, but I continued on, hoping for the Irving payback at the end, a la \\"A Prayer from Owen Meany.\\" After over 3 months invested in reading this book in short spurts, I arrived at the end, wishing that I had those hours of my life back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best, but...","review":"My first Irving novel was Garp, after which I went back and read Setting Free the Bears and the 158 Pound Marriage before resuming the chronology. Cider House remains my favorite.I had to force myself to keep reading this one at first; I think I was looking for the heart of the novel, and I didn't really find it until Jack's sister is introduced. Some of the humorous scenes are strained--you're not sure whether you're supposed to be laughing or not. The novel could easily lose about 150 pages without significant loss of texture.Nevertheless, when I'd finished it, I felt a sense of satisfaction. The spirits of damaged people triumph in the end. It reminds me a sticking with a friend through years of tribulation until, finally, he conquers or at least compromises with his demons."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a way to end a book","review":"I found the book to be odd, amusing, and sad in classic Irving fashion. I really liked this book. I didn't love it the way I did \\"A Widow for One Year\\" or \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany,\\" but I was compelled throughout the book to its finish. The final act of the book is so lovely. Maybe I was so moved because I had read of John Irving's plight with his own father, but this ending literally left me in tears and has stuck with me in the months since I read it. Maybe not the best Irving book to start with, but I think this book nicely compliments his collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of My Time","review":"I am an avid reader and love to experiment with new authors. However, I will NEVER pick up a John Irving book again. I made it through about 200 pages of Until I Find You and decided the content (namely the 16 year old girl teaching sex to an 8 year old boy) nearly made me crawl out of my skin. I think I am a pretty open minded person....but this was too much. In addition, I had no connection to Jack at all. Really could care less about the characters. I passed it on to a John Irving fan....maybe they will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is child molestation pornography in graphic detail","review":"This is a book that only a pedophile would want to read. It is blatent and unappoligetically child pornography. It contains graphic details about the molestation of a 4 year year old boy through his adulthood. This book does not have artistic integrity. It really is just pornography for the sick, sick, sick. When it refers to this repeated molestation by all sorts of women as abuse Irving puts the word abuse in quotations - \\"abuse.\\" This implies that it is really not abuse, when in fact any sexual contact with four year olds should unequivically be considered molestation and violation and rape of a child. John Irving should have more social responsibility than to put this kind of sewage out there.I will not finish it. Though, I will try to read future novels as I have long been an avid fan of Iring's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Until I find you.","review":"I liked how Economist magazine noted this best selling novel, \\"John Irving has lots of fans. That, or there are thousands out there willing to pay for 1.4kg of penile obsession\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"a great audio version","review":"I just finished the unabridged audio of this book, and it's great. Maybe because I didn't have to heft the 800 pages, or because the narrator is excellent with all the foreign places and phrases, it was a very easy listen, completely entertaining, and rather profound in parts. Part travelogue, part memoir (I'm an old Irving fan, and have read of his own 'lost' father), and part over-the-top tale of child sexual-abuse and the confusion it creates in an adult's sexuality & life, I was sorry when the cassette tapes ran out in my car and I couldn't follow Jack and Heather further through their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Good Book as far as I am concerned","review":"Well I must say I really like this book. Long. Yes. Difficult. Yes. Very challenging subject matter. Yes. All that said I really think it is a good John Irving book and just a good book period. It does take work but sticking with it pays off. I must say I write this as someone who experienced childhood sexual abuse and part of my life was about forced sexuality. In the way Irving writes about this and the characters who he writes about show an understanding of the bizarre painful and challenging dynamics of early life for some of us.I say give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Child Molestation???","review":"I've been a huge fan of JI since the beginning of his careeer; however, I've read through 300 pages of his lastest novel and am appalled to find it contains nothing but episodes of child molestation.Jack Burns is molested by older girls and women from the age of 4 and is raped by a babysitter at the age of 10. I don't care if these \\"experiences\\" help shape his character in later years. They are disturbing and not at all entertaining.Why hasn't anyone mentioned this??? Maybe if the main character were a girl and she were being molested there would be an outcry...but since it's a boy, I guess people think it's acceptable.I'm throwing the book in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I ordered this book before publication because I am such a fan.

When I was researching for a new pillow, this got really good reviews so I purchased this pillow. I have to say that this pillow is not comfortable at all. I tried to sleep on it for several nights. It does not contour to your neck, it puts her neck in an uncomfortable angle. As per other reviews, I did try the pillow without the cover, but it was still uncomfortable.My husband also tried to sleep on this pillow and he got a headache from it. My mom was looking for a new therapy type pillow and I gave her the Pike Street Micro Bead Therapy Pillow and she used it one night and said it was VERY uncomfortable. She had other negative things to say about it, but bottom line is that we all feel that this pillow is not very comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe for really big people","review":"I tried this pillow and figured it was for a bigger person. Too big for me. My husband didn't like it. My sister didn't like it. My son's caregiver didn't like it. My brother didn't like it. Now I have it back. This pillow seems like it should be comfortable but it's not. I think it's for a giant person. Your head is just too far off the bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This pillow is deceiving.","review":"When I first received this pillow I thought it was very hard. I'm a side sleeper and I need my pillow to be somewhat cushy. But, as soon as I laid down on it I realized that the beads adjust to your weight and support your neck perfectly. I have had this pillow for about a month and I think it is very comfortable. It won't end up being a bag of cotton balls like other pillows I've slept on. However, my husband (who is a back sleeper) tried this pillow for 1 night and said he couldn't sleep on it so he didn't want me to order one for him. That's okay, though. This way he won't be trying to take mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuffed too full - so it's not soft enough","review":"Stuffed too full and cover is too small making the pillow too dense and hard.

After scolding my husband and washing all the bed linens again, I settled in for a good nights sleep. WRONG!!! I got up and found myself covered in microbeads. They were all over the bed, me and the floor. After moving the pillow off of the bed, I noticed puffs of microbeads coming out of several microscopic holes in the pillow.

Not a good product in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have another microbead pillow that I was looking to replace and decided on this one. As many suggested, I slept on it without the provided cover to prevent restriction of bead movement, but to no avail. It was still far too hard, too high and too over-filled for a petite person such as myself. My neck, shoulders and back seized up within 5-10 minutes of lying down.I put the cover on it, and my cat is now enjoying it immensely as his new bed, hence 2 stars instead of just one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pillow","review":"I have been sleeping with this pillow for about two weeks and I am very pleased with it. As other reviewers have recommended, if you buy this pillow you should not use the pillow case that it comes with as this restricts the ability of the beads to conform to your head and neck shape. This is a pillow for sleepers who need a supportive, conforming pillow but not one that is too soft and squishy. The pillow is quite firm when your head is resting on it. I find this pillow superior to my last memory foam pillow for both comfort and support. I would recommend this pillow to others and find it to be an excellent value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pillow","review":"Since receiving this pillow it is the only one that I use. Extremely comfortable!! I use to use 2 regular pillows and my neck would hurt me in the morning.One bit of advice. I was using the pillow without the cover and I tore off the tag on the side.

I now use the cover on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing pillow","review":"I'm kinda a pillow snob and I love this pillow. It's amazing, it feels just like those expensive ones you buy from Brookstone or the airport stores. It molds and mushes to just fit your head and neck. It's not too fluffy or too flat, it's just right. I love this pillow, hope to own more.**update** I have now had it a few months, and I still love it, but it is getting a little flat, looks like it may need to be replaced once if not twice a year, but I think it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"firm...how about like a brick!","review":"I am sure, based on some reviews, that this product works for some,but not me.

After a few days, I decided that the pillow was a keeper, so I threw away the box.I left on a cruise on June 11th with my new fabulous pillow.On June 15th, I felt little beads through the pillow case. I was surprised and checked into this further.Yep, little beads inside my pillow case. Thank goodness, I had a 2nd pillow case over it to catch the beads in. I placed everything in a large garbage bag and sealed it.I returned from the cruise on June 20th. I decided to take off both pillow cases, while holding the pillow above the garbage bin, to see where the problem was.There were TWO areas where the stitching was loose. Not one, but two!I had expected more for my money. Where is the quality control person??Don't buy this product unless you have an alternate use for the beads after 3 weeks of sleeping on them.Back to searching for a new pillow."},{"rating":"1","title":"A LEAKING MESS","review":"I was really looking forward to this pillow, I have heard good things from my friends about them. First night was a bit odd, the pillow is very firm and takes some getting used to. I could also feel little beads under the cover, between the pillow and the cover. During the second night I could feel there were more little beads under the pillow case. I looked to see what was going on in the middle of the night, the pillow was leaking beads at an end seam. This is like a bean bag leak but the beads very small. So, after two nights this thing goes back and I clean up the beads. I am disappointed as the pillow itself felt good, but this is a mess. I am opting for a refund of the product and shipping. I don't think I want to roll the dice on a replacement, I'll find something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Hard for Sleep","review":"I bought one of these for myself and my husband for Christmas. After a mix up with the order and waiting forever to get them we only used them maybe a month off and on. They were to firm and hard and made our necks hurt worse because they were so high. Some reviews said you had to give it time to get use to the difference, but I found myself reaching for my \\"old\\" pillow in the middle of the night and using this one between my knees. I even tried taking the pillow case it comes with off and using a standard pillow case...what a mess, I ended up with beads throughout the bed. My husband who likes a firmer pillow could not use it either and now both are in a spare drawer in storage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still a pain in my neck...","review":"I suffered terrible whiplash back in 1997 in an auto accident and have struggled for years with neck pain. After much searching I found the most relief I have ever felt. I began sleeping with a horse-shoe-shaped neck roll filled with bean-bag-chair-like stuffing purchased in an airport gift shop.When I spotted this pillow it seemed to be made out of basically the same materials... so I ordered it. I admit I was quite the skeptic... So when I received this I hung onto the packaging; \\"just in case\\"... one month turned into 2, then 3... I threw the packaging away ...You may have noticed that this was a 1 star review so here goes... I purchased this pillow in May of 2009... I am writing this review in October of 2009. I have had this pillow for only 5 short months and already it is worn out! It flattens when I place it under my neck and I wake up all night long chasing it around my bed. I am going back to the $12 neck roll from the airport! Don't waste your money... I did!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good if you're looking for a firm pillow","review":"This pillow is not soft and it feels like a bag of sand, but it does adapt to the shape of the body so I sleep comfortably. The pillow has two drawbacks. First of all, the stitches are not well done so the beads are leaking. (This is not a big problem for me since I always keep the pillow in the cover that came with the pillow and the cover doesn't leak anything.) Secondly, the pillow smells very badly, and the smell persists for weeks, so I couldn't use it right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wasn't what I expected","review":"I received the product a day after estimated delivery date which I guess isn't a big deal.

I would recommend this product to those who stay fairly still when they sleep. On the nights I have rolled over onto my back I find the pillow is not as comfortable. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and the pillow helps improve the alignment of my neck, shoulders, and spine when I sleep on my side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loves me like a rock","review":"The pillow arrived in a box with flimsy plastic protective packaging that didn't cover the merchandise.The pillow had a strong chemical odor. The odor hadn't subsided any after three days of airing.The pillow was about as comfortable as a concrete slab would be. It had almost no 'give,' even two hours after my head rested on it. It didn't stretch a bit. I used it without its cover (which supposedly makes it too firm for some users) and with a simple (and ample) pillowcase, which should have allowed it to stretch out. As far as molding to my head, it didn't mold at all.If you want a hard---and I do mean hard---pillow, this is for you. It will definitely support your head, because it has no 'give' to it. It MIGHT become more comfortable after a few nights of use, but I don't want to invest three or four nights of sleeplessness to find out. Your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pillow hurt my neck","review":"I found this pillow to be way too hard and it ended up hurting my neck while sleeping. I sleep on my side and sometimes semi-face down. It forced my neck into an awkward angle and it did not contour to my head at all. I didn't use the cover--hoping it would make the pillow more relaxed. It did, but it wasn't enough. Someone with a similar pillow said that it gets better over time. Unfortunately, I stuck with it for two months and there was no improvement.

I was in a several car accident outside of Boston in the late 80s and have neck problems and just couldn't find a good pillow. And as an engineer I even tried custom making a few. In short I read many of the reviews for several pillows and do agree that this is a very good pillow. What I have learned is that I need to take 5 second each night and re-fluff (or should I say squish) it and it works well for me. I wish you luck with your search for a good pillow. Oh by the way; I sleep on my side and have one of the sleep number beds. With that bed and this pillow I FINALLY sleep well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard and Hot","review":"Bought this pillow because it is supposed to keep your head cool (compared to other types of pillows). This pillow becomes much hotter than regular pillows and requires me to flip the pillow to its opposite side much more often than standard pillows. This pillow is also very hard. Initially when you place your head on it, it does a good job of forming to the correct shape for support, but once it is set it feels almost rock hard. Definitely would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard","review":"These pillows were too hard due to being over stuffed. I tried to not use the pillow case but still too uncomfortable.

The only issue I had after the first 2 weeks was that the seam opened up a little and started leaking out the pillow filling. I used a glue gun to seal up that hole and just went ahead and glued all along the seam that had leaked. That seems to have taken care of it. But overall, it's super comfortable to sleep on. I also use it to sit propped up while reading and the firmness is great for that. I was attracted to the fact that you can purchase just one (rather than the requirement to purchase 2 Tony Littles) and the price. For those who like a firm yet comfy pillow, this is a good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stopped my husband from complaining of his neck hurting","review":"My husband was complaining of having neck pain for a good two months without having any obvious injury. He went to the chiropractor a couple of times and it would feel better for a day but then would start hurting again. I finally got fed up with him complaining so I read hundreds of reviews on pillows on Amazon and finally decided on this one. One of the main reasons i bought this pillow is I wanted one that would hold it's shape and not be too hot because my husband tends to sweat at night. After sleeping on this pillow for two nights he hasn't had any neck pain at all. Like previous reviews it was too hard with the pillowcase it comes with so he put it in a normal pillow case and so far for almost two months it has held it's shape. Would recommend this to anyone that feels they are having neck pains from the way they are sleeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Micro Bead Therapy Pillow","review":"This pillow is not what I expected it to be.

It wore out and I couldn't get it any longer on Amazon. So, I saw this \\"comparable\\" pillow in structure and content. Or so I thought. When I opened the box, I noticed a strong chemical smell. When I opened the plastic bag it shipped in, it stunk so badly, I crammed it right back into the bag. My eyes watered, throat burned and I got an instant headache with nausea. The noxious fumes coming from the pillow are unbearable. I put it back in the box and set in the garage until I could return it. When I went into the garage the next day, the whole garage stunk. These cannot be healthy fumes. And, when you think about your nose being that close to the pillow all night...and your brain...what is it that you're breathing in?!?!Went back to the Tony Little micro bead pillow. Yes, it only lasts about 6-8 months but at least I'm not inhaling toxic, carcinogenic chemicals and fumes.Sorry - bad product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not have my head on this pillow for more than a minute or so","review":"I couldn't wait for my head to sink into the microbeads on this pillow when I took it out of the box. Firstly, it sat in the spare room for a couple of days as it smelled horrible (I'm guessing it's the smell of the new microbeads) but when I did put it on the bed I could not have my head on it for more than a minute or so.

This pillow looked like a good switch that would probably hold up for several years and keep my head cool. After using it two weeks until the pillow started leaking beads, it was neither. Instead of the pillow conforming to my head and neck, my head would sit on top of the pillow without any sort of give. I found a way around this by fluffing the pillow while my head was resting on it. I used the spandex cover that was included since the first day but it made the pillow stiffer and less breathable. As far as the pillow being able to breathe, I would wake up with sweat under my head when our room is kept around 70 degrees. Overall, this pillow did not last and was not comfortable enough to want another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too thin for side sleepers","review":"I've tried this pillow for several nights now, and haven't has a good night's rest yet. This morning I woke up with the right side of my face numb in addition to my neck and shoulder aching. The problem is that the beads need to bunched up to make it thick enough to support your neck, but that makes it very hard too, so the tendency is to attempt to readjust it throughout the night.

It's super stiff and isn't soft like a pillow at all. At least not the ones I'm used to. A few good things about it is that it offers great support for your neck and it basically always keeps it shapes and doesn't go flat. Although it's stiff, I wake up with my neck feeling stronger and I don't have shoulder pain like I do when I sleep on regular pillows hence the quotation marks around therapy. Maybe that's what the pillows designed for, to relieve neck and shoulder pain. I'm happy with it, just not what I expected.

After 1 month of continuous use it has retained its shape and distributes weight well.There is one modest suggestion. I would put in a few pockets of soft cushion on top of the bean padding. This would make the pillow more comfortable. The pockets would require sewing in to assure that they don't wander. A silicon jell pack or a cotton (preferred) would work best. People who will pay for this pillow won't mind the additional cost.If this review was helpful, please add your vote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like sleeping on a brick","review":"This pillow is wayyyy to firm for me.

I read about these micro bead pillows and it sounded interesting. So I ordered it and tried to sleep on it and it was too hard by a long shot. It is even too hard to sit on, never mind rest your head on. If you are looking for something with absolutely zero give then this might be for you. Not even suitable for camping."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I've been looking for the perfect pillow for months now. I have a pinched nerve and herniated disk in my neck. I spend a lot of time tossing and turning. I use a squishy microbead pillow to provide some support and I hoped this would do the trick throughout the night. Unfortunately it was so packed with beads it doesn't give enough to cradle my neck and head. It's terribly stiff and hard and I haven't even put on the cover. I'll be returning this and continue searching for the right pillow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not supportive","review":"Pillow is kind of like a bean bag. When you lay on it the beads just push off to each side leaving no neck support unless you constantly hug the pillow to keep the beads together. Always waking up to a flat pillow. Waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best pillow EVER!","review":"I purchased this pillow from Amazon about two years ago. I have always liked a firm pillow for head support, as I am a side sleeper. This pillow is fabulous for head support. The quality is very good. As recommended in the previous reviews, it is best to keep the included cover on the pillow. This keeps it firm and to keep it's shape. After two years I still love this pillow. I travel quite a bit and wish I could take it with me everywhere I go. I would highly recommend this pillow to those who are side sleepers who's shoulders get \\"in the way\\" thoughout the night. Love, love, love this pillow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pike Street Micro Bead Pillow: Excellent. Cover: Very bad.","review":"The pillow iself is excellent--cushy but resilient, completely as advertized. However, the cover that comes with it is much too small. It fits so snugly that it turns the cushy, resilient pillow into a hard cushion--something you might want to sit on, but not rest your head on. I made myself a nice loose cover out of an old flannel sheet, allowing the pillow enough room to \\"give\\" when I put my head on it, and that solved the problem. Now it's perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"It leaked beads all over my bedroom","review":"I got this pillow and figured I'd give it a shot. First off the thing is horribly hard. I've had it for awhile and it just sits on the floor because I can't sleep on it. If you want a mircofill pillow you can pick one up from Walgreens for about $6.00. Those are better to sleep on.On morning I noticed that the cover felt weird so I opened it up and there were beads everywhere. I put the cover on like it said but there was a small hole in the side. This thing leaked beads all over my bedroom. I had to sew the pillow back up with some heavy thread and it worked. I then spent 30 minutes vacuuming up beads.This thing is not worth the money when you can get the same thing at other stores for under $10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bean Bag pillow","review":"I have always been on a quest for the perfect pillow. My husband teases me that I am a pillow addict with my collection that I have now. I ordered this pillow because it was way out of my norm. And it was a good risk. My neck problems went away and I am sleeping through the night. But there are a few things you will need to get used to. You can't flop down on the pillow like a fiber filled one. It doesn't give like that. The filling is made up of those little beads you find in a bean bag. It has a soft and stretching covering. Sometimes during the night the beads have shifted to the top of the pillow and I need to push them back into place but I have gotten used to it now so I am not aware that I even had to do it. This pillow is a good purchase but understand that it takes some getting used to."},{"rating":"2","title":"***** Comfort!","review":"I purchased a pair of these pillows and they are wonderful. I fall asleep quickly since I'm not adjusting every minute. I sleep soundly and wake without the terrible neck and shoulder pain. The design and beads conform to your neck and head and give gental support throughout the night, also they seem to be much much cooler than standard pillows, a real plus during California summers. On the old scale of 1 - 10 these are a 10 and a must buy.In response to other posts - Yes, the cases provided are too small for the pillows, I used doubled cotton cases instead and works great. The other comment I read in earlier reviews was the smell...strong scent of fiberglass when unwrapped but I let the pillows completely air out for a week before using and they are fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a Brick","review":"So I purchased this pillow to help curb my increasing pinch nerve neck pain. Let me just say it's about as comfortable as lying on a brick. No give. And it's hot regardless if you put a pillow case on it or not. I used it a few times and was curious to see how it was holding up. Opened up the soft case it came in - and beads burst out.. Styrofoam beads everywhere - good times. I would recommend the Cervical pillow instead - it did wonders for me - no more pain, no more shoulder pain or numbness in my arms and hands or biting pain in the shoulder. check it out - a better option IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG the smell!","review":"I should have listened to the person who indicated this pillow was a bit odiferous. Seller was excellent in getting product to me, but it cannot be used by someone with adrenal stress or chemical sensitivities because the smell is overwhelming. Wasn't cost effective to return it.

I am not sure what will help me and my individual problem short of going back in time 30 years, I have severe arthritis in my neck and shoulders. It was worth trying it out. Just because it did not work for me doesn't mean it won't work for you. The pillow is well made and of great quality. Delivery was quick and no problem with return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pillow ~ if you ignore the pillowcase","review":"This is a wonderfully supportive pillow that is neither too soft or hard. I love the way these microbeads work! However, once you squeeze it into the pillowcase that comes with it, the pillow has no room to move, and it becomes harder. I just slipped it into a regular one I had leftover.These pillows have done wonders for me as I suffer from chronic pain and migraines. I have had real trouble sleeping - and the instant I tried one of these pillows I had such an improvement in my sleep that I became a believer.

The only problem is staking my claim before my cat settles in (she does not like to give it up).

It's the first pillow I've been able to use in years that hasn't left me with stiff shoulders, neck and a morning headache. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the fact that the pillow case that come with the pillow is to small, the zipper was defective, and if you put the pillow on the case they provide, it's rock hard and you couldn't possibly sleep on it. On top of that, the material the case is made from a rather rough material that wouldn't be conducive to a good night's sleep.I read the reviews, and was prepared for this issue. My regular pillow case on it and haven't had any problems with it at all. I would recommend this pillow to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel comfortable and good for neck","review":"It feels firm but comfortable and it is good for neck. I really like this product.

The pillow can curl around my head to maximize the contact area and there is no pain after sleep.The only problem is, as I just discovered a few days ago, the pillow causes static electricity. I think you can see sparkles at night if you scrub it. I know static electricity is not good for human body, so I am not sure if I should use it anymore.I hope the producer can give an evaluation on the effect of the static electricity the pillow causes on human health. Before that, I won't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard for me","review":"Firmness of pillows is a matter of taste. The same can be said beds, and 1000 other things. De gustibus non est disputandum. For me this pillow is very firm. I normally sleep with down or down-alternative pillows. I slept (poorly) with this micro-bead pillow for one night and woke up with a stiff neck. It is going back to the Amazon mothership. Your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very hard and not comfortable","review":"I do understand that the pillow will need to be firm for treatment of specific neck and spinal conditions. However this pillow is very hard and does not provide much opportunity to conform to ones preference. The description is correct that it holds it shape. It will most likely hold it shape since there is very little room to fluff the pillow. The product may be good for some but not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"HARD!!!","review":"I got this for my husband. This pillow is hard as a rock! I do believe when you put a pillow case on, it makes it so the beads can't move, my husband could not sleep on this pillow.

Even without the pillow case, this pillow is hard!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SMELL is a big problem","review":"The biggest problem with this pillow was the smell - it was extremely strong. I tried several different things to get rid of it, I even washed it in my front loading washer, but nothing worked. It took several weeks and almost daily pillow case changes before the smell was tolerable to sleep with. Even after all that, I really wanted this pillow to help my neck pain, but it made it worse. This is basically a large version of the travel pillows with the beads in them that you buy at the airport. It may work for some people, but for me it was too hard and uncomfortable, and the ordeal of getting rid of the smell was not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what expected","review":"This pillow is rock hard, there are so many micro beads in it that it will not conform or properly support (you can't even conform a fist into this pillow) any body part much less my head.

I tore off the label ... and the pillow tore,(Please note: I always tear off pillow labels and have never before had the pillow tear!)spewing tiny beads everywhere. Very difficlt to get up, like tiny styrofoam beads. I painstakingly sewed up the rip (I do not sew) and only then, when I went to toss the torn-off label, did I find a second label which had been sewn under the first label.

I had tried my friend's micro bead pillow from another company, but she couldn't remember which company (the tag was long gone). Hers was incredibly comfortable. This pillow from Pike Street is the WORST pillow I have ever slept on, even including those tiny camping pillows. Within 10 minutes of resting my head on it, my neck started to hurt. I tried side, back, and stomach positions to see if any would alleviate the pain. The only thing that alleviated the pain was putting the pillow on the floor and switching back to my other pillows. Unless you know you like hard pillows, I suggest you stay far away from this. Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard as a rock","review":"Really disappointed with this pillow!

I look forward to the sequel!I meant to give the book 5 stars but accidentally gave it only 4, and cannot change the rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for a beach read","review":"I admit to having purchased this book solely because of the title. I then read it over a beach-weekend and found it suitable: decent plot, fast-paced, didn't require much thought, and up-beat. Being a parrot owner, I found quite a few issues with the author's details on parrot behaviour and care (for example, chocolate for parrots is a huge no-no since it is toxic). But for most people, the side-kick antics of the parrot will be mildly amusing. The main character is likeable enough and though there is no depth to the character development, it was enough to keep my attention .... at the beach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best novel","review":"This is the best novel I've read in many, many years. The characters of the lady poet and the samurai are profoundly engaging. I felt I learned a great deal about them, about medieval Japan, and about human love and loss. This is a war story and a love story I will want to read again. It is powerfully and even beautifully written. I don't know how the author manages to get inside the culture and the heads and hearts of her characters, but I am grateful she did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to love","review":"This book sounded wonderful from the online reviews, but I was sorely disappointed. The details were certainly fascinating, but I found the author's style jarring and disjointed. Certainly the grace of Japan is evident in the novel, but my concentration just kept getting derailed by the author's prose."},{"rating":"2","title":"well-researched and engrossing historical novel","review":"Susan Fromberg Schaeffer has authored a well-researched and well-written historical novel, the story of a samurai and a young girl reared in a great lord's palace who meet during a plague, fall in love and become separated during Japan's great civil wars. There are elements of fantasy and myth in the tale which describes in detail the grandeur of palace life, the horror of epic battles, and the everyday life of 1000 years ago. With elements of joy and sadness, this is an engrossing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Have you ever read the dustjacket of a book and thought \\"Hmm, this might be interesting.\\" Then you make the mistake of actually opening the book and reading it, only to find the dustjacket was the best part of the book? That's the problem with The Snow Fox. To be honest I didn't read the entire thing. After 150 pages and still not caring about any of the characters or what was going on, I decided life was to precious to waste my time on this novel. I will say the story went at a steady pace, but a good pace doesn't make up for the fact none of the characters were interesting enough to get involved with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh let it end already","review":"Four hundred and thirty-four pages of dialog with little description other than \\"he said\\", \\"she said\\", and a plot that was achingly slow.

George Carlin just does not cut it as a narrator. We bought two Carlin tapes and the other is on it's way back to Amazon. This one will end up in the bottom of the tape shelf. Even my three year old son was disapponted. This particular tape has a lot of footage from a train show from Pennslyvania. Not what we want in a Thomas tape. Also, apparently the P.C. police have changed the name of the Fat Controller to Mr. Top Hat or something equally stupid. Why they feel it is so important to change from the orginal is beyond me. Even the traditional music sounds differant. I have Thomas tapes narrated by Ringo from England and they are delighful. I hope the Ringo tapes have not been ruined too. If so, I will get all future tapes from the U.K."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying footage in between...","review":"Who wants to see visitors to a \\"day out with Thomas\\"and hear what they have to say about Thomas and company?

I have to this day to see such a rich collection of talented lead singers on display in one choir. \\"Timeless\\" is the word that comes to mind when watching this one over and over year after year.

It is to hard for a five year old to put together and it does not stay together. It wobbles when you try to stand it up and parts fall off continuously. The parts do move and easily but it just does not stay together that well. Do not purchase this as a toy your child would actually play with or they will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"This product might be worth $5, but not what I paid. The arm is too short to be useable, I've already broken the switch (REALLY cheap) and all of the LEDs don't light all of the time. The head of the unit weighs so much that the base of the light stays loose in the power outlet - you have to hold both ends for the light to stay on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stylish but flawed","review":"This map light puts out more than enough light for map or book reading. It has a stylish silver knob for the on/off switch. (4 stars) And that is its flaw. The knob is nicely sized. But it is mounted on less than a 1/8-inch tab. The tab does not have the strength to prevent the knob from binding on the push-down motion. As a result, people think that the real on/off-action is to twist it. And the knob breaks easily. (1 star - it might be repairable with glue gun)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nine Inch Nails - The Hand That Feeds (DFA Remixes)","review":"Tracklisting:A1 The Hand That Feeds (DFA Remix) (9:02)A2 The Hand That Dubs (DFA Remix - Instrumental) (9:01)B The Hand That Dubs (DFA Version 1) (14:12)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I expected from Amy Bento","review":"I have Hi/Low extreme from her and it kicks my butt every time.

It also sparked a literary legacy as writers joined the gold rush and sent back stories of adventure, romance, and memorable mining camp personalities. Great Tales Of The Gold Rush is an outstanding anthology of the best of these stories that range from realism to romance, from tall tales to true-life adventure. Great Tales Of The Gold Rush introduces a whole new generation of readers to an invaluable, enduring, and very special literary legacy from Jack London's \\"In a Far Country\\" to Robert Service's \\"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\\" to Elizabeth Robins' \\"The Ice Goes Out\\", and more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"3 and a half stars","review":"The first review is right on in all that was said.

Overall, the songs aren't as edgey as on previous albums but I think the writing and arrangements are very consistent and well done. Probably a disappointment only to hard core fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"i am not rating this, all im saying is.....","review":"First of all, i really like the pretenders.But if you dont like poppy albums, you probably wouldnt like this at all. it sounds like they are trying to hard to fit in with the popular sound of the time, like radio stuff. you forget that the pretenders are a band. there is even this song that is suppose to be a dance song where this guy just repeats this phrase over and over again.im not hating on this album. you just might want to hear it first before you buy it.Who knows, you might like it, or you might not. its all about the style you like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Collection of Hymns","review":"This is a wonderful (and very inexpensive) 2 disk set that has most of the really popular and outstanding hymns of the Christian faith. Its sound is diverse, with electric guitars, violins, pipe organs, and many other instruments used--yet most of the songs stick to a very traditional and full sound. The only problem I have with CD is that a few of the songs are only instrumentals and do not have the words. For example, a couple of the songs missing the words are Be Thou My Vision and Joyful Joyful. Otherwise though, if you are looking for a good collection of traditional hymns but with a more contemporary sound, this is a great collection to own. You can't beat the price, and musically it's quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only fit for the bin","review":"What a complete waste of money! I'm a big fan of Peter Cook but this is best avoided.

Bandai messed up the OST, leaving out songs and miss labeling others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly engaging stories.","review":"Wednesday, September 08, 2004 / 4 of 5 / Surprisingly engaging stories.The move from bigscreen to smaller scale is apparent in scope, but these short collections from the world of Ghost in the Shell are pretty good on their own. Particularly compelling in this one is the story of a designer who puts his mind into a renegade mecha tank and then uses it to head out to meet up with his parents regardless of hardware in his way. The android story reminded me of Cherry 2000; but despite the derivate episode I was pleased with the calibre of artwork and voice acting for the dub. There are four episodes with the fourth being a cliffhanger to bridge to the next volume to be released at the end of Sept. One thing I did notice was that the major in these short stories is played with a bit more emotion than the movie, less melancholia and soul searching. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"soundtrack CD is knackered","review":"The soundtrack CD is all screwed up! Track 8 on the CD includes both track 8 (velveteen) and 9 (lithium flower) while track 11 is the first part of the song (fish~silent cruise) and track 12 continues the song. There's also a blank 19th track.The DTS disc also has a sound glitch were there is little to no audio coming from the rear-left speaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Do The Movie Justice!","review":"I liked Ghost In The Shell, the movie version. But this Stand Alone Complex is nothing like the movie. What happened to the Puppet Master, in the movie version? I have to admit, Stand Alone Complex is visually stunning, but other than that, it's nothing to cheer about. If you want to see the real Ghost In The Shell, then see the movie version. This Stand Alone Complex just doesn't measure up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bandai/Manga Ent","review":"I just wanted to say to readers that this DVD is much better priced than the Japanese Region 2 DVD which is priced at $54 retail.

Well actually the original Japanese DVD set has 13 discs and is not cheaper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to get it !!! >:)","review":"If u have seen Ghost in the shell The Movie, u'll really be suprised with the first Season of Stand alone Complex!This is a must have for any Shirow Fan and if u are not u will be after u have seen this!Stunning Animations and action all the way being very close this time with the Original Manga!When I saw the Fansub for the first time I thougt wow, if every anime would be like this I could die for it!I hope it will be not to long for the second Season to come to DVD too. Because it's even darker with Major Motoko Kusanagi and her team involved in even more Black Ops action!But get the First Season first!!! I do :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Different Ghost, Different Shell","review":"Except for most of the characters, this movie is completely different from the original Ghost in the Shell. It lacks the visual beauty, interesting score and has become just another fast paced anime. I feel I have been misled by the title into expecting a sequel of the original with similar qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I stopped watching this after the first episode. The Animation is nothing like the movie GITS. Also there is quite a bit of cgi used in the series. The music was nothing like the original and the actors who did the english dub sounded corny to me. The only similarity between this and the movie is the premise and plot. All of the atmospherics are gone. There are numerous still shots where only the mouth moves. This is a very tame and uncreative version of ghost in the shell. All in all if your a die hard fan, I guess you will like this no matter what. If you expect a lot as I did you will be diappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ninja look!","review":"We ordered it a size larger than he actually wears, and it fit perfectly, I'd advise doing the same. He wears a size 6, we ordered the 8/10. The costume is great, he looks like a 'real' ninja, but don't expect some really high quality Hollywood reproduction stuff, it's a definite \\"toy\\" quality, but visually - it's stunning. I'd expect it to last through Halloween without breaking just fine, but I can see it wearing out after a few backyard play-ninja fights.We ordered a light-up sword for fun, but the costume looked so good, we ended up getting a 'ninja sword' set to match it.If your kid wants to be a ninja, THIS is the costume to order."},{"rating":"1","title":"A childish view of human behavior","review":"Childish, simplistic, overly geared towards FEEL good solutions , and much to idealistic! However, makes some good points."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stimulating And Easy Reading","review":"I bought this book because I needed to read it for a class. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did! The first couple of pages made you really think and wonder about how mindless one really is. The book did wonderfully in keeping the psychological jargon out, and the examples helped me understand the concepts. I would definately say that this book is a must-read for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it was","review":"If you are looking for an enjoyable treatise on bringing awareness to everyday life, this is not the book for you. The author does not have an engaging, easy-to- read style. Rather the work is much more scientific in tone and probably helpful to one trained and interested in psychology/psychiatry and counseling modalities."},{"rating":"1","title":"unintelligible","review":"I had difficulty following or understandingmuch of this. I'm very disappointed.The studies she relates don't appearto be at all scientific. I could noteven describe what she calls mindfullness.I probably won't finish the book becauseit's a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap-fulness","review":"The book starts out well but soon dissolves into feel good chaos. She lost me when she got to the creepy mystical ideas. Like how time is not linear? really? are you god? Can you float out of time and space just by being mindful? and that theres no such thing as being too fat or too skinny. Does that mean we shouldn't help anorexics out? And the big one is how theres no such thing as sexual perversion. So rape away I guess?She also has allot of useless observations about how things like clocks, rulers, and borderlines are just man-made things. Yes they are, but you know what? I still have to be at work at 6 in the morning tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"This book is more for the psychiatric professional and not for a person who is trying to become more mindful. The first half of the book focused on mindlessness. The second half of the book focused on experiments done with various groups of people and how those experiments helped those people become more mindful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more Abstract and detailed than other methods of mindfulness","review":"I have ADHD and manic episodes and I go from Abstract to simplification and breaking down and tailoring it to MY NEEDS. I tried DBT and although half of it was common sense and I am far from a borderline personality, I found the application of mindfulness to be helpful to me and wanted a better way to apply it than to be in a group of manipulative people that had much different issues than mine.This book was the answer. It helped me because of my tendency to start abstract and break things down and do them my way. Borderline Personality Disorder must need the other method, which explains the negative reviews but my few groups I participated in with those people suggested that they either want a hero to save them or they were the antichrist and I couldn't tolerate the issues they had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply inspiring book","review":"The book touches on some great concepts and uses research data to make key points. The example of confrontation between Napoloean and Kutuzov to illustrate how changing perspectives and being aware of new information is excellent. Perspective-changing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid As A Rock","review":"Fireball is truly one awesome recording by Deep Purple. In between all the heavy sounds there are some creative touches most notably from keyboardist Jon Lord and drummer Ian Paice. The drum fills are a pure joy to listen to on No No No and The Mule as they compliment Ian Gillan's vocals stylings to a T. The keyboard touches are great throughout. Whether its The Noise Abatement Society Tapes, Fools, or the previously mentioned No No No, they all are done with the upmost creativitiy. No One Came is another highlight on the record with some ultra cool lyrics.The extra tracks just add to the value of this recording. Pick it up at once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have - and should have been - 5 stars!","review":"Great job on the remaster and great job on the liner notes. Major problem? The decision to scrap the original version of \\"Strange Kind Of Woman\\" in favor of Glover's '96 remix. What's that all about? Not only does it make the album's claim - \\"the complete original album remastered plus bonus tracks\\" - a falsehood; it also deprives the listener (this one in particular) the opportunity to have that sonic gem in its best available form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better Than \\"Machine Head!\\"","review":"While \\"Machine Head\\" gets all the glory, \\"Fireball\\" is in actuality a far stronger album, much more diverse, though it doesn't have the big recognizable songs that most people associate with Deep Purple. The only real weak track is \\"Anyone's Daughter,\\" which almost strays into country(!) at times. Everything else is great though, however. Buy the 25th anniversary edition, as it comes with many bonus tracks, such as \\"Freedom\\" and \\"Slow Train.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Trash (in a bad way)","review":"Having read some of the author's other books, where I enjoyed descriptions of Korean lifestyle/customs, I ordered \\"Buddha's Money\\". While I am no prude, I have not come across a book with so much seemingly needless and gratuitous sexual violence, many of them so badly rendered that they are cartoonish. Some other recent books, such as \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" also have more than their share of sex and violence, but at least they are written as part a coherent story. \\"Buddha's Money\\" is a grotesque, badly written book. As a book-lover, throwing away a book is a last resort, but that is what I did with my copy and I actually felt better once I chucked it into the garbage can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Action, but torture scenes were quite unsettling","review":"The action was first-rate, and the book kept me flipping pages, but I felt the torture of women in this book was too much to bear at times. Every major female character suffered in some way. I'm not squeamish, and can handle violence, but I felt the violence in this book was way too excessive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy if you have kids","review":"First of all I love Martin Limon's books. I think this is a great series and I buy them as soon as they come out. Having said that, Buddha's Money was a bit disappointing. The story was the usual but there was some horrible torture of a little girl. To the point of being repulsive. This just turned me off an otherwise pretty interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"This book was awful. Jade Lady Burning, which was excellent, must have been a fluke. What happened to Ernie?? In Buddha's Money he's a complete bore with a personality of tree bark. Oh...and get this. Midway through the book our heros swim to a mysterious island to fetch a jade buddha skull and they're attacked by a giant sloth. HELLO...giant sloths became extinct in the ice age. Why not just have them be attacked by a sabre tooth tiger? Pass this stinker up.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash trash trash","review":"This book should be burned. There is terrible violence against a child, graphically described, that left me wondering what kind of man could even put these things on paper. What is worse, neither the abuse of the child nor the graphic descriptions of it were necessary for the plot.That said, even without these scenes, the plot was absurd. An army of Mongolian fanatics who don't look like Koreans but can beat up even the most skilled crime fighters with a quick kick or sucker punch to the diaphragm, seem to be able to move through underside of the town unseen, taking over a Buddhist Temple, and asking random people to find a lost treasure on threat of more harm to the child. Why does no one think of using an adult man as a victim?If I can stop one person from reading this book, my work here is done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Donate your money to Buddha instead!","review":"Limon's two previous books were atmospheric, with sustainable plots, and interesting characters. Buddha's Money retains a bit of the first characteristic and absolutely none of the others. The basic plot premise is absurd, the story is weak, and his \\"Ernie\\" character has turned into a pointless idiot!It's hard to believe that the same author who wrote \\"Jade Lady Burning\\" and \\"Slicky Boys\\" also wrote this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buddha's Money rates no stars from me.","review":"I started to read Buddha's Money anticipating a good adventure & mystery story placed in Korea. My interest turned to distaste and then to anger at the author, when the 11 year old girl is kidnapped, raped, tortured and then murdered. This is followed by the brutalization, rape and murder of 2 more women. I stopped reading the book after Lady Ahn was beaten up and gang raped. The author hasn't constructed a solid mystery that relies on solving the crime, psychological insight into the characters or narrative detail about Korea -- instead he's presented a tale that lives vicariously from savaging a female underclass. I reqret buying the book and would not assign any stars, if the Amazon.com rating system allowed this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful series but skip this one","review":"I love this series, but this particular book is just unspeakable. There is an ongoing plot line of the torture, dismemberment (ongoing) and sexual violation of a small girl that is just unbelievable. There is an ethical dimension to writing, as in all things, which in my opinion, this author has violated. I don't think it should ever have been written and I question why it was ever published."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent treatment of key points","review":"This should be required reading for Catholics who believe John 6 supports the RC doctrine of the Sacrifice of the Mass. White analyzes the passage and builds his case brick by logical brick. He demonstrates to a very high level of certainty that the text is NOT referring to the Eucharist (which by the way the early church fathers didn't believe either). Also answers the controversial question of whether the Roman Catholic Church has gone so far as to compromise the gospel and jeopardize the salvation of its members."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor James...","review":"He needs to quit talking and writing and start *listening* to his own sister, Patty Bonds, who converted to Catholicism. Don't waste your money. Instead, go check out the books on Catholic apologetics by authors like Patrick Madrid, Scott Hahn, David Currie, Mark Shea and Dave Armstrong etc etc and check the ratings for yourself against garbage like this by James White Dave Hunt. See for yourself who's winning the Cath/Prot debate. Christ said when He gave Peter the keys to the kingdom that the gates of Hades would not prevail against His church and the proof is in the ratings of books like this one by James R. White."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the love of God, pls read a lot!","review":"The only thing I would like to say is...please if you want to make a book critique on the other side's (in this case Catholicism) please read alot of good books, specially from the official teachings of the catholic church, secular, historical books on christianity or much better the \\"Early Church Fathers\\" by Jurgens. You will be surprised that the early christians and writings of like Iraneus, Polycarp and others who were students from the apostles themselves taught true christianity and you will find that it didn't have any similarity at all to modern-day protestantism (which I think somewhat like modern day relativism- to each his own).And lastly, the book was poorly researched and bias."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strikes at the heart of the matter","review":"James White approaches this topic by striking at the heart of the controversy first: do Evangelicals and Catholics hold to the same Gospel.

That would be the similarly-titled \\"The Catholic Controversy,\\" by St. Francis de Salles. This truly is a masterpiece of defense of the Catholic Faith. I don't know why James R. White chose the title he did for his book, but I can't help wondering if he thought he might in that way mislead readers looking for St. Francis' marvellous tome. In any case, I urge everyone who is interested & who wants to know the truth about the Catholic Church to read St. Francis' book. Then decide for yourself who makes the most sense about sola scriptura, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"I was really excited about this book - especially after reading White's excellent, \\"Letters to a Mormon Elder.\\" However, \\"The Roman Catholic Controversy\\" was all over the place, lacking hard-hitting points and a consistent treatment. It failed where LTME succeeded: in providing a progressively stronger case against the theology it's critiquing. If you want a good exploration of the differences between the Church of Rome and Evangelical Christianity, get a copy of Geisler and McKenzie's book. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful if you need a concise treatment of the subject","review":"As a Protestant in the process of converting to the Catholic church, I decided I needed more substantial information about what I was getting into. RCIA just doesn't tell you about the church doctrine. I was hoping this book would clearly spell out in simple terms what the differences are between the two. A quarter of the way into the book the author had lost me. The writing is hard to following and the reasonsing at times is impossible to follow.If you need a basic, straigh forward treat of this topic, this is not the book for you.

All but the last three songs of the first set is from July 17, 1989, an excellent show. \\"Desolation Row & Deal\\" make it worth the combination of two seperate shows from the weekend. Tight shots of the band allow viewers a peek at how the Dead created their special sound. The full moon hanging over the stadium that night would have been a nice addition. A solid performance from Let the Good Times Roll to We Bid You Goodnight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories!!!!!!!","review":"I was there, it actually made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

As another viewer correctly states, there are three songs from the last show substituted at the end of the first set, but I happen to find their presence very valuable. \\"Desolation Row\\" is a nice understated version, with chilling harmony from Jerry near the end, and I found the \\"West L.A.\\" to be a fiery performance to rank near the best. My only quibble (well, a Deadhead has to quibble!) is not enought Primal Dead. \\"The Other One\\" would have been nice! Great stuff, though, and beautiful sound and camera work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jerry at the pinnacle of his career.

The good times were a rolling that night up in the Phil side beer garden.The clouds had just cleared enough to reveal the huge full moon and they took their cue form the heavens and played \\"Standing on the Moon\\" to the uproarious cheer from the crowd.The boy's had just put the Buddy Holley \\"mmbop bop bop-bop bop\\" at the end of \\"Not Fade Away\\" and brought back after many years \\"And We Bid You Good Night\\".It didn't get much better than that.Then the rain came..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be the best, but for HORRIBLE VIDEO quality","review":"Really, this could be the best Grateful Dead DVD from their later period. Unlike much of the View from the Vault series, the music is superb --- culled from a group of very inspired performances --- and non-Deadheads won't fall asleep watching it. But, the color and the resolution on the DVD is INFERIOR. I know this because the VHS picture quality is much better. And, someone inside the Dead organization told me that Monterey Video (who oversees the process) used an inferior process to go from VHS to DVD. Really, there is no reason why this video shouldn't look just as good as all the other View from the Vaults -- at least VFV IV (which was same year).Sorry 'bout this, Grateful Dead people -- but I have to be straight with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Single Best Dead Video Recording","review":"Yes, this does encompass the Dead over a three day run at Alpine which has been combined into one \\"show.\\" But if you are going to buy one Dead DVD, this is the one.

Bocelli 'sings' some light, poppy fluff in his inimitably superficial, pretty, gee-don't-I-sound-nice voice, unable to hide the fact that he couldn't phrase a melody if his life depended on it. Whereas great singers, in any genre, understand that you must find some contrast in the poetry and music, Bocelli sings everything the same way, in his all-purpose 'expressive' style. Not to mention the fact that he is consistently out of tune in his high register. Don't be fooled people, this is no introduction to opera. Great opera is an epic, exalting, monumental experience. 'Romanza' is the musical equivalent of lobster butter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great voice-beautiful songs","review":"Con Te Partiro' is one of the most beautiful songs of all time.

Interesting.","review":"Well, I must say, I like both pop and opera music. It strikes me as amusing though, that Bocelli sings the song \\"Caruso\\" - the lyrics of which are written in a first-person perspective of the greatest singer who ever lived. I particularly like \\"Le Tue Parole\\", and while Bocelli does an okay job at opera standards like \\"Che Gelida Manina\\" on his other albums, I think he does better at the light pop-opera seen on Romanza. By the way, I think that the songwriters of \\"Romanza\\" are a real talent here, there are some great songs on this album, and just try to forget about the kitsch-ness of whoever else listens to \\"Time to Say Goodbye\\" a billion times. (did he really need to re-record that song with Sarah Brightman taking over most of the vocals? Her diction is pretty scary.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"i liked the songs Vivere and Vivo per lei the best...","review":"I really wish to hear the spanish version of the CD, especially the song Vivo por ella that he sang in the novella Vivo por Elena.

If you plan on playing it loud like I do the static get in the way of enjoying it. I thought that most of the songs would be in the style of Time to Say Goodbye - they were not. I have yet to hear the whole thing because each time I listen a little way into any other song it drives me absolutely crazy.Would I but it again? Yes, just because I love the one song so much.

I'm glad his fans are so happy to have recordings from him. But this is not opera as it can be presented onstage. Nor is it particularly interesting dramatically. I had to wonder if he's aware of the dramatic circumstances of several of the arias. And that is the point: he is singing words that possess meaning, not just loud or soft for the fun of it. For the curious, these are some of the reasons Mr. Bocelli is not given high praise by musicians and those who critique (which means \\"analyze\\") operatic music."},{"rating":"2","title":"emotional","review":"I listened to this cd and it actually brought tears to my eyes.

The canola oil in the pan immediately started smoking. This shouldn't happen, as the smoke point of canola oil is 400 degrees. At a loss for what temperature to use, I turned the temp down to 250 in hopes that I wouldn't end up with runny eggs. By the time the top of the white cooked, the bottom was burning.

Although America too quickly forgot about our Vietnam veterans, 9 from the 9th gives us another chance to recall the everyday heroism of this generation of soldiers. The language is not for the politically correct squeamish, the sentiments are not for the faint-of-heart peaceniks, but these are stories honestly told by soldiers who deserved better from our country.

If I wash my hair the night before it is always extremely greasy in the a.m. My hair has a tendency to be quite oily (I have long fine straight hair) but it is even worse with this product compared to other shampoos. It looks and feels soft at the ends but the roots are horrible. I am thinking of using this product once a week and find a better daily shampoo so that I will not have to wash my hair everyday as it is making my hair color fade from over washing. I do like the scent and texture of the product but it just does not seem to work well with my hair type. I am not certain if it is really helping retain the hair color since I have to wash it so often.

Her mother had achieved much softer hair utilizing this product and so I decided to give it a try.

I have coarse hair but this stuff is leaving it like straw, and it dries it out. I have experimented to see if it was this product by using a few others in between uses.

Having a stickier hook ladden sound reminiscent of the more popular multiplatinum big sellers of that genre and era ( Bon Jovi, Dokken, Motley Crue, etal ), it still puzzles me why this album wasn't a big seller for the warner label back then. Pay special attention to the fine guitar palaying to the twin leads specially to the then very young and promising Amir Derakh ( of Orgy & Danzig ).

It is to small, my fault for not double checking. The base consists of eight pieces, four corners with wheels, and four bars that go between the wheels.

Look for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality and Design","review":"The unit is capable of sustaining the weight without any problem but it's not capable of turning as advertises. When you push the unit left or the right, the wheels bind and does not allow you to move the unit.

I had purchased two other Jet mobile bases for a table saw and band saw that had virtually no assembly at all. The Mini Shop Fox does handle more weight though.Also, shipping was an extra $9, even though Amazon advertised free shipping with tool purchases over a certain amount.

Its that moodness in the beats which give that remenecent sound which made Wyclef famous. However, the album changes dramatically for the worst after that. Almost every song is crapy upbeat Foreign Language version of soething you would be able to find on the Masquerade. Its just not the same Wyclef from the years back.

Most offensive are \\"Stay Loose\\", \\"You Just Gotta Be\\", \\"Ecstasy Made Easy\\". The WORST tune on here has got to be \\"Anything For Love\\", with the worst elements of a/c: faceless synths, back-ups, and the rest.

The result was horrifying. In an earlier review, someone compared this synthesized pop record to a Phil Collins album. Need I say more? I guess Lightfoot thought that he needed to \\"update\\" his sound in order to remain commercially relevant. The problem was that, in so doing, he made himself musically irrelevant. The production problems were compounded by a particularly weak collection of songs. \\"A Lesson in Love\\" is particularly unlistenable. \\"A Passing Ship\\" is a nice song, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reliability","review":"I have five different LaCie Big/Bigger Disk drives, from this the 1 TB version down to 500 GB versions, and 2/3rds of them have had some sort of failure as follows: 1) external power brick going bad, 2) FW800 ports going bad on 1 TB Bigger Disk, 3) bad drive (one of the two 250 GB drives in the Big Disk 500 GB version), 4) extremely loud noise (a Big Disk 500 GB version), 5) included firewire cable going bad.Basically, anything and everything that can go wrong has gone wrong in these drives.Naturally, all of these failures occurred after expiration of warranty.

When I saw the 15.99 price I was surprised and disappointed. Many e-books are the same price as the paper but not sure I understand why many of the Simon and Schuster titles cost more than the original paperback version.If you can get a physical copy of this book I suggest you get it as soon as you can.

Don't take anything she says as gospel. Her assertions, completely unfounded and undocumented, have been repeated endlessly in books on quilts of the Colonial Revival (30s-40s) and the quilt revival (70s-today), but it doesn't make them true.

CONS: Remote doesn't have the best layout, may not be compatible with Pioneer's DVD R/RW. With the DV 414, Pioneer has proven that although quality has a price, it doesn't need to be above US$ 300.

I went to Borders and B&N in December, '97, but couldn't get the book; finally getting it from our local llibrary after 3 months on waiting list, I couldn't put the book down. Tanenhaus indeed should have got the National Book Award for \\"WC, A Biography\\" rather than \\"Cold Mountain\\". N.B. Several curious errata in the book: 1) the word 'Anglophone' probably should be 'Anglophobe'; 2) New Hope, PA is described as 110 miles to Washington, DC; it's more accurately: 150 miles; 3) the Washington DC suburb where Chambers stays overnight just before the 1st HUAC hearing is Tacoma Park, MD -- not TaKoma Park, MD.

He is at his best during the hearings and trials, tautly rattling off questions and responses, cutting through the fog of Chambers's too-close account, making the more arcane controversies intelligible.In Chambers's early life, Tanenhaus sticks to the evidence and refrains from speculating about Chambers's motives for joining the Communist Party, for example. I was somewhat disappointed that he didn't provide more in the way of interpretation, but by the time of Witness's publication, Tanenhaus begins to satisfy this craving for critique.Most important, Tanenhaus succeeds in making his subject sympathetic in all his flawed humanity. His story has become central (in an odd way) to America's story of the first half of the 20th century--and beyond. But he continues to fascinate because he was so unlikelyy, an American original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Insight Into A Very MIsunderstood American","review":"Chambers is a very misunderstood individual. He is lionized by the right, hated by the left, and unknown by the masses. What Tanehaus does in this book is provide a very informative view of this polarizing figure. Depending upon your perspective what you know about Chambers is pretty well formed, but after reading this book (if you can keep an open mind) you will have learned something new. Reading this book one is exposed to the fact that Chambers was more than the man who made Nixon famous, rather he was a very talented individual who later wrote in a way to reflect the value of America. We also learn that he was not the natural born patriot, but someone who took time to get to that place in his thinking. What I hope you take from this review is that Chambers is a very complex man, one who is worthy of a very balanced treatment of the subject. That is what you will find in this book.

The instrumentation, arrangements and performances are superb and the sound quality is astonishing. Originally recorded at MGM studios in 1974, this provides the best of all possible worlds.

A fairly useless book. Just really phrases with no seeming relationship to each other the chapters don't build on each other. No lessons to help you get the words and phrases into your head.I would never buy another dummies book again. The changing from pc to mac and the snow lepoard books were no help to me either.I believe my copy was an earlier edition but I doubt this is better.The idiot series is much better.This book is the book I would buy now.German Made Simple: Learn to speak and understand German quickly and easilyHas all you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Received Blank","review":"Received a blank CD.

Some of my favorite Erasure songs of all are here in \\"Victim Of Love,\\" \\"Leave Me To Bleed,\\" and \\"Sometimes.\\" A smooth blend of analog synths, unique electronic bleeps, combined with a great melody has quickly become the British duo's tour de force. Lots of danceable tracks with some slower ones mixed in. I love the atmospheric dreamy qualities of \\"Spiralling.\\" Other cool songs include \\"It Doesn't Have To Be,\\" \\"Hideaway,\\" and \\"The Circus.\\"If you like Erasure, also check out EchoImage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Erasure","review":"Erasure's break-through album, The Circus, is a considerable improvement over their debut, Wonderland, and up to this day remains one of their best releases of all.Every song could make an excellent single and represents Vince Clarke's creativity at his highest apex. And although Clarke progressed over the years, adding complexity to his melodies and different arrays of synth tones to his repertoire, The Circus remains one of Erasure's most endearing, poignant, and emotional albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Erasure's beginnings...","review":"In some ways, Erasure's 'oldest' albums are their most original, classic, and best...and in other ways, they're not. This album typifies that. Some people probably deem their newest albums the best and other people..vice versa. I relate to both paradigms. While this song is full of originality and while every song is memorable and emotion-filled, at the same time, they're overall, simpler and less refined than what you find in succeeding songs and albums. Depending on one's tastes, this may be a love-it-or-hate-it album, but I..oddly enough..just 'like it a lot.' This one is a very classic Erasure album worth buying, but not one of their best albums..."},{"rating":"2","title":"more soul than blues","review":"... and that's a good thang. i don't buy blues albums very often anymore, in fact almost never. this cd has much more in common with the 1st soul of john black cd than it does blues in general -- and thankfully so. in fact the only songs on the album that can be called blues in the structural sense are 'the moon blues' and 'deez blues'. my fave: feelinsnot quite as funky as the original, which is still the gold standard for these guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistaken identity/excessive artificial bass","review":"I purchased this item from Amazon's SACD section and when it arrived as a regular cd I was more than a little disappointed. Than I played it and it had even more of what hooked me when I sampled the disc on Amazons website. But, and this is a big but, the samples as heard on my laptop don't prepare you for the overbearing, plodding, and wholly artificial bass on this disc. I like big rich bass in my blues/jazz just as much (if not maybe even a little more) than the next person, but the bass on this disc sounds so fake and at the same time so overbearing as to ruin an otherwise fantastic moody mix. I sure would like to hear a remastered SACD without the amateurish syntheticly enhanced bassline. The music is quite enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"a useful tool for certain uses","review":"I think this could be a useful item.

This particular CD is filled with the wisdom teachings gathered from other presentations or retreats. While possibly redundant at times, the ever true bears repeating because we forget. The biggest problem with this particular CD is the sound quality. It is very poor and at times Tolle's voice is all but obliterated by the hissing noise of the re-make. It is not audience noise but technical deficiencies which make this CD an unsatisfactory product not up to the standards of Sounds True."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor sound quality","review":"Another wonderful CD from Eckhart Tolle, but the sound sound quality is very poor.

I also just recently purchased more copies..for a baby gift and also for my daughters to keep for their families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I got this book for my young children, who were brought into our family through adoption. After being read the book just a few times, my daughter had most of it memorized and loved talking about what happened in the book (at random times). Many things seemed to really draw her into it, like Mrs. Bear running to help when Choco was sad, the things Mrs. Bear did for Choco like a mommy would do, and that Mrs. Bear's children all looked so different. It was a great choice for our family and I highly recommend it, not just for adoptive families, but for any family. It is a wonderful book to introduce any child to families that may not look like each other and brings up great opportunities to have conversations about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK!!!","review":"I am the process of going through adoption through Foster Care. I have not had a placement yet, but most likely it will be a bi-racial adoption. I LOVE this book! I was hoping to find a book that would showcase a similar story.

It shows you don't have to be the same to be a family. :) Exactly what I was looking for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little book","review":"This is a short book, perfect for bedtime and easy for young children to understand. It offers a very simplistic explanation for adoption."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming book!","review":"This is the cutest children's book I have ever read.

I am honestly VERY surprised this book received so many glowing reviews. The end has a positive spin bc there is a mother who wants Choco despite his differences bc they have other things in common. In my family we celebrate the fact that we are all different, not love each other in spite of it. I will not read a book to my child that causes him in any way feel like he was unwanted or even that he is blessed bc we were the only ones who wanted him. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I hope to read this to my adopted son.

Choco looks all over for his mother thinking she probably looks just like him. He finds an animal that may have a beak or a wing but doesn't look like him and becomes hopeless. He is heard weeping in the forest by a Mother Bear. She asks him what is wrong and he proceeds to tell her his tale. She listens sympathically and asks him what his mother would do in a case like this and he describes all the comforting things a mother would do. Then without hesitation, Mother Bear does exactly what he needs. She takes him home where he is introduced to her \\"children\\" which are all different animals (not one bear child).

The actors themselves were believable. But it didn't seem too believable especially at the end where it didn't seem to wrap up. It had a -watch me make a movie with my camcorder and a few friends in the backyard- kinda feel to it. It wasn't scary at all or thrilling. So calling it horror or a thriller to me would be amiss.

If only they had a stronger, preferably metal, replacement part, this would be an ideal umbrella, especially with it's very reasonable cost.Why such a key part is made of plastic instead of metal when this part is at the key point with the most stress is beyond me.

We have had the umbrella for 4 months and it's already broken. We didn't use it very often because it always looked like it was going to tip over whenever there was the slightest amount of wind. Moving it from one spot to another caused the plastic arm to break off, even though the moveable arm wasn't touched at all when we moved it (we held it by the main post). We can't use it at all.

Eventually in the next few months, they cracked through, rendering the umbrella useless as it could not be held in place nor held open. Unfortunately, the company does not make replacement parts and it has been more than 12 months since the initial purchase. We love the umbrella but it's shamefull that either we got a lemon or this is a potential problem with no solution.

The only thing really lacking earlier in the series was a sense of interest in the characters. I enjoyed watching them, but I didn't really feel anything for them as people.This tape makes you care. It is also pivotal in that it introduces Ifurita, the \\"Demon God\\" with the big chest and the rather shocking penchant for destruction. Jinnai manages to awaken her, and minutes later commands her to destroy the allied nations that are at war with the Bugrom. This she begins to do, by hovering over a large city and obliterating it with a single energy blast. After the lightheartedness of the first tapes, in which no one really got hurt, this was almost disturbing. The drama melds well with the comedy, though, resulting in a series that covers all bases. I highly recommend this tape to all anime fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Magnificent Series","review":"I started out by watching the The Wanderers firts and was sort of disappointed.

And everyone kept standing next to and walking by zombie like they weren't affraid then they got killed."},{"rating":"1","title":"um...","review":"ok...i love zombies for whatever weird reason, and that's why i bought this. i was disappointed by the horrendous acting, and the script got kinda specious in many places (or amusingly corny, i.e. the \\"action\\" lines). however, the gore effects and the general concept were both good. so...i don't regret buying it. however, if you're looking for something that will blow george romero's great trilogy out of the water, you're in the same stranded boat as me: i've found no movies that even prod Dawn of the Dead with a ten-foot pole, and this is no exception. still, this was written, produced, directed and acted in by one guy when he was 19 or thereabouts. that's pretty impressive. in light of that, i'd keep an eye on J.R. Bookwalter, 'cuz if he ever gets a decent budget behind him, i bet he could make a really good movie (or several)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puts a lot of professional stuff to shame!","review":"A remarkable achievement with capable photography, some exceptional makeup...add to this a clever screenplay from [director J.R.] Bookwalter and this mix is a potent one. Any synopsis loses a lot of Bookwalter's clever writing, and his direction shows skill on obviously limited means and equipment. Bookwalter also manages the difficult balancing act of keeping the tension tight and the story moving while not missing out on the black comedy of the situation. The film moves at a cracking pace...puts a lot of professional stuff to shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic acting!!!!!!!!","review":"I ordered this movie because I like almost all zombie movies, but this one was pathetic! The most annoying thing about this video is that the quality of it is poor. The screen always looks dark, and it's not my t.v. screen, it's just the quality of the video. Do yourself a favor, rent this movie first."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZOMBIE CRAP","review":"This is total zombie crap-bad acting, bad effects and worst of all, BAD ZOMBIES. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this one- watch Zombie, city of the living dead or even the disturbing burial ground, all of which are, at worst, watchable, as opposed to this terrible attempt at filmaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even Sam Raimi could save it","review":"Again, impressive gore effects, some good ideas and I read about Sam Raimi being involved, but this one is so slow in parts! The acting and tech aspects are below par, but not as distracting as the sluggish pace. It seems like people talk for no reason! The effects work is why to buy this. I really couldn't say I would recommend it, but then again, if you don't mind long stretches of tedium, you may be able to enjoy it. If JR would just make things faster ( a re-edit maybe) then it would be a good film. To many subplots and meandering talk scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of film","review":"This movie was a complete waste of film, film that could have been more appropriately used to create an educational documentary or perhaps even a first-aid video. The Dead Next Door should not even be considered a zombie film or even put in the same horror genre as othe zombie films. It wasn't even funny, so it can't be considered a spoof. Do yourself a favor and don't EVER subject yourself to this complete piece of crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing read....","review":"I found the story to be disjointed and a bit difficult to follow. The character development was poor and when I finished the book I thought, \\"That's it?\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Squirrel Proof!","review":"I purchased this feeder at a local store to detract squirrels - the squirrels love it! In fact, they can jump onto it from the ground, hang on it and tip the seeds out. They empty it in about a day. If you have squirrels, don't waste your money. I gave it 2 stars for it's durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"San Diego reppin'","review":"This CD is the bang. Best dancehall/hip-hop on the market. This would be well worth your money to pick up. Beats are dope and the lyrics are ill. This is a must have for you true heads out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak, unrefined effort at music","review":"Where did this CD come from? I'm not certain which musician, let alone, which producer would let something this unfinished come off the line. The tracks with vocals are better served echoing through New York's underground system, looking at least for some form of pulse or life form. A shining example of dead vocals.The other 'tracks' on the CD sound like the DJ looped his creation of \\"post meal ciggarette\\" notoriety. What a sordid excuse for creating electronica music. This CD is definately not worth buying, let alone stealingi. I hope the artist thinks twice before releasing this unfinished again."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE SOUND OF SELLING OUT","review":"What a stunning disappointment Mind Elevation is as a follow-up to Nightmares On Wax's classic 1999 trip-hop masterpiece Carboot Soul. The tasteful, infectious, instrumental grooves of N.O.W.'s previous efforts are evident in smaller, weaker doses here. They have been largely replaced by vocal-heavy tracks which seem hopelessly misplaced. The tracks featuring the singing of Chyna B (\\"Date With Destiny\\", \\"Environment\\", and the single \\"Know My Name\\") are particularly cringe-inducing. These tracks in context with the rest of the album seem like a blatant attempt score a hit single and would not sound out of place on a Jennifer Lopez record. That's pretty lo. Oh, how the mighty have fallen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see for all young gay men!","review":"Wow! That is all I have to say. If you are gay (or even not, but open minded), and in need of some hope, then see this film. I'm dissapointed that Amazon will not make this available to people under age 18. I'm sure that it is a blanket policy for \\"R\\" movies, but if this were about a guy and a girl I am sure that the MPAA would have given it a \\"PG13\\" or \\"PG\\". How sad. Still, if you are over 18, buy it, if under, get someone to buy it for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS ONE OF MY MOST FAVORITE MOVIE","review":"A really wonderful movie done in England (alittle hard to understand the actors) but I love this movie. Single mom living in the projects trying to better her and her sons life. Son falls in love with the neighbor boy and a crazy neighbor girl (Tameka Empson) who loves the Mommas and Pappas. Great movie, do yourself a favor and buy this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie... Bad DVD","review":"This is an excellent film on VHS. Nearly worn it out on tape. However, this DVD version is an import and a waste of plastic! I returned mine asap. Gonna wait for a REAL DVD version to be printed. for now, just buy the VHS version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why an R rating /","review":"The 128 enormously positive reviews percentage wise, leave little for me to add. Except the \\"R\\" rating, it can't be sex, which leaves language. A single very offensive 4 letter word, too difficult to edit out? Unless the American movies we see here in Australia have had the innumerable gratuitous 'F'' words edited out, [which also applies to 'South Park'] what else is there in this movie, a movie that could be a literal life saver for a gay but very frightened 14-15 year old, that would damage the morals of anyone under 18 yrs old? The logic behind this rating escapes me."},{"rating":"2","title":"good story","review":"This is a touching story that reminds me of some things that happened in my own life. Two boys in love with each other does happen. And it truly is a beautiful thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supporting characters even more interesting","review":"I find this film very interesting, though not for the reasons you would expect. It's about two male teenagers living in a working class neighborhood in London, who one day discover they are attracted to each other. One of them is not even aware that he might be gay (Ste, the popular athlete). Put in this way, it may sound like your typical coming of age gay story. But it is much more than that. And what makes this movie really special is the supporting cast. They carry the weight of the story. The character played by Linda Henry (Sandra, Jamie's mother) is truly fascinating, and her performance is astounding. And Leah deserves a film just for herself. Also the soundtrack by Mama Cas and the Mamas & Papas is a standout. I think that both gay and straight audiences will enjoy this excellent film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must see","review":"This movie is extraordinarily creative and unique in that you reach a point where you identify so much with the characters and their situations that you forget that you are watching a film. I would recommend this movie to anyone, gay or straight. It gives an very special and touching insight to a world that more people than one might imagine must face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Lousy Description on Amazon","review":"This is a wonderful movie about English boys coming of age and coming out. I've seen it at least 2 dozen times on cable tv. I thought I'd buy it on dvd and watch it whenever I wanted to, even though it's an [IMPORT]. It is in it's original language British English. But, the subtitles are in chinese and cannot be turned off. This is a real nusance and not an added desired feature. Amazon should update it's description to reflect this flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big White Chinese Subtitles That Can&#65533;t Be Removed!","review":"I love this movie but the DVD version is not very well conceived. No menu...none of the features you would expect to find -even on the cheapest DVD. There are large white Chinese subtitles that cannot be turned off. This is a fine film and deserves a better DVD release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Gay Film I've Seen","review":"I absolutly loved this film. I saw it for the first time a couple of months ago and have watched it many times over since then. The soundtrack is wonderful and the two young men in the film are delightful. The love these two teens find in each other is an inspiration to all of us. Enjoy the film...it's a must see for all audiences!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touchy","review":"This movie is sad but very very touchy in the end. It's very good movie! I wish this movie should have been make alittle bit more of whats going on after the dance outside in public wonder what would happen but it was over. It also has great songs in this movie. I am planning on buying soundtrack CD of this movie. You will love this movie! Go buy it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a beautiful thing.","review":"Any one who has been teenage and gay will love this movie. It is touching, funny, witty and the soundtrack is great! I am not someone who buys movie videos, but I had to have this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To Burst into Tears","review":"What a movie... I loved this movie. Sometimes you can't understand what they are saying cuz they have a very strong (Australian Acsent) so yeah... but I loved it... It beats a 5 star.... But anyway, I highly recomend this movie. It's taking pride in what you believe in. The end is to just realize how great love is. You should see this movie I recomend this movie 100%"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Thing","review":"I just loved the flim. But when I read the reviews of the DVD I did't buy it. Thank you. I hope they do something to change it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must See!!!","review":"I saw this movie by chance, and I'm so glad that I did. I'm glad each time I watch it. It's truth, sometimes raw, sometimes hilarious. I feel that it's a must-see for anyone who is gay, or is open-minded enough to want to understand what it is to be young, gay, and in love. I wish this had been available 25 years ago.Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blazing, Stunning and Brilliant!","review":"I saw this film on television. It was heavily edited but what was left made me run out and buy the DVD. Money well spent! It's a stunning achievement in gay cinema. Don't let the South London slang disuade you. Just pay close attention with your ears open and watch the screen...It is a pure joy! The two young actors, Glenn Berry and Scott Neal in the lead roles are simply stunning, funny and heartbreaking too. Linda Henry as the Mother to one of the young men gives a raw whirlwind powerhouse performance! Why are so many magnificent performances in small films forgotten at awards time? Miss Henry truly gives one of the best performances of 1996. Of course, the last scene, the dance is worth the price of the DVD! On a scale of one to ten, I rate this tiny gem a MILLION!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good.","review":"I've wanted to see this movie for a while now, and i wasn't disappointed.I liked the movie very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Gay Movie Of All Time","review":"Quite simply this is the best gay movie ever made. That's a very big acolade and I can honestly say that most people who have seen this would agree with me. It is one of those very rare gay movies that is completely true to life, has a gritty script, is superbly acted, and just makes your heart jump and your smile broaden as it reaches the end. The perfect gay movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Love Story..For the Romantic at Heart","review":"This film is one of the most exiting editions to gay culture. Beautifully written and directed, the best thing about it, is that it comes from a teenagers point of you. The film captures you form the very beggining with it's wit and sarcasm of a gay teenagers life. The two main characteres are a delight in the film, reminding us all of when we first fell in love with the boy next door. Jamie's mum is also wonderfully funny as she tries to deal with a son who is different from the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"16 going on 17","review":"I did enjoy this film - it had animated characters - gay sexual tensions - a bit of drama - and a heartwarming ending- 4 stars -You know the story Gay Boy (Jamie) falls for the Hot Boy Next Door (Ste). Is he Gay? Is he Straight? Find out in this loving film about your average nutty neighbors all trying to coexist. Plus this film features a scene that had me holding my breath - Jamie makes the first move, a very tense moment in any young mans life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Romeo + Juliet for the gay youth of today.","review":"The story of two teenagers who find love in the strangest of circumstances. How can anyone resist? Set in Thamesmead, London, you experience the cultural diversity of the capital itself and a realistic view of homosexuality in school, home and loads of other places. More importantly you get to see something come from nothing - and what a Beautiful Thing it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare gem in cinema","review":"Most movies of this type either follow stereotypes or are just plain unbelieveable. Beautiful Thing does neither, and thus I give it 5 stars.Shy Jamie and athletic Ste seem like two normal young lads in the beginning of the film. After Ste can't handle the abuse from his father and brother, he decides to sleep over at his next door neighbor Jamie's house. One thing leads to another and they fall in love...and best of all, there's a happy ending. :-)The well-chosen Mama Cass/Mama's and The Papa's soundtrack gives this movie a nostalgic, innocent feeling. It is one of the very few movies that portrays a same-sex romance as a monagamous relationship. No promiscuity here...Again, I see this as something of a rare movie. If only there were a few more movies like this..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love was never so beautiful","review":"I saw this lovely film for the first time over two years ago. Since then, in an attempt to understand so-called gay cinema, serious or otherwise, I found only this beautiful thing over and over as the ultimate joy of life and love, without life and love's constraints. Much gay film avoids love in favor of sex or love or at least does the disservice of showing a Spelling woman in dishvelled hair onstage.The young guys in this film fall in love. That is what we all want. They do it so nicely that we accept it. Are Glen and Scott gay? Does it matter?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Of Film","review":"This movie has been one of my personal favourites ever since I had the pleasure of seeing it on the big screen. A common theme coming through from all the other reader reviews is that the DVD that they have purchased is of an inferior quality. If you all log on to amazon.co.uk - then you can buy a non import version which is 100% better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not perfect...","review":"I had great fun watching this movie, but it simply didn't turn out as well as I expected it to, based on all these 5 star reviews. However, it rates as a near-perfect film in my very critical mind, and that's enough to give it 4 stars, but I reserve 5 stars for movies such as 'Hollow Reed'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumbs up!","review":"This is must see movie. The love between Jamie and Ste is awsome. A great coming out movie. Check it out for yourself, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie gets 5 stars, the DVD gets 1","review":"This is one of my all time favorites, but I was very disappointed with the DVD. What everyone says is true... no features, subtitles that you can't get rid of, bad sound. I kept it however because the movie is just so good. I will be keeping my eye out for a real DVD release of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Story - DVD is POS","review":"This is a great movie and I have the VHS which I will be keeping because the DVD is a POS. (Its the main reason I've given it a rating of one.) The quality of the DVD is ... and the color (especially on red) is so over driven it bleeds and is almost unwatchable. I've seen better quality on VHS! Then there is the issue of Chinese subtitles **BURNED** into the picture. How bush league!!Unfortuately, I bought this some time ago and just decided to watch it again. Needless to say I went balistic when I saw the burned in subtitles. This little \\"feature\\" was NOT noted in any of the details. Amazon.com should offer to buy all thiese back."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 'feel good' movie","review":"What a great Saturday afternoon listening to the Mammas and Pappas and see 2 gorgeous teens fall in love. Funny, sad and more. Coulda, shoulda but glad 'they' did. At first I thought the accent would be to heavy but that worked out fine as the movie progressed. This movie will be on my mind for awhile"},{"rating":"2","title":"ADDICTED TO BEAUTIFUL THING","review":"This movie is by far the best movie I have ever seen. This film should have been nominated for an oscar - along with Linda Henry for best actress. I stumbled upon this film one late night via sattelite. I live in San Lorenzo Ca. (Part of the S.F. Bay Area.) and dont remember this film ever being released. I am now the proud owner of two copies of this video and I'm waiting for the DVD release. I have recommended this film to a few friends - and now they own copies as well. NOTE: This film is for everyone GAY or STRAIGHT! And I truly believe that any parent of a gay or lesbian child should see this film immidiately!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate, funny, and sincere","review":"\\"Beautiful Thing\\" is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen. It deals with the touchy subject of homosexuality in a sincere and heartwarming manner. The acting is superb and was worthy of Oscar nominations. This story is both touching and important. If more directors would do justice to issues such as this the movie industry would do a great credit to itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie - Really Bad DVD","review":"I was vert disappointed with the quality of this DVD, because I really love the film. The quality is terrible, there are no menus, and no way to turn off the subtitles. It's very distracting, and makes watching the film difficult. Get a copy of the video instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Bad DVD","review":"Just adding to the negative comments. This is a horrible DVD. In addition to the giant Chinese subtitles, the picture and sound quality are terrible. This seems more like a bootleg video than a quality DVD.Avoid this. Buy the video or wait until the DVD is released by another company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly beautiful","review":"One of the first films depicting gay teen love that rings true throughout and does not descend into sordidness, depression, or despair. I saw this in the theatre fully expecting a suicide or similar trauma, but instead was treated to an uplifting and liberating romance. Steals the thunder from the multitude of straight love flicks, and defies formula, to grand effect. Deserves a place in the libary of anyone that worships Love in its infinite variety of forms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly sweet","review":"I recently bought this video solely on the advice of a friend who recommended that I see this movie. I am not sorry that I went ahead and bought it without seeing it first. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone wanting to see a love story with a slightly different twist. The title of the movie says it all, it's Beautiful. It's also incredibly sweet to see the relationship between Ste and Jaimie evolve in something deeper. Every one should see this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Hate To Sound Like Every One Eles But...","review":"this movie is great!!! i feel that this movie has much to offer. A more than believable story line, a couple of funny scenes, a few sentimental scenes which balance each other out with out making one side too heavy, with many different people's points of views. The actors are great all around especially Ms. Tameka who plays the \\"slag\\" leah... but the main reason why this movie gets a perfect score from me is because well.... It's just down right entertaining. perhaps the movie that i watch the most out of them all is purely addictive... and GOT TO LOVE THAT MAMA CASS."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Coming-out Movie Of All Time!!","review":"An exquisitely intricate tale, set in an ambiguous era (it all looks and feels to be the 1960's - particularly with the addition of a few classsic Mama Cass tunes - and yet plays like a 90's drama).Often hilarious, this touching tale resonates soundly in the minds of all who have ever fallen in love (be it gay or straight).The performances are all amazing, but particular attention must be paid to Linda Henry, who positively scalds the celluloid with her top-rate performance.Without doubt, a true British Classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The title tells all.....","review":"I did not know what to expect from this film since I had never heard of it. While watching, I became totally absorbed, and I realized that this was one of the best films I have seen in many years. A simple story that exposes acceptance and first love at the same time is the best description that I can give. I have watched it 3 times so far, and have become engrossed with the individual storylines and have had quite a ball learning some British slang and understanding the dialect a little better. My vote is with everyone else....we must have the DVD version here in the States!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem!!!!","review":"I worked for a while at an art movie house and i went to see this on a lark. I figured, \\"Ho, hum, another coming out movie.\\" I was pleasantly suprised! So suprised that i went back five more times to see it during it's run at the theatre. I was also lucky enough to play Ste in a stage production in my home town last year, and the magic and beauty and purity of the relationship between the two boys touched me even deeper. If you're considering buying this film, do it now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I've ever seen","review":"This movie re-sparked my partner's and my romance. It takes an extrordinary film to invoke that kind of emotion. Thank you, Hettie MacDonald!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A One Of A Kind Classic Gem! When Will We See The DVD?","review":"I received a copy of this film from my best friend, who came across it accidentally. I have totally fallen madly in love with the entire cast of this movie. The performances are excellent! This has to be by far one of the best films ever made. I cant understand why it is not available on DVD here in the states. I will probably hold out for another couple of months, just waiting to see if it will be released on DVD. If not, I will by the Asian version that is available overseas. I understand it can be played in all regions."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL IN EVERY WAY!","review":"This is not your typical gay movie. This film will grab your attention, then suck you in faster than the black hole itself. Its nice to see a gay themed film that's full of heart, and not tragedy, or AIDS related issues. I agree with the majority of people who have posted their reviews - Their should be a DVD version."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE!","review":"I am a very private person, and never published my opinions of a movie I liked online. With this movie, I have to say something.I have a new favorite movie. There simply is no more touching movie in existance. I cannot see any reason to give it any less than 5 stars. There are and will be other movies with similar plot lines and characters, but REST ASSURED, it will NOT top Beautiful thing! NO other movie has or ever will want to make me buy any scrap of merchandise available. I have the tape and screenplay, and DEFINITELY will buy the DVD when it becomes available.I recommend this movie to EVERYONE! The acting was SUPERB, and could not have been topped by any other actors and crew.See this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting for the real thing","review":"This is one of my favorite \\"small\\" films; very real, very honest and with a great soundtrack. Saw the play too and loved it. This DVD though is a Chinese (Japanese?) pressing with no extras. I sent it back and am still waiting for the American release. Caveat emptor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with VHS [* * * * *] for now!","review":"Beautiful Thing is a beautiful thing, indeed...as long as it's the VHS version. The reviews here have helped me continue to wait for a GOOD DVD of the movie. Meanwhile I'll keep my VHS alive. As to the movie itself I give it 5 stars. Implausible but beautiful dream for sure, yet a heartstring-tugger for this writer. I still can't figure out why Jamie's mom ditched her boyfriend. He seemed a rather good sort. All-in-all it's one of my all-time favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This DVD is a complete waste of money. Sound and picture quality are mediocre. Do not buy this thinking you'll just turn off the annoying subtitles. You can't. Wait for the real thing, if it ever comes out in the States."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie! Sorry DVD. (Petition Sony Pictures at...)","review":"I bought this DVD and then returned it. It is a Hong Kong import with Chinese subtitles and happens to be the only Region 1 formatted DVD of Beautiful Thing. The video quality is awful, much worse than you get from a new VHS tape.The Region 2 formatted DVD features: theatrical trailer and biographies. Scene access. Soundtrack in Dolby surround and widescreen aspect ratio. You can get it ...for less than you'll spend for this DVD except that you must have the proper equipment to watch it.Contact Sony Pictures Classics ...and request like I did that a version of the Region 2 formatted DVD be released in Region 1 format for US/Canadian audiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why one should always read reviews of products...","review":"While I was extremely delighted to see that there was a release of this film on DVD format, I let that fact get the better of me before researching the entire product. The film itself is quite possibly one of the most brilliant \\"gay\\" films ever. The characters and story line are honest and crisp. HOWEVER, I was completely disappointed when I recieved the film and there were CHINESE SUBTITLES????? Funny that fact was omitted from the \\"product details\\" although I would consider that an important piece of information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Film, Terrible DVD","review":"This beautiful, charming, heart-warming, endearing and moving film about coming out as gay in a working-class milieu has been given an abysmal transfer onto DVD, imported from China with huge Chinese subtitles that cannot be turned off and interfere abominably with the viewer's pleasure. The quality of both the sound and the picture is also poor. I returned it. It is to be hoped that an excellent transfer with extra features which we expect on DVD will be available soon. Don't buy it! Instead, get the VHS, or wait for a good DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Official U.S. DVD Version Arriving May 20, 2003","review":"\\"Beautiful Thing\\" truly is one of the best gay feature films made. It's one of the best films made, period.Just wanted everyone to know that it's finally coming to DVD. The official version is being released May 20, 2003 from Columbia TriStar. So if any of you have been waiting for it and have been leary of getting the above-mentioned poor quality knock-off, your wait is finally over!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sending it back...","review":"Loved the film, too bad the dvd is such a joke.

Girl-next-door is crazy but loveable. Boys get found out. No one gets bashed or dies of AIDS. All the characters we fall in love with on this film's journey live happy-ever-after.This was my first gay mainstream film to buy on vhs, right after I came out of the closet. At the time, all gay films involved storylines about lifetimes spent in the closet, bashing and disease. This film was a blast of fresh air and sunshine in a sea of films filled with sadness.So this year, I replaced my very tired tape with a new DVD...and should have done so many years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie IS a beautiful thing","review":"Not just for your gay friends - this is a movie about love of many kinds. I love this movie! (But make sure to brush up on your working-class English accents before watching.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Thing, impossible to understand","review":"This movie is very difficult to understand, is spoken in a British jargon which is impossible to follow. It does not have any subtitles or a better translation to an American Standard English. I recommend buying it only if you live in the UK and understand their jargon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Flawed Thing","review":"Many gay reviewers unfortunately have not been balanced in rating films like this and rate it so highly primarily due to a misguided loyalty to anything gay rather than things of quality.This film has a touching storyline at times and I have to admire that, however it is far too flawed in its disjointed and very assuming storytelling to deserve such a high rating and content wise the love story, coming of age and coming out may be beautiful but the drug content, language and sudden coming out of many characters who were straight without clear explaination of the reversal of sexuality is more than a little confusing.An average film dipicting poor, violent and crass British folks and the love between two teenage boys in this enviroment. Has some very touching moments, but overall highly flawed.The DVD would also have benefitted from optional subtitles, like most do, for those of us who find the heavy British accents hard to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thirty Years Ago, It Might Have Meant Something","review":"But this sentimental claptrap, rife with working class cliches, just a dash of racism and unrealistic fantasies of sexuality, just shows how desperate some people are for movies to come and simplify everything.I can certainly see how a gay teenager, especially one who feels under threat, would flip for this film; but as art it is dishonest, shockingly unevolved in its politics, and dangerous. The John Hughes-ization -- heterosexualization and MTV-ization -- of gay life continues at an alarming pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most tasteful and significant coming-out movie to date","review":"I have seen many coming-of-age / coming-out movies, and to say that this movie is the best of this genre would be a gross understatement. I have yet to see a movie of this type done with as much taste, intelligence and honesty as this one. Uncluttered by the \\"side issues\\" of gay life, this movie focuses straight in on the most important and essential issues facing young gay youth: identity, conflict, and acceptance. Exceptional performances by Glen Berry and Scott Neil., but I must admit the standout performer in this movie is Linda Henry. This is a strongly recommended movie for gay teens who are exploring themselves, as well as for straight teens, who will gain a better understanding of how their gay counterparts feel. For those teens out there who may not know how to get the \\"coming out\\" dialog started with their family, this is the perfect movie to break the ice.

The brachiosaurus has the high quality we have come to expect from Schleich - sturdy and close attention to detail. This particular dino has a few small spots where the paint is chipped or worn off. Not enough to notice at a casual glance, but definitely some flaws.

They are very difficult to apply to an 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of paper without the plastic wrinkling, and ruining whatever you are trying to apply them to. I work with paper a lot and have good manual dexterity, but ruined 3 color copies before I decided to stop trying. The only function a laminating machine would serve with these sheets, is to press it down more (on the cold setting) after you have already adhered the plastic sheet to the paper. In my case, the damage was already done. These sheets may be useful for some other crafting function, but they are not at all suited for something that needs the waterproofing and reinforcement of true laminating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"They look like they would be stiff and durable, but they're not.

I went to see Earl perform with his band last Friday night here in Atlanta and was entertained for over 3 hours with songs from several of his albums, including Naked Guitar. If you've never seen him perform you are missing a definite treat. His band is amazing, Lenny Price, David Lee (Spradley), Al Turner, all were in rare form (as usual) and shared several solo spots with Earl. His humor between songs left the audience in stitches as he shared a more intimate side. He signed my copy of \\"Heartstrings\\" afterwards as he shared some trivia about the song \\"Balladina\\" from his album \\"Crazy for You\\", and how it relates to a song performed by Angela Bofill on one of her early albums.

After not hearing this album for 15+ years, I appreciate \\"Debra Ann\\" (you can hear the love in that song) and \\"Moon and Stars\\" much more than I did in my early 20's.

If there was any current information (the statistics may have been current), I don't think it was worth reading the entire book just to locate current information on gang activity in the U.S. I'm using this book as a textbook for a class I am teaching (I assumed it would be similar the GIA 2nd edition), but I will definitely change books next semester.

This 5 song collection is some of their best 80's material including \\"Money Talks\\" and \\"Are You Ready\\".The best thing about AC/DC is their straight-ahead song styling and hard rocking. Exclusive use of basic rock instruments and power chording to perfection complements their in-your-face lyrics - usually about women & drinkin.Its what rock is supposed to be!!Try this one and then get the others to sort of round out the experience with the greatest rock band of all time - AC/DC!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"25 Minute Clipped","review":"Now that AC/DC has a dvd out containing all of the videos to these songs (Family Jewels), this vhs version pales in comparison!!

The features advertized on this watch are very counter-intuitive and very difficult to use. The light on the watch is not the indiglow kind, but the one that shines only a part of the face of the watch. Also, the analog part of the watch is set by using a button that only makes the minute hand move forward.In my opinion, you're better off paying a little more for a decent watch, but if you are really looking for a cheap watch, just go to Target or Walmart.

Their point in the end is to stop the name calling, which does happen. some innaccuracies: 1) kids in middle school aren't that mean. 2) its unrealistic to think that four geeky seventh graders are going to get boyfriends or girlfriends, especially with popular people. 3) the ending-something out of a teen movie. still, read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Misfits","review":"This is a wonderful book (for older teens) and as a person who has suffered from teasing and name calling it sounds great. My problem is that this appeared on my 10-year-old brother's reading list. When you are ten and entering the sixth grade, you do not give this book for them to read. As a high schooler I know gay people and am friends with them. I am not intolerant of them. The problem is it is recommended for 10 - 14 year olds. You grow up tremendously from these ages. I feel 12 is the earliest you should read this. I read the book and it backed me up. I read books in school that deal with many issues.

We all know that middle school years can be tough, and a lot of authors write about these situations. I believe that this book is going to help me through the next two years because it has taught me how much names can hurt and eventually scar people. James Howe uses a very creative and unpredictable voice, which has taught me a lot about style. I would happily read the sequel which is titled Totally Joe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read Book...","review":"A Must Read Book?This book is great; it tells about this group of friends who don?t fit in. That?s mostly why the title is called, ?The Misfits?. They are just like a normal group of friends who want to fit in. One character in this book decides to not recite the Pledge of Allegiance with the class. It ends up that she gets in trouble and gets sent down to the counselor to have a little talk. Another character is the class clown and gets in trouble because he makes rude comments about the character whom gets in trouble because she doesn?t recite the Pledge of Alliance. The group of friends goes to a restaurant and they debate about stuff at school and other stuff like politics, etc. This group of friends are best buds and change their nicknames more often than their shoes.

I agree with the previous reviewers that say that Marillion has put out some albums prior to this jewel that were still good just not great ... I was elated to listen to this album and have since been able to also obtain the two disc version. Songs I think stand out 'Fantastic Place', 'you're gone' (yes upbeat (compared to the more darker songs on this album, kinda out of place but still an excellent tune), and from the double album the epic 'ocean cloud' is a treat. I just love this band and I suggest everybody to get out there and 'discover a lost art, play marbles'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Commercail success finally?","review":"I recently saw Marillion in concert. Since the album wasn't released yet I didn't recognize any of the songs. I loved every one. There are several radio friendly songs on Marbles \\"Don't Hurt Yourself\\" and \\"Angelina\\" should satisfy the mainstream listeners. Eventhough, this album has a more commercial sound than their previous releases, Marillions strong musicianship and song writing is very evident."},{"rating":"2","title":"The world's gone mad!","review":"When you can put on an album and just sit back and do nothing, just let the music take you on an emotional and powerful journey, it's really something special about it. There are very few albums that have the same effect on me like Marbles have. Its melodic and professional, sometimes relaxing, sometimes upbeat music takes you through a delightful darkness with a colourful brightness and a loving atmosphere. Not in the same musical style as Misplaced Childhood, but it still brings the question; \\"Can music be any better than this\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finest In Years","review":"I was a little sceptical about this album considering the last three albums Marillion released. Not being a fan of 'Radiation', 'Marillion.com' and 'Anoraknophobia, I wasn't sure what to expect. Reading through the fan club newsletter the band said the new album would be darker than the previous albums. Knowing Marillion's track record, dark usually meant 'great'. Thank goodness this was the case.From the opening notes of 'Invisible Man' to the commerically available songs 'Don't Hurt Yourself' and 'You're Gone', this album meets and surpasses all preconceived ideas.As they said in the 'Brave' liner notes, listen to this album in the dark with the music LOUD! Those that still can't see Steve Hogarth as the lead singer of the band, you should have seen him sing Marbles live this summer, unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with the marbles?","review":"I stopped buying Marillion after 'Made Again' and gave up on them after the wretched 'Afraid of sunlight'. It doesn't seem that I missed much. Marillion I fear never got over the loss of Fish and with each cd it appears to be the case. Steve H's vocals will either thrill you or irritate you depending on your mood. I have never gotten used to his voice despite repeated listenings. I did like 'Brave' but only because the music was particularly good. 'Marbles' is a strange one, way too many introspective slower tracks and not enough rockers. It's a laid back disc a bit like 'Brave'. The longer tracks: 1 & 11 work better than the whole of the disc. The band puts in a good performance but nothing that requires repeated listenings sorry to say. Sound quality is very good. Full booklet/lyrics/credits plus a video of 'Don't hurt yourself'. 11 tracks/64.11."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird music...","review":"They are journeying more and more into unknown territory..

No passion or presence, just a weak and passive voice, which utterly bores me.Fish is my god and H is nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best since Afraid of Sunlight...or ever!!","review":"Marillion have been my favorite band for the last 15 years, and this CD is nothing short of stunning. I thought Anoraknophobia was OK, with a bit too much filler and .com and Radiation were both disappointing. But Marbles...First, spend the extra money and get the 2 CD version. Ocean Cloud is worth the extra money all by itself. You won't regret it.I won't do a breakdown of each song (you're welcome!), but personal favorites are Invisible Man, Fantastic Place, Ocean Cloud and Neverland. If you've been wondering where Steve Rothery has been, well, he's all over this CD. The guitar in Neverland brings back the goosebumps missing since Brave and AoS.Highly recommended. Marillion were slipping in my eyes the last few recordings, but they hit a Home Run with this one. Good job, boys, and thanks for stopping by to see us. Hope to see you Summer 2005."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Finally... a new album from Marillion. I was very anxiously awaiting this album. I finally bought it and I sometimes wonder whether my expectations were just too high?MY favorite albums (AOS, Anorak, Clutching) still seem better than this one. I didn't quite like \\"Map of the world\\" previously and this album has many of those songs. I wonder if Marillion is taking a turn into a more mainstream direction??????A few songs are really old fashion Marillion but I really have to get used to a new Marillion.I guess they are appealing to a much younger crowd...I'll wait for the next one. Long live Clutching at Straws!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best effort With Hogarth Since Brave","review":"First off, you need to be sure and get the double cd version of this album. If you can't find it on here, go to the band's website and buy it from them direct. A classic track \\"Ocean Cloud\\" with an incredible guitar solo and awesome lyrics are on that version. A fine return to form after a few year of experimentation.

I bought it after seeing the good reviews and after hearing Neverland. Sadly, after getting the album I found that Neverland is the only good song. The record is boring. I have listened to it at least 5 times over the last few months, and it doesn't sound any better. I wasn't impressed with this album at all.IMHOI have been listening to this CD again. Now it is growing on me. The CD isn't that bad. You have to listen to it several times to know the parts that are good and which are bad.

But boy did they grow. I saw them live when Seasons End was released and Steve Hogarth blew me away with his on stage performance.Ever since then, Marillion has grown into something unique. Steve Rothery's guitar remains as haunting as ever, echoing over Mark Kelly's keyboards and blending with Pete Trewavas' bass riffs. Hogarth's vocal talent, for me, has been what Marillion needed. Fish fits into the old Marillion but Steve dominates the new.Marbles continues to prove that Marillion have what it took, what it takes and what they need to continue for years to come.If you are old school Marillion and haven't bought an album since 'Clutching....' then Marbles is a great way of getting you back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let it grow on you","review":"This is a review of the single cd version.On the first listen I was surprised it sounded so mainstream (for Marillion, anyway).

If you ever need to reset it, just run your finger along the thermometer and it should fix it. I've had mine freeze a couple times on rapidly changing temps (for my refill bucket for water changes). It does have an upper limit of 82 degrees though (it can technically measure up to 83), and that means if you are making sure your water is the right temp for changing water, you will have to wait for the temp. of the water to drop below 83 for it to show on the thermometer.

I hope this was just one bad book. Otherwise there is no hope for the reading public. THIS WAS AWFUL.It began with repeated phrases (three and four times in the same number of paragraphs). The overall stench just worsened with every predictable and trite description. What's worse-- the trite descriptions were of southern rural life rather than midwestern, as were the bad snippets of dialogue.Did anyone bother to edit this? Our female protagonist puts a pot of coffee on the stove, gets her newspaper, comes back and pours a cup?

The small town setting could have worked out if it had been handled a little bit better.

There are a lot of similarities between them. In both movies there is a \\"duel\\" between a suspect and interrogator. Both movies are set in the police station. In both movies there is a psychological drama and an unexpected finale. Also there is a love story and a final redemption of the main character. But the French movie has an otherworldly and mystical twist while \\"Under Suspicion\\" stays totally secular.Although \\"Under Suspicion\\" is not a complete lemon, the ending is a big disappointment. On the other hand, in \\"Pure Formality\\" not only acting is great; but the ending also is awesome. If \\"Under Suspicion\\" is worth watching at all, it is only because of some interesting filming techniques and great soundtrack, inspired by the Puerto-Rican Carnival.

How else would I have known that this DVD would not work in Canada. Therefore I am out the cost of the DVD and the postage which totalled close to $16.00 (because it was sent to me from Europe).

The ending threw me off. Thinking that I missed something, I reviewed the last ten minutes. No change.Here's my take on the ending...When Detective Owens stumbled in on Hearst's interrogation to deliver the seemingly incriminating photos to Detective Benezet, Owens cleverly stated that Chantal took the initiative to lead the detectives to the incriminating photographs. Owens' statement was not true because Chantal clearly had no knowledge of the photographs before Owens discovered them for himself in the darkroom. Since Hearst heard Owens statement, Owens unknowingly tricked Hearst into thinking that Chantal had discovered the photographs prior to the murders. At this point Hearst assumed that Chantal murdered the young girls out of jealously and rage, notwithstanding the fact that the victims were precluded by the fondness Hearst kept for their neice. Because of his inequities, Hearst felt responsible for her actions.

The music verges on the unendurable, with whole performances drowned in the worst kind of smooth jazz with moments of 80s synthesizer schlock. The talent of the acrobats and aerialists is matched only by the fetor of their wardrobe, an unimaginably hideous panoply of dreck, sort of 'punk rock on an acid trip' meets 'revenge of the psycho hairdresser.'There are a handful of bright moments -- a 'family' scene at the beginning that was quite touching, a nimble group of pole-climbers, and some lithe bungee-aerialists toward the end. The lead singer is striking and has a beautiful, ethereal voice - but someone should shoot her costume designer.My overall opinion is that Cirque du Soleil offers better fare for the price. Check out Varekai, Quidam, Dralion, or the Journey of Man, all of which are much superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camera direction RUINS this one.

They seem to be of a more ductile metal than other 1 3/4 roofers we use in that price range, e.g., griprite. They drive easier from the gun and aren't as brittle so the heads don't snap off if you have to pull them, but they have a tendency to bend more when pounding by hammer. They seem to hold as well as a nail that length should. Occasionally in cold weather the lower wire between nails snaps before the nail advances (this happened in different model roofing nailers) creating a jam easily cleared by advancing the nail manually.A solid product for the price, but it might be worth paying for a slightly more reliable brand if it would cost more in labor over the life of the whole box to pay guys to clear the occasional jam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Short Album","review":"This album is an excellent display of these guys' music talent. The 5 songs on this album really show the ability of the band to play all types of music. The song \\"Bourgeois Blues\\" is just like the title, very blues-rocky. While the ballad \\"Trucker's Lullaby\\" is a haunting story of a man's last thoughts as he nears his sudden and unexpected death. Perhaps the best song on the album is \\"Bad Day,\\" which shows just how versatile this band is. It is a mesh of great music/lyrics/and feel.It is very difficult to figure out what genre of music Willis belongs to. It sounds like a combination of old school mellow rock to modern rock. This album, and the band in general, definitely has Paul Simon like influences but with a modern edge.All in all, this album is very good. The only problem with is that it only has 5 songs.

Zao has manned up once again and are back with avengeance. Scott and Russ, two incredible guitarists, have seemed to stray away from the more technical side of metal and just bring it hard and heavy with some thoroughly enjoyable riffs. Dan is as good as ever on vocals. The Funeral of God also has a very interesting theme that is present throughout the entire album. Zao has put much work into this release and it definately shows. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mighty ZAO returns!!!","review":"I was hoping it'd be longer than this. That's always been a problem with ZAO for me is that their CDs are just way too short. For this one however, it sounds like a cross between Parade of Chaos mixed with the demos they did with corey as vocalist, and mushed up with Society's Finest. They also lost their atmosphere. I loved Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest, Liberate Ex Inferis, and Self-Titled because they pack alot of atmosphere. I mean their CDs really move you. However this one lost it's atmosphere, but they made up for it with great, intelligent, and thought provoking lyrics. I'm proud to announce to the world that the mighty ZAO has returned! Buy this, but also pick up their old stuff if you don't yet own any of it. LONG LIVE ZAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its amazing what a little time can do","review":"This album is awesome. Simply put. Zao has truly outdone themselves this time. I lvoe the whole feel of it. It reminds of Russ, Dan, and Steven's old band Seasons in the Field. The concept really was something they stumbled upon, according to Dan. And I am glad they did. It's a great, thought provoking concept, one which Solid State would have allowed, but wouldn't have given enough time to pursue. Dan said that the previous albums where pretty much thrown together in a couple of weeks, but this one took a few months. It shows. Everything was done with precision and care. If you like the stuff before, you will love this so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zao Never Fails","review":"With all the metal bands going mainstream lately (Underoath, Atreyu, etc.) I didnt know what to expect from \\"Funeral Of God\\". The concept of the album is intriguing. Zao explores the possibility of God turning his back on humanity for turning our back on Him and the apocalypse which ensues. Every song on the album is good although some are way better than others. I dont know how Zao continues to make such amazing records through all their changes but they do and they did with \\"Funeral of God\\" so pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst album since Dan joined the band","review":"Zao was probably one of the most unfocused bands out there today. Their purpose and direction have been all over the place. So to attempt to bring the band into focus they made this concept album. While the concept may be cool enough, the music is another story. In their own words the change was supposed to be about the music, but I hear no evidence of this. I found the album to be dispassionate and uninteresting. It just lacks that same gritty groove that I found appealing. I tried to give it a chance, but I just couldn't get into it. After about 10 listens I deleted it out of my mp3 player. This is nowhere in the same league as \\"Parade of Chaos\\" or \\"Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest.\\" While I'm sure they thought this new direction would bring them a wider audience base, that audience doesn't include me. Whatever you're doing to try to focus your direction, please stop it Zao."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME","review":"Zao, one of the legends of hardcore, just released this one, and I have to say, I like it so much more than the others.

Zao keeps going and keeping it true heavy. \\" no sell out\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"change can still be good","review":"Zao comes out with yet another album and yet, another change. Ever since \\"Where Blood and Fire...\\" almost every album has changed, but Zao still held true in most of their efforts. This album is VERY different from their past albums, especially if you look all the way back to \\"The Splinter...\\", but it is really well put together and sounds great! With the return of Russ Cogdell on guitars and Dan Weyandt back on the mic., you knew something good had to come from it. It's still strange to not see Jesse Smith on the kit; afterall he was the only one left from the ORIGINAL Zao. Never-the-less, it all worked out and this is an album for Zao fans to have. Of course, keep your musical minds open because it can be a rough listen if you're fully focusing on the older albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but Very Sweet!","review":"When I first heard the voice of Rebecca Eaglin, I must say that it was a blessed experience. God has blessed this young lady with a beautiful, angelic like voice. She sings sincerely from the soul, and you can tell that she has a deep and true love for Jesus Christ. \\"God Says You Can\\" is simply remarkable. It was a joy to hear both the original and remix versions. \\"Worthy\\" was Spirit-filled! \\"It's Not In Vain\\", \\"Love Lifted Me\\", and \\"Cry No More\\" were also beautiful and spiritual. I was truly touch by the heart and voice of this young teenager. The album is more of an ep with being a little bit over half an hour long, but it's worth the price because I know I would pay it just to hear her sing. Hopefully, this is just her first effort, and that there will be many more great things to come from this beautiful, young lady of God. When she sings \\"God Says You Can\\", you will believe you can achieve anything! God is Love!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Spirit, Awesome Voice, Heart-felt Ministry","review":"Rebecca was totally captivating during her performance at the Seattle Area Gospel Radio Announcers Guild Conference.

This album is to be sent into the second category. Actually, only two tracks are really worth it, \\"kisses in the moonlight\\", which he sometimes performs live, and the rythmic \\"shiver\\". That's it. Fortunately enough, Benson seems to have overcome difficult moments and his latest two cds (That's right, and Standing together) are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Pop than Jazz or R&B...","review":"This 1986 project may not rival Benson's biggest smash album Give Me The Night, but it's pop accessible and listener friendly...While no particular track may jump out like the classic Give Me The Night, the production and execution are still ear catching and toe tapping at best !

Generally i'm very impressed with Proper's releases but this one was a major disappointment to me. I was lead to believe that there were a lot of Delroy's Rocksteady classics on this album, but that is not the case. Most, if not all of the recordings on these CD's are Bunny Lee produced recordings from the 70's. And the songs on here that are considered to be Delroy's classic Rocksteady recordings are 70's remakes of those songs, and not the Studio One originals from the late 60's.Now mind you this is a pretty good collection of Delroy's material and there are some good tunes in here. However, i bought the CD thinking that it had a lot of the Studio One Rocksteady cuts on it and it doesn't.

The steering wheel is really hard to turn (even the 5 y.o. has trouble with it) and the pedals are pretty hard to turn for a young one. The description may say that the wheels are rubber but they are not. They're the same old plastic wheels that crack over time and that have no traction.

I have a GBC brand laminator with a 5mil setting, and it worked perfectly with these Fellowes pouches - no missed seals, nice and tight against the paper. I think with most any thermal laminator, you have to be careful to try and feed it evenly and straight into the machine, as well as have some support for it as it comes out to minimize warping. I was doing a stack of papers for signage, and each one had a very small amount of bend/curling in the sense that, when you had the finished stack of signs, they didn't lay perfectly flat on each other. That said, these made much more durable signs and were less prone to curling and warping than the 3mil sheets I've used in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, good quality","review":"My daughters and I recently purchased a laminating machine (Scotch brand) because of the good price. We've used these to laminate morning and afternoon chore instruction sheets and some recipe cards (which I then cut).The quality is perfect. They appear to be heavy duty for when you're laminating something that will be used often. The pouches are clear. I'm not sure that I can expect more than that (good price, good quality, see thru).I don't see any cons to using the Fellowes brand pouches. I'm not sure that we'll use 100 of them quickly, so maybe a smaller package would be better for most people, but having the extras on hand doesn't hurt.If you're laminating smaller items that you then need to cut, my advice is to buy smaller pouches rather than use scissors to make the item smaller. It's just nicer looking. Since this is the only size we had, I thought I'd give it a try. It works, don't get me wrong, but smaller pouches is just more ideal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great laminating film!","review":"As a homeschooler and a tutor, I laminate quite a lot of things.

When utilizing the pouches, I used aScotch Thermal Laminator 2 Roller System (TL901)as the lamination source. The end result was a document tightly laminated without a hitch.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fellowes Pouches Work Well","review":"With a Fellowes laminator I have laminated several sizes of paper objects. When laminating papers smaller than 8 1/2 x 11 it is important to leave a sealed margin around the whole object when cutting otherwise the seal will not be waterproof. If the margin is kept I have found the laminated papers will stay unmarred by a driving rain storm. We make signs for our stand at a farmers' market so have plenty of water to contend with, shaken off of vegetables or on a rainy day. No problem with the Fellowes laminated paper signs. If you are under the gun to get laminations out quickly be sure to allow time for the laminator to warm up before you can make signs. Also, I make sure that I can \\"receive\\" the laminated pages after they flow through the laminator. That way they will be sure to \\"dry\\" flat.

There were no bubbles or wrinkles, and all four edges were tightly adhered. They are crystal clear.I like these 5 mil thick pouches better than the 3 mil, because the 3 mil just feels flimsy in your hand. However, some ingredient sheets that I laminated with 3 mil pouches about two years ago are holding up fine, despite being abused in the cookbook rack in a busy kitchen.

Plagued with air bubbles and \\"foggy\\" patches, the finished projects were not usable (and definitely not sellable, for those who use their laminaters for craft projects).

'Systematic' is relatively a new band on the heavy rock scene and while it's riffs and chords are highly repetitive song to song, the songs are totally enjoyable and not to lite. Infact this is a prime example of heavy rock with a touch of nu-metal. This album 'Somewhere In Between' is almost a hour long with 3 good songs, 'Glass Jaw', 'Slowburn' and 'If Only'.

Regular guys like Mert Lawill driving along in his Ford Econoline van with his racing bike in the back. On the way to a race they would stop and test their bikes on farmer's side roads! Nowadays racers ride around in Gulfstream jets and their (many) race bikes are hauled around in huge corporate-sponsored semi trucks. As an airline pilot, I frequently fly over what's left of the old San Jose Fairgrounds and I always remember seeing my first Mile there in 1977--the dirt clods from the racer's back tires flying through the cyclone fence at turn one where we were standing! A must-have, especially now that it's on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Found it!","review":"My husband has been looking for this movie for a while.

The results were better, but my red toy poodle still had tear stains. So I added TrueBlue Safe and Sure Eye Wipes to the mix. I used them every day and got a rust colored stain on the wipes every time after wiping her face. I think the wipes actually made it worse. Then I discovered Veterinarian's Best Pet Swabs Tear Stain Guard (product being reviewed) and quit using the wipes. It probably reduced the tear stains by 70%, but I had to use a swab every day. At this point I'm down to the twice a week maintenance of Angels' Eyes. Next month she'll have been on it for 9 months and I can start the regime over and use Angels' Eyes daily. I'm hoping the tear stains will improve at that time. Not sure if I will try the product being reviewed again. I probably will if Angels' Eyes don't work more effectively when I go back to daily use.

I at least have an office and don't have to live with the cubicle dwellers and my boss is somewhat brighter than Dilbert's, but it's still scary how realistic Dilbert's world is.I would have given this book 5 stars except all of these cartoons appear, in sequence, in my 2001 Dilbert desk calendar, so I've already read many of them and I have no reason now to flip to the next day on my calendar. That's almost Dilbert-esque, in a way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too close to reality for comfort!","review":"Despite a limited group of characters and settings, Scott Adams continues to find funny situations for his characters.

My personal favourite in this collection is Dilbert's discovery that the Moon is populated by the women who love engineers but really, the whole collection is great.These cartoons age very well compared to some strips in the newspapers and they certianly stand several readings.

The Mishna is translated orally, not as text, into English. If you are not concerned about having an English text of the Mishna, then this is a good product. The Hebrew font is clear.

Make that NO trick pony. This is one of weakest representations of art I have ever been subjected to. Brettell is clearly mesmerized by her own voice - a voice which lacks clarity, depth, control, or range - and belts out one diarrhetic blast after another. Her voice ranges from flat to....flat, but being tone deaf - unfortunately - doesn't seem to hold Brettell back one bit. What Brettell lacks in vocal power she definitely does NOT make up for in writing abilities, as her songs are at once lyrically trite and musically grating - a stupifying combination. Brettell is either surrounded by Yes-men or people who intend to do her harm - this could be the only explanation for the team who allowed the recording of such mind-bendingly bad material."},{"rating":"2","title":"HILARIOUS!","review":"I was crushed when Good Guys was cancelled.

I laughed, literally out loud, and that doesn't happen often, but with this show, every week all hour long I laughed at the insane crazy antics from two brilliant actors. The entire supporting cast couldn't have been better chosen.

This game is nowhere near that. Some people may like this game for reasons beyond me, but im going to guess that that number of people is small. The game starts out kind of fun, the first dungeon isnt tedious, and the georama (town maker) is fun to a certain extent. The first boss is too hard for a first boss, and while in the first dungeon, you will find out that weapons break WAY too easily. After you move to the second town, the dungeons get so boring that i had to quit. The dungeons are randomly generated, which basically means no cool zelda puzzles, or cool fight scenes. You end up having to kill all the enemies in the dungeon just for a little bit of fun, and that wears thin after a while. In all, stay away from this game unless you are bored, or want to rent it for a quick play on the weekend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark cloud","review":"Very fun game easy to understand with good plot.

It didn't receive so well in Japan, but they've changed it for America. And what a job they did! This game is so fun! It's not a Zelda a rip-off in anyway. It only looks slightly like Zelda. It's actually pretty different than Zelda. It has some GREAT features to it. The Geo-Rama thing is so much fun to use! This is game is MUCH deeper than Zelda too. The weapons, magic, and fighting system all are more complex than Zelda for the N64. The only problem is that the graphics could have been a bit better, but it in no way hinders the fun of the gameThis is just a great game and I think you should buy it for your PS2. Luckily it lasts a long time too! 30+ hours! Unfortunately most of the reviews below are based on people who haven't played it. Well I have! and it is AWESOME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my personal favs","review":"Gameplay- 10/10The gameplay is very addictive! You complete dungeons to collect town pieces, rebuild them, upgrade your characters, and defeat the final boss. Sounds like fun? YOU BET!Sound-8/10This area is great, don't get me wrong, but it does get a little off with the music. Why? It gets a little old. Still the Sound FX are great!Control-10/10The control is superb! Everything is set so well, it's like the controller and the game were meant to be! I never have problems with the button placement! Very good.Story-9/10The story is a very enjoyable part of this game. Except the Dark Genie thing is a little off. But the idea is great. He destroys your world and you must rebuild it and defeat him once and for all. Sounds pretty sweet.Overall-10/10This game really reaches out and grabs you. An instant hit! Just like the case says!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty of Dark Cloud","review":"Dark Cloud was the first game I bought for PS2, and let me tell you, it's one you don't want to miss, with beautiful graphics and very addictive gameplay it's a keeper. Despite what some people say about it being repetitive I never really got bored because of the cool weapon system and Georama feature. Sure, it looks and plays alot like Zelda but that doesn't mean it stinks. You'll most likely be searching for other titles this holiday season but if all else fails buy Dark Cloud, but be warned it will take much of your time away, not that that's a bad thing.

An infant monkey could've written a better plot(fairly smart infant monkey). Please no one buy this game it is horrible. I played it and found the graphics to be decent, the plot way below average and enemies way too easy. I think this game was made for little kids or the video gamingly challenged. The character is none too bright and every new place you visit you have to go and do the same thing you did at the last place. Every new place you visit gives you a new character so the last character you get, you really don't ever use. This is more primitive than the first Final Fantasy(wich is actualy quite hard).

Bah! After that, put the gem in, open the door, run down a dungeon, rinse, repeat, lather, and rinse!End-to-end, this game is pretty much blah.

There really isn't much of a storyline (I guess I've been spoiled with Final Fantasy/Lunar/Xenogears type games). The only thing that kept me interested was building up the characters weapons. I certainly don't plan on ever playing it again, though. If you want a true RPG, I'd wait for some of the more promising ones coming out in December."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable game","review":"I really liked this game. I was bright and colorful but not too childish. I liked the fact that the point of the game was to retrieve parts of the world and reconstruct it with clues from the inhabitants. The weapon ungrade options were inovative and highly creative. I liked that you could switch between the characters, all of which have different abilities and weapons. Then, there is the fishing. I like that you can take time out to fish and win point that can be exchanged for gems and attribute stones. I played this game for DAYS on end. The monsters got a little repetative, and the maps were all the same, but I still found this game highly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you enjoy Zelda and have a PS2 buy it.","review":"I would definitely buy the game if you like a \\"non-classical\\" type RPG. Dark Cloud takes Zelda and adds in a little sim city. When your actually finding the pieces of the city the game is incredible, but when your just trying to open new passages in dungeons the game does get old. I especialy enjoyed that you can play as different characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative","review":"This is one of the best games i have played for the PS2 yet. You play as a hero who goes around the world and rebuilds it. Alot of the reviews compare it to Zelda on the nintendo 64. They are both very complete different games. The fighting style and the 3rd person are similar, but, the weapon develpment and and character develpment are very different. I like how you can use 6 characters as you wish.The only downfall is when you are in the dungens that the background doesnt change. Overall, it is a game worth playing. Orignal in many different ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it, Play it, Enjoy it","review":"This was a very good game, fun to play, easy to figure out. I have very few complaints. I thought the dungeons were a little to repetitive. They really needed to make the characters and story more indepth. It's like ok I'm the main character, but I have no personality, I was thrown into this adventure (not that I had a choice) but I don't really care. Back to basics the game is simple, fun, and fairly original. A little more indepth and it would be perfect. Dark Cloud 2 anyone?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sub-par graphics??

The different culter atmosphere of the villages is exeptional. For example; the first town you encounter has a mexican atmosphere, while the second has a more primative, native feel. Also, the variety of different fairy-tale characteres was quite original, as you are encountering wizards from a medieval setting and a genie from an Arabian setting.The graphics are excellent and the game is altogether original and tasteful.

All the battle are just single attack button you have to keep pressing. The items are scarce, and there a lot of enemies that takes dozens of hits to kills. The dungens are very reptitive, and looks all the same. The randomly generated dungens sounds like a good idea on the surface, but it is just developers getting lazy and not wanting to design the levels cleverly. The town building part of the game is actually more interesting, but SimCity and Civilization does much much better job of that. It is too painful and repetitive to keep going to dungens and collecting things."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Quest","review":"When I first bought Dark Cloud, I thought hey this looks like a really cool game. At first when i started playin I'm like hey this is a sweet game. But then I found out some of the things you need to do to manage everything. For instance, you have to maintain a water supply because you have 3 little droplets at the top of your screen, and when it gets depleated, it starts to suck your health down. The one that I thought was ridiculous was u have to maintain the strength of your weapon, it has so many hits before it will break, so you have to have a constant suppley of a healer to bring the strength of the weapon back up. STUPID!! All and all though I pretty much like this game. Graphics are incredible and its the first actual RPG game that will take you some time to beat and not like some 7 hrs. game. The concept is pretty cool. You go around and collect these spere lookin things that contain item, people and housing from your village, and then you build up your villiage however you c fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only ok","review":"It's looks like zelda but much more easier. The game is so easy, that I don't see any challenge in it- especially fighting the boss. It also have some bug that I began to notice- for example, the whole screen have black line of Toan (the main character) shadow being split. It looks horrible when that happened. luckily it doesn't occur alot, only a few time in the first dungeon you encounter (Divine beast cave). I suggest anyone who wants to buy it, wait till they fix the minor problem-It can be real annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-Off","review":"I'm terribly sorry to say it, but this game was most likely the worst I game played in a long, long time.

The problem with random dungeons is just that........the whole game seems random. There is no sense of fighting thru the underlings, to get to the \\"boss\\". Yes there is a boss at the end of every dungeon, but there is no progression that's immersive.The graphics are also very \\"cutesy\\". This is a good game for children under 12 or so, would be a nice first \\"RPG\\" for someone, but for serious gamers it becomes very boring very quickly.By far the most \\"fun\\" to be had in this game is goofing around arranging the towns you have to put back together. Unfortunately, most of your time is spent in random dungeons, fighting random mobs, and it all begins to look the same VERY quickly.Rental only"},{"rating":"1","title":"so Repetitive","review":"This is the easiest game ever. its is so repetitive. its not hard at all. you do the same thing on every floor on a level.

This is one of the best games you can get today. It kept me hooked for 50+ hours! If you like RPG's and Action and Sims then mix them all together you get Dark Cloud. The dungeons are very detailed and the enemies are actually kinda hard to beat. This just gives you more of a challenge. A lot of peolple think this game will stink because of the japanese failure, but there wrong, dead wrong. This game includes so much more than the japonese version and every new thing is gold, solid gold. The hero may look a little odd but who cares. There are 5 other really cool playable charactors that have special features on them. Buy this game if you know whats good for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wtf happened Sony","review":"This game is absolutely horrendous. You go back and forth to the same ugly looking dungeon looking for georama pieces. On top of that he gets thirsty every 30 seconds and is sword breaks which makes it weaker. Very very annoying. What is up with the building of the town? I want to play an RPG not sit there and build a town. If I wanted to manage a town I would go play Sim City or something like that. I bought this game a while ago, and played for a total of about 2-3 hours before saying \\"screw this\\" and shelving it forever.

It draws children in by combining adorable illustrations & word associations (i.e. a b shaped backpack for the letter b). Although Obvious Letters uses some pretty novel words for preschool age kids (yield, razor, handbag), the children I observed reading the book picked them up easily with repeated readings.

They use their letter to hide in a picture of something that begins with that letter. Our class book is very similar to the book, but ours is bilingual. I have some monolingual Spanish speakers in my classroom, so with their letter they draw it into a picture of a Spanish word. I had one students whose letter was \\"A\\" and he drew a picture of un avion (an airplane) and hid the A within the airplane. Another student who had the letter \\"T\\" drew una taza (a cup) and used a lower case T to hide inside the cup. What was unique about this particular picture was the she was trying to decide how to hide the T and finally decided that the top part of the \\"t\\" would be a straw.

I like the idea of incorporating a beginning sound picture into the shape of the letter, but as a kindergarten teacher, I see problems.1 - The words are printed in all capitals, which is a big no-no. All words should be printed in lowercase, except for a beginning capital for proper nouns. This would certainly get kids more ready for \\"real\\" reading.2 - Some of the associative pictures begin with long vowel sounds. All major phonemic awareness, phonics, and reading programs introduce the short vowel sounds first. Long vowel sounds are introduced after short vowels are well established.3 - The coloring pages are not really kid-friendly. The letters are too dark to color in.4 - Some of the associative pictures in obvious letters are not so OBVIOUS (\\"inside\\" for the letter i).This product could be great if these problems were worked out.

Although, it can be repetative at points, it is well worth the price. This book is ESSENTIAL for anybody who chooses to have an opinion about Iraq.

Enamored with the idea that pacifist ideals should rule the day, Clark and his followers insisted force must not be used. His ilk predicted extravagant numbers of civilian and military casualties.When the Iraqi government was dispatched with in something around three weeks, Clark changed tactics. He then decided the war, though successful and heralded as a \\"liberation\\" by most Iraqis, was \\"illegal\\". Clark acknowledged Congress' \\"greenlight\\" to the war in October of 2002, but said President Bush violated the agreement by not giving sufficient time to the United Nations process. (After a November 2002 Resolution, Bush did not go to war with Iraq until 6+ months later.)The claim of War Crimes by Clark is unsubstantiated and this book only seems to be an attempt to re-write what is widely accepted as a tremendous victory for the United States and the Iraqi people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Soundtrack","review":"This is an absolutely Fan-Freakin'-tastic soundtrack. cosmic castaway is byfar the best song on the album. though creed isnt featured on the album they are featured in the movie (i think its during the end credits) and you know Creed's song wouldnt feel right anywhere during this movie. it doesnt fit and thats why it didnt make it to the soundtrack. each of the songs featured here tie in perfectly with the scenes they were used in.

The book, in my opinion, does a great job of capturing the essence of Clarksdale in 1967, especially the societal divisions that existed, while telling a story of inter-racial romance, along with greed, murder, incest, and homosexuality.I grew up in Clarksdale in the 1940's, so I found this book totally fascinating, but I think it would be an interesting read for anyone.

Called Casio to ask about getting more links - was rudely told they are not available. Can't find a watch band locally that will fit. Bottom line I have thrown away my money on this watch. My last Casio lasted about 10 years and still fits but is pretty banged up and that's why I replaced it with another Casio. Will NOT buy another Casio and will continue to inform people that they are now too cheap to provide a watch band with adequate adjustment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good, good price","review":"It's an attractive watch with a good metal band that's not difficult to adjust.

The staples were practically useless for this application. The bamboo is too hard - the staples are not made with hard enough steel. 7 or 8 out of 10 staples would not cleanly penetrate the flooring into the subfloor - they just bent into a wadded up mess.

Through out his musical career, he always maintains bluesy singing style. Johnny refused to jump in the psychedelic rock band wagon of the late 60's. \\"I never wanted to jump on that (progressive) stuff because I didn't need to and (for me) it wasn't honest,\\" he says, \\"I would have fallen on my ass just like the rest of them who tried it and didn't do it honestly.\\"Many of Johnny River hits are the re-make of another hits.. Johnny took the original songs like Smokey Robinson's \\"Track of My Tears\\" and Four Top's \\"Baby I need Your Loving\\", and sang them with his original style. The result is that Track of My Tears and \\"Baby, I need Your loving\\" are more uptempo and more bluesy. Secret Agent Man is the most played song on Radio this day and is my most favorite song. Poor Side of Town became Johnny's number hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs much more information on tuning","review":"I'm a big fan of Des Hammill having bought 6 of his other books so I was a bit suprised to find this only deals with using standard parts, apart from briefly mentioning Holley carbs there is no mention or suggestion of using performance parts and their likely effects on output.A nice history of the engine but other than telling you to use the best of the standard parts which I would have thought was obvious anyway there is a real lack of information on upgrades. Doesn't even mention the GT40 crate engine or the ally heads which I would think lots of people will be starting with as a baseConsidering the title of the book and the picture on the cover I would imagine lots of people would buy it as I did for info on tuning and upgrades.You will be disappointed I'm afraid it doesn't talk about them at all!If anybody knows a good performance tuning manual for the 302 please let me know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie/Comic Book was Better","review":"This game was OK.

Most likely the music will mean more if you heard it Way Back When.Pluses: The eight non-LP singles are tough to find elsewhere and add up to a reasonable CD's worth of music on this otherwise short album.Minuses: Liner notes say that the master tapes were lost and the CD is mastered \\"from vinyl\\" with extra postprocessing. I didn't hear anything noticeably bad, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album","review":"This is definitely one of my favorite albums and one of the best musical discoveries I've ever made!

It is a good thriller with unlikely heroes. It is a little dated, as it concerns Middle Eastern kidnappers and terrorists in the 1970's, which turns out to be a kinder and gentler time compared to our Post-9/11 world. It is also pre-DNA, pre-cellphone, pre-Internet, and thus plotting is slower in a sense, since everything takes longer to investigate, people are harder to reach, etc. A good mystery and a thrilling read.

Although it is billed as being a Berlitz-written text, the focus is primarily on grammar and pronunciation. There are some entertaining dialogs, too.It's easy to follow...much easier than comparable (an much more expensive) text and CD combinations.However, if you are just going on vacation, I recommend Fydor's Italian Phrasebook.

Now I guess its all about making a buck and keeping your name out there so the public doesn't completely forget about you."},{"rating":"1","title":"industry favorites","review":"a more apt title would have been \\"industry favorites\\"this is the record of how a wonderful young woman became owned by the nashville recording industry and how artistry can slip from music.i love amy grant. i grew up listening to amy, christmas would not be christmas without amy, however, i miss the real her.we all know it is there, and the cover photo almost recaptures her.i hope she can come back around and leave the plastic image behind that the industry has made her into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy's Best Pop Songs","review":"These songs are pop gems in the truest sense. Most of these songs are from her secular albums(You can find her early songs on \\"The Collection\\" cd). Amy's music is possibly the most melodic and pleasant pop music out there today. Her album \\"Simple Things\\"(the title track is included in this collection) is a great album from start to finish. Highlights of this collection include \\"Next Time I Fall\\", \\"I Will Remember You\\", \\"That's What Love is For\\" and \\"Things We Do For Love\\".btw, it is really offending when a reviewer discusses an artist's personal life and their views."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Believe How Bad This Is (But She Sure Is Cute)","review":"Didn't know much about Amy but was hoping this would be a solid collection (considering it is her best). Wow if this is her best, the rest must be total garbage! All in all this is really mediocre stuff - The Water starts things off on a good note but after that - really bad! Her voice is ok but the songs are soooooooooo bad. This is just bad songwriting! Taylor Swift songs sound realy really good next to this trash. (Although Amy has a much better voice than Taylor!) \\"The Next Time I Fall\\" is a horrible song!!! \\"Baby Baby\\" is ok I guess, \\"Every Heartbeat\\" is a bad remake of \\"Baby Baby\\" and is a horrible song, \\"That's What Love Is For\\" is ok I guess...???? The rest just really stinks! Avoid at all costs!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent collection. A masterpiece","review":"Amy Grant is definitely a truly amazing, talented artist. I just picked up my copy of this Greatest Hits collection, and this truly is a GOOD Greatest Hits album.Listening to these songs reminded me of some good times! Thank you for that, Amy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent compilation of Amy Grant's songs","review":"This CD is wonderful. It includes all of the best Amy Grant songs, and then some, even the song \\"The Next Time I Fall\\", featuring Peter Cetera. Also includes two new songs, \\"The Water\\", and \\"Come be with me\\", and a bonus CD with 4 variations of her songs. Well worth the $13 I paid for it. I'd recommend this CD to all Amy Grant fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amy - come back to your fan base","review":"Listening to this album at Christmas was somewhat disappointing. Granted, the songs on this album are some of the most well known to the general public and wonderful songs, but there are songs missing on this album that are classics.In particular I missed \\"El Shaddai\\" and \\"Thy Word\\". Amy has always been a great example to young Christian girls everywhere. Yet not putting in \\"Thy Word\\" and putting in \\"Yellow Taxi\\" is not exactly an inspiration to young ladies.My nieces have already switched to Point of Grace and Girls of Grace.Amy, please come back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simon's Tunes","review":"There Goes Rhymin' Simon is another lyrically rich album from master tunesmith Paul Simon. Mr. Simon has the ability to articulate his lyrics in a story like landscape that few songwriters can. He perfectly captures a man on the brink of middle age in the breezy and brilliant \\"Kodachrome\\". \\"Something So Right\\" is a pretty declaration of love. He shows off his wry sense of humor on \\"Take Me To The Mardi Gras\\", \\"One Man's Ceiling Is Another Man's Floor\\" and \\"Learn How To Fall\\". The album further cemented his reputation as one of music's best songwriters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diamond Simon (It's the only word I could think of that rhymed with Simon)","review":"To be honest I'm not the biggest Paul Simon fan, there always been a bit of a Beatle solo feel to his work, although his last two records \\"Surprise\\" & \\"So Beautiful..\\" seem a good return to form.The reason for purchasing album was because of reading an S&G; biog, which went on to explore their solo careers, giving this record a glowing review, & I'd never heard of it. So I put it on my Birthday Wish list, & here is it.Now it has a great laid back, stripped down, summer evening feel to it, with no weak tracks, & defiantly should be as revered as \\"50 ways..\\" or \\"Graceland\\".Some nice demos as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great solo album from Paul Simon","review":"Paul Simon / There Goes Rhymin' Simon: Filled with wonderful enjoyable songs, this is a Great album. A little Pop, and little tin-pan alley, a little Gospel, this is a joy to own. The bonus tracks are ok are not necessary. Five Stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Four of His Best Songs, Nothing Less than Very Good","review":"I took some time to re-listen to \\"There Goes Rhymin' Simon\\" and it's still a very enjoyable album. \\"Kodachrome,\\" \\"Take Me to the Mardi Gras,\\" \\"Loves Me Like a Rock,\\" and (my all-time favorite) \\"American Tune\\" make this recording a keeper, and the other six songs are solid and enjoyable. The production throughout is excellent. I haven't grown tired about this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT","review":"when I first herd the song American Tune I was in shock , how could someone have read my mind and put it to music . I now carry the words to this song in my wallet as a message to have it played at my funeral , not that I am planning on that to happen. Paul simon has a gift of taking our most personal thoughts and letting us know that we are not alone in those thoughts. While I bought the cd for this song only and feel the rest pale in comparason others will find a song that means as much to them as this to me. Paul Simon is a writer whos songs will play on long after he is gone because he has the ability to capture the raw human emotion and put it to music. If you listen to his songs you will never feel alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you already have the 2004 remaster...","review":"...then you can skip this version because it's the exact same album with the same bonus tracks only now it has the Columbia imprint (the album's original label) and it's packaged in the standard jewel case as opposed to the cardboard case on the former. As for the album itself, there's nothing to say that really hasn't been said already. The hits from this album were \\"Kodachrome\\", \\"Loves Me Like A Rock\\" and \\"American Tune\\" peaking at #2, #2 and #35 respectively. Other highlights include \\"St. Judy's Comet\\" and \\"Was A Sunny Day\\". The bonus track \\"Let Me Live In Your City\\" would later become \\"Something So Right\\", another noteworthy track. This is definitely one of his best solo works and is essential for any music fan.Total Time- 50:08"},{"rating":"1","title":"a low, but still better than most pop records","review":"This is probably Paul Simon's second worst record (after the dismal \\"Songs from the Capeman\\", and not counting the first three Simon and Garfunkel records). The epithet \\"one man's ceiling is another man's floor\\" is mildly amusing--I suppose--, but repeated it quickly becomes annoying, and it certainly can't support an entire lyric: Simon should know better. Musically \\"Kodachrome\\" and \\"An American Tune\\" are pastiches, strings of cliches; lyrically they are drab. The best one can say about \\"Was a Sunny Day\\" and \\"Take Me to the Mardi Gras\\" is that they are filler. On the other hand, \\"Love Me Like a Rock\\" is clever; \\"Tenderness\\" is apposite (and opposite Billy Joel's insipid \\"Honesty\\"); \\"Something So Right\\" is pleasant.Just make sure your collection includes \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\", \\"Paul Simon\\", Still Crazy After All These Years\\", and \\"Graceland\\" first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Quality album","review":"The songs remind me of the early seventies. One of Paul's best solo album. Kodachrome, Loves me like a rock, Mardi Gras and other great tracks. This is a good 'Ryhthm' album. Better than his first solo album.Kevin"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bigger hit than the debut!","review":"Paul Simon scored more hits with this album than his 1972 solo debut. There are four Top 20 hits which are KODACHROME,a trademark for Kodak's color film,ST. JUDY COMET,LOVES ME LIKE A ROCK and SOMETHING SO RIGHT. All songs appeared on NEGOTIATIONS AND LOVE SONGS 1971-1986,released in 1988. The other songs are good. On the cover is a photo of a teenage Paul Simon,circa 1950's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff!","review":"This is the band at their peak, with songs collected not by how popular they are but how GOOD they are. This is a must have for anyone, in my opinion. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I hardly ever give 5 stars to anything unless it s absolutely AMAZING. This album comes very close, though....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage - A Poor Representaion of G.G.D's","review":"I gave this 1 star because it is really a cd with only 2 good songs. Those being the last 2. If you read my other goo reviews you'd know how I feel about the dir4ection they went starting with 'hold me up' and getting progressively worse with each new one. So it is obvious I dislike the fact that this compilation only contains 2 tracks from their first 2 records. It is as if the band and record company erased the first 2 from their collective memories and want to push this same overrated watered down sellout version of g.g.d.'s music on all of you. If you like the stuff they shoved down your throat for the better part of the '90's to now then by all means buy this. If you are like me and want quality goo goo dolls the way they used to be, before they sold out their musical vision, then buy \\"First Release\\" and \\"Jed\\". They are both truly rare masterpieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"review staples","review":"The staples rate 5 stars. Amazon shipping gets none. I ordered 5 different sizes of these staples.

The work, barely 180 small pages in all, probably has some good 140 small pages of content.

The author describes the creation of the likes of SPY, QQQ, SMH. Why is it important to know about these instruments, how they get created, who manages them, their cost effective investing over regular mutual funds. He goes in great detail by listing all EFTs available today with their tickers as well, till the point I don't need to keep going to the internet. I started trading the EFTs for profit and for hedging in particular after reading this book. The introduction about the Emini futures is useful and gave me a good start in this subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Foundational Information","review":"I won't complain about this book at all.

It also takes in excess of 3 weeks to get mail here from the States. I purchased and downloaded the e-book and was all set to print. I could only print the first 14 pages and then was notified by the Abode print driver that I could not print any more pages that day. After doing some checking I found that permissions were set by the publisher that only allowed printing 35 pages every 7 days - what a rip off!!! By the time I can finally print the last pages we'll be celebrating July 4th 2004 (well maybe not that long). But the idea that printing is being restricted after purchase is outrageous. I have written Amazon to inform them. At the very least the publisher should advise of this practice BEFORE YOUR PURCHASE.

When it came it was some kind of scientific outline, not even a book, but a disclaimer that it was unreturnable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Business?","review":"The description, book jacket and even the introduction offer no clue that this book is, in fact, nothing more than a pep talk for those who are stuck in multi-level marketing schemes and are having difficulty sucking other people in. I only ordered the book because it was mentioned in an article about job-hunting in the Chicago Tribune's Career Builder section. On thumbing through the book, I couldn't figure out what the content had to do with anything until I noticed multiple references to \\"this business\\". After drilling down a little deeper, I realized I'd been had. There's nothing in here that's really applicable to anyone who's not a \\"distributor\\" or a \\"sponsor\\" with a \\"group\\", and I'd rather be roasted over hot coals than become one. The only reason I'm not returning the book for a refund is that it'd probably cost more than half of what I paid for it just to ship it back. I gave it one star only because the color scheme of the cover is nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thus Always to Tyrants","review":"The clip I heard on NPR induced me to buy the CD. Scott Miller takes himself too seriously. His performances are generally overwrought. He would be much more entertaining if he'd lighten up a little and try to at least sound like he's having fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"An uncommonly good album.","review":"I never paid much attention to Scott Miller's previous band, The V-Roys, so I came into this effort without any preconceived notions. That said, this is an excellent debut solo album. For most of the record, Miller alternately rocks and twangs, coming up with first rate tunes such as \\"I Won't Go With You,\\" \\"I Made a Mess of This Town,\\" \\"Yes I Won't,\\" and \\"Absolution.\\" On these he at times sounds like John Cougar Mellencamp or even Tom Petty, but with better lyrical skills. Thene there are the two traditional folk tunes, \\"Dear Sarah\\" and \\"Highland County Boy,\\" that come in the middle of the album. Both are Civil War era narratives based on Miller's ancestors own experiences. They are also absolutely fabulous. They give the album a weight it would otherwise lack.There are a few cuts that don't work out as well, and that keeps it from getting the extra notch to five stars. Buts it's an impressive debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect roots rock","review":"Scott Miller describes himself as a folk musician, whose songs are sometimes loud and sometimes not. When he's loud, Scott sounds a bit like the Replacements with a southern twang; when he's not, his acoustic guitar and harmonica are reminiscent of pre-electic Dylan.The best songs on this record (Highland County Boy, Goddamn the Sun, My Daddy Raised a Boy) are among the best I've heard ever; and there are no bad songs.So why only four stars? First, a couple of the songs (Across the Line, Mess of This Town) are a bit overproduced, and would benefit from a sparer arrangement. They are excellent songs, but the music almost (though not quite) distracts the listener from the superb vocals. Second, as good as it is, this album doesn't compare to Scott's live performances. The smaller touring band directs the listener's attention to the songs themselves, where it belongs.Buy the album, think about the lyrics, and then go see the man live."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Standard Set for Real, New Country Music","review":"If you haven't heard the V-Roys, Knoxville-based Miller's former band, then you should. Then move on to Miller and discover why they were so cool. Miller is massively talented yet self-effacing on stage and in person. He is a relentlessly honest and insightful observer of the Southern world around him. Fortunately, he distills these observations through some high-guality infulences (Neil Young, Power Pop, George Jones, Steve Earle, Beatles). His live show alternates between heartfelt solo acoustic numbers and turn-it-up-to-11 jangle rock with an authentic edge and a real rock band. Then throw in a moving spiritual that is absolutely not fake. Seek out his live acoustic solo CD available at his shows: it's at least as good as this record. Spread the word about Scott Miller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfectly","review":"This pulled off the wiper arms of my 2004 BMW 325xi with ease.

But other than that, I will never buy this mess. I will say this to the group's defense, at least Lil Jon is truthful about the purpose of his \\"work\\" (he's all about partying and having fun). Whereas, 50 Cents tries to say he's a \\"gangsta\\" when really he's not. 50 is basically the same type of artist as Lil Jon without the crunkness(IMO).I have listened to this cd and it serves only one purpose.

And if you don't know, he is the annoying one yelling in the background (a time in which any real rap fan turns off the radio). This is not rap. This is club scene garbage.

First of all it's so loud and noicy then there are to much foul language. Take a look at the song titles, well even the album title sais it all. Then you hardly understand a word of what they are saying, too much slang and never any proper language, but perhaps they don't want to be understood. Cause it's cool these days to not be understood in your rap lyrics. It's all commercial too. Party music i guess. None of the songs are any serious either, they are just about the \\"normal\\" things in modern rap, when you've heard the hit single \\"get low\\" you've heard it all, the rest are just fillers. None of the eastside boys are good rappers either, if they could do it then so can anyone.

Alot of my friends tend to disagree, but also alot of my friends smoke alot weed and do other negative things that burn brain cells. Lil Jon and his goons are too corny for my taste. The eastside boys cant rap,neither can Lil jon, but atleast the eastside boys dont yell like retarded kids on the little bus all the damn time. Getting Crunk(loudly annoying) is a southern style i guess im from Ohio so maybe thats why I think they suck. But it doesn't explain why my friends like them maybe the weed does. I dont like Lil Jon or anyone he produces or hangs out with on a regular basis,But they do know who to collab with to make a hit.

Crunk is the best thing that happened to music since they invented rap. For those of you who don't know what crunk is, it's basically party music, rapping with energy. Lil' Jon is the epitome of crunk, with his loud voice and energetic personality. He can also make tight beats, like those of \\"Get Low\\" and \\"Freek-a-Leek\\" and Usher's \\"Yeah!\\". Lil' Jon has proven his great talent and his crew The Eastside Boys have just as much skill in gettin' it crunk.

I first heard this in my cousin's car, from the beginning. The intro is kind of stupid, but then I heard \\"throw it up (with pastor troy)\\" and I thought that song was hot. the rest of the album is alright, i guess. The best tracks are the one with jadakiss, the one with krayzie, the one with e-40, and the pitbull solo.In the middle of the album, it seems as they flip the whole script for the ladies. There are a run of songs with r & b type beats and women vocals.2 stars for the best tracks, but its missing 3 because it is basically a mainstream album.I would say cop this one, but I would recommend \\"put yo hood up\\" before you pick this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lil Letdown","review":"Off of the success of the 1st \\"official\\" album released, Throw Yo Hood Up, I thought this album would be off the chains. But alas, it was not. The beats on the first album are the only thing that saved the \\"lyrics\\", but the beats thumped so hard that everything else didn't matter. The beats on this album just aren't up to par. Even efforts like I don't give a F and get low don't even come close to the 1st album. My suggestion is to get the first one and check it out; then you can see how they fell off on this album. This was disappointing from the aspect of hop-hop and in terms of crunk music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kings of Crunk","review":"Out of nowhere, a group of three emerge and go platinum. \\"Kings of Crunk\\" surpirsingly provides entertaining songs. As Lil Jon lays down exceptional beats, his rather \\"exciting\\" vocals match up well with the weak, yet comical lyrics provided by the other two members of The Eastside Boyz. For an unkown reason, Lil Jon's nearly identical flow and unmistakeable voice never become a nusance through any of the 21 tracks on the album. Songs such as \\"Play No Games\\" and \\"Nothins Free\\" provide a refreshing break to loud \\"crunk\\" style that has been prefected by Lil Jon and the Eastide Boyz. Howver, from the first listen, it becomes apparent that the shine of the album is the \\"became-club-anthem \\"Get Low.\\" An interesting variation from recent rap is provided on Kings Of Crunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty hype, then gets annoying. 2 1/2 stars","review":"I like about five songs on this CD, but alot of it sounds exactly the same.

I always listened to 2pac,bone thugs, cypress hill, biggie,dmx, etc and at about the turn of the century started to notice the decline in hip hop and thought what happened?! Radio started spitting out complete garbage and Lil Jon imo became the epitome of the most wack sounding so called hip hop ever. I honestly gave up on the genre because this idiot and his horrific approach to rap which I cant even describe other than hideous. A few years went by and I still accepted that mainstream hip hop had became garbage thanks to the radio until I discovered the underground not realizing real hip hop had never left it was just harder to find. So on one hand this album is just fingernails on the chalkboard to me and on the other if it werent for lil jon i might of never discovered some seriously awesome acts such as puts, little brother etc. So thanks Lil Jon !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lil Jon is a gimmick!","review":"This is to lil jon, Crunk does not fit into any genre of music period!

This album has alot of energy through the rapping. Besides that, the lyrics are weak. Most songs have no concept or meaningful topic.The production, I like some of the production on here. Some songs like, \\"Rep Yo City\\", \\"Pitbulls Cuban Rideout\\", \\"BME Click\\". The rest of the beats are meh, decent but not great.

The other Madonna song \\"can't stop\\" is dreadful and like the rest of the material on this soundtrack represents the over-synthed dreck that represented pop music in the 80's: it sounded good at the time, but, boy, it sure doesn't hold up now.

The fact \\"Look of Love\\" didn't get a US single release is simply an injustice, I usually don't like ballads, but I love this one. \\"Who's That Girl\\" is a masterpiece, simultaneaously being both innocently fun and eerily haunting. And, in my humble opinion, \\"Causing a Commotion\\" is the single finest song ever recorded, 4:20 of pure energy.

Shoulda had a V-8! Saved only one song (Can You Feel the Love Tonight).Those who said this music is too busy are right. Sounds like he should have turned off a few buttons on the synthesizer, especially the annoying drums on some of the songs. You'd think Synchronicity 2 is an April Fool's joke. It should be on NPR's \\"Annoying Music Show.\\" I mean REALLY now.Music is so subjective... there's something for everyone out there.

I let any precepts go, although I couldn't quite picture saxaphones in most of these songs. I reserved judgement until the record was over.Well, almost. I couldn't get thru it. The pain became too intense, and there was no anesthesiologist present.Why does John Tesh have to cloud up his music with meladrama and overproduction? Is he perhaps trying to prove something? There is no clairty in his music. His arrangements are overcomplicated, superfluous, and too busy. You know that feeling...when someone with way too much perfume walks by in a public place and everyone's eyes go wide hoping they can hold their breath long enough for them to pass?If John Tesh could cut down on production, it might work out. But until then, I prefer to be spared."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you gave it to me I wouldn't listen to it","review":"Oh boy, sax on the beach, salt, sand and saxophones do not mix well. The horn will get all jammed up and so is this music. The music might do well in an elevator, but it has no place in the serious listening world, this music should not be considered even in the \\"smooth jazz\\" catagory, maybe snooze jazz is more appropriate.

The first time I put it on I was in my car going to work because that is how I rate any new c.d. I purchase. When I heard the opening track \\"What cost war\\" I was blown away. It sounded alot like a \\"Dio\\" song, I really like that song. Then I heard \\"The night you walked away\\" and said to my self this album really rocks. The third song \\"Wrong place wrong time\\" is o.k. but nothing spectacular. The fourth one \\"Playing God again\\" is a really cool song but I feel as though the music sounds kind of muddy on that one. \\"Solitary world\\" is a catchy tune which I happen to really like and then the sixth one \\"In the dead of night\\" is pretty cool. So far so good, then that's where the bottom totally fell out on the c.d. The next four songs are just brutal. I find myself shutting it off constantly after the sixth song. I still think Pilson is great but I am just disappointed in this c.d."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simon Live","review":"Live Rhymin' is a very good live record from Paul Simon. He perfectly mixes songs from his first two solo album with songs from his Simon & Garfunkel days. The songs are done in mostly the folk-rock vein, but he does sprinkle in some nice instrumentation on the sweeping \\"El Condor Pasa (If I Could)\\" and the touching \\"Duncan\\" as well as gospel singers on \\"Love Me Like A Rock\\" & \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\". The latter song is quite interesting to hear as the original is a showcase for Art Garfunkel, but Mr. Simon's interpretation is strong. Other strong songs include \\"The Boxer\\", \\"America\\", \\"Mother & Child Reunion\\" & \\"American Tune\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul Simon and Jesse Dixon Singers","review":"I have always loved Paul Simon's and friends'live rendition of some of his classics on this album.

The characters were boring--not one of them a reader could feel even a smidgen of empathy with. The plot was non existant. I can't think of a single thing positive to say about this book. It was obvious the author had taken his screen play with stage directions and copied it almost word-for-word and passed it off as a novel. The only even dimly bright spot was the ending when the author admitted it was the worst piece of s--- he had ever written. Usually when I encounter a bad book, I just cast it aside.

What other singer has mastered such diverse styles as blues, rock'n'roll, country, ballads and so on always with first class backing musicians?Recorded in the legendary Sun Stuios in Memphis, this album is Johnny performing at his very best.

Somehow most of the songs just aren't Johnny's bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"An utter disappointment. Considering the majority of this man's career has been based on covering other artists material, I'd have to think that he could have done much much better. Nearly every song on the album butchers the original, which is quite an exceptional feat considering how excellent the songs are when done by the original artists. If Mr. Rivers wished to pay tribute to them he'd have done a much better job by simply buying some shirts with their pictures. The lowest point of the album is when he attempts to redo some of his more famous songs. Poor renditions of songs that have already been done to death simply make the album drag on mercilessly. Additionally, the few uninspired Johnny Rivers written tunes don't seem to fit into the concept of the album. Quite honestly the best part of it was when it finally ended. This one will never get near my CD player again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get rhytm","review":"A classic.

The author spends a lot of good words on Khomein's mysticism. From other books about Muslims I had gotten the impression that followers of Islamic mystics tended to be mellower and generally wished to get along with the outside world. But this is a false impression with regard to the Ayatolla, if you believe the author's analyis of His mysticism. --- \\"For Khomeini the mystic, when Man reaches a sense of unity with God, his anger becomes that of God.\\" (page 296)."},{"rating":"1","title":"IN THIS DAY AND AGE","review":"It requires a great deal of courage to justify and praise the ideas and policies of a religious black reactinary in this day and age.And, yet, this is precisely what Baqer Moin, a British radio journalist of Iranian origin, has tried to do about the late Ayatollah Khomeini.Moin is clearly fascinated by Khomeini.This may be because Moin himself, as the cover of the book informs us,had trained to become a mullah but ended up in London working for the BBC radio's Persian service.The biography is written in a standard style: starting with Khomeini's birth until his death.There is absolutely no discussion or analysis of his political ideas, theories and actual policies in government.

It is, therefore, welcome that Mr Moin has written a biography that is sympathetic to the late clerical leader.Moin, however, lacks the knowledges and the analytical abilities needed to do the job properly.Those who wish to hear Khommeini's side had better refer to the work of Hamid Algar, a Briton who converted to Islam and has become one of the most passionate followers of the late ayatollah in the United States.RB"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Usual Stuff","review":"Sadly, there are very few books in English which discuss the Islamic Revolution in Iran from the Iranian point of view.

I recently purchased the Angel Band CD and I have to say it is the best of her sound that I own. There is not one song on the CD that I do not thoroughly enjoy. This sounds like the real Emmylou to me. I find it addictive and often listen to it several time in succession."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"This is one fantastic album. Harris sounds more like Sandy Denny exploring traditional English ballads than a country chanteuse. She navigates her way through \\"Angel Band\\", \\"Where Could I Go\\" and \\"Precious Memories\\" as a voice of truth, a genuine singer rather than absurd over-emoting.Secondly, the backing band are incredible. What with the shimmering purity of Vince Gill's backing vocals and the fiddle of Ricky Skaggs. It leaves me gasping with awe, and, having recently seen Bob Dylan in concert in May, I think Bob's opening songs must be touched by the hand of Emmylou. I refer to The Stanley Brothers' \\"Somebody Touched Me\\" and \\"I Am The Man, Thomas\\".It is this country-folk gospel that has, furthermore, influenced \\"O Brother Where Art Thou\\", yet Emmylou was there first, leading the way and reinvigorating us with this traditional music. Ultimately, this is for lovers of real music not the [stuff] that calls itself Country music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gospel Bluegrass at its best!","review":"What a CD, I had the tape years ago and wore it out playing it and now the CD and my newer equipment makes this old one new again.

Musically, the group, consisting of country greats Vince Gill, Jerry Douglas, and Mark O'Connor among others, is sensitive, subtle and melodically compelling. Thehighlight of the album is the uplifting \\"When They Ring Those Golden Bells,\\" which features fine instrumental work in addition to Harris's beautiful vocal performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another elmore leonard wannabe","review":"This book was atrocious.

In the Argentine forest a man is released from a rural prison after serving times for killing his two brothers. Most of the movie is his boat journey home to find his daughter. When he gets there he encounters his grandchildren. Is he guilty, innocent? Will he kill the kids? Are they the bodies at the beginning of thefilm, or are those his brothers? The lack of answers could feel like a cop out, but left me with a nightmarish feeling of open ended horror. The style is simple and spare, with long wordless takes. But we know there's something going on, even if we never fully get the answers. Sort of a cinematic, visual equivalent of the plays of Harold Pinter.

Here goes: A suppose if we had not come to Prembrokeshire, Judith, Briony and i, this story would never have been written. There would have been no Dido.......

Both brothers sign up for a championship MMA match in order to claim a 5M dollar prize. In the finale, the two compete against each other for the title.

This one has it all, tremendous action / fighting scenes, high energy and a profoundly poignant drama that will leave the viewer physically and emotionally drained. The production values, story-line and dialogue are top notch and the acting is strong and believable. Nick Nolte as the reformed alcoholic father and Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy as his emotionally tortured sons are unforgettable.

Both the lyrics and the music is lacking. It seems all the songs start out with that Greg guy's annoying voice babbling about God knows what or some stupid sounding guitar jingle at the beginning. See some bands can get away with all the songs sounding the same, which is a very RARE occasion, but the Bouncing Souls get one medicore sounding song (at it's very utmost potential) and somehow manipulate it into generic sounding noise and duplicate it 13 or so times. Maybe some of thier early releases might be better but I'm not gonna take the risk of making the mistake of purchasing something like this again.

But this one is just one big, mediocre song. The lead singer's voice can be cool if its in the right music, but on this cd is just sounds annoying. I guess the track \\"The Something Special\\" is pretty good, maybe worthy of giving this alum 2 stars instead of one, but probably not. I hope the Bouncing Souls go back to the fun punk of the self-titled and Hopeless Romantic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to be improved","review":"I went to see Green day in concert last december and Bouncing souls were their support band.And they sounded really good so i decided to get the album and i was dissapointed.Every song is miserable apart from tracks 5 and 6 which are decent rock songs.

Scans of more than one page don't work.The upside is that we used this scanner for a couple of years where it worked more or less flawlessly, over the course of easily thousands of pages.

The first is the time frame.

I will admit that I agree with some of the points he makes, as I am a Christian.However, I do not believe for one second that America ever was a Christian nation. Having read several books on the subject, including Kennedy's, I came to the conclusion that the founding fathers wanted the freedom to practice religion in the privacy of their homes and churches, and not to have the state dictate to them what they could and could not believe.

Many students find linguistics an intimidating subject to tackle, but this book makes it manageable. At the same time, Finegan does not just give students the \\"right\\" answers when discussing issues in linguistics--he presents those issues, then expects students to think for themselves, and draw their own conclusions. He is definitely not unbiased, but he also doesn't claim to have all the answers.

Thank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Put me to sleep every time.","review":"I read this book as part of a high school AP class and I do not think that it was worth my time. The content was very boring and had too much detail that nobody really cares about. The author draws senseless things on for pages and pages that shouldn't even be in the book. I have looked for other sources to help me to even understand what this book is saying, and every other European history book that I have found is many times better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Comprehensive Textbook","review":"This textbook is excellent. It provides an in-peth analysis of European History, without being too in depth. It provides information on many subjects, including culture, art, politics, and religion. The book is a worthy investment for all who are studying European History."},{"rating":"2","title":"What??.... Then wow.","review":"I am in front of a computer all day at work. I don't have an office. I work all over the place. They tell me I can't wear headphones, but I can listen to music. What to do? I figured I would buy a small set of speakers. Well I got them! These speakers are really small! They are 1 and 1/2 the width of my Shuffle. Well, I figured why not try them. I have to say I am surprised how much sound comes out of them. Audiophile, not even close. Think portable radio (do they still make those?). Not the best sounding music, but it's better than no music. You can connect your shuffle and put the whole thing into a shirt pocket with lots of room left over. I would recommend these to people who need very portable speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Work","review":"I recieved the watch not functioning either because it is defective or that it does not contain a battery.

Except the back light. It could use a better light for night viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, Greater Service","review":"This watch is very nice and stylish. The price is cheap though the wathc is great. First I ordered one for myself, then a friend of mine asked me to order one for him, and yesterday another co-worker asked me to order one for him... So you can see, that in the first month that I am wearing this watch everyone is noticing and once they know the price they want to have one right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me!","review":"I used to like Casio products until I wore this watch. I use it mainly for travel, and changing the time is just too difficult and time consuming. Only good thing about this product is it's looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"1.5 Year Battery Life...","review":"The battery life was not as advertised. The battery died after a year and a half of owning it which is half a year after the 1 year warranty coverage. Maybe Amazon had it in stock for 8.5 years already? It seems like it would be a risk to buy one of these watches at this point from Amazon and risk having to spend more money to replace the battery because it might cost just as much as it would to buy another one of these watches. Who knows how long they have their products in storage at their warehouses.I also own theCasio Men's AW80V-1BV World Time Ana-Digi Data Bank 10-Year-Battery Watchthat I bought at a Walmart back in 2008 that also has a 10 year battery life and the battery is still alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome look!","review":"Awesome look and feel. Has the right look for everyday use, and not bad for the price, also just right for someone with a small (or even larger) wrist. Not bulky looking at all, tho not slim or slinky but sharp and did I say, a great deal?! Even if the battery lasted less than 5 years, as I like to push the buttons, that wont be a bad thing. This port subject to my update as I reach that time frame. I would trade 1 expensive watch for 3 others of this thing -alternate color for different occasions.One gripe is that you can't see too well the sunken LCD display even with the ample amber lighting within the circumference of the watch. I've set analog hands to tell me the local time and left the digital display for other use or function. This is why it is only a 4 star rating. Always, a room for improvement, but perfectly satisfied, otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best watch I have ever Had..!!","review":"this is the best watch I have ever had. Its beautiful, comfortable, is not expensive and also fits very well on my wrist. I recommend it 100%... Its the best watch for the very low price!!! You won't get anything better like this watch for only 19.50$, and the best of all is very easy to learn to use it. I am very happy so you will be too when you get this excellent watch!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love this watch","review":"iot's lightweight, has lots of casio good old options and it's cheap.has some problem with digitial time settings and the strips are thin plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The wolfe review","review":"This is the second watch that I have purchased recently. The first, a Casio Pathfinder (Fisherman's Addition). I like the Pathfinder, however,It has a rather higher profile than does the World Time Database. That is the reason why I purchased (World Time Database Watch). This is the watch(World Time Database)I prefer over the Pathfinder for every day use....I do like both watches....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it is supposed to","review":"A watch is an integral part of me. A lot of times I wear it even when I sleep. This was a replacement to my Timex digital. I mainly bought this watch for its clear crisp display. Amazon shipping was prompt. I was amazed the see the features that this watch was loaded with - some of which I believe most people might not even use. (I'd rather use cell phones to store ph #'s than on a watch). The world time, stop watch, alarm and hourly chime are pretty much all that I need. This watch serves the purpose. The different modes and adjustment were something I had to look at the manual the first time. Only things that I did not like was adjusting the analog time. I was under the impression that when you set the digital time, analog time would also update. But that was not the case. But it is just a one time thing. I am very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last 2 years!","review":"The 10yr battery life and the waterproof rating made the $20 price a great deal. But, I have had this watch for under 2 years and the seal broke and water got inside.When I checked how the seal was broken I found a large crack in the plastic body of the watch. The crack runs through one of the screw holes (for the back plate) and is perpendicular to the band pin. Either a design or manufacturing flaw has the force of the band pins being too great for the plastic body to bear. The result is a crack along the weakest point (screw hole) that compromised the waterproof seal.Luckily I caught this before too much damage was done by the water that got in. Now I am left with a watch back with three screws in it, no waterproofing.The lesson; even if it's a great deal, a cheap watch is just a cheap watch. I wouldn't recommend it, I've have better life from $6 watches."},{"rating":"2","title":"great features, low price","review":"This is a great watch with many features. I love that it is both analog and digital. I prefer to tell time in analog but frequently use the digital features like alarms and countdown timer. The only downside to this watch is the light. It doesn't illuminate the digital panel, only the analog hands. If this watch had an indiglow style light so the digital functions were visible, it would get five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good watch, great buy!","review":"The face is easy to read - day, date, and time. Lots of good features - alarms, etc. The band is comfortable, too. I've been looking for some time for an inexpensive, good quality, manly watch. This seems to be all of of the above. It is tough, too. I've been gardening and got it wet several times. The night light is weak but passable. Try it out if you are looking for the same type of watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so face","review":"this was supposed to have a white face, but is is silver-faced. Reading the face is very difficult. Particularly at night even with the backlight!"},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for","review":"Cheap, cheap, cheap...not worth the money. It's a watch but it is a cheap watch. Looks cheap, feels cheap...save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch has several faults","review":"Analog and digital time have to be set independently and both run independently.No winding stem, so resetting the analog when you travel is a pain.The light is useless-- it's a white light and you cannot read the hands in the dark.The crystal scratches easily.There are positives:The watch looks good.The digital display is large enough to read without glasses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun for Bionicle fans","review":"I have no idea why this got some average/negative reviews. My 9-year-old Son LOVES this. Since it arrived 4 weeks ago it has taken precedence over all his other Wii games.

I recommend this (and the 2nd-hand resellers \\"DiscX\\") to all game players that are Bionicle fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best Mtn bike guidebook","review":"Purchased this book for a mountain bike trip to Idaho. I was excited to read about the trail titled South Hills Singletrack Nirvana. While the author kept meticulous detail of the number of creek crossings, he failed to mention that the trail is mostly loose gravel climbing which was impossible to ride. It was not my idea of Nirvana. It was a big disappointment, especially since I drove over two hours to get there. There are better Idaho mtn bike guidebooks out there. A book titled \\"Good Dirt\\" is a great guide for riding in the Ketchum/Sun Vally area."},{"rating":"1","title":"background, background, background","review":"i bought this cd hoping that it would contain some actual interviews, but its probably only about 2% interview, 90% background info (from the sp career up until just before the cd was released in 2000), and then the last 8% is this weird corny techno/british elevator music going at the end of each track. this cd would be good if you were doing a report on the sp for school or something, not for somone looking for really good, original info and interviews by the pumkins. the best thing is the mini poster inside of billy and james that says \\"MAXIMUM PUMPKINS\\", but thats about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hear Them Live!","review":"If you're familiar with the NLCR only through their studio recordings, you're in for a real treat with this compilation. If you've never given the Ramblers a chance, this is as good a place as any to start. This compliation is a recap of their long career (I'd dare say that the Ramblers may be one of the longest running musical acts around), and a very good one at that. What struck me about this album is how they've changed over the decades and still have managed to keep their old-time music fresh, faithful to tradition, yet open to innovation. A nice addition to anyone's old-timey music collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless! Protects screen by BLOCKING stylus!","review":"I bought this at a local store very excited to protect my new DS Lite. After getting the bottom protector on, my stylus no longer worked! Now that I've read the other reviews I know it wasn't my husband's application or that my set was labeled wrong, it is just how the product is. I'm guessing it protects the screen from scratches by not letting you use the stylus!! I'm going to return this worthless thing and get something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Pelican Product Ever","review":"I purchased this product for my son's ds that I gave him for Christmas. Put this on the ds even though no instructions were included. Looked fine at first but then my son asked what there was something that looked like a rainbow sheen on the dark screens. I looking at other comments on amazon and found out that alot of people have had problems with this product. Just noticed that one person read one of the comments and said \\"Thanks for saving me the $10 bucks\\" wish I had checked here first and could have saved the $10 too. I called and the e-mail Pelican Support and all that they were willing to do is replace the product with another. So the I would have to spend postage and end up with another faulty product. With all the postings I am not the only one having problems with this product. Save yourself the money and the hassel of trying to remove all the adhesive that is left on your screen when you remove the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read these reviews too late...","review":"... after having already bought a set of Pelican screen protectors for my son's DS Lite at a local store. Just like the reviews said, the upper screen protector adhesive is way too sticky and leaves a white residue after removing it, and the white border is distracting on a black DS Lite. Worse, the bottom protector kept the stylus from working! Protector on, stylus won't register. Remove protector, stylus works. Really really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work On DS","review":"There are so many third-party companies that have tried to offer products for the Nintendo DS that have been either a miss, or a dud as a accessory. That has been the case with Pelican products, most of their accessories don't work. The DS Lite Write & Protect Pack is a pair of stylus for the DS Lite that unfortunately wear out within a matter of time, and don't handle like the ones Nintendo makes. On top of that, if you have the original Nintendo DS, not DS Lite, they don't work either. I suggest you only get the Nintendo brand of stylus', because they are worth it in price and quality, not any other third-party brand.Price: C-Control: D-Overall: D 1/2-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I too found the protectors difficult to apply correctly...then when I got them on the stylus wouldnt work on the game...also the stylus' that came with this pack did not fit in my nintendo ds' holder - whats the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handbook to Hell","review":"I urge caution in reading this book. While it offers a glimpse into the eating disordered mind, the book reads like a handbook to anorexia. I know I used it as one, and abused it as a source of inspiration to lose weight in order continue down a dangerous pathway. I definitely wouldn't recommend it as reading material for anyone (particularly pre/teenage girls). I wouldn't even recommend it to parents/loved ones of those struggling with eating disorders because the book's tone leave's little room for the hope that is necessary in order to recover from an eating disorder."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this was a book about Kessa, NOT her therapist...","review":"I decided to give this book 2 stars instead of 1 because although the book is extremely stereotypical, it was readable and I didn't toss it aside like I would have if it was *really* awful. This book is definately not one that I'd read a second time though.The first half of the book is written more from Kessa's point of view...so the first half is ok. But then when she enters treatment, it seems to shift focus off of Kessa and the spotlight shines on her BRILLIANT, UNDERSTANDING, and WONDERFUL therapist. It gets very annoying after awhile. If I wanted to read a book about a therapist treating an anorectic I would find one... but I thought this book would be from the anorectics point of view. Anyway, needless to say, this book was somewhat of a disapointment... It's not really worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgust","review":"Dear Reader,If you are looking for a reason to justify the eating disorder culture, might I suggest you read \\"The Best Little Girl in the World.\\" Not only does this book idolize anorexia but it is a shallow, vain look in futility at the depths and severity of anorexia nervosa. Still caught in the hell that is this disorder, I found this book insulting and quite revolting as a matter of fact. Amidst a world of thiness, appearance, and weight, verging on the brink of death I found this book justified my actions, even reinforcing my disorder. So if in fact you are elated with the concept of entering an eating disorder facility, with absolutely no freedom whatsoever, \\"the Best Little Girl in the World\\" is a choice novel to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over simplified...","review":"I absolutly detested this book. I felt as though the author was talking down to me the entire time I was reading it. I am 24 years old and have been ana/mia on and off since I was eight (in ballet and striving to be the best little girl in the world myself).I feel that the author took too much liberty with the subject, and that treating ana/mia patients and being involved in their lives can only give an outsider so much insight, he was never (and will never be) a female struggling with an eating disorder and didn't convince me that he understood one iota of the disease's complexity.More than the story, it was the writing that irritated me. Having a doctorate does not an effective author make."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Best Little Trigger Book in the World","review":"This is the best little trigger book in the world. This book should not be read until you are very secure in your self image. If you are the average person that would pick up and read this book, then this most likely will trigger an eating disorder in you.Its full of catchy rhymes, 'tricks', and making eating disorders glamarous. Yes, it was written in the 70's? (not sure) But even then, it seems a glamorous image...shes comparing herself to magazine pictures..which are bad also, because many of the models are entirely too thin.Don't let your kids read this. Its not worth the trauma it could cause, and I am not speaking with sarcasm here. This book is not good for anyones mental health."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this if you want more lies....","review":"Levenkron wrote \\"The Best Little Girl in the World\\" in the 1970's. Sence that time there have been many more discoveries. It is now known that anorexia is not related to control or attention. In this novel that is all that is discussed. The poor girl's sick behavior is focused on, the disease is all that is discussed. What about recovery? I am 19 and been in 3 treatment centers for eatting disorders. If you want to focus on crazy behavior and pre historic theory's about eatting disorders, go ahead and read this. If not read something else, anything else. I can gaurantee it will be better from the sole then this book of lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My first disappointment upon receiving this book is to learn that it is fictional. Clearly, that was my fault for not reading more carefullly before I ordered, but I still wanted to mention that, lest anyone make the same mistake I did.But far more disappointing than that was the actual book. I have never read anything so forced, contrived, and cliche. The writing is absolutely dreadful, the characters are stock-characters and utterly predictable. The alcoholic, gruff father. The peace-keeping, clueless mother. A rebellious daughter. Blah blah blah. I forced myself to read half of this book before I gave up.I don't agree with the reviewers who say this book is going to \\"teach\\" someone to be anorexic. Odds are, anyone who's reading this book for tips probably knows what thy're doing anyway.This book, however, is absolutely dreadful in terms of writing, character development, and plot. Please, please, please, save your money. This book is so not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic","review":"As a recovering anorexic I've read several books and auobiographies on the subject. When comparing them to this book I feel this author has \\"sugar-coated\\", if you will, the disease and the recovery. The ordeal is made to look like after a quick trip to the hospital and a few therapists and the main charactor is cured. I'm not saying don't read it, but please keep in mind that treatment of the disease is hardly as swift or easy as this book makes it appear to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad, but very interesting","review":"I read this book in one night. I really liked it. I still cannot imagine doing to myself what Kessa did to herself. It's not an act to get attention, it's a real disease. Anyone who has it really needs help. I think that Kessa had a lot of courage. There was no way I could have stayed awake during the chest tube procedure. It was so graphic that I almost fainted. This author is very talented. He really gives an insight into the minds of these young girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This book got me started. I picked it up in the library and it triggered me even when I had no eating disorder. it helped me develop one. It became my trigger bible and taught me how to be sneaky. I also had a hard time believing in it's non-fiction because of the ending. She just snaps out of it? Like that? Sorry, if this book could get negatives, I'd stick it there. There is no telling how many girls-or boys- this book has damaged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply not intresting","review":"The book was quite dull and lacked any real depth. Kessa's decent into her nightmare of an eating disorder reads off as a stereotypical checklist of what an anorexic girl should be like. The character did not breathe and come to life from the pages. It was though the author searched for the word anorexic and threw every symptom into Kessa."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Best Little Girl in the World","review":"I wouldn't bother with this book. First of all, the author doesn't even make an appearance throughout the story, so how accurate can the story be? Also, it seemed to me that Francesca's anorexia just suddenly jumped out of nowhere. The blame seems to be resting on the shoulders of one woman's comment, and it just doesn't work that way. It was pretty poorly written, and if you want to read about true anorexia experiences, it's safer to get the story from the one who HAD anorexia, or was there the whole time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finished","review":"I bought the book yesterday and just finished it now. I thought it was an excellent book and having an eating disorder of my own that I am dealing with, it was interesting to read about a girl and what triggered her problems and caused her to do this to herself. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the ending. I just feel as if it shouldn't just have been so abrupt and sudden."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only reason this even gets one star is because I managed to read it all the way through....","review":"I just finished The Best Litle Girl in the World..... I hated the stereotyping. For example I got the feeling he was trying to say that only middle to upper class white girls are anorexic. Also the whole hospital stay I did not like that there was even more sterotyping with her roommate being black and some of the comments she makes. I don't understand why the author seems so narrow-minded to me when he is supposed to be an \\"expert\\". His books The Best Little Girl and The Luckiest Little Girl are both written in a way that I don't really connect with even though I read both books in less than 7 or 8 hours total. I don't think that this promotes eating disorders in any way and I don't understand why people say it does and I guess that is the only good thing about the book. Well anyway.... there have got to be better books out there...."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that big a deal","review":"This book was alright. Not that big a deal. I was expecting a little more. A bit disappointing but informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't even deserve 1 star","review":"When I was teenage anorexic, this book helped me to stay that way. It confirmed all my fears and gave me some new ones. It also gave me tips as to make myself more ill - which I accept was part of my illness, but nonetheless, people should be wary of reading this if they want to be healthy.That was over a decade ago now. Now when I read this book all is see is a grandiose psychologist attempting to \\"prove\\" his insight and skill, that are in my opinion, questionable... or absent. Sorry if he means well, but Levenkron just does not get inside the mind of someone with Anorexia - he does not get the fear, the loathing, the control, the lack of options, the desires to get well and stay ill. No, Levenkron does not get it.This is not a helpful book if you are ill or if you want to understand Anorexia Nervosa. Choose something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"be very careful","review":"I didn't know what anorexia/bulimia was in 1980 when I read this book (you just didn't hear about it back then). I was in middle school at the time, a bit overweight, and interested in reading books about girls my own age. 25-yearslater, I'm bulimic. I don't want to totally blame this book for my bulimia, but I believe the book was a trigger, teaching me everything I needed to know about how to be a bulimic and get away with it. I remember admiring Kessa. I'm sad this book is still around and being read by young women. Books should inspire, teach, or touch us, not harm us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Starting Point","review":"As a young ED sufferer, I was in love with this book. Prior to Marya Hornbacher's \\"Wasted\\" I feel this was probably the best piece of literature out there for someone looking to understand the mindset of the eating disordered individual. Now that I have matured along with my disease, I find the author's simplified view of recovery to be at least mildly unrealistic (granted there are sufferers caught early enough that recovery isn't as difficult as it has proven to be for me). This is a great book for a young reader, ages 12-15. Now that I'm in my early 20s it doesn't hold the same magic that it once did for me, but I certainly recommend it as a great starting point if you're delving into the world of eating disorder literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD BOOK, BUT GOOD FOR THE WRONG REASONS","review":"I have read this book and yes, it is a great book, but one must use caution when reading it. When I read this book I was in the worst part of my struggle with anorexia, and while reading this book I became wrapped up in some sick competition with Kessa. I continued to use many of the tips i read in the book, along with my own tricks, until I ended up in the hospital. I strongly reccomend that NO ONE currently in treatment or suffering from an eating disorder read this book. Wait until you have reached a strong level of recovery before you read the book. In my opinion, this book is a VERY TRIGGERING book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solidly Good","review":"It's a good book. I read all of it. I never lost interest. An easy read for sure, if you enjoy reading about these sorts of things which I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotypical, Self-Congratulatory TRIPE","review":"Steven Levenkron's book \\"The Best Little Girl in the World\\" is ridiculous and stereotypical. All it does is present the perfect little white ballerina from a well-off family and belittle the class she 'represents'. Levenkron assumes the role of Kessa's terrific therapist but i think he needs therapy himself!This book is nothing but fuel for a dangerous obsession. As so many other reviewers have said, it GLORIFIES anorexia. The chants of \\"Kessa, Kessa, Kessa\\" give the reader a chance to develop an eating disorder themselves.The sequel to this book, \\"Kessa\\" is just as bad as this book. Unless you are VERY secure about your self-image, do NOT under any circumstances read this book! In fact, even if you are secure, don't read it. It's nothing but self-congratulatory TRIPE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick to death of all this propaganda","review":"You see, this, like every other book I've ever read on anorexia, started out with a girl who was clinically anorexic to begin with given her heighth and portrayed her as fat.....to others as well as herself. Makes me feel awful every time I read it but I do it as well because it's MY Bible too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insight","review":"This novel provides a wonderful insight into both sides of the eating disorder treatment process. Unlike many other books in this genre, the reader is not only able to understand what Kessa, the main character, is going through, but also what her doctor is dealing with. An excellent book for those interested in eating disorders from a more medical point of view but who still want to retain the more interesting and readable nature of a fictional story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Little Girl in the World, by Steven Levenkron","review":"This was a wonderful book, quite possibly one of my favorites. It is about Francesca (Kessa) Dietrich, who, because of the influence of her ballet instructor and pencil-thin models, goes on a diet even though she is already very thin (5'4\\" and 98 pounds). Her disorder, anorexia nervosa, her hospital stay, and everything else, is well documented. It made me think twice about dieting like that again."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent portrayal of the descent into Anorexia","review":"Levenkron's The Best Little Girl in the World takes an outstanding viewpoint in the life of Kessa, a perfectioistic high school student who develops Anorexia Nervosa. Kessa is diagnosed with Anorexia before most people knew what Anorexia meant. She is very good at hiding the physical and psychological effects of the disorder from her family and friends. As an anorexic, I felt this book was one of the few pieces of writing that appropriately describes the emotional turmoil an anorexic feels, and her family feels. Most authors do not portray anorexia as the kind of disease it is. Levenkron, however, gets into the mind of Kessa and lets the readers know everything about her, not just about her anorexia. Levenkron makes it very clear that anorexics fall into a trap, one in which they feel anorexia is their identity, without it, they are nobody. Kessa falls into this trap and has a very hard time climbing back up, to be a noraml kid"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotyped Crap","review":"This book was a real disappointment. It perpetuates the simplistic stereotype of anorexics as affluent, high-achieving white girls who lean towards perfectionism to deal with controlling parents and other family stress. (The protagonist in this book even does ballet.) The prototype Levenkron generates is overtypified and uninteresting. To make matters worse, the book is poorly written. Although it benefits from an inherently interesting topic, I can only hope that Levenkron is a better psychiatrist than novelist. The book may be shocking to those unfamiliar with anorexia, but for those who are, it's pretty mundane."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for Levenkron's ego alone","review":"I'm sorry, but I have read a ton of material concerning eating disorders and have had enough close personal experience with them to see that this book is terrible. It is no more than a chronicle of how brilliant Levenkron thinks he is in understanding the mind of an anorexic. I'm glad for his prose that so blantantly displays that he's impressed with his ability to cure the disorder rather than concerned with the actual ramifications of the disorder itself - bravo. A must-not-read, indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best","review":"An eye opening look into the pysce of people suffering from anorexia nervosa. 15 year old Francesca appears to lead a fairly normal life. She is a pretty, all A student, who also happens to be a wonderfull dancer. One day at class her teacher and role model points out that she could stand to lose a few pounds, and \\" Kessa\\" is born. Kessa is stronger than Francesca ever was, Kessa doesn't need to eat, doesn't need to fill her body with such impurities as food. Kessa is thin thin thin, but never thin enough. Although heart wrenching, The Best Litttle Girl in the World shows a realistic look at the journey back to normality, and self acceptance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good points, but too much language","review":"I'd love to share the book with my 12 year old who is suffering with anerexia, but the language was inappropriate.

My teacher spent valuable budget money on a class set of this junk and I'm severely appalled.First thing first, this book is hardly appropriate for a guy to read and is not school suitable, either. It also contains a good deal of profain language.It appears to have the capability of reverse physcology and is definately dangerous. If you're shallow enough to just take it with a grain of salt and only read enough to write the report....it's great, but if you read into it......it's just strange. It almost encourages anorexia nervosa. Definately plenty of stereotyping as well.Good punctuation, though....kudos to the editor.Verdict: Not Suitable for Teenage Girls, Guys of any Age, High School Students, and of-their-rocker English teachers.Anabelle W., Age 15"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fat and Skinny Had a race","review":"Francessa is a bright and talented young girl .

That is space in my brain that is going to be occupied by the information in that, that, book (if you want to grace it with that title) that I can never get back.If this is where literature is going, then count me out. Don't get me wrong, reading is my main hobby, but this was painful to read. It was written at a level for people who have trouble with the back of the cereal box.On the upside, I can imagine no more successful torture methods for political prisoners than providing them with that *thing* as their only source of entertainment.

Over the years I know that much blame has been put on this book and even on the author, however, I think that it is the \\"informative\\" nature that makes it so dangerous. I remember reading it for the first time (at age 11) and while I don't remember a clear \\"wow, anorexia is cool\\" thought going through my mind - it definitely opened a door. Being a (naturally thin) gymnast and model, I think the book gave me ideas I wouldn't have had yet. Do I blame the book? Not entirely. Would I let my daughter read it? Definitely not.

This album rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alcohol & sedatives starting to rot the brain?","review":"I have just about everything Joe Walsh has ever released.Did Joe Walsh really release this? The same guy who released \\"Barnstorm\\" or \\"But Seriously Folks\\"? Yikes.It sounds as if Joe was scraping the bottom of the barrel or just didn't have a handle on things. It feels like they are just going through the motions as they roll up those dollar bills and slam some JD.Highlights? Hmmmm I guess I enjoy \\"In my car\\",& \\"Memory Lane\\".Now if I ever play the CD, I skip around quite a bit between songs.Bottom line: \\"Got Any Gum\\" is one of the least played CD's in my Joe Walsh collection.Additional two cents... \\"Got Any Gum\\" and \\"Song's for a dying planet\\" are the worst in Joe Walsh's cannon of music. Not very much depth and inspiration with a few exceptions/gems in each.If you can get it cheap, and need to complete your Joe Walsh collection, go for it. There are much worse forms of music/releases!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WORDS CAN'T DESCRIBE IT..","review":"This album deserves five stars because Blackmore really proved his mastership of the guitar.

All the fifteeen tracks shine with beautiness and perfectin, without boring you to death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best from this group!","review":"The first and still the best album in my opinion! This group, with a female lead vocalist, is many things: traditional, folk, renaissance, pop! An original and talented group with so much to offer, but still so unknown and unappreciated. If you like traditional tunes and folksy songs with a more modern flare then check out Blackmore's Night!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for Renaissance music fans","review":"I loved the way Ritchie merges new style music with old styled renaissance music. Between Blackmore's guitars and Candice Night's beautiful voice this one is a must buy. The only fault with this album is track #8 writing on the wall. It just does not seem to fit with the other renaissance style music. It is more of a Techno dance number. With that said , If you have ever gone to a Renaissance Faire and loved listening to the minstrel's playing their tunes I would recommend this one to you. It is not exactly Rainbow or Deep Purple but it is a great alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely unbelievable!!!","review":"as a founding member of Deep Purple, Ritchie Blackmoore set new standards for the hard rock genre. With this new album he shows an entirely new dimension and facet of creativity which will, in my opinion be hard to surpass or for others to equal.

It will be a long time before i grow tired of it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly \\"Renaissance\\" enough!","review":"I did have high hopes for this disc, but alas, the notices I'd read of it supposedly being some kind of purist/full-on Medievalist work are far from the truth. Most of the disc sounds like typical MOR balladry with slight Olde Musick touches, and is not dissimilar to what any MOR band might do whilst in a ballad mood. Perhaps years of cranking out mediocre FM rock with Rainbow and the reformed Deep Purple has dulled Mr. Blackmore's sensibilities as to what constitutes moving early music - I have no doubt that if he had attempted something like this immediatley after leaving Deep Purple the first time 25 years ago, the end result would have been much better. As it is, for renaissance-tinged popular music, old Jethro Tull, Ms. McKinnett, or especially the unjustly ignored Gryphon, will stand you in much better stead."},{"rating":"1","title":"So SAD","review":"Ritchie Blackmore's fans should keep singing \\"Still We're Sad\\" because this is a shame... This music is just so mediocre, where is Blackmore's outstanding talent? Night's voice, that others swear is so angelical, is just soooooo cheesy and plain, nothing great there at all, comeon let's be honest. Well, if you really enjoy folk music I would very much recommend searching elsewhere, and if you really enjoy Blackmore's music I very much recommend sticking to his wonderful old stuff. I have no words to describe how I felt when I listened to this CD, just, not because I loved it but because I wanted to cry, being a fan of Mr. Blackmore's true talent. A shame. But truth is, this has been the golden egg for Ms. Night, who would have never made it on her own, and certainly we wouldn't be missing out anything... Gee, the corniest thing ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"I was only 13 or so when my dad popped in the cassette (oh, the ages of cassette) into the player in our car; when the first song plays (\\"Shadow of the Moon\\") I was immediately hooked. This obviously wasn't the typical thing that a 13-years-old would love to listen to, but there I was, enjoying every single track, even the instrumentals. The long journey seems remarkably long without playing this cassette once. The music is soulful, the lyrics even more so, the guitar is awesome and Candice's vocals are marvellous! Even after listening to this album countless times on countless journeys I was still consistently happy with it. Definitely a masterpiece! Too bad my brother had to play with the cassette and ruin it. I will detest him forever for that. *smirks* But yes, it does make a nice listen while driving, doesn't it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I have been into english folk and celtic and such for some time.

You have to buy the complete CD to get the radio edit, which doesn't really seem fair play. The extended mix version (cut one) is fine, but it doesn't really compare to the power and energy of the original radio edit, which is usually included on maxi singles of this type. And so, I'd have to call this disappointing. The other mixes aren't particulartly inventive, and as for the acoustic version; well, you can see why DJ Encore's input was necessary.

Honestly, it makes me think of John Mayall's Blues Breakers featuring Eric Clapton. It's got a similar sort of hungry young blues band sound. Costello sings well without imitating an old black guy (can't stand it when they do that), plays with a rare balance of flash and taste, and presents good tunes, several of which are originals. Blues is a varied and rich tradition that's about much more than three-chord progressions for guitar solos; Costello seems to understand this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Holiday Soundtrack","review":"Having grown up listening to the The Forester Sisters, I must say that their album, \\"Christmas Card,\\" warms my heart in a cold season. Is it the ladies' voices? Is it the their chemistry? Or is it the intangible, the feeling? At the height of their popularity, The Forester Sisters were a regularity in my household, and in the car. When, \\"Christmas Card,\\" was released it gave these lovely ladies a whole new perspective to me. When the season rolls around, and the reminiscing begins, as I said, they warm my heart.

One thing I thought that this book needed was an index, with an index, research would be a lot fater, not only that, but you wouldn't need to look all over the book for who was the guitarist for Roxy Music which later became Stryper, you could just look up Roxy Music and have one ot two page numbers.

The story centers on one memorable night when two former friends, one a UVF member and the other a humble catholic fatehr raising two children. The meaning of the title is most likely a comment on the war that has been going on for years, that the war is no longer about personal hated toward a specific person for anaction they had done, but for just what they represent. The movie isn't that centered but the ending does give off the message very clearly: Violence is wrong. Duh!

It was a \\"big bad Russians\\" and \\"poor brave Americans\\" kind of tale, and I did not find it interesting at all. I would not recommend it to people interested in the Cold War."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Needed","review":"There is really no reason for a photographer to buy this, a bounce card (which is built into the 580EX) serves the same purpose when one isn't using direct strobe and one should rarely if ever use direct strobe in shooting. You're wasting your money, especially $11 for something that is really just translucent plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whatever","review":"Well, it does the job. Is not as good as a white ceiling, but better than pointing straight to the people or using the silly mini white card that the canon 580ex II has.It fits so tight in the flash that every time I pulled out I'm afraid of braking the turning head mechanism. Be careful with that.Could be cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate flash","review":"This little plastic thing does make flash more acceptable, I'll have to admit.

Minimal instructions came with the product but photos taken with the Sto-Fen were much warmer and appealing. I really like the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"The Omni Bounce is very simple to install and use (follow the directions - use a 45 degree angle, not straight up or straight on) and does a good job of diffusing the light from the flash. My experience has been that results are dependant on the height and composition of the ceiling. There are many different diffusers to choose from, I can recommend this one, but right now I use my Demb Flash Diffuser Pro when I really want the best shot. Both will help when photographing children, who like all of us don't like a flash shot right in their eyes, but are more likely to run the other direction when they see it coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"for its usefulness, a must have","review":"compared to the price and the usefulness of the item, this unit is a must have for any photographer who uses flash.can't say more, it's so simple to use and yet provides you control on how you use your flash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bounce flash affordiable option","review":"The product was exactly as described and it works extremely well. Provides more flexability with my Canon flash and for a very reasonable cost. The retailer was a bit slow in shipping, however it arrived on time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic must have...","review":"This is a classic addition to any dedicated flash setup. There are many situations that I personally use it both on and off camera. It is a nice low cost solution to soften hard light when using a 45 degree bounce technique off lower ceiling structures. Just be aware of your ceiling color as that will affect your outcome. This product is easy to slip in even the smallest of camera bags and makes an excellent on-the-go diffuser. You can also use it for holding color correction gels when shooting in different lighting environments. There are several variations of this type of product on the market but this one is compact and something you'll use for years to come. Enjoy your creative side and never stop reaching for the ultimate picture in your life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does not work on 580EX II","review":"Having fond memories of the Omni-Bounce from years ago when I shot with a 20D and 580EX, I purchased one again this month for my new 580EX II.

Perhaps it is my copy, but it is unusable on this flash body."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I never thought I'd be excited about a piece of plastic, but this little device makes the results from the Speedlite flash 10 times better. It totally eliminates the glare and the harsh shadows associated with the the pre-diffuser era. I've been delaying buying one for a while and now my only question is 'why didn't it come with the flash in the first place?'.If you have a Speedlite, you must get one of these things! (A cheaper alternative is to tie toilet paper around the flash and secure it with an elastic band, FYI)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential item for flash","review":"I have now owned one for each of the various Canon flashes I have owned. It's the first item I get when I buy a new flash and I think it should be in every photographers kit. It's small and does a great job dispersing the light for a softer feel. Used in combination with an off camera cord this is a great solution for portraits and weddings. About the only down side in the older ones was that the plastic would age and warm up rather than being neutral in color."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good compact diffuser","review":"It is small and it does the job.

This is a must have for any serious photographer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple yet effective","review":"This seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer. Basically it's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash. It is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage. When used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed.The white box is for general use. Also available are the green Omni-bounce for florescent lighting and the gold Omni-bounce for a warming effect.PROS:Inexpensive solution for better flash photography.A quality product that works.CONS:None"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive diffuser - a little hard to slip on - works well","review":"I use \\"fill flash\\" all the time when shooting portraits outdoors. That little extra light brightens the shadow under the nose and shadows under the eyes. I dial back the power to -2/3 stop with the Sto-Fen in place and it makes a nice softly lit portrait. When you consider the cost of other products (go check the very cool Gary Fong products), this is a inexpensive yet effective way to add light without harsh glare.The reason for 4 stars is that the fit is quite snug - probably a good thing - but it does make getting it on and off a bit of a chore. Probably will loosen up a bit over time but for now, 4 stars for an under $15 product isn't bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"This little piece of plastic really does a great job of diffusing light, also it's so small it fits in any camera bag.Just remember, never point the flash straight at your subject with this diffuser, it will shoot the light up and down and you will get a dark picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"omni bounce diffuser","review":"great product; easily attaches to my flash; diffuser works great; keeps light from getting too harsh"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are two basic ways to really soften and smooth your flash, and this is not one of them!","review":"The first is to bounce off your flash of the ceiling -- that works wonders with white ceilings that are not super high. Try it; it works wonders! Umbrellas and other photo reflectors work well for this, too, when you forget to bring your ceiling along with you.The second is to use a softbox, the bigger the better. Nothing this small can really soften light -- \\"soft\\" light means it comes from a large source, not a small source hidden behind plastic.The Omni-ounce and Gary Fong's Lightsphere, etc, provide an almost indetectably small amount of softening to my eyes, and do not seem to enhance bounced light either.

Granted, it does its job, it spreads light everywhere. However, it's too good at it. It puts light where you don't want it, thus reducing the amount of light output of your flash. I tried it once to test it out, and never used it since. It's now a convenient tray for batteries or other small things. This is NOT a replacement for a soft-box or shoot-through umbrella.1 star for the idea.1 star for being an omnidirectional light-spreader.0 stars for light-control.0 stars for usefulness.0 stars for guide-number reduction while in use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced Plastic","review":"I thought I needed a diffuser for my flash and, while this one does the trick, it is just an overpriced piece of plastic.

Since she's been born I have purchased more copies for family members. This book is an excellent resource for parents and loved ones. It teaches about the condition and related concerns in an easy to understand manner. This is by far the best book I have found on Spina Bifida. I would HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who is expecting/has a child with Spina Bifida. I would also recommend it for family members and caregivers of children with Spina Bifida."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elle Fanning shines in an odd story","review":"This is an odd tale of a young girl who turns out to have several OCDs that cause her problems at home and especially at school. Elle Fanning does a fantastic job as Phoebe, who doesn't know why she does these things and wants to stop. Her sister is adorably outspoken, and the kids in the movie are more fun to watch than any of the adults.Campbell Scott is oddly cast as the principal, while Patricia Clarkson gives her usual strong performance as a drama teacher who is eccentric yet caring. Felicity Huffman and Bill Paxton play some rather strange parents who seem to live a life of the mind as writers but also have a nice house and apparently a nice chunk of income too.There are also some interesting visual effects that occur when Phoebe imagines herself interacting with the characters from Wonderland.Worth watching for young Fanning's talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Movie","review":"Thourowly thought out and perfectly executed. It is like magic, sprinkel fairy dust and you are a dancer, clap your hands and the \\"fairies\\" appear. I think it portrays in a paletable way what it might be like to be suffering from this condition, and how awful people can be who don't understand or can't be bothered to learn how to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phoebe in Wonderland","review":"I recently rented this movie, mostly due to my interest in the famous Lewis Carol's book. The movie is about a young girl struggling with a psychological disorder while she becomes involved with a school play. I found the acting to be mediocre at best and the script to be unrealistic. Many of the children don't behave as you expect children to behave. The mother and father are overly-emotional (especially the mother) and don't even get me started about the drama teacher, yikes. The principal and the psychiatrist provide some unintentional comedic relief, but not much. For those interested in Lewis Carol's book, there's not much for you here. For others, I do not recommend this one unless you like sappy movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"So aware of acting","review":"This was an ok film - but I was SO aware of the 'acting' going on that it wasn't believable for me. I thought Bill Pullman, although he didn't have many scenes, the most believable. Elle Fanning . . . in my mind I kept seeing the director say, \\"now ACTION\\".She got on my nerves with her 'so perfect' diction and wide-eyed wonder at everything. And Felicity Huffman, I guess if she changes her hair color it makes her a better actor - but not here. Patricia Clarkson's character was just plain silly. I felt like I so wasted my time watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another boring martyred mother movie!","review":"Another politically modern mother movie to appease the feminists. You know the drill, The child is the most important thing in her life, nothing else comes close. Everything must be sacrificed for the mother's cinderella-princess fantasy she has for her daughter. The male, the husband, is portrayed as the usual irelevent, impotent, character who manages a smile and a grimace every now and then.(I don't know why men take these roles).Finally it comes out in the movie that the mother can't stand the daughter who has a similar dislike and distrust for the mother. A typical non-functional family made worse by the mother's interference with the daughter's therapy sessions. The daughter is the real victim in this situation who is suffering from a genetic illness.If you're in the mood for this type of soap-opera, go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Oracle almost a Tarot deck without the Majors","review":"This oracle really spans the idea of oracle-geomantria beautifully. Geomatria is the ancient Greek elemental classifications/correspondences of the 4 directions (EAST, North, West, South) as well as the elements (Fire, WInd, Water, Earth & Spirit) and then marries it to Celtic mythology. The key is by using animal totemsboth real, frog, snake, bear, as well the Manley Hall Spirits like Gnomes, Sylphs, Undines and Salamander.All of this would be overwhelming except that the book, an extension of Leslie's previous book, The Magical Personality, explains how this system (which is really tarot dignities) comes into while using these cards. It is beautifully done and for those who don't like that \\"wicked pack\\" of cards a superb alternative for dealing with elementals and the unconscious. Highly recommended.PS I have uploaded a bunch of shots so you can see detail paintings that make up this fine work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime Stokie!","review":"When it comes to creating orchestral magic, there really was no else like Leopold Stokowski. With an orchestral master like Debussy, this is a match made in heaven. These old Capitol recordings from the late 1950s are a pure delight. Julius Baker's flute on \\"Prelude\\" is in a class by itself, and although I prefer Boulez's recent DG recording of \\"Nocturnes\\", Stokowski's performance is wonderful just the same with otherworldly BBC Women's Chorus singing in the third movement. The recording, naturally for Stokowski, is in excellent 1950s stereo and not a hiss is to be found. Stokowski's transcription of \\"Clair de Lune\\" is not too gooey, and \\"Iberia\\" has plenty of Spanish sizzle. Debussy fans might have their more favorite conductors, but Stokowski shows once again there were few pieces of music (Mahler, for example) he couldn't make his own. Anyone interested in Debussy and/or Stokowski should not hesitate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good movie","review":"This is a movie about how life is all screwed up.

If he must do this kind of stuff, he needs to drop the old gangsta moniker and genuinely convert to the Hebrew religion. Maybe then people will take this new turn seriously.

I'm surprised the poor heroine could ever even sit down, because she was getting it back there constantly. I guess what bothered me was the complete focus on it, almost to the exclusion of any other sort of activity. The best erotic books, the ones I go back to again and again, have a lot of variety, something for every mood-meat and potatoes to barely legal wild stuff.

Though geisha sometimes had sexual relationships with their clients, they were supposed to entertain primarily through their accomplishments.So, when Ms. Royal went to describe one of Annabel training was to give a perfect handjob, I laughed aloud. That's something new.This whole historical blunder could be avoided if Ms. Royal spent a little more time in research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Overview","review":"If you want to get a fine overview of Siza's works, this book might be just fine. It inculdes a short presentation of all of his works, the major buildings are featured more extensively.

It is remarkable that most of the photos do not present the the projects in the just finished state, but how they look like right now, making plain how gracefully Siza's buildings get older. I have to agree that Le Croquis might show his major buildings more in depth and documents far more Siza's own point of view with two long interviews, however this edition is for sure worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing music!","review":"I love musical fusion, blending one style with another, using different instruments in different genres, etc. This is a truly interesting mix of cultures.Not every number is a winner for me, but everyone is a great example of musical experimentation.

They are intended to be used along with the Latin Primer I workbook and teacher manual. The teacher guides the student through the lesson, as she goes through pronunciation, chants (verb conjugations) and instructions for doing the worksheets. This program is an absolute godsend to parents who want to teach Latin without an extensive knowledge of it themselves. It also helps kids to see that other kids are capable of doing the work. A classroom of students inpressively illustrate that throughout. Latin Primer I does a great job presenting vocabulary (nearly 400 words), along with 1st and 2nd declensions.

The recording has been criticized often for its many overdubs and technicality. A matter of taste...I like it that way - cerainly nothing for the average grunge-one-take \\"listen, I-can't play\\" person.If you like this, check out one of the later Whitesnake albums with Steve Vai as guitarist.\\"Skyscraper\\" is one of those albums that go well with driving into a sun set with an open roof and an open sky."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely worth buying.","review":"While not as good as eat em & smile, it has its high points.

The sound is just incredible.The songs are great, sound great... and the solo's are for those who like this kind of stuff.Listen. If you liked FZ's release SHUT UP AND PLAY YOUR GUITAR and the subsequent GUITAR release, you will love this release, due to it being focused around the 88 band.

All selections are superbly recorded. Most extracts are from the '84 and '88 tours, however, there are a couple from different tours. As always the band line-up is magnificent and they form a solid base for F.Z. to carry the listener to the stratosphere. I wouldn t call this cd a must for die-hards only. If you like guitar and improv you should check it out. I mean the Inca Roads solos number 3 on this cd and they are all different. I believe that F.Z. got more technical as he aged. It seemed to me as though there might have been more aggressive playing on the SU@PYG cd. However, I like the mood of this cd. Any new F.Z. is a welecomed addition to my collection.

You'll have more fun!!!","review":"I'm a big Steven Seagal fan, but this film was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot was non-existent. The acting was atrocious. And the fight scenes were so far over the top, they were unbelievable. Not only does one of the two serial killers in this film get thrown for a 4th story window and survive with no major injuries, only to go on killing, the fight scenes were edited using \\"replay\\" (repeat of blow or impact 3 or 4 times). After the first couple of times, you want it to stop-- desperately. Also, the end of the movie is edited so that key information is left out. The ending makes absolutely no sense at all to viewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes me miss Ed Wood","review":"Wow this was bad. This is the first time I've felt compelled to post a review for a movie, that's how bad it was. A porcine Seagal, complete with some kind of odd southern accent. Obvious stunt double. Gratuitous fight scenes that go on forever with Seagals innumerable punches and kicks seeming to have no real effect on the bad guys. Cut and jerky stop motion photography. Inexplicable ending that seems to have been inserted as an after-thought. Just a bad movie from start to finish. Kind of like the \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\" of the action movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read many reviews of Seagal's DTV releases, and I have seen some of the movies, including this one. The main problem, as I see it, is that you can't hear what he is saying. He mumbles instead of speaks. I don't know about anyone else, but if I am watching a movie and the actor says something, I want to be able to hear what he says without having to turn the volume WAY UP first. I bought this movie, and watched it once, but I'm not sure if I will watch it again.

Like someone else said the close-up shots of his face during the fight scenes didn't cut mustard with me.* The action sequences were, at best mediocre, his Martial arts skills are a joke in all his 21st century movies, and his gun skills are even worse, firing guns at people that he can't even hit.Anything before 2000 was much better, Under Siege I & II, Out For Justice, On Common Ground, Hard To Kill.....I'd pick any of these over this one any day.Save your money folks, go to Blockbuster and rent it if you Have to but DON'T BUY THIS, it's G-A-R-B-A-G-E!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not His Best Work","review":"The DVD and packaging was fine, but the storyline and the acting was not Seagal's best work. There were two story-lines one about a bomber and another about a serial killer, but they were unrelated. Story moved slow and ended weird. First time I noticed that there were a lot of beat 'em up action scenes that really didn't do anything except over-punish the bad guys. (They kept getting up and Seagal would punch them down again.) Also, I noticed that you rarely saw Seagal's face doing the action... like there was a double doing most of his martial arts."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of their weakest...","review":"The first two tracks are very good and hard-rocking, but then the album takes a nose-dive in quality.

Some of the reviewers have said that the computer is reasonably fast. im not really sure what they are used to, but this computer is incredibly slow. Part of that is due to the norton antivirus because it sped up a little when i disabled some of the functions but it didnt fix the problem completely.

Youngsters will most likely need this book to be read to them since the vocabulary is a bit elevated (verdant, acrobatic, accelerates, meander, languorous, etc.). Of course, with creature names like \\"rhinocerose\\" and \\"antelopetunia\\", even adults may need to give this a read-thru before attempting the names out loud! Especially fun are the mangorilla and the orangutangerine who cavort through the jungle and are rarely seen.Sis' mostly monochromatic illustrations are surprisingly exciting and help the reader to really understand these strange animal and animal/plant (especially fruit and vegetable) hybrid creatures. The back cover is further help to decipher these scranimals' imaginative origins and may inspire youngsters to come up with some combinations of their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scranimals Review","review":"This book is great! Jack is so creative and gifted with words. I bought this book for my 4 year old daughter, and she loved every bit of it, except for the Mangorilla and Orangatangerine. She made me skip that part, because she said the picture gave her the creeps!This book takes you on a bizarre journey through an amazingly creative place with a clever play on words, and wonderful poetic content. My daughter spent hours looking at this book and had fun figuring out the animal combinations that created each character.

Instead of purchasing the cheapest one, I picked one with the color strips.1) The hue test indicates it should be adjusted more to the red even when already a bit too red.2) The sharpness is best adjusted by sight during programming than with the test patterns on any pattern I've used.3) After setting color saturation, lowering it enough to better satisfy the red push test proved to be a decent maximum setting, although it should really be a bit lower than that.4) This test & the THX test both indicate a higher brightness than should be used. The recommended setting causes a foggy look.The color strips were great because I could use the blue one with the free THX tests.In summary, your eyes alone are probably the best choice. The second best choice would be the free THX test. The THX test indicates the glasses for the test are available online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money on this one","review":"This video really only helps with a couple of things such as brightness.

Maybe I'm being a little harsh, because I did wait long enough after buying my TV to have tweaked the settings to my satisfaction without this disc.

In fact, I found it useless.You're looking through colored gels at a color test pattern with blinking squares in the center, and you really can't tell what the heck you're adjusting, or if it's getting better or worse or what.

I bought it because I had an old Mr. Coffee that worked fine, but was white and stained. I liked that this was black and looked sleek. The very second time I used it, the off button stuck, so you can no longer turn off the machine, but have to wait for it to turn itself off. Also, EVERY pot has grounds in it.

I will first say, the coffe brews fast, tastes good, stays hot for a long time. The one thing I just can't understand is why they made the carafe the way they did. It is impossible to pour any liquid from it without it spilling everywhere. Whether it be filling the tank with plain water or pouring a cup of coffee. The pot is big then tapers down to a tiny spout and I just don't know what happens but it goes everywhere. I have to pour my coffee over the sink now. And I usually make only 10 cups of coffee, but since tons of water spill out when I'm filling the tank, I have to fill the pot to the brim to make up for all the water I'm loosing.I just HATE this thing and really regret buying it. Mr. Coffee should have just kept the old design. This is just horrible. I may even box it up and see if I can return it. As far as I'm concerned it's defective."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this model","review":"Poor carafe design makes this Mr. Coffee machine a waste of money. We bought this model to replace our old Mr. Coffe machine after we broke the carafe and couldn't purchase a replacement for that model.

In pouring coffee I always have my trusty paper towel at the ready, knowing that it will be needed as a part of the process. It's a bad coffee maker design, and I cannot understand why Mr. Coffee, with all of its experience, cannot put out a product at least as good as those it used to make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye Mr. Coffee","review":"After using nothing but Mr. Coffee products to make coffee with for nearly 25 years, we are never going to buy one again. This model, like the model before it, has a bad burner plate that quickly loses it's teflon-like coating no matter how careful you are with sliding the pot in and out of the slot. When that happens, it not only looks ugly, but affects the overall heating performance of the coffee maker. I also agree with many other users that the design must have been created during a contest between mechanical monkeys and amateur apes. An awkward lid, dripping pot, and ridiculous top spout that needs pushing out of the way every time you replace the filter, all combine to make this the worst coffee maker I've ever used. If the Mr. Coffee company cared at all about their customers they would issue a recall on this product. But then, if they really cared about the consumer, this piece of trash would have never left the factory. Goodbye Mr. Coffee, forever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee Maker failed after 7 months","review":"The coffee maker did a good job for 7 months and then the heating elements failed.

What a piece of [....]. You can NEVER get a decent HOT cup of coffee (it is lukewarm at best) and the carafe not only breaks, so you have to replace it, but it is designed to spill coffee everywhere as you attempt to pour coffee from the carafe into the cup. What a dissapointment this machine is. Mr. Coffee used to make a good product that would actually make a good hot cup of coffee, but the quality and design of their machines today are very poor. I would not recommend this coffee maker to anyone. The only nice thing I can say about it is the programmable timer worked.

However, it contains inaccurate information and is woefully outdated. Many of the trails have either been encroached upon by new housing development or are presently closed to the public altogether (ie. Devils Hole in the Tonto National Forest). Descriptions of certain trails and the level of difficulty is also cavalier. It is irresponsible of Bruce Grubbs to author a publication on a sport as hazardous as mountain biking when he is clearly not an expert.

For this price, it should have been somewhat durable but it isnt. Doubt I will purchase from here again. You cant see what you are getting until you get it.

It is the cheapest-made toy I've ever encountered. As soon as I took it out of the box, I could tell right away I would end up regretting this purchase. The one I got came with a dust-buster, which is even worse than the vacuum. Yes, it makes a loud noise and the front lights up, but it scratches the wood floors and is difficult to push across carpet. The front panel has already fallen off, and the panel in front of the \\"filter\\" won't stay on. My son loves it, but for the money ($30!!), there has got to be a better made toy vacuum. One last thing....they should NOT advertise that it really works. I wasn't looking for a vacuum that sucks up dirt, but the box says it does, and it doesn't even come close. Unfortunately, at the store, there weren't any other real-looking vacuums to choose from. Does anyone know where I can get a good quality, fun vacuum??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"We bought this for our 27 month old who is obsessed with vacuum cleaners.

My little helpers love turning it on and pushing it around the house whenever I pull out my vacuum. My only complaint is that it doesn't really pick anything up! Wouldn't that be a dream!For the price and the fact that you can interest them in any sort of housework is a plus in my book!

He used to have the Little Tikes vacuum and outgrew it. For Christmas I went online and searched for an \\"upgrade\\" for him that was a little more like a real vacuum. This one is great! It has a detachable dirt devil handheld unit that really sucks up dirt! It snaps back into the main unit and the vacuum noise sounds real! He really thinks he's vacuuming with me, it's so cute! A great buy! However, the downside is it doesn't seem as durable as it could be for the price. He has yet to break it but for kids that are hard on toys and drop them often, this one might need a little care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting!","review":"I really wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing... that mistake was all my own! My 23 month old has an obsession with vacuums so I wanted to get him something to play with so I don't have to drag out vacuum out several times a day to avoid a temper tantrum. I was browsing on my phone, saw the picture and thought it looked cool, and purchased it. I was seriously dissapointed when it arrived! It is *super* light and not realistic at all. It also makes that annoying fake \\"clicking\\" sound as it rolls across the carpet. It does have a light and sound which is great, but you can't even hear it over the clicking sound. It is not worth $30 AT ALL... I'm going to spend the extra $20 and get a more realistic looking one. Too bad my husband threw away the packaging already or this would be sent back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FLIMSY!","review":"We had the other Dirt Devil toy vacuum and were looking to replace it when it finally wore out from too much use. When I ordered this I thought it was the same one but this one is really flimsy. My son wouldn't even use it! I had to go onto eBay and buy another Dirt Devil like his old one, which has that plexi part in front where the beads bounce around. Now THAT is a great vacuum...it even sounds like a real vacuum! I wouldn't suggest this one...it sure didn't pass the kid-test in MY house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I pictured!","review":"I ordered this for my two year old grandson who has a cleaning fetish. I sent it directly to his house and I just saw it for the first time today. I was crushed. It certainly did not look like a $40 toy, it was lightweight and cheap! Not at all what I thought it would be. Certainly not a replica of mommy's vacuumn.There is no way it has enough suction to pick up even small lint pieces. Yes, it makes a soft sound but that is about all I can say. I would have been better off buying a real portable dirt devil vacuumn for almost the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"abbeythegreat","review":"My sister and I both purchased this vacuum for her little girl (3)and my little boy (2)because it looked so cute and what fun it would have been. Very Dissapointing. One, you would expect that it would do more. It does not role easily on carpet and it is not loud enough. Even for [$$], it was a waste of money and I wish that I would have bought one that was more realistic and had more lights. Also, it is hard to turn on and off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable!!","review":"My son is 18 months and really loved this as a christmas present.

I found this one on line and ordered it right away. Much to my disappointment, it was not like the one she had. I guess for a toy under ten dollars, I shouldn't expect very much. My son is very advanced for one year, and he became bored fairly quickly. There is a small button on the bottom part of the toy that turns on the \\"motor\\", however, it is not large and is the same color as the rest of the toy, making it difficult for little eyes to detect. The whirring sound only lasts a few moments and then shuts off. It also locks when placed upright, and is difficult for small children to release. The other thing that I noticed is that the plastic handle has rough edges, and within minutes of playing, my son had scratches on his arms and chest. I would not recommend this toy for anyone under the age of 5. If your child likes to help clean, spend the extra money to get a better brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap looking and poorly made","review":"This toy was fully misrepresented in the description. It is definately not worth the price listed. $10.00 would be more appropriate for the price. The contruction is so poor and the sound that is made does not begin to sound like a vacuum.

The seller was notified of the lack of quality and was very helpful and interested in resolving the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I ordered this for my 3 year old. In my opinion this toy is not worth the twelve dollars. It is worth more like five dollars. My daughter was disappointed with this toy and grew frustrated with it in minutes.

I would recommend spending more money and getting a better version."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this","review":"My son has been fascinated with the vacuum cleaner since he was a year old. He would stand at the closet and scream whever I put it away. I bought this hoping to ease his anxiety when I was tired of cleaning! He loves this toy. He is now just over 2 and goes to find his vacuum whever mommy is vacuuming. He loves the button that he can push himself to turn it \\"on\\" and the light is great. It would be nice if it actually picked up dirt but you can't beat it for the price. It's quiet, has no pieces to break or get lost, and is very inexpensive. He uses it on a regular basis and I've never had to replace the batteries in the year+ that I've had it. It shuts off automatically after a minute or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"dirt devil child vacumn","review":"My 18 month old grandson just loves this.

But just because it says Dirt Devil doesn't mean it has 1/2 the quality of a real Dirt Devil. This broke after 2 months of basic toddler play.

It's got a beautiful chrome finish and comes with oil to oil it with. The oil is red and gives it that trademark K&N look. The hose clamp is included too. Compared to the old intake which was horribly restrictive, this breathes so much easier. And I couldn't find it anywhere near as low as Amazon. $12? Sold!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not just the title is wounded in this movie...","review":"Sad to say, but this is far from as good a movie that the other reviews give the impression it is. Basically the story revolves around Julie, a female federal agent, who was part of a team tracking a bear poacher. They get wiped out, and only Julie survives because a biological quirk. The bulk of the movie deals with her psycological recovery, and slow build up to the final confrontation between Julie and the poacher. Unfortunately, the movie is almost devoid of suspense--it's just to predictable: especially the ending--and is marred by a poor screenplay. Only Graham Greene saves the movie from being a total disaster, but due to circumstances way beyond his control, even his performance isn't all that great. You'd have to be insane to buy this movie new at $65."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is short and sweet, this movie is a must see.

I was very excited to find this fan online and based on the description it was suppose to point down. Unfortunately, it DID NOT.

It is truly very satisfying, with complex riffs and nice melodies, but the most important thing is these guys do it without losing heart and spirit and it never gets boring like many other so called prog metal bands. It never turns into mindless display of technique and everytime I listen to it I discover a tiny detail here and there.I usually listen to every album I buy at least 3 times before I have an opinion- to be fair-. Some of them I can not bear to listen more than twice like Iron Maiden's last album Dance of Death, or some Symphony X song which do not inspire anything in me, sounds so robotic and have a feeling like they are put together in an automated fashion with pe-determined rules.Well you are not going to see any of that in this album.

I've been waiting for months for this album to be released in the US.\\"So what does it sound like?\\" you ask. It's probably the most modern, up-to-date progressive metal album in existence. It's heavier than most progressive metal, but it doesn't sacrifice any of the tight, neo-classical performances that you would expect from a prog-metal band. They use a certain amount of electronics, but it adds to, rather than subtracts from, the music.If you like bands like Dream Theater and Symphony X, then you should definitely pick this up.

This Cd is perfect from every aspect, Musicianship is F..cking awesome, vocals are amazing and they're done by ex-Darkane singer lawrence.

His guitar playing prowess takes you to the next level of musical enlightenment. Like the all time great classical composers, Becker studied his predecessors, mastered his instrument and created a new music saturated with feel and technical brilliance in a very heightened compositional context. I've heard that he now suffers from physical complications, and it breaks my heart to know that he can no longer play his instrument, especially at his young age.

Went back to said store and they were all chipped!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like but dimensions are NOT correct","review":"I ordered this pan because the dimensions said it was 4.4 inches deep. In reality it is just over 3 inches deep.This was a HUGE disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality control","review":"For this much money I would have expected a flawless product. In one of the corners, there was a hole in the porcelain - like a bubble burst during manufacturing. At first I thought it was a piece of dirt. What a pain, having to return it. If you buy one, wash it right away and inspect it carefully. Amazon was great - they shipped out the replacement the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent pan","review":"I bought this pan after getting tired of having lasagna bubble over while cooking in a too-shallow pan. I read the reviews on Amazon, and selected this pan because of the positive feedback. What the other reviewers have said is true: the pan is so deep you don't have to worry about spills -- it can easily handle 3 layers of pasta; it has excellent heat retention, and you can use it for things other than lasagna [like roasting]; the Chianti color is very attractive. The only caution: the pan is quite heavy when filled with lasagne. I would definitely buy this pan again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kit Gun","review":"I am just a hobbiest and do not use my gun every day. If you like having to buy o-ring kits, bumper kits, and triggers, go ahead and get one. It seems like every time I go to use it I have to buy a kit or trigger. I have bought enough kits for my gun to buy 3 guns. It's the worse gun I've ever bought. I had a 18ga. Central Pneumatic brad nailer from Harbor Freight that I used a lot more than the N60FN and I never had to put a kit in it. It lasted 20 years. It finally died just recently and I can't get a kit for it. The problem with bostitch nailers is the kits cost way too much. It's kind of like buying a printer. When the ink runs out just go ahead and buy another printer because the ink is more expensive than the printer. I haven't shot but a total of 4 boxes of nails through mine and have had to use four kits and 2 triggers. I don't know if the new version is better than mine, but I'm afraid to try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I fail to understand why reviewers seem to be bowled over by this collection of murky and poorly written stories.

If this is the \\"new style\\" of writing, we are in trouble folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I found this book unreadable, the writing style is choppy in the extreme, and I felt nothing for the protagonists, of whom there are too many. I always thought books were supposed to enlighten us about people we may not be like or know personally, that we would actually learn something in the process of reading the book. These people are unlikeable and unlikely.The book is overall too mannered."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Strange Read...","review":"I'm not a big fan of short stories as it is, but I love the era of the 40's and 50's. Seeing as how that's the era these women are from, I figured I really enjoy this. Well, I was wrong. The book focuses more on the women when their older...much older.But that wasn't why I didn't like this book. What I didn't like was the writing style. Not AT ALL. It was extremely choppy, and I found it to be difficult to follow in many places. And the women themselves...I just didn't care for them. They were a very weird bunch, and I thought they were a bit eccentric for no apparent reason.Overall, not a book I recommend. But as I said, I'm also not a big short story reader. I picked this up thinking I was in for some easy, light reading...but that wasn't the case.

This is a novel to hold on to, and to read again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Majorly Disappointing","review":"Because of the award nomination and short-story format, I bought this book. I found it boring, honestly. I thought this might be the case because I'm a man and this is about women (though that's not stopped me enjoying books by Amy Tan, Joyce Carol Oates, Jhumpa Lahiri, or Sandra Cisneros but I was thinking there I must be reading something wrong). However, I felt vaildated when my mother - an avid reader - read it and complained about the pace and characters as well. Fortunately, it's a short read so it wasn't a long waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put It Down","review":"I just did a 24 hour turn around of \\"Our Kind\\" by Kate Walbert. I was interested in checking her out because her new book, \\"A Short History of Women\\", got such a glowing review in the NYT Book Review a couple of weeks ago. It's about a group of 70 somethings looking back on their lives as mothers/wives in the 1950's and 60's, but also, about their current lives. As you get clearer on the backstories of the characters - what they did in their younger years and how the choices they made effect their lives now - it really starts to come together very powerfully. Not all of the characters receive the same back story treatment, so I was left wondering about some of them, and wished there was more. You have to drop some of your stylistic conventions when reading and just go with the flow - there are images that take your breath away, and an undercurrent of disturbance that is not comforting, but well worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"All time fav of John Tesh","review":"This Cd is one of his first releases but is one I adore!

For most of your home electronic appliances, you really do not need professional cables that cost a lot of money. Especially in the case of digital signals. Your Blu-Ray or DVD player simply does not decipher enough data information that requires you to need premium cable to transfer it. Also, a lot of the expensive cables advertise about being gold plated and the thickness of the cable, but unless your signal source is over 100 feet away from your projection (most likely your TV), you are not loosing any data in the transit process.Point being, this cable is more than enough for what you need.

The Casual Gods artwork is very compelling, something I can rarely if ever say about any CD.

So when i finally got it in the mail, I put it into my DVD player. I was shocked to see it was old footage of them playing (footage that can easily be found on youtube). I was hoping that they would put on a solo show specificly for the DVD, Lacuna Coil needs to take a page from the book of Within Temptation. The only thing that makes the DVD worth anything is the \\"behind the scenes footage\\" and the additional music videos for Karmacode.

I was so excited at the prospect of a Lacuna Coil Dvd that I immediately bought it when it came out. Sadly this dvd completely disappoints. First of all the quality is pretty bad for a professional dvd - that in itself ruined the dvd for me. Second, there is not enough NON-concert footage...the footage from when they were in Japan SUCKED...they kept repeating the same boring images over and over. I've seen some pictures from Cristina's myspace about their time in Japan and it seemed more interesting then what this dvd portrayed. It would have been nice to see a \\"home video\\" of sorts with Lacuna Coil exploring Japan. Oh well. Honestly the only thing I did like about this dvd were the included music videos.

In \\"The Rink\\" you will see that these comedies are the result of Chaplin's tireless choregraphy and perfectionism.

Whereas Pet Sounds reflected the melancholia and insecurity Brian was feeling in 1965, his self titled 1988 release showcases a much more optimistic and loving artist. Love and Mercy, Melt Away, There's So Many and Let It Shine rank among Brian's best melodies, and Rio Grande is an experimental gem that would have fit nicely onto the aborted Smile album. The album's shining moment is One For The Boys, an a capella tribute to his former bandmates, which features Brian's multi-tracked harmonies. If Carl Wilson had sung on this album, it would rank as The Beach Boys' best work. This version also contains 11 bonus tracks (including many demos) that prove this wasn't just pieced together by producers, as was rumored at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"What you need tonight","review":"This, of course, was Brian Wilson's long awaited first solo album.

His fans should enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pocket Symphony","review":"Hello Brian Wilson fans,I have been a BW fan since I was five. This is my favorite album ever. Melt Away remains the most spiritual and most magical song I've ever heard and may ever hear. I love this record and am sorry it was not promoted better than it was. That's probably the main reason why it didn't fair well commercially. BW got me through the roughest time of my life and continues so today. I love this man. He is the purest soul on this earth and I only wish him happiness and continued success. I try to write all my vocal arrangements as inspiring as his. If you believe in magic, believe in Brian Wilson. For the first month it was released I listened to this album two or three times a day, 7 days a week. It remains my most listened to album. I just absorbed it. And you will too. Enjoy!-Brett Northampton, PA"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful debut!","review":"I first purchased this album in the early '90's in a rack full of tape cut outs. At that time, I was very young, loved the Beach Boys but didn't even know who Brian was or that Brian was even part of the Beach Boys. When I listened to this album, my jaw hit the floor. I loved every song and was shocked to find out that it wasn't deemed successful at first. I still continued to listen to it and soon found out that Brian Wilson himself was a mover and a shaker of his time. I always felt that Brian's \\"Imagination\\" album was part II of his 1988 debut. Each song on this debut is enjoyable. You can hear the joy that Brian puts in every song. If you are a Beach Boys or Brian Wilson fan, this solo debut is not an exception. Now, with all the bonus tracks added, what more could anyone ask for? It is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine reissue of a near-classic album","review":"I was 16, and already a Beach Boys fanatic, when this first came out, and I was delighted to see it was being reissued in a remastered version. It sounds great ... at least a few of the tracks sound like they were remixed as well as remastered; \\"Love and Mercy\\" seems to have extra synth parts that weren't on the original CD at all (listen to the end of the wordless bridge just before the chorus comes back in), and the end of \\"Melt Away\\" sounds quite different. In any case, the sound is mighty fine, and the bonus tracks are generous and worth at least a listen or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brian Wilson out of the dark into the LIGHT!","review":"A nice collection of songs as the genius of the Beach Boys rises from his period of drugs, depression, and burn out to captivate the world again with his talent. This CD was produced by his shrink Dr. Eugene Lansky. What is therapy for Brian is music for us from this very dark period in his life.If you like the Beach Boys this is not them. It is a more mature musical sound. Test the the sample tunes before you purchase. That's what I did and I don't regret the purchase of this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"As I expected... filters!","review":"The filters fit perfectly.

He blends beautiful vocals accompanied with orgasmic beats. And Movement in Still Life is no different. From Ima, through Escm., and into the Go soundtrack, BT has expanded his artistic ability. He continues on that path with this most recent import. The tracks include Godspeed which is much like his older stuff, along the lines of Flaming June, very earthly and epic. But he grows with songs that sound more involved with a break-beat sound. But it's when he returns to old form that he truly excels. There are tracks that are, for lack of a better word, beautiful. I truly recommend this album. It's worth the import price."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING IN ALL LEVELS","review":"To start off, I would give this CD 10 stars if I could--and I truely mean that without any sense of exageration. This CD pulls you through a emotive ride in lush landscapes. ESCM was much more deep and ambient in that the music was slow and spoke to your soul--the difference with MSL is that it acccomplishes that with a lesser degree, but it has MUCH more of a trance beat to it. As to where with ESCM, you could only dance to a few beats, with MSL, you can to nearly all. This version amazingly outshines its US version counterpart which is filled with (...). Buy this CD, and let it change your life (ok, well....not that far)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I bought this album mainly for the song \\"dreaming\\" it is one of my favorites by BT and I thought I would give his album a shot.

Definitely worthy of a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"an awesome album with a diverse arrangement of songs","review":"BT's latest album \\"movement in still life\\" is an album that can only be described as incredible. it's a wonderful mixture of rock, trance, techno, and hip-hop. Its got everything a music lover could want. There is not a person i know who does not like BT's subtle arrangement. His lighter side (\\"Satelite\\"), while soft at times, can be brought up by the enjoyable \\"godspeed\\" which makes you want to get up and dance with it's rhythmic synths, and relentless beat. I could go on all day and describe every track one by one, but in no way can i describe the feeling the album brings to you. Do yourself a favor, and get an album with plenty of flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"US Version is way different from the UK/world version","review":"Beware on the early reviews. They all refer to the UK/world version of the CD which is significantly different from the US version. This cd is great and I might pick up the US version for the tracks i don't have, but it looks like the more pure dance orientated tracks have been removed the stateside version. Be sure to check out the import, there's one with a bonus CD of unmixed and extended versions which would also offset the additional cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWEFUL!!!!!","review":"This is the only BT CD that I have ever bought and it will be the last one I will buy from this DJ. He had like one descent song, and the rest was crap. He mixes too many things together and messes up the flow in just about every song. He also keeps on scratching and bringing in strange sounds and strange talking. When you listen to the first track on this CD you will understand what I mean by strange talking."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment for a talented artist","review":"BT's third full length CD, \\"Movement In Still Life\\", contains moments of greatness, but is plagued by material that at best is second rate. Only on tracks, such as \\"Dreaming\\", \\"Godspeed\\", and \\"Mercury and Solace\\", does BT deliver what he does so well, that is, deliver trance which is well a cut above commercial trance. Not that everything else is bad, but there is nothing fresh or innovative about the other songs on this CD. BT's first two CD's fully embraced techno/trance music's driving beat. Here, it is in dire short supply. One has to wonder if there is an American phobia with having such a prominent beat. If you are new to BT, you would do well to buy his first two CDs instead of this one. Of course, you can buy this CD only because the cover has a great picture of him."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointing","review":"I've heard Godspeed, Dreaming, and some other songs by BT on various trance compilation CDs so I bought this CD, thinking that it should be a pretty good trance CD... Sadly, I couldn't stop myself from pressing the fast forward button as soon as the first song started playing. The only two songs I can listen to without fast forwarding any part of it was Godspeed and Dreaming (but even Dreaming was disappointing since the one I've heard before was a remix and this one is not). The songs on this album is more rap/alternative-ish, so if you are looking for nice trance/rave music (like how I was), this is soooo not the CD to buy. You would be a lot better off spending the money on a trance compilation that has the BT song you're looking for (such as Godspeed)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Next Level","review":"I just bought this album and haven't had a chance to listen to it fully, but no joke - this album is worth it for just cuts 1 and 2! And the great thing about BT is that his albums bring depth and new discoveries at every listening. His writing and production skills are through the roof. If you haven't checked out IMA or ESCM, I highly recommend them both also."},{"rating":"2","title":"BT thanks to Napster","review":"Well here I am with my 3rd BT CD of the year. I never knew who this DJ was until I downloaded a few tracks off the Napster Hot List. [E-gads you mean Napster helped the record industry!!]. I loved the tracks so much I am here on Amazon buying more of his CDs. I need music to \\"workout to\\" and BT fits the bill and rushes the soul to new heights. It is a true gift to be able to create music that is lightning in a bottle. I hope you enjoy this CD as much as I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to be the antagonist here, but...","review":"I don't see how these people here have rated this cd so highly! We had this stinking thing back-ordered for weeks and rejoiced when it arrived. But we were misled. Frankly, I'm very disappointed in BT. Ima and ESCM were very, very good, but the only redeeming quality of this work is the Mercury and Solace track (a track we already owned on another compilation). I usually love BT. This is different; like a poor attempt to break into mainstream trip-hop or something. Oakenfold, Van Dyk, and BT: all very talented artists. I have to wonder if the record contract is responsible for this nonsense. Sorry, BT; this is just the way we're feeling out here."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy this version !","review":"dont buy this version because this cd suposed to have some other track from the original version like ride, the hip hop phenomenon, giving up the ghost and namistai,this songs are so much better than shame, never gonna back down, smartbomb and love on haight street. that's all that i can say of this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sell Out....","review":"After ESCM was released, I read a review that hailed BT as the artist most likely to bring trance into mainstream consciousness, so long as he could bridge a gap with pop. Unfortunately, it seems like that's what he attempted here, only he went way too far. These tracks have none of the innovation or passion of his earlier releases. All that's left is a boring, progressive pop album that will play to top-40 audiences much more effectively than his true fans or club listeners. Even the standout track Heaven Scent is a weak version - you can find more uplifting, EnErgizing mixes of it almost anywhere. Here's hoping BT will return to his roots on his next efforts....."},{"rating":"1","title":"No movement, NO SIGNS OF LIFE - BT's latest is D.O.A.","review":"One of Paul Van Dyk's most fruitful professional partners and a quality electronic musician, BT has created such amazing tracks as \\"Namistai\\", \\"Mercury and Solace\\", and \\"Godspeed\\", among many others. He's also released several previous albums that have garnered the American considerable critical acclaim.Naturally, I thought this album was gonna rock... the thing is, and I'm sure you'll agree with me, that every track on this album (that's any good at all) has already been remixed into a better piece and put on a compilation somewhere by someone. I was totally unimpressed with this release, maybe if he had some passionate original mixes of one of the more obscure winners, like \\"Running Down The Way Up\\"... but BT eventually leaves us searching for a sign of life in \\"STILL LIFE\\". I hope his next is better.Good luck Brian, we still love you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-Hash","review":"This album is just a re-hash of up and coming music that has existed for the last couple years now, from trance, to hip-hop, to rock. To see how this album is pushing any boundaries is rubbish. This album is nothing new if you know your music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"I discovered BT and his music a month ago, and purchased the album \\"emotional technology\\". I enjoyed it but was a little dissapointed. But it (emotional technology) still made me a new fan. After reading the reviews and listening to samples for the imported movement in still life, I had to get my hands on it. This cd is about as close to perfection as they come. Every track was amazing, and you can tell BT had a lot of fun with the first 4 tracks! Another great aspect of the album is the transitioning of the genres of music. It starts out with some crazy break beat tracks, moves into progressive trance territory, crescendos and brings you down slowly with tracks 10 and 11. Very well done... Don't contemplate any longer on wether or not to buy this album. Get it now you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart, and the bomb.","review":"After just a few spins of this disc, I realized \\"BT\\" was very talented and a great dj. He has been able to take the techno/trance genre, and make it into something very accessable and catchy. Kind of like what \\"Trent Reznor\\" did with industrial music. This album is almost as much pop as anything else. Most of it is very radio, or at least club friendly. Great beats, mixing, samples, and vocals on most tracks. \\"Never Gonna Come Back Down\\", \\"Dreaming\\", and \\"Godspeed\\" all seem like they've made their way into movies or commercials. Imagine what \\"BT\\" and \\"Moby\\" could do if they teamed up. World domination? Anyway, this may not be his best disc, but to not have it would be a \\"Shame\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, whatever you do, GET THE IMPORT!","review":"Had I not gotten the import version of this CD (and then lost it and repurchased the US version, thinking they were one and the same) I never would have known just how weak this compilation is in comparison. The import version of this CD is instantly recognizable as pure BT... the CD is beautifully mixed together and weaves seamlessly from song to song, whereas the US version just doesn't have the same continuity. Several tracks from the UK version are also missing on the US version, what replaces them I would call pablum at best. (I can't remember what's missing and my UK version is GONE!) Under no circumstances would I recommend this CD over the import."},{"rating":"2","title":"no words, no talk.","review":"i can remember spitting out the word 'trance', and stating that never would i enjoy any kind of dance, trance, techno etc style of track.then i heard dreaming.first the lyrics caught me. poignant, without being overly saccharine or trite, they seem to speak to something inside not only me, but others of my friends. i have a friend for whom this track makes him stand, in a christlike pose, arms outstretched, tears of elation running down his cheeks -- he loves it that much. i don't claim to have the same strong affection for it, but it comes close.mercury & solace is another fine track, and a great lead in to dreaming. in fact, from the second track (mad skillz), BT leads you from high, to high right up until the beauty of dreaming.i can't tell you that you too will love dreaming as much as i, or get as much pleasure out of the rest of the album, but give it a spin, or two, and let it take you away.take my hand, we'll go dreaming."},{"rating":"1","title":"so disappointed","review":"If you are one to follow and purchase all of Brian Transeau's great musical works, this is not an IMA or an ESCM! This is more like an experiment into pop/rock/hiphop. Although there are some great songs on this disk (Godspeed + Mercury and Solace are re-released) much of the disk is weak and messy. You start to miss BT's old style as you listen to each track. Of the newer tracks the highlights would be Dreaming, Running down the way up, and smartbomb. I've heard that the Import is many times stronger than this release (US), so check the import. Also, check out BT's ESCM for a more refreshing envigorating selection of beautifully crafted songs instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mix of everything","review":"BT tries to combine a variety of styles and genres here on this cd, while he is mostly known for sweeping trance ballads this cd has it's share of departures to other areas. There are 2 tracks that are very rock influenced almost alternative in nature, then there are also a few hip hop songs that arent too bad.Mostly ofcourse the cd stands out because of it's whole compilation of everything above with Godspeed, Mercury & Solace and Dreaming. All of these have been featured on countless other DJ albums and compilations but they are in their original form here and not re-mixed.This is pretty much a feel good album, you cant go wrong, hopefully BT will release an albun where he dedicated himself fully to what he does best - mix and produce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ecstatic Trance!","review":"I just have to admit that I was a dabbler in dance/houe/trance music before I bought this CD. Now I listen to Trance and Dream House as much as possible, thanks to BT's artistic abilities. Many have said this album is a sell-out, but his skillz are still apparent. And, since he did vocals on some ESCM tracks, I don't see what the big problem is with \\"Shame\\" and \\"Satellite\\", both of which are both beautiful songs. This CD just shows how diverse BT really is! A must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Import!","review":"Was very disappointed with the US release of this album - all the songs are cut into singular, radio-ready size sound bites that are just mere shadows of the brilliance of the UK release. I don't fault BT for this - the record execs apparently think us Americans can't handle an epic trance album in the format it was originally intended. On the US release, beginnings and ends of songs don't make sense, e.g., \\"Running\\" and \\"Satellite\\" are one consistent 15 minute experience on the UK release; on the US version, they're cut down SIGNIFICANTLY and are out of order!My only regret was that I wasted ten bucks and waited three weeks for a sub-par release. Spend a little extra, get the import +9 off of Amazon, and go home happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but I prefer the import","review":"As stated before, the import has longer tracks and has 2 of my favorite songs, The Hip Hop Phenomenon and Giving Up the Ghost, which do not appear on the US version. However, the import does not contain Never Gonna Come Back Down, so it could be a toss up, depending on your tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"BT. . .Beautifully Thought out!","review":"Mezmorizing!!! This was BT's big break album! This CD has it all. From Trancy (Dreaming) to Pop/Rock/Electronic (Never Gonna Come Back Down). Beautiful! This CD never lets you fall away from its beats. Just as it finds itself slowing down. . .another song comes that won't stop pounding. BT is always going to be a classic, find this CD and listen to it over and over again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic, Slick, and Uninteresting.","review":"Okay, so its well produced.Okay, so some of the melodies are kind of catchy.Okay, so its BT.Okay, so he even sells Apple products I own and love.But this record just has no soul. It's a series of tracks with no cohesion (other than they fade into eachother), and there's no theme to the disc.It's well made techno, but it has no feeling to it. It leaves me feeling cold and wondering what the point of it was.With so much good electronic music out there, one might think that BT would have picked up on what makes the rest of it (such as Eat Static or Hallucinogen, or dare I say The Chemical Brothers or The Crystal Method) so good.BT has had a lot of success lately, largely from good marketing, and a slick image. I think that perhaps what has happened is the quality of music has gone down because there hasn't been any feedback but positive. My suspicion is he has fallen prey to his own (or his label's own) marketing engine.Move along folks, nothing to see here."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS ADVERTISED","review":"This kit does NOT contain an aluminum, cleaning rod as advertised.

His writing style seems a little disorganized at first, but the book comes together in the end and I really enjoyed it. He also does say some things that aren't precisely scriptural (not that they are against Scripture, but he makes a little bit of a stretch in coming to conclusions). I do think he touches on points that need to be addressed in the church, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life changer","review":"So many books promise to \\"unlock the secret to the meaning of life.\\" This book actually does!

This is what we're truly searching for!\\"If you are going to only give John Eldredge one shot, this is the book to do it with. I have been deeply moved by the truth Eldredge and his team preach about God, so much so that I've cited him in The King's Game, but this is far and away his best written work.Don't miss this book - understanding your life and your heart depends on it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"Books are highly subjective, but I have always liked John's books. Be aware of all the pompous critics out there who claim that John is 'aloof' or not quite 'in touch'. I know that God has used his writing in wonderful ways for myself, and MANY that I know.

Its a quick and mindless read. I could not identify with the characters at all. The two female protagonists are way too silly and naive, given their respective ages.

Learned a lot about tea. Liked the book but there were a couple of places where it felt that the author either overlooked the culture or didn't do enough research. Here are some inconsistencies that bothered me:It puzzled me that the Bengali father knew that his eldest daughter's finance was sleeping with his youngest daughter but he stayed calm. Once his mother let's him know that she too is aware of the affair he does react in a more traditional way by hiring thugs to kill the guy.Also, Grandma Nina keeps referring to the tea plantation as something belonging to her ancestors but it didn't belong to her ancestors; she came into the family as a young bride.Anyway, overall it is a good read.

This saw did a perfect job. It is round and sharp. The varriable pitch on the tooth pattern kept it from chattering. My only complaint is that I used it with a Klein mandrell. The hole pattern for the set pins was off just enough that the saw did not install tight on the mandrell. This may be due to the age of my mandrell, or the difference in brands. In all this saw did the trick at a reasonable price.

After the interactions occur, and sometimes during, you are shown a canned quicktime movie. Same movie may be shown over and over and over...Any program that requires Windows users to back off of Quicktime 6 and install 2.5 from the CD-ROM is useless.Tried it on our Mac also and found that if you type too fast, it misses your keystrokes, and counts the stroke as an error! If you type too soon, even after the visual prompt is displayed, it misses the keystroke.Distracting visuals and too great a visual reliance on the keyboard chart at the expense of the source text hinders learning. IF you make a single mistake, you lose and have to start over.This program may have functioned well in its day (though I don't see how that could be), but it is out-of-date, in addition to being very poorly designed.STAY AWAY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Read an earlier review which slammed this product.

Mixing themes of religion and politics, submission and rebellion, desire and death, the Sicilians is that rarest of achievements: a page turner with literary depth . . . and a history lesson to boot. The Daluci brothers, Turi and Luciano, seem to have descended from the Karamazovs, by way of the Thornbirds; the bloodlines are electric.

By intense internal politics and taking huge bets some unqualified Swiss banker was able to secure the CEO seat, which inevitably lead to disastrous consequences for the bank. The reasons for the fall of UBS are well explained and is a must for anyone wanting to understand how Switzerland's number one bank ended up merging with Swiss Bank Corporation, a smaller rival that secured all the top management position of the new entity. It seems to me that the other reviews of this book come from UBS employees that were working at the time in the bank divisions that caused the bank to almost fail. If you want to know why they are so bitter, read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This book is marginal at best. Very short, quick read with type large enough for a children's book (probably looking for filler pages to get it past 200). Nothing new for someone who followed it in the popular press as the events were happening.The book also does a poor job of explaining relevant details surrounding the markets of the time, especially with respect to the inner working of Swiss Bank. The author also fails to examine the exact nature of the losses in the equity division within UBS... maybe his knowledge of derivatives rates right up there with the man responsible for the downfall."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Writer of Good Breeding","review":"I was recently in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and someone mentioned Miriam Toews as a good writer from the area. I really enjoyed the characters in this book: the eccentric mayor Hosea Funk, the young mother Knute Corea-McCloud and the wonderful mutt named Bill Quinn.

Tesh wrote 6 of the 10 tracks, which are for the most part not very enjoyable. The exception for me is \\"When Will Our Love Find A Way\\". It's a tender tune that is well suited for the soprano sax. Eric Marienthal plays the tune well. He and Jeff Kashiwa seem to be the artists I like best on the album. I like Kashiwa on the cover of \\"Rocket Man\\", which I think is the best track of the album. \\"Polar Express\\" isn't bad, but that is just because I really enjoy the guy playing the flugel horn.

One was by the good Prince (Love Sexy) and the other by the bad Prince (The Black Album). The story goes that the good Prince won out and Prince released Love Sexy. The album is full of positive notions about love and God. The problem is that the unreleased Black Album(it was released in a limited edition several years later) was far superior to Love Sexy. \\"Alphabet St.\\" has a nice funky groove with a guitar riff reminiscent of \\"Kiss\\" and is a good song, but the album doesn't offer much else. One would be better served to find a copy of the Black Album as that contains some of the darkest, deepest, funkiest grooves Prince has ever committed to tape. Love Sexy just doesn't match up the high standards that he had set with his previous 80's releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!","review":"Prince is SUCH a genius.

HE PROBABLY KNOWS IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Messy","review":"Through out the 80's, Princes' standard in artistry and production was nothing short of amazing. \\"alphabet st.\\", \\"dance on\\", \\"love-sexy\\" and \\"I wish u heaven\\", were all strong tracks with much potential. The finishing result was a 45 minute mish-mash of noise that has destroyed the joy of listening to these four particular songs. The mastering process of the album, resulted in one single track (very unusual) (that's prince), but overall, the album sounds awful. Many of the tracks are mixed together, with no definitive track boundaries, with \\"over the top\\" production work, which becomes somewhat annoying. Prince would have been much better off to release these four tracks on an EP, with distinctive silent gaps between the tracks. This would have given all four tracks their distinct individuality, deepening the experience that each track is conveying. On a finishing note, this was one messy album to listen to, with no depth. This was the beginning of Princes' decline"},{"rating":"2","title":"An album for getting in touch with your soul.","review":"Although I am not a professional reviewer, I must say this is truly my favorite Prince album. It is joyous, thought provoking, soulful, romantic, and full of all sorts of musical complexity. The songs merit listening based soley on their composition, and become more powerful with the addition of the words. The best song on the album is \\"Positivitey\\" but hardly anyone has ever heard it because it is buried at the end. If you appreciate this epoch of Prince's history when he produced a different album each year, this is a must buy. If you want an album to write poetry and be philosophical to, this is a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An emotionally charged classic from a musically GENIUS!","review":"This album is as uplifting and subtly aggessive as any of THE ARTIST'S work in his 20 some years. My favorite song here is ANNA STESIA. The vibe and feel of this song mentally puts you in a place where you don't mind being,comforting and yet musically moving.Prince at this time was in a dark place spiritually and chose to release this effort instead of the funky, aggitated BLACK ALBUM,which is as different as day and night with this album. SHEILA E plays the drums along with the Artist. This album also was the beginning of most of the post- Revolution LINE-UP changes, no more Wendy and Lisa. ALPHABET STREET is the \\"commerial hit\\" here which features very tight rhythm guitar and an entriguing sycopated drum progression. Listen to this album as a whole,straight through and get into the aura of the man who undesputable is the most prolific song writer of our time......ENJOY......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lame packaging","review":"In case you don't know, all the songs are on ONE track.

What other musician writes lyrics filled with spirituality and funk which lead 2 introspection by the listener?Lovesexy is the gospel according 2 Prince. In his own words, it is his gospel album. With it, he reveals his perception of God and opens himself up to millions of people. This revelation and openness may explain the liberal cover of Lovesexy, which works well with the intent of the album. Lovesexy intertwines spirituality and sexuality in such a way that u can only experience that idea if u listen 2 the CD in its entirety. Hence, the CD is only one track, in a sense leading u 2wards salvation and away from evil and negativity.

I used the crows foot sockets and I was amazed an how easy it came out. I checked the socket size on the new part and it fit perfectly. When I was removing the old O2 sensor, it felt like the socket was too big. It turns out it was already loose. I could not believe how easy this tool made the job. There is no way to fit a normal wrench into the very limited work space. Nothing like having the right tool for the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great on 2004 Honda CR-V","review":"The socket is just a touch too large so if the O2 sensor is really jammed in there, be careful that it doesn't slip. Warming the sensor with a brief drive and/or some gentle tapping to free the threads might help avoid rounding it off if it really doesn't want to turn loose. As others have said, unscrewing the metal tab that holds the connectors is a handy way to disconnect the sensor. This should be done before unscrewing it.For a full Honda service manual in PDF format, try AutoManualSource. About $20 will get you a good one-- not some blurry halfhearted scan. This describes the whole process for replacing the sensor and getting the computer to properly recognize the new one.

For my 1998 Honda Accord, the slotted socket was just a little bit to short to cover the O2 sensor. But the crow foot socket works perfectly.

However, this author blew the whole story. The ending was horrible and predictable..her writing style is horrible. She writes with so many short sentences and it's almost like you don't know who's speaking at the moment or if she's thinking. I do not know what the other reviewers were reading, but their either paid relatives or friends. This book was BAD! The boy was way too mature for his age and the characters didn't touch me at all. 2 thumbs down!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging well written love story","review":"Very well written and engaging novel. I couldn't put it down! Read it again recently and it touched my heart again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!!","review":"John Tesh has done some good music in the past. This CD is not one of them. The CD tries to introduce new and obscur talent into the business. Unfortunately, he doesn't have a diamond in this rough ride. The only good thing on this CD is the smooth sax on the remake of Kenny Loggins' \\"Love Will Follow\\". After that, I just want to turn everything off.

Soon the winter comes and the ants are warm and have plenty of food to eat. However the grasshopper is out in the cold with no food at all. I liked the illustrations in this book, and I also enjoyed the way the author told the moral to the readers. The author's main moral was that there are times when you can play and times when you need to do work, and you can't play all the time. The moral is easily understandable so that children will be able to pick up on it. Also it is a great way in introduce time management to older children"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I purchased this book thinking that it would take off where the Wrox books left off (since it is a MS product), but I was very disappointed to find that not only is this book very small (which means it cannot cover the breadth of the .NET framework), it is not much more than a bunch of MSDN articles and reprints of the help & readme files from beta 1.I expected a lot more since MSDN magazine touted these books as a good technical resource.If you're looking for an in-depth resource for .NET, stick with the Wrox books for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless cashing-in","review":"... I bought three books in this series - this, Web Applications in the Microsoft.NET Framework and The Microsoft.NET Framework - all three went straight back to Amazon, since there's nothing here that hasn't been around since last summer - I have rarely felt so ripped off. Mostly these books are transcripts of interviews that you can find on the site anyway - there's nothing of interest to developers that you don't already know in far greater detail already. I wouldn't pay five bucks for these, never mind thirty. Shame on you Microsoft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beta 2 changes everything","review":"I started out giving this book a three star rating, as the articles are not that bad. Unfortunately, very little of the content has been updated for beta 2. There is still some content that is very useful for understanding the basics of .Net, but it is laced with material that only applies to beta 1. As such, it is really hard to recommend this book any more.If Microsoft would publish an errata, to cover the changes for beta 2, this might be a slightly different story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Obsolete...","review":"I understand it is a \\"pre Beta 2\\" so it should be removed from active selling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Writer","review":"I agree entirely with the previous reviewers. There is so much in this book; beautifully written history of the depression era, characters who you really care about (or fear), all in a style that is so well developed is sounds a little like John Steinbeck. I really can't understand why the book was not a bestseller. I can only guess that this author is not well known amoung the NY literary intelligentsia. I am doing my best to tell everyone about it. Mr. Murkoff, please continue to write such wonderful material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Similegeddon","review":"I gave this two stars because I could get far enough into it really judge the book on it's merits. I simply found the style of prose to be unbearable. I agree with the one poster who says the writer tries to hard and seems to be saying \\"look at my stuff\\" (which isn't that great). \\"Creamy glow of headlights\\" and that sort of thing, such as one would expect in a student lit quarterly or something. For a western themed book that is much more daring,unique and successful I recommend Brain Hall's \\"I should be Extremely Happy in Your Company.\\"Matt"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a terrible book!","review":"This book was painfully bad. If you are tempted to buy it, I strongly suggest reading an excerpt from it, or flipping through a few pages at the library or a bookstore. It's pretentious prose, with thin characters and a plot with very little to recommend it. Interested in the Hoover Dam? He gets to it about two hundred pages in. If gratuitous violence is your thing, you might be able to skim this novel for the parts about Lew Beck and enjoy the bits where he stomps on legless beggers, chops off fingers, or stabs people in the guts with broken bottles. I wouldn't have minded the violence so much had the justification for it not been so very weak. Nothing we see of Lew's childhood really illuminates his sadistic nature to my satisfaction. He just doesn't add up, which is frustrating because he's the only potentially interesting thing in novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to put it down","review":"Murkoff is an ok writer, but everything is too precious. He's got some dark characters and a little rough subject matter, but this book tries too hard. Too many perfect descriptions and metaphors. I feel like he's trying to impress instead of creating something from the heart. I got about halfway through and I had put it down before I puked. Too bad I didn't get to the dam part, but oh well, must look after my health."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Pitter Pat!\\" Mr. Jones is back in town\\"","review":"I am always surprised at the many negative reviews of this last album.

Ignore at your own risk.\\"I dream of cherry pies, candy bars and chocolate chip cookies.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Emperor Unclad","review":"This is by far the least compelling album released by the Heads. Relative to their lofty standards, this is dull, downbeat, repetitious music. Although Byrne has shed the most of the affected naivete of Little Creatures and True Stories, he can't recapture the dark, quirky humor underlying the Heads' best albums, Fear of Music and Remain in Light. And in spite of the heavy beats, there's not much to dance to on this record. Look to Speaking in Tongues or Stop Making Sense for that. It's hard to lament the breakup of this great band after such a lackluster effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fear of THIS Music","review":"So what happened? Many reviewers here have offered their pet theories as to why this Talking Heads recording is good or bad. You will see that few take the middle road, nor can I.Certainly, any band has the right to take any direction its wishes, and on this CD, the freefall that started with True Stories and Little Creatures ends in an all out burn out. The songs are, for the most part, cloying and annoying, and the band's preoccupation with trying to synthesize disparate elements of \\"world\\" music leaves me cold. Basically, this CD foreshadows the direction of Byrne's solo career, which is not a direction most core Talking Heads fans cared to follow.I suppose there is a place for music like this. I call it the trashcan. It's rarely a good sign when the used CDs start at under five bucks, is it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like this one.","review":"I think the Talking Heads are a very original band. I enjoy much of what they have composed, but I do not like this CD. I ended up selling it at a used CD store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another CRASH AND BURN album","review":"I hate to say that after listening to every track on this Album I was very quite disappointed. As you'll hear I should say, the band is not near to it's original quality as they were in albums such as speaking in tounges at which point some of their most classic memorable hits were introduced to the world. The music selection was bad, poor writing, and it seemed really out of time so Sadly I regret to say if you like the all time sound of the Talking Heads don't buy this album. You will be quite disappointed and look at it like this: David Byrne left the group less than a year after it's release so the unpleasing change couldn't have been for the better! It was unfortunately this album Naked that dropped the curtains on a fairly cool band popular in my high school years"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another established band having reached the end!","review":"Horrible, poorly planned, bad sound effects, terribly misplaced song and lyric themes, it doesn't even fit the traditional theme these guys usually demonstrated all of the other times. I regret to report that this was a very lousy, annoying, and uninteresting album almost as if written with pre-schoolers in mind. I would not reccomend it as it would be really detrimental to the taste of anyone who'd developed a relative liking to the band with all time classic hits such as \\"Burning down the house\\" or \\"Once in a lifetime\\".While they put out some good productivity for some years, it is needless to say the image this album put in the eyes of fans all over the world toward the band played a large roll in David Byrne's decision to go solo the following year."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this cd and I am a fan of the T-heads","review":"This has got to be one of the most disapointinng cd's I have ever bought. I love the T-heads and felt like I got ripped-off when I played this."},{"rating":"2","title":"all over the map","review":"rock music is the music of sincerity; you have to believe in the attitude of the lead singer or all is lost. David Byrne never bothered to create a persona- or rather, he creates a new one for each song. This probably keeps him from being as popular as he deserves to be. The main problem with \\"Naked\\" is its eclectivity (if that's a word). It has great songs on it, but it doesn't cohere as an album. If you are a Talking Heads fan, it's an essential buy, but it's not the place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"My childhood years and watching nightflight, and nighttracks","review":"I bought this album back in 1988, I was in the eighth grade....and even to this day, I listen to it from beginning to end everytime it goes into my stereo.

Talking Heads made school a little less trite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roine Stolte at his best.","review":"This is genius at work. Roine Stolte never improved on this in my opinion.

The stories are classic--my faves are \\"The Yellow Wall-paper\\" & \\"Extenuating Circumstances.\\" Many of the authors included are published elsewhere so this book in turn leads the reader to other excellent books.

As far as I'm concerned, the book was all-but-unreadable. The inner parts of paragraphs were usually readable. But the openings were often unreadable, seemingly starting in mid-sentence. And most of the different sectional markers normally used to guide reading were either missing or run in with the regular text. All-in-all, I cannot recall seeing such a poor OCR job for many years.

Unfortunately, the LED power indicator light is bright blue and puts off too much light in a dark bedroom. The design and quality are pretty good and the 3 AA batteries seem to last a long time, but it does not charge the iPod so you'll have to carry a power adapter too.You will probably be satisfied if you are willing to accept mediocre sound quality in order to get very portable and very inexpensive iPod Nano speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"C86 Classic","review":"A welcome release featuring many of the band's ep tracks only available on vinyl or on the long deleted and impossible to find Lazy 86-88 album. The first cd collects all the early single releases when the band was at they're best. Each track is a three minute burst of pop heaven. The second cd features the majority of their major label material from the hit single 'crash' to their final baggy material (which never really suited their style). A great compilation that's been well thought out and put together."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book sent me to Ireland","review":"This is the most thoughtfully laid out book of needlework I have ever seen--a friend and I wrestled for the only copy at a bookshop when it was between printings! Both the photos of Ireland and of the needlework \\"at home\\" are glorious. I've done a few of the designs and they've turned out wonderfully--my only caveat is that the graph colors can be difficult to distinguish, as is often the case with needlepoint charts, particularly British ones. Also, Appleton yarns can be hard to find in the U.S., but in these days of the internet, who cares?

The camo is only on one side of the lanyard. It looks terrible.

It seams like this and all the trio cds have a different feel to them which is rare this day when so many songs sound exactly the same with boring lyrics that are [uninteresting]. This cd is exactly the opposite! The lyrics are the best lryics I have ever seen recently. Each song has even it's own feel.

I got this the day it came out and even got to go to an instore, acoustic show of their's the day it came out. The show was amazing, but when I put in the CD when I got home, I was disapointed. The first song really stands out from the others because its the only one that has a different riff than the others. All the songs on this disc sound exactly the same. Its very repetitive.

Absolutely excellent. A long-time fan, I cannot praise his work enough. None of the characters are ones who appear in later books, but those familiar with Burke will recognise traits and types. I was amazed to read that Burke had such difficulty in finding a publisher for this book originally.

The beautiful Montana sceneryis described in terms so rich as to defy human experience.

We arrive to endless cigarettes, Camels, Lucky Strikes, roll yer own and pot. This is mostly accompanied by many six packs of beer and booze of various brands. The stench of unwashed bodies and the nasty odors of jails prevails. Tiresome adjectives and adverbial phrases, which were interesting the first ten novels, are now old. You'd think an English professor could pick up some new ones from his students. Who cares about any of these shiftless characters.I, for one, am putting down this book and taking a bath.This not one of Burke's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"masculine loneliness","review":"Yes, it is about gangsters. But to any Continental old enough to have seen this movie first in a small suburban movie theater full of smoke (when the basic idea was 'I will grow up and do this kind of things'), then to have seen it again in late night showings on a black-and-white TV (when it was already slightly fading away, towards nostalgia), and finally in poor VHS and in the admirable Criterion edition, it will be mostly about growing old, and experiencing that specific form of loneliness that is one of the glories of old males. Eating a leftover terrine of foie gras with a baguette in the company of an old friend may be more quintessential to spirit of this movie than any crime scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Knew?","review":"I fell in love with this one the moment I heard it.

It was a sensational novel with a family of dolls who reside in a little girl's doll house. They go searching for their Auntie Sara throught the house, because about 100 years ago she went missing. Soon,a new doll family moves in and helps them search and become their friends. I believe this book is a great book for children grades3-5."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"I love this book because now that I've read the book, I believe that my stuffed animals are alive. The author really puts everything into place so that it makes sense about the dolls being alive. First, if you want to be a doll that's alive, you have to say the doll code of honor. If you're a doll that's alive, you can get in doll state (which means you have to be still in the place that you were in for 24 hours), but you can only get in doll state if a human sees you walking around. Permanent doll state means you're still forever. This is a wonderful book, and if you don't believe me, then you should just see me read it! It took me about three days to read it and it's about 256 pages. I am 8 years old. I think my 6-year-old sister might like it, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Doll People","review":"I enjoyed The Doll People because the characters are well described. Their dresses are frayed and their skin is a bit grayer. The book grabs your attention so that you can't put it down because of the things that Godwin and Martin have the characters do.

Not surprisingly, as in Frances Hodgson Burnett's other stories, the main character, a boy, is noted for his resourcefulness and courage in spite of poverty and numerous obstacles. The story draws one in so that one wishes Samavia were an actual country one could visit rather than an imaginary Balkan state like Zenda. A kingdom is the sum of its subjects, and judging by the boy, his father, and their friends, Samavia is well worth fighting for. For a book which promotes patriotism and bravery try The Lost Prince of Samavia, a classic example of a Balkan adventure in the spirit of The Prisoner of Zenda."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Candy","review":"I've only owned a couple of pairs of binoculars so don't have a ton of experience with different models. But I can't imagine it getting much better than these for general use. First off, they are very clear and bright and deliver a very crisp image, even with IS turned off. But at 10x there is noticeable shaking in the image. But then... turn on the IS and it just dampens everything beautifully. Even more detail is revealed and it kind of takes my breath away every time I use them. While this initial \\"wow\\" factor will dissipate over time, I can't imagine I'll regret purchasing these ever. They are that good.I agree with others that have complained about the lens caps. But the caps actually work pretty well now that I've installed some 52mm B+W UV filters. The caps fit pretty snuggly onto the filters.

The new Canon binocs are like having bionic eyes! I not only see distant birds that I never would have seen otherwise, but can actually watch my trolling baits far behind the boat and see how they are running. My Cayman friends all went bonkers when I let them try these beauties out. I am thrilled with this product and getting rid of my treasured Zeiss binocs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"After reading all the other reviews when looking for IS binoculars I decided on these because of the glass, the weight and the field of view. Having now bought a pair I can say they are excellent. Easy to handle, superb optics and the IS function works extremely well. Hand held images look as though I have the binoculars on a tripod - very stable indeed. I would however echo some other comments on the downside - the lens caps at both ends don't fit well at all. The eye piece caps fall off when turned upside down, and the objective lens caps whilst they do stay in place, just, are very fiddly to fit on correctly. I'm buying some skylight filters to protect the lens just in case. That said, an excellent product, and if Canon can solve the lens cap issue for future releases then I'd say these are flawless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and compelling","review":"Bought this while waiting on the release of SMiLE.

Any work by Palmer is worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humor for those easily amused","review":"I'm driven to write a short negative review by the acclaim this series of books seems to generate. I suppose I'm alone in thinking that in reading a history of philosophy you should aim for unique perspective, erudition, or outlandish insult. I don't think this series of introductions fulfills any of these roles. While finding a general consensus in the rating of philosophical systems is a pipedream not worth pursuing, there are so many alternative histories worth perusing, that I would advise anyone with a modicum of lively interest in the subject to avoid these books. Even if your looking for the comic book variety of \\"how to\\" manuals, there are better to find.

Have updated to the latest 2.40 firmware - no help."},{"rating":"1","title":"DLink, you let me down :(","review":"I was a die-hard DLink fan. Not any more. In my experience, this router worked AWESOME for 5 months. Then it locked up. Hmm, I made no changes to the config, it has been kept cool, dry and away from the rest of the world, that is odd. Oh well, I guess its time for a reboot. BAM! Next day it locks up again, 4 connection lights lit solid, no status or 11a,g lights. It was at this point that I looked at bulletins and reviews for this product in closer detail, and realized that I am experiencing a VERY common problem. At this point I must unplug and replug the router every time I use the internet. I flashed the bios and turned off every possible feature. THIS ROUTER BLOWS. DLink, you should be ashamed. Please don't buy this router until you read a few bulletins and reviews. I'm lucky to have written this review between lockups."},{"rating":"1","title":"You might want to look at something else","review":"I have had this unit for about 3 months now. Every so often it locks up (all the lights freeze) and it takes a power cycle to get it working again. One time if froze up and I had to reset back to factory default configuration. Fortunately I had save the configuration a day or two earlier and was able to reload it.Along with the occasional freezing I have noticed internet access problems which I had assumed were with Comcast. I have now discovered that the router quits passing data for about 3-5 seconds every minute or so when it's under load. It doesn't loose the wireless connection, but the data stream stops for several seconds. It appears to be long enough to drop instant messaging connections and file sharing connections."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the last D-Link product I will ever buy","review":"Over the course of several calls and emails with D-Link support, I was required to go to extraordinary lengths to prove to them that the problems I was experiencing weren't imaginary. They explained that as a \\"home\\" router, it was perfectly normal to have to reboot the router every day or two. Finally, they replaced the router, but that didn't solve the problem (I'm convinced this product is fundamentally defective). Then, they charged my credit card $50 because I didn't send back their $1 Ethernet cable. D-Link is a horrible company that needs to go out of business, and I will not spend another dollar with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just as bad as every one said","review":"Great features. No customer support, constant rebooting, endless reconfiguring. After several weeks of useless tech support denying the problems with literal flat out lies, I found an abundance of info on the shortcomings of this device. I install networks and have no lack of ability in this area but the fact is this cheep router cost me a lot of wasted time and money. Now it sits on the shelf in my closet and I use my old linksys. PS if you must use this router and the reboots/drops are killing you turn off ALL the extended features and limit it to A, B, or G, that will help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for the first few months","review":"But eventually I started having nothing but problems with it. It would lock up and I find myself having to get up back and forth unplugging the thing and plugging it back it. Sometimes it would be okay, while on other days I would be up ever 5 minutes unplugging and replugging.Dlink has since discontinued the product altogether, was told that it offers that dual band capability and thats why it's having these problems. They ended up replacing the product with a different mondel after weeks of trouble shooting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of warranty","review":"I just received my dead DI-784 back from D-Link service.

I had the same issue reported by others with the router locking up after a few minutes (with all the status lights staying on). Customer service was not helpful. I upgraded the firmware, and finally figured out that if I disable the 802.11-a antenna (which i'm no longer using), the router lock-ups went away.So, if you only need it to work with either an 802.11-a or g network, it'll probably work. However, I will not buy D-Link products anymore; they couldn't even figure this bug out, and they designed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Media Center and Xbox 360","review":"I wasn't pleased with my previous router's performance (D-Link DI-624 rev C), so I did some research and picked up a new one. I purchased the D-Link DI-784 dual link A/G router and am happy to say that it works substantially better. I use the 360 as a media center and for gaming. If you set up the 360 to use the 802.11A connection, things have been, at least for me, substantially better. Before I had the occasional disconnect when listening to music and the occasional slow down with streaming HD-TV. With this model, no issues at all. Give it a shot if you have any performance issues with your current router. No complaints here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for 3-4 months","review":"Worked fine for several months, had a few hang ups here and there but nothing I didn't expect from a router.After 3-4 months it started cutting out all the time, I would have to unplug it and wait a minute and then plug it back in, which only made it work for 10-20 minutes until it cut out again. Seems like this model is defective as a lot of other people have experience the same problem. I would pass on this router."},{"rating":"1","title":"Locks up frequently","review":"My intention was to use the router with the Media center extender. But the router frequently locks up.

Steer clear of this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Probable Heat Issue - Agree with other users","review":"I have had the exact same problem others describe. It started off with a lock-up maybe once every few days, and then became progressively more frequent, until recently when it was locking up every 15-30 minutes.As a last ditch effort, I removed the outer case from the unit so it is sitting with circuit board exposed - have not had a lock-up for 48 hours. That suggests to me a high sensitivity to heat.I decided to replace it rather than wait for it to progress any further. D-Link should probably offer something to users for such a seemingly frequent problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"D-Link blew it on this one","review":"I purchased the D-Link DI-784 in June, 2005. It worked fine for about 6 months. Occasionally (about once a month), it locked up with all of the lights on solid, and I needed to reboot the device. It would work fine after rebooting for about another month. After about 6 months, the lock-ups would occur more frequently. Finally, today, it stopped altogether. All of the lights were on solid, and no amount of rebooting, powering off/on, etc., would make it work again.I'm very disappointed in the product. My expectations for its reliability were much higher. Every time a new version of the firmware was published by D-Link, I would install it on the DI-784. It didn't seem to make any difference.Fortunately, I had an old Linksys wireless router that I could re-install to get back onto the Net. I'm going to get a new wireless router, and it won't be from D-Link."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very fast but drops me often","review":"This was easy to install.

From his days in the no wave skronk band DNA through his leadership of Ambitious Lovers, Lindsay has always delighted in breaking convention, expanding genre until the term itself is meaningless. He's a true original, nowhere more evident than on his masterful Mundo Civilizado, with a remake of \\"Erotic City\\" as indelible and odd as Prince's original. Though still a master craftsman, on Invoke you can hear Lindsay repeating himself. There isn't a time during these 12 tracks when you don't think: he's done this better before. Yet there are pleasures. The title track is a true invocation - the resurrection, in images, of a vanished lover. And \\"Beija-me\\", the simplest number here, is a breezy kiss worthy of Gilberto Gil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Da Buzz was one of the first dance pop groups to make it main stream.

Other tracks made me sick and I don't want to listen to them for the 2nd time.So here are my advices: 1) If you are a die-hard Da Buzz fan that loves every Da Buzz song no matter how bad they sound, by all means get this CD. 2) If you are like me, only like the single \\"let me love you\\", go buy that CD single, or buy some dance party CDs that has that song in it, believe me, those kind of CD are better this CD.

The examples are horribly confusing.For each sample app the author just used a naming scheme of chapter number and then he adds an incrementing number at the end of the chapter name to get the class/file name.The index page would be ch04_01.jsp.

This is required reading for anyone who wants to join our ministry team, be they actor, musician, vocalist, stage crew or technical staff. It is broken up into easy to use chapters, with group discussion questions at the end of each chapter, as well as \\"action points\\". These discussion questions have been proven to be an invaluable tool in evaluating attitudes, expectations and spiritual readiness for ministry. They also give the leader an opportunity to expand on their vision for ministry. This study primarily focuses on servanthood, having a right view and appreciation of your God given gifts and talents, and being a team player and not always having to be \\"in the spotlight\\".

Most of this material can be found on any book about discipleship. It wasn't specific enough about artistic issues.

It is the first book I've seen that addresses issues that face those of us who are in some form of \\"performance\\" ministry. It is put together in a way that it very conducive to group study. Each chapter begins with a situation that probably every Minister of Music has faced, and then the character issues that cause these situations are explored, with an emphasis on the appropriate scriptural response. Pride, envy, false humility, and the need for deep, daily communication with God are some of the topics discussed.

I'm eighteen and I run circles around most of the designers featured in this book... that's not a good sign. The best design in this book is actually the cover, which can be very decieving... most of the content is flatly uncreative, with all the dullness of a dentist's waiting room. It is, however a good example of what not to do in brochure design: noted mistakes include sloppy collaging (not intentionally sloppy), terrible visual appeal, and the work of designers who went filter-happy in Photoshop (the Emboss filter, no less.)

I am a huge RATM fan and despite the fact that Chris Cornell dragged them down I enjoyed Audioslave as well. But this is unlistenable. The vocals are terrible. The quality is on par with some struggling musician who records himself singing in his bedroom or something. I actually laughed out loud during \\"Flesh Shapes the Day\\". The music is boring at best. All that happens is the strumming of minor chords and the same old blues progressions. There is absolutely nothing new or innovative about it. The only saving grace to the whole thing is that the lyrics have a meaning behind them ... but this is nowhere near enough to save the album. If someone played this for me and I didn't know it was Tom Morello I would absolutely trash it. It sounds like any random musician from someone's hometown who just recorded something on his 4-track.

I was very disappointed in the sound and style of the album. It seems that Morrello went 180 degrees from what made him such a successful guitarist. Mainly, the energy and eclectic sounds that he cannot (or will not) replicate with an acoustic guitar. The vocals are poor and the lyrics only show that Morrello is uncomfortable outgrowing his \\"angry young man\\" persona. It's difficult to listen to a multi-millionaire artist sing about injustice...But the oddest thing about this album was that I had to keep checking to make sure my iPod hadn't switched to a crappy Springsteen album. The slow pace to most of the songs and the sorrowful voice that accompanies them made for a poor fit. All of the things that made RATM/Audioslave so fun to listen to are sorely missed on this offering.Caveat Emptor...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke?","review":"Is this a joke? This album is easily one of the worst I have ever heard. The lyrics are nothing short of embarassing. The vocals sound like a cross between Johnny Cash on a bad day and Bob Dylan (as the Nightwatchman seems to have trouble staying on key). The most suprising part about this album is the guitar work. It sucks. Morello is known for being one of the most innovative guitarists in the last ten years for his work in Audioslave and Rage Against The Machine. But in this album, he relies on basic chords and dated blues riffs. The only conclusion I can reach from this album is that Morello must not have any friends.

I do like the style, but a lot of the riffs just felt... unoriginal or cliche to me. Not entirely sure how to describe it. And most people would agree his voice isn't exactly spectacular.On a somewhat unrelated note, I don't agree with Morello/Rage Against the Machine's political beliefs. I'd imagine people who think similarly might enjoy it more than I did, since the lyrics are an important part of the overall production of the album (arguably the most important, since Tom wrote the album to return to political activism).I don't know, give it a listen.

Thematically, it picks up where Rage Against The Machine left off, addressing issues like the xenophobic war on Latin American immigration and the 2nd Iraq War. Musically, it picks up where Against Me left off (when they decided to go make awful hipster rock - see \\"New Wave\\").Morello's clear baritone is a refreshing change from the high tenor whine of most male singer-songwriters. The sparse instrumentation lets you focus on the words and message, as befits a political rock album.It only loses a star because I wish there were a few more fast songs, like \\"House Gone Up In Flames\\" and \\"The Road I Must Travel\\" and \\"Union Songs\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty weak","review":"Look I'm not going to smash his guitar playing, it's acoustic and it's meant to be meaningful protest music (not saying you can't have both, but sometimes it's worth the sacrifice). Yeah it's not Rage, but you should have known that when you read \\"Night Watchman\\". Now for the attack. The lyrics are poor. I really don't feel like he put a whole lot of work into them. It seems like he's trying harder to rhyme the next word then to add meaning or flow to the song. He also seems like he's trying too hard when he sings. It's my personal opinion, but I suggest borrowing this CD or listening to a few tracks before just picking this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the Whammy pedal Tom.......","review":"While the concept behind The Nightwatchman certainly has merit, the execution of this album is not up to the same standard. As a fan of Rage Against the Machine, I was interested to see how this would compare. The guitar playing is mediocre, and the vocals are ridiculous. Tom's singing sounds affected and forced. While Zach de la Rocha spit his venom on the Rage albums, Tom is clearly making a profound effort to whisper his. His voice actually doesn't sound that bad when he's singing naturally, it's the amateurish attempt to channel 'Nebraska'-era Springsteen that's laughable. Overall, this was a real disappointment. This pales in comparison with 'Nebraska', 'Ghost of Tom Joad', or any protest music by Neil Young."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This album was extremely well hyped, and turned out to be a huge let down. If you loved Rage Against the Machine, then you will probably hate this album. Everything that you have come to love about his guitar playing with Rage is completely missing on this accoustic album. If you like Leonard Cohen then buy this album. If you don't then don't bother. Don't base your purchase upon Rage Against the Machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better than I expected!","review":"I am not (yet at least) a fan of Rage Against the Machine. I am definitely a new fan of Tom Morello. No, he does not have a naturally great voice, but it suits the songs on this CD quite well. It reminds me of something along the lines which Bruce Springsteen might do as a solo project. Damn, I had the chance to see Tom Morello perform this music in SF a couple of years. He was headlining and I didn't know who he was and the opening act was Ike Reilly, who is one of my favorite artists. \\"The Road I Must Travel\\" is currently my favorite cut on this CD. If you're a RATM fan and you're looking to get blown away by Morello's guitar work, this CD will likely be a huge disappointment to you. On the other hand, if you're a fan of great socially progressive folk music, I highly suggest that you give this CD a listen to. What is great is, I now have another artist to look forward to seeing and hearing live. Thanks Tom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Revolution Will Not Be Amplified","review":"This is the best album I've bought in a long while! The Nightwatchman wields a nylon acoustic guitar with the same power and ferocity he has exhibited with his \\"Soul Power\\" electric. His vocals are great--a low, mournful baritone that doesn't hide it's Johnny Cash influence. Lyrically, the songs demand the listener pay attention.Stand out tracks include \\"The Road I Must Travel\\", \\"Battle Hymns\\", and \\"California's Dark\\". But they are all just great. If you like early Bob Dylan or Bruce Springsteen's acoustic work, this album will certainly find a place in your CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great inspiring album with an awesome message","review":"I truly loved this album. Definitely not what you'd expect musically from Tom (I love Rage and Audioslave-not a folk fan), but what better vehicle than folk music to clearly convey Tom's awesome message of social justice. The songs' lyrics are truly inspiring and the guitar work, although simple, is very memorable/catchy. Every song touched me with its thoughtful and passionate message. Who knew Tom had such a cool voice? Perfect for the genre and I'm certainly happy he decided to take a chance and make this record knowing well it isn't going to be a huge popular hit. We definitely need more songs like this in our troubled times. Hopefully the kiddies listen up and don't pass on this looking solely for some hard rock riffs. Long live Rage Against the Machine!!!

There was very little combat to speak of until one big mission over the Phillipines in 1944. I was expecting some more barge hunting, attacks on sea convoys and such.I've already read enough books on the Pacific war from a variety of campaigns to know about life during the island hopping campaigns and such. So, this book came as quite a disappointment.Not badly written, but not really a lot to sink one's teeth into."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting view","review":"This book does more than talk about flying in combat, it talks about the build up to war, life in the late 1930's in America and then the training process and the many accidents from young men showing off. His descriptions of combat are there, but not the strongest point.Given that there are few other books that describe combat in the A-20, this is a valuable book for that alone. I could ask the author a zillion more questions, but this was a pleasant easy read that brought back my father's stories of Pre-WW2 and gives you a feel for life in the front lines of combat/attack aircraft. Heavy on background but a little light on tactics, combat and technical aspects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a book you will appreciate if you are interested in attack aviation.","review":"A well written book from an A-20 pilot view. J.W.Rutter was replacement pilot send to 389th Sq, 312th BG, 5th AF in 1944 and sent home after 64 missions over New Guinea and Philipines in 1945 just before 312th BG was about to rearm to B-32 Heavy bombers. In the book you can find number of very good photos of camp, planes, crews and also from plane mounted rearfacing cameras. Also included are some detailed descriptions of A-20 piloting."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unexamined life","review":"The author has given us the shallowest of memoirs on his experiences as an Army Air Force pilot in the SW Pacific flying A-20G Havocs during the period July 1944-April 1945. There are lots of details about the aircraft but no sense of the man, his inner life or the emotional and physical price he paid in combat.Fifty-plus years on Rutter is as puzzled as he was in April 1945 when Doc Walsh, the group's doctor, grounded him and suggested that he request a transfer out of combat.The author seems incapable of the self-analysis, the self-awareness, that bring such depth and timeliness to works such as E.B.

That being said, I do enjoy her baked goods section. So, if you don't mind the vegetarian \\"meat,\\" you may like this book, but if you don't like it either, then you may want to go with her other cookbook, \\"the Soy of Cooking,\\" which tends to use more vegetables, temph and tofu rather than \\"meat.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"My almost 5 Year Old LOVES this book!","review":"It really helps the young inquiring mind learn about the moon.

While the sound isn't superb all the way through, it most definitely is worth the purchase price. Disc 1 is a 1991 show from Japan that features 3/4 of the original band in a fine post-reunion show, plus two 1970 BBC \\"in concert\\" recordings by the original line-up. The two BBC recordings are a little rough sounding, but with so few recordings available from that era it doesn't matter. Disc 2 features eight songs from a 1976 show and are a rare example of the brief period Wishbone Ash toured with a keyboard player. The rest of disc two is comprised of five tracks from the original line-up, recorded in 1973. Overall, another nice addition to anyone's collection.

I bought this book in a small bookstore in Grindelwald, Switzerland and then proceeded to enjoy a blissful couple of days sitting on the front balcony of the youth hostel, reading The White Spider, with the north face of the Eiger towering overhead. I would read from the book, and then gaze up to identify the exact routes and landmarks described in the text, which were clearly visible on the massive wall of rock before me. It remains one of the great youthful literary/adventure experiences of my life, and fires my imagination to this day.The White Spider of the title, for those who are curious, refers to a difficult network of ice-filled cracks and crevasses high on the face of the Eiger through which all the early routes passed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The White Spider","review":"I enjoyed the book and recommend it to all who enjoy the challenges of climbing. The historical account of climbing the north face of the Eiger is quite impressive. The author, having climbed this route, conveys a real sense of the terrain/conditions and the emotions associated with the seriousness of the situations. In the spirit of climbing a route, the author also includes a description of the route for aspiring ones at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"The White Spider by Heinrich Harrer","review":"Accurately portrays the time period of the 1930's. Explains about the crazy media who took these mountain climbers words out of context (or enticed them into saying certain things) to create a friction between the German/Austrian mountain climbers and the Swiss Alpine Guides, just to sell their story. Heinrich Harrer accurately tells about these wonderful mountain men and their supreme ablilities on all sides. Also a book I didn't want to put down. It really helps one to understand the time period they were living in and how innocent people can be pulled into unsuspecting situations. A super good read! He is a great author.

I am disappointed by that, but you can download that song and add it to your collection if you want to. I like 80s music since I grew up in the 80s, so I like this soundtrack.

They talk about how those ideas and longings were pierced by the Arrows of lifem and on from there. John and Brent remind us that God is a God who pursues us. He is the one who desires to woo our hearts.An eye opening book that will take your breath away. It's easy to relate and dive into the book that has stories and experiences that both authors offer in the book. It's very well written, and one that you will not want to put down. Any true Christian will truly enjoy and cherish this book, and will no doubt cherish and enjoy a closer walk with God- the desire of their true hearts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unequaled","review":"As the budding rose unfolds in the warmth of a summer sun, so does the heart of truth reveal itself in the pages of this book: and its fragrance is unequaled in the gardens of our fallen lives.Surely the father of lies cowers in fear at such a powerful revelation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book!","review":"I bought this book, originally, to use as background research for a sermon series I was planning. I liked it so much that I suggested it to the teacher of our adult Sunday school class for their next lesson series. She loved it, pitched it to the class, and we are beginning our study of it on Easter Sunday. I highly recommend this book to you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummmm......","review":"Perhaps it was a mistake for me to read both \\"Wild at Heart\\" and \\"Captivating\\" first... This one felt shallow to me compared to those later two. I'm not sure how to explain it, but it just didn't do anything for me. I stuck it out halfway through, then gave up. I tried picking it back up later, thinking maybe I just had a bad day, but it was the same result. It just didn't feel as deep and personal as Eldredge's later works. Also, there wasn't as much scripture to back up statements. I don't even remember hardly any of the content. It didn't speak to me as strongly as \\"Captivating\\" or \\"Wild at Heart\\". It just felt more cold and distant. So, perhaps it would've been fine if I hadn't already read the best. =}"},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzz fustrating and BORING","review":"I read this; or I should say, started this book many times in a small group at church. I can in a week late and had to read two chapters. I love to read; and have excellent skills. I was bored to tear by this book; despite my craveing to get closer to God. Everyone I talked to in our group founf the book dry, boreing, dull and hard to follow none of us realted to it. My group (all the small groups in the church were useing it) made up of graduate students in Ministry studies and young career women gave up on the book as a goup decision. We felt we weeren't being fed, that no matter how hard we struggle alone and as a group we were not finding the gold others saw in the book. I have tried a number of time; based on reviews, and can't get into it, much less though it. zzzzzzzzz"},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my life!","review":"This book has absolutely changed my life. It is the first Christian book I have been able to fully relate to. I have allowed the \\"Arrows\\" of my life to turn me into a skeptical, pessmistic person with the belief that God is basically the big disciplinarian in the sky. This is the first book that has said that my feelings are natural and has not dismissed them. Instead it has helped me look at the various individual threads of my past and how they have woven the current fabric of my life. But most importantly, the book has used those revelations as a starting point and outlines the path to healing and transforming my view of God to one of a loving Father and passionate bridegroom. I'm telling everyone I know about this book and the workbook. The workbook is a crucial component to getting the most out of the book. It's a lot of work, but it's worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Book","review":"I received my copy recently, and have begun thumbing through it. Despite the time the authors spent in Japan and the support of the Japan Foundation, the book is immediately disappointing. Beginning with describing the color of takuan as \\"vile\\", I quickly discovered a variety of errors in the book. For example, the authors misidentified what a hot water kettle sits on in a tea ceremony. The iron implement which supports the kettle is properly called a godoku or gotoku. The kettle sits within either a ro (sunken hearth) or furo (portable hearth)."},{"rating":"2","title":"lord i need your strenght","review":"Very powerful singer, go buy it . A rare voice to find .He compared to Rev Clay Evans.OLD SCHOOL GOSPEL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great corded headset","review":"I love this headset. It holds to my ear better than most, it comes with couple different sizes of ear gel to aid that, it has a really well placed answer/end button on the boom, no searching the cord for it. The Cord doesn't get tangled up too badly. The sound quality is Great! Best of all, you can get them for $5!I tried out a handful of headsets before I got attached to this one, and this one simply has superior sound quality from a headset. I can understand everyone and they understand me much better than any other earpiece I've tested.Now, in my experience, its durability leaves something to be desired, though I'm not sure exactly what the benchmark for that should be. I will also say I'm extremely hard on these things. Nonetheless, when you can get them for $5 a pop on Amazon, I can stand to not cry over durability too much. As much as I abuse these, I probably buy 3-4 a year, but for the comfort, sound quality, and good design I get one of these every time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is cheap for a reason...","review":"I was excited when i first bought this as i cannot afford expensive blue tooth technology but it is cheap for a reason. lots of background noise when on phone calls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward, Doesn't Fit Well, & Was Not as Described","review":"I went 'round & 'round with this seller trying to get him to fess up to the fact that it was not as described. It was $3.90, so I cared more about the principle than the product, which was terrible--completely useless. It's awkward, doesn't fit will, & definitely can't be put on quickly to answer the phone--when you finally do get it on it's very uncomfortable, & doesn't stay on. I needed it for work, so it was completely unacceptable.The seller also harassed me about leaving a negative review. Amazon went WAY out of their way to make it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"The article was damaged","review":"buy this headset and when I received the item came damaged, wrote to customer service and received no response. the headset had a serious injury on the handset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same - great til it breaks","review":"I had the same issue as someone else. I loved it til it started shorting (and shocking me) and then it just went dead. I guess for $3, you can buy them in bulk...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it breaks","review":"I'm on my second one and the same thing just happened. The earpiece is great when it's working, but after about a year, just like my first one, there is a short or something as it goes in and out at first and now can't even hear anything through it(I have tested other earpieces, so I know it's not the phone). Just a heads up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This book is motivating, inspiring, and supportive. After smoking heavily for over twenty years, I managed to quit simply with this one book. It has been four years now without cigarettes, and I occasionally refer back to it for its uplifting thoughts and ideas and am able to apply them to other problem areas. I recommend it highly to anyone who is serious about wanting to quit smoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movies ever!","review":"These are two movies, which were apparently filmed very, very early in the featured artists careers and they are not the main characters. Extremely low budget--poor acting of \\"main characters\\" and poor film quality. I bought my copy from Amazon Marketplace because it was less money. The movie is definitely not worth more than a movie from the $1.00 bin at a discount store. In fact, it is a waste of time to purchase out of curiosity. I wish I could give you the storyline; however, my copy did not even start at the beginning, but 10 minutes into the movie. It was done so poorly, I could not sit through it. Whatever roles the kung fu kings played, I missed it. Horrible, horrible, horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"average","review":"i heard alot of hype about this disc.but it is by no means a 2nd coming of Sketches OF SPAIN.Miles has moments but it's not on par with Miles's better soundtracks such as Jack Johnson.Marcus Miller's work hasn't dated well with Miles.he is a very Talented Bass Player Writer,Arranger,Producer&Musician but he adds nothing to Miles for me.he ain't no Gil Evans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I am very disappointed in this copy of the movie. One of my favorites, but it was defective and I had to return it. I am STILL waiting for my refund!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great framing nail gun","review":"I've run over 20,000 nail through my newest gun.Runs great, no jams, ( sounds like some people with jams may not have a proper air supply)no problem getting nails, weight is no problem.Shouldn't be building if it feels heavy.can work it hard,it will take it.the price is right.I just ordered another"},{"rating":"2","title":"This one will bring you home","review":"I've used this nailer on several framing projects and have not been disapointed. It's compact design allows easy access to most tight places. Coil load averages about 300 nails so I spend more time shooting than loading. Loading is easy and rarely have had a jam. It's a little heavier due to the coil load but the advantages out weigh the weight. Can be set up for contact nailing which speeds things along. Nailer has crowned head that can grab wood for toe nailing. At 100 psi this nailer drives the nails with about 1/8\\" countersink. You can find coils at most hardware retailers. Nails are reasonable priced. Great product. Reliable and durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Hitachi","review":"** See my review of the N89C as wellI bought a N80 and it would not drive a 3\\" or a 3 1/4\\" galv. spiral nail into Douglas Fir. After sending the gun in to see what was wrong with it. It was send back with nothing wrong. I took the gun, the nails, and the wood to the Bostitch distributor. They could not get it to drive the nails. Even the new one they pulled off the shelf did not do it. They gave me a N89. The depth adjustment on the N89 is nice and it has never jambed. Changing nail sizes is much easier then the N80.Both the N80 and the N89 double fire easily. I have listen to nails land 50-60ft away on the street.The crew framing my house uses 4 Hitachi NV83 guns. Thees guns are more balanced, drive 3 1/4\\" nails no problem, and I have not had a double fire yet. The Hitachi guns run 3-6 coils of nails a day 6 days a week in the mud and sawdust. If I ever wear my N89 out I'll be spending the extra $$$ on the Hitachi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greate Gun - but","review":"The gun was everything I needed. Shoots a wide verity of nails from 1 1/2\\" to 3 3/4\\", therefore it can do many tasks.The SEQ6 Sequential Trip Conversion Trigger Assembly was received broken, but I did not need this item for my project.I would recommend that for those in the need of a nail to take a look at this gun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Obsolete?","review":"I couldn't find nails for this gun in my area. 2\\" nails could be ordered for it but cost three times as much as it does for real siding nailers.

It is big and heavy. I could only special order nails which were thicker then regular siding nails and cost about three times as much. Home depot, Lowes, and Amazon do not carry siding nails for it. I couldn't even get framing nails for it in my area. Although Amazon carries two types of framing nails. It is a good gun to build crates as long as you can find nails for it. It is ok for framing. But, framers use stick nailers."},{"rating":"2","title":"keeps on driving","review":"this is the second N80 i have purchased. the last one was 9 years old before retiring and she didn't go quietly. i have used senco and paslode stick framers in the past but instead of reaching to reload i just seem to reach for the bostich. a huge bonus is that it fits everywhere a stick nailer won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bostitch N80CB","review":"I purchased a Bostitch N80CB coil nailer from a Lowe's HomeImprovement store in Charleston West Virginia on the 29th ofSeptember 2001.

The father who notices that his child doesn't like getting up in the morning to do chores gives his son the gift of doing them for him. No secrets wrapped in bright paper, no consumerism -- just a simple gift given from the heart. This is a wonderful book to share with your children at the holidays; make it a tradition they will always remember and set aside special times to read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Day in the Morning","review":"The book \\"Christmas Day in the Morning\\" itself is in excellent condition. I think the seller could easily have said that the cover had two major torn places in it which distracted from the overall condition of the book. The story line of the book is an excellent choice for individuals to read to children of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"Does not disappoint. I have a 2 yr. old and 4 yr. old and they enjoyed the story and illustrations. It'll mean more to them as they get older. Helps them understand the farm life of their grandparents.

I only \\"discovered\\" the book a few years ago. It's now my favorite Christmas story. I must say however, one of the big negatives is that I must be allergic to the book because my eyes get watery every time I read it. Buy it for yourself and then buy it as a gift to give. The message reminds us of the true meaning of Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This was a surprise book for my husband for Christmas.

The face is awesome, everything is so viewable you can see it under any circumstance. Has a great array of features which are easily learned. The compass feature as far as I can tell is quite accurate, even as I haven't calibrated it yet. It is definetly a more than worthy purchase for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"I read this book in about a week. It is an excellent bridge between Black and White. I was sitting in the lunch room reading and the book revealed a plot twist that I expected... but I exclaimed out loud when the other twist hit and then they kept coming. It ended leaving you wanting more and I jumped on the third book of the series! This is a MUST READ!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wild Success!","review":"\\"Black\\" was an appetizer. Pleasing, but not entirely satisfying, it lacked a certain richness. Meant to whet our appetites, it was preparing us for something greater.\\"Red\\" is the meal. Ted Dekker expands upon his concepts and worlds, entertaining us, spinning a great story, and serving up substance with style. The dream-like world of Thomas Hunter takes on weight--it becomes more real. In the \\"real\\" world, the spreading virus and its global threat become parallels for the actual battle playing out on another plane. A spiritual plane. A plane with very real consequences.As in the first book, we don't get much inner character conflict or change. For me, this can lead to disappointment. But Dekker aims for a larger, symbolic conflict--the struggle of the human soul between darkness and light, between death and life. In this, he succeeds wildly.I've had my appetizer and my entree...Now I'm waiting for dessert!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is a kicker - for those that like fantasy and adventure - this delivers both with a top note allegory and a rich storyline. Can't wait to see how \\"White\\" with tie it all together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dekker did it again.","review":"This is a wonderful book from an awesome writer. I can't say that Dekker appeals to everyone, but he is a great writer with a way with words. This is a captivating story. Caution, if you start the trilogy, you will not be able to put it down till the end. Then it leaves you wanting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Easy Peel","review":"These labels were supposed to be easy peel. However when used to label bottles, they stick as tightly as any other label and are NOT easy peel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost, but not quite entirely useless","review":"I've had this book since the week it came out and I've never used anything from it. I offered my players a chance to vote on using the critical hit system in here, and they were overwhelmingly against it. Their main complaint was that if they were using it against monsters, then monsters would be using it against them, and it was too easy to die on dumb luck.Perhaps it does make combat more realistic, but when a single swing of a sword involves 6 dice rolls and takes about 10 minutes to consult all the right tables and figure out all the modifiers and effects, I think you're doing something wrong. But, hey, maybe some people like that.The monster tactics section is more useful, and if a DM uses it properly, he allows his monsters to become more than a ball of hit points that the characters have to reduce."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],M={key:0},N={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(O,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-ab50bdcb"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/38.md","filePath":"sponsor/38.md"}'),j={name:"sponsor/38.md"},G=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
