This Black % Decker makes JUNK."},{"rating":"1","title":"The one I bought is junk","review":"It takes less than 5 minutes to empty the spool... it has a 'sensor' that tells it to spit out string.I bought it since it was the most expensive corded electric in the store (THD)... and it was still cheap.It was never an issue to bounce the spool on the ground like the old ones worked... but they went and 'fixed' it anyway...Gas powered ones that work well enough, and more expensive than a push mower, so I'm off to look at garage sales to get an old one that has not been over-engineered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't count on it to feed string","review":"I recently bought this model after my previous B&D trimmer gave up the ghost. Although the previous model had occasionally failed to feed string automatically, by and large, it had worked quite well. Not so with the new model. Two strings mean less capacity and THEY DO NOT FEED. Not automatically, not reliably, mostly not at all. Check out the reviews anywhere else for ANY of the current auto feed models, they just don't work. You have no recourse but to open up the spool and feed it out by hand every time it gets too short to use. I went with the only 'bump' model left on the market and CR's second top choice. (They got it way wrong with the B&D.) Save time, try another brand, this one is not worth the money. How the mighty have fallen; it's really sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating . . . or infuriating","review":"When it was working well it was OK. But just OK. What drove me nuts was the fact that to replace the string you have to buy an entire spool designed just for this model, which costs much more than simply buying the string. Maybe that's convenient for some, but it's expensive. I had thought that would be no problem; I'll just buy cheap string and wind it on to the old spool myself, how hard can that be? Well, somehow they were able to design this so that adding the string yourself so that it will work is impossible, which can't have been an accident. Clever, those B&D; designers, but it's cost them at least one customer for life.Eventually the trigger switch went bad so that it wouldn't run at all. That actually was a relief, since it meant I could finally throw the turkey out. I got a cheaper, lighter, non-B&D; model that works fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Black and Decker admitted this stunk","review":"I bought the product, took it home and every time I went to use it, the cord top flew off. When it broke and flew off, I called B&D; to complain and they admitted that this model wasn't functioning right. They sent me a new no-break top for the cord area, that promptly flew off. They replaced that one, too.I was able to use it two or three times - the cord top didn't come off, but the cord didn't auto-feed properly ever.Last summer I took it out and the engine died. I called up B&D; again and they said that they had recalled the model entirely, but that mine was too old.B&D; used to be a brand of quality, but this trimmer was fail from beginning to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic gear melted","review":"I purchased this grass hog 4 months ago. I've used it twice for light trimming and the third time I used it, the drive belt melted off the plastic motor gear which connects to the string wheel shaft gear (metal).

Unbelieveable design flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grass Hog","review":"I bought one afew days ago, first day all the line go out in cuestion of seconds, put another line and same. I went to the store for my money, no problem with that but they said is one of the worst equipment made by B&D ever!

If you want to waist money, try with machine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"This is the worse machine I have ever purchased. They do the double spool to use up string and make you buy more.

For the money I paid ($20 +tax, no shipping) it's a good deal. The Black&Decker replacement spool is quite expensive though. I had it for 8 months now and no problems at all. I just switched to \\"generic\\" line (7x cheaper) and it still works great. I do mostly edging but the lot is small; I'd say light \\"duty cycle\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect Item Pictured","review":"I owned the string trimmer pictured. After six seasons the trimmer wore out so I went to replace it based on the image. Unfortunately the GH600 I received is a CHEAPER quality plastic, no soft grips as shown and no lever lock to prevent cord disconnection. The shaft is also a silver color. The first time I used it, the auto feed stopped working and the cord disconnected several times. I've written to Amazon about the incorrect product image but the site was never updated.This item is another example of a company placing what used to be a good brand on an inferior product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent trimmer","review":"I have been using this trimmer for three years in keeping the tall grass on extremly rocking land cut short.

I had no problems untilI tried using it today. It advances line much to quickly I blew through 2 pre-wound spools. The line got jambed under the spool housing, I got the whole thing pulled apart and cleaned out some melted line in the works. I got it reassembled and try to go back to cutting old dead grass and the line fouls again.

Useless, and dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"black and decker review","review":"The black and decker grass hog has no potential in cutting grass or weeds.

The engineers should not allow a gap where grass can just wrap around it, what were they thinking?The plastic on the bottom broke with normal use, cheap plastic instead of a higher quality plastic.The cord holder doesn't hold the cord, the engineers went to extremes to design a overly big cord clamp that don't even work, it takes like two minutes just to put the cord in the lock and thread it through.Very disappointed. I have other Black and Decker products that work good but this one is a failure. You will be sorry if you buy this, over 50 people gave it only 1 star"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, stay away from this device","review":"I have had good luck with Black and Decker lawn products, but not this one. Had the GH600, never worked well. Tried the GH610, does not work well. The string simply does not advance. A 20 minute lawn job takes me 2 hours, I am constantly stopping and manually advancing the cord. B&D does not really do a good job of phone support or online support for this product - my strongest advice is to stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money.","review":"This product was a nightmare. Did not last one year. Released line at a violent pace that would break off and whip you in the leg. If it wasn't wasting line, it was jamming up every 2 minutes forcing you to stop and release it by hand. The excess line that was continuously released proved to be too much abuse for the guard and it snapped in two. I have never had a lawn care product fall apart so quickly. I will never purchase a Black & Decker trimmer again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Worth 1 Star!","review":"I purchased this electric trimmer since our gas powered one is just too heavy for me to use for any length of time. I used it the first day and had some troubles but discovered the spool of line that it came with was not wound correctly. I replaced the spool with a pre-wound spool that I had bought and it seemed to work okay. The second time I went to use it, I used it for about five minutes and it just died! Done..dead! It will be going back and you can believe I won't be buying another Black and Decker product. I wish that I had read all the complaints here before I purchased it. It would have saved me a huge headache! All the major components inside seemed to be made of plastic and melt under average use. Very poorly designed. This was a 2011 model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good value","review":"I've had two B&D trimmers. Both broke after about a year of relatively light use. I figured after the first one broke that I just had bad luck but I've now learned my lession.The automatic feed mechanism feeds the line far too fast. String is cheap (as long as you don't buy B&D's refills) but it is a bother to constantly stop cutting in order to put more string in.I wonder if B&D was trying to take the ink jet approach with this product: sell the product for relatively cheap and then sell the refills at a premium price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trimmer knife breaks.","review":"I've had the trimmer knife break off twice. The trimmer knife is used to automatically cut the string to the desired length. Without the knife, the trimmer cannot be used. The first time the knife broke off Home Depot reluctantly accepted the exchange. The second time I riveted a sheet of sharpened metal to where the knife used to be. I'm looking around for a better model. This model eats line like crazy, particularly the non-round kind, leaving pieces of trimmer line everywhere. On the plus side, it is light and easily adjusted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I am such a fan of Black and Decker and the grass hog. What ever happened to the quality control on this item? It arrived with a hub cap (keeps the spool in place) that would not seal. I called the company, and they mailed a replacement promptly. Then I used it to trim about 20 feet along the fence and 2 feet on the edge of the sidewalk. The thing then died completely. When I plug it in, it's like there is no electricity going to the engine. This time, Black and Decker told me to rebox it and send it back to Amazon; Amazon says to see the manufacturer for warrantee repairs. I live in the Dallas metropolitan area, but the nearest official repair shop is 30 miles away and is only open Monday-Friday 8-5. So I could take a half day of vacation, drive 60 miles, and see what happened. Instead, I'm going to cannibalize it for parts for my current old Grasshog (the engine still works!), throw this in the trash, and never buy another Black and Decker product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Automatic Line Feeder is a joke","review":"Bought this trimmer (though not at amazon) and thought the \\"no bumping required\\" automatic line feeder would be helpful. What a mistake. It makes sure there's always one inch of line available and that's about it. I hate to spend money on another one, but this is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"I purchased one of these from the local Home Depot, it went through the courtesy reel within the first hour, just long enough to trim and edge the front yard.the reel cover was extremely difficult to remove, once the dual reel was in and the wrestling match to reinstall the reel cover was over the trimmer proceeded to disgorge itself of the string within the first five feet or so, what didn't attempt to weld itself to the housing, spilled all over my back yard.This \\"trimmer\\" has found a new home at the local landfill, and is the last Black and Decker product that I will ever purchase"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad but NOT Good Either","review":"I am on my third Grass Hog and you'd think I am a real fan. I have number 3 only beause numbers 1 and 2 died soon after buying each. This one has not stopped working just some features like the bump thingy. I will throw this device away as soon as I either get another trimmer or this one dies dead. It, honestly, takes me twice as long to trim the yard by having to stop, undo the string holder, pull some string out, replace the holder and go at it. If the bump worked this would be a 4 rated machine. It can make it to 5 if someone at B&D comes up with a way to make a shaft long enough for folks over 5'7\\" tall. If you are 6'3\\" I will almost guarantee a sore back from leaning over while trimming."},{"rating":"1","title":"When it works its great","review":"When this works its like the Tony Hawk of weed eaters but I had a problem with the motor belt constantly slipping off. This means taking it apart (8-10 screws) and slipping it back on just to have it slip off again an hour later. Support was wonderful and when I got the new belt it did the same thing an hour later. Engineering needs to use capped gears and when I find a suitable work-around I will be using it again. Too bad one minor glitch sidelines a really great tool. Oh yeah, wear protective shoes, this thing throws lots of flesh tearing line at random."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duck when piece start flying","review":"I had high hopes for this unit. My biggest thing was getting the nylon twine extended quickly and this unit is better than most, but I wish the nylon was thicker. Maybe there is an after market spool that is thicker. HOWEVER, the first time I used it today the cheaply attached wire edge guard flew off and almost hit me in the face. This is a serious problem and a lawsuit is waiting to happen. I'm still not going to return it because the rest of it is fine and meets my needs. I just leave the wire edge off the unit. I can't believe the design team didn't spend a few extra cents and fix the wire to the unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grass Hog","review":"This is the best weed whacker I've ever owned.

It worked just fine until the 5 ft of sting ran out on the trimmer and it came time to replace the spool. I bought the replacement spool thinking that it would be a simple install as in other trimmers that I have used, but no such luck. There were no instructions that came with the packaging of the refills and so I consulted the owners manual and it might as well as have been in Greek because it was completely irrelevant to what I needed to do. Searches around the internet provide me with no information on how to do it either. In the end, I am going to just have to pull the weeds by hand.

True, his voice back then wasn't quite up to the same raspy power that he has found in his career these days, but it's fun to listen to. He sounds of course a lot like the early days of Aaron. The collection is a mixed bag of songs you wouldn't expect the hard rock lover to sing. The most amusing of course is his cover of Billy Joel's 'Uptown Girl,' in which Nick sings the lyrics \\"I bet she never had a backstreet guy.\\" It's a cute irony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fan item only","review":"It is hard to believe (sorry this has been edited by amazon for some reason :-) based on these fairly weak (vocally) sounding Karaoke style demos that Nick went on to better things. The vocals suffer from a lack of training as they seek the note each time. Smooth is not what comes to mind here. Ask yourself: would we be hearing these if he had not gone on to become famous?Really a memento for die hard Nick Carter fans.

I bought this because I hoped that maybe away from a five-voice setting, Nick would prove that he really deserved all the hype. This album in fact reinforces Nick's status as one of the worst sounding pop stars of all time. He may have a pretty face, but his whiny, off-key voice is exceedingly painful to listen too.

Full of incredible beats, hooks and samples, this album will have you hooked on the melodies and bass lines alone, but it is the lyrical output that makes this a great piece of art. The artists, several Anticon lyricists in addition to Atmosphere's Slug and DJ Mayonaisse, pool together a wealth of insight into matters of all sorts. Their poetic structure, peculiar use of meter, or disregard thereof,insane rhyme schemes and brilliant word play make this a truly beautiful work of underground hip-hop.

This is pure rap, no catchy hooks with R&B singers, no bling bling, no what what, none of that fake [stuff]. I also got the Anticon Presents CD, which I think is not as good as everyone is writing. I would give it about 3 stars since I do like at least 70% of the cd, its still a great cd don't get me wrong.

When O'Leary changes shape, there's a girlfriend for his new body, a jealous boyfriend, and a father ready to start the wedding. He changes shape again, and there's a new girlfriend, jealous boyfriend, father, etc. The writing for both situations is nearly identical. One of his temporary bodies belongs with a band of gypsies, and reading pages of dialog written in a cheesy French accent is guaranteed to give you a headache. O'Leary is supposed to be smart, but he does something stupid to get out of trouble, and when it doesn't work, keeps doing the same stupid thing over and over again.

Well, it's been over a month and it still looks as good as the day I applied it. My only complaint is that the color is snow white, which makes it noticeable on my porcelain white sink.

I was hoping the product would flow a little better than it did. The applicator was a little too long causing the brush hairs to curve against the bottom of the bottle instead if being straight. The curved brush in addition to the rather thick liquid made it difficult to apply a smooth finish. I'm attempting to smooth out the repair with 150 grit sand paper. I had to let it cure for a few days before sanding. It does set up hard. I'm still working to obtain a finished product. It looks like the repair will be good, but there is a color difference (shades of white) between the porcelin and the touch-up. I didn't expect a miracle, so I have to admit that I am satisfied.

Together, the two set up and execute a brilliant heist to separate the LEPrecon - an elite force of fairy commandos, much like the green berets - from their fairy gold. As the plot develops, questions are answered, but much is left unsolved, up until the very end.

It is not fantasy, it is not sci-fi, it is STUPID. This is more annoying than the 5th Harry Potter book!

One of them, Captain Holly Short, part of the fairy police, is sent above ground to recapture a troll that has escaped the underground. It seems this fits perfectly with Artemis's plan. Will he take over the world or will the yet unknown hero stop him?I would definitely recomend this to anyone who loves suspense and action.

You shouldn't miss this."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful!","review":"I found this book very suspencful and interesting. Athough to me it was a little hard to follow.

Over all I was very pleased with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not HP, but real good","review":"I thought that this book was very good. The author was telling the truth when he said, \\"die hard with fairies.\\" LOL It's got action, and the end is really surprising. Artemis is a cold hearted 12 year old that wants to take over the world. Kinda reminds you of Salem on Sabrina, no? Anyways, he captures fairy cop Holly Short in order to get the fairy technology to take over the world. Ransom is a ton of fairy gold. Her cop squad comes to rescue her, and with Foaly, Root, and the rest of the LepRecon Unit, they make this story believable. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Fowl","review":"Truly the best book I have read for entertainment value. It will appeal to adults even more than children because of its subtle writing. Artemis is a very complex little boy who is taking on adult responsibilities and doing very well. He uses his natural intelligence and hard, hard work studying the computer to regain the family fortunes. He wants us to think he is a tough, macho man, but his endearing childishness and true goodness and morality show through many times. He doesn't want to appear a wimp so he tries to disguise his goodness. If readers can't see through this, that's too bad for them. The actual writing is spare and appropriate. There is no horrible overwriting and reapeating and padding like in the last Harry Potter and I wouldn't compare it to that book at all. Read and enjoy for the wit, writing, excitement and excellent characters. This is from a high-school teacher who should know."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Human Macavity","review":"Artemis Fowl is a twelve year old genius. He is the latest in a long line of Fowls who have always managed to stay one step above the law, and has determined to return billionaire status to the family name, and restore the Fowl fortune with fairy gold, ransomed from the faries themselves. Readers of Harry Potter will find this slightly more down to earth, but no less enjoyable. Personally, I thought Artemis's criminal character a welcome relief from the rather heroic style of Harry Potter. Artemis Fowl is a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"I for one enjoyed seeing the antagonist get down off his white horse and just make some money. The plot is insidiously twisted and all of the characters are well developed(You would know this if you read past chaptewr two).

Harry Potter kept my son busy when he was 9 but by the time he turned 10 he had read them all twice and his teacher recommended the Alex Rider series--full of machine guns! So, thank goodness for Artemis Fowl, full of adventure, strategy, high tech gagetry, yes some-appropriate violence, but also very age appropriate humor. There is a dwarf who's main weapon is his backside...I won't elaborate. This keeps my son from whining for video games, and passes the \\"can I tell my friends about this book and still be cool\\" test. Four stars out of five only because J.K.

This book I enjoyed, but not nearly as much as Maximum ride, Percy Jackson and the Olympains, or really anything Rick Riordan and James Patterson wrote (I highly recommend the series stated above). The plotline was good, but for only one book. I read up to the second or third book, and I must admit, the plotline of the three books, all together, didn't fit. There wasn't too much good humor, and it wasn't witty, with the exception of mabye two statements. One minute Artemis was trying to capture Holly, a fairy, and the next he's trying to rescue something(I actually can't remember, but I know that's at least close) with her. Sorry if I confused you.Let me summarize. This book was a fail (to me) and the first book seemed liked the last. There wasn't much of a point to it either.

Why this is the weakest in the series, it is still a five-star book. Every character was well-developed, the plot was fast, and the humor was top-notch. There are so many memorable quotes, and scenes that even after the book was finished the scenes kept coming back.

I was also a little disappointed to find out that leprechauns are a myth (although I'm not still not sure I believe it, LOL). Overall, this was a fairly fast read and really draws the reader in. It definitely falls under the category of \\"fantasy,\\" so you need an open mind and a good imagination to read it.

This is a great read for people of all ages, especially for pre-teen, teens who haven't quite gotten into reading or absolutely love to read. It's a high paced fantasy adventure that will keep them enthralled and capture their imaginations, and yours as well. I will warn that there are some violent scenes and mild language, but no more than most books of this nature usually have.

I think it's going to be a fantastic series. High tech for \\"today's kids\\", yet some of the same concepts of the adventure/fantasy books I read when I was the same age as my sons.I do wish people would stop comparing this book with the Harry Potter series, though.

What I like is how the tempo of the book changes from criminal drama to comedy to fantasy to spy novel, etc, etc... Initially, you aren't really sure what is going on, but eventually the young anti-hero idea catches on and becomes a very entertaining narrative. Nathaniel Parker provides a fantastic narration, reminiscent of Jim Dale's excellent characterization for the Potter audio books.Having finished the first couple books, I'm led to think of the first two books almost as a continuous story, with many of the same characters recurring.Worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm.","review":"So I bought this book because I've seen it in stores/online/etc. I didn't like it too much, I like Artemis and Butler but that's about it.

It lacked the good hearted theme of innocence conquers evil that Harry Potter is noted for. There was very little innocence in this book.Artemis Fowl was not a believable character. He was a robotic character with few human characteristics. This prevented me from identifying with the character.Technology buffs may find the book entertaining but if you stop and think about it, fairys are nature loving creatures who dislike the idea of technology. And why would they need technology? They are magical beings.Eoin Colfer is a talented writer and his ideas are interesting but I do not feel this book has the universal appeal of Harry Potter and should not be promoted as a fix for Harry Potter buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book rocks","review":"This book is cool , the concept is great it's like getting paid to eat or sitting it's as cool as like any thing I've read so far!:)..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for a great series","review":"Some people might want to compare this book, and the subsequent series centered around Artemis Foul, to other works within the same genre. But to do that would be to underestimate this story as a whole. All in all, this is a completely different world from others (i.e. The Hunger Games, Percy Jackson, Harry Potter, etc.), and, as a stand-alone series, it is very good in its own regard. It's clever, fast-paced, and well-written. The story telling is clear and it is age-appropriate for its target audience. Book One, I will admit, seemed a little rushed. There was a great amount of suspense and intrigue at the beginning of the book that fizzled out a little towards the end. That's not to say it wasn't a good read; it was, but the ending left a little to be desired. Overall, it is fun to read and, while perhaps underplaying its hand, doesn't over-embellish on the myths, ideas, or histories it brings into the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explosive","review":"Although the idea that a stylist twelve year old would be able to do this is farfetched....the book and its plotline were great.

Artemis is delightfully evil, but in a salvagable way. I feel he has a heart under all that malice, no matter how much the author would like to veer us off that track of thinking.The book is very action-packed; a definite page-turner. The only negative comment I'd have to make is on its length. I'm never really satisfied with shorter books. If it were longer, I probably would have enjoyed it more.As for the comparisons to Harry Potter, I feel they are hardly justified. Two completely different worlds, two completely different styles of writing. Colfer has a very unique style, and his writing is humorous. Quite unlike Harry Potter, which can be a good thing...for awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intriguing Plot around Colorful Charaters","review":"I read this out loud to my family while traveling in the car on summer vaction.

It seems to go over well with children in the 9 through 12 age range (and perhaps older) but as a parent I had 2 concerns with it.1) There are many descriptions that detail and perhaps glorify weapons of various kinds as well as related paraphenelia, from rocket-propelled grenades to various kinds of hand guns.2) In many places I found the writing clumsy or awkward.

I thought it would be a fun vacation read. Potter fans, don't let that review suck you in, too.Artemis was only mildly amusing, and had none of the positive messages that J.K. Rowling shares in Harry's stories. The plot was pitifully simplistic and predictable, and the characters shallow. Artemis reminded me of a bad Stallone movie or a take off on a bad spy novel. This one is definitely for less sophisticated readers than those Potter appeals to.

They will stimulate your imagination. This book is not worth reading. I found this book to be excessively violent with material not at all appropriate to its target audience. Its frequently repetitive explanations of simple concepts insult the intelligence of its reader and the descriptions of weaponry and violence seemed a bit over the top. How anyone could classify this book anywhere near Harry Potter is beyond me. The writing is ponderous and dull and the story is not at all engaging.

Sadly, Colfer isn't as good of a writer as Rowling. His writing was both dull and clich�� ridden, and the main character mean-spirited and unlikable.

This means that by the halfway mark, you really don't care what happens.The author has spent a good deal of time thinking through the action and the technology (this is the only part of the book that vaguely works and is why I've given it the 1 star)and I'm sure this will thrill the right type of young audience but older readers will find little in the way of characterisation or plot to keep their attention.Unfunny at best, dull as dishwater at worst, this Artemis is truly more foul than fowl!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to the hype","review":"Definately not up to all the hype.

It was funny, sarcastic, and interesting. I am an adult reader and this book reminded me of the old Bugs Bunny cartoons, the ones where viewers of all ages found something to their taste. Violence is a part of this story of a criminal mastermind, but just one part. I found it was used appropriately, and several characters in the book routinely demonstrate that a good intellect is superior to a weapon.

I read the book jacket and a review and thought this book would tide us over until HP#5 finally hit the store. Unfortunatly - this book is way too over the top for anyone under middle school age. When you start talking \\"fine Irish whiskey\\" and \\"syrynges shooting into her veins\\" - I have to draw the line, and that was just in the first few pages. Now, despite my living in the 'bible belt' - I am not a prude. I am a firm believer in freedom of expression.

Artemis does not teach good versus evil. Artemis comes from a family with a criminal background and thinks this is the right way to do business. I also thought the description of violence was to graphic for children to read. When our children read, we should NOT show them the way to get around what is right.

Artemis was a little hard for me to warm up to, but I've heard he gets better as the series continues. At first I thought this was a middle grade book since Artemis is so young, but the swearing and other elements put it more in the YA category. Plus, Artemis is the only young character - the rest of the cast is older. It was a fun world, the pacing was really done well and I'm excited to pick up the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artemis Fowl","review":"I think this book is good for anyone and any age group because it has action, twists and great plots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheesy, but amazing.","review":"Artemis Fowl is a book that I could read over and over again.

LIsa Platt, the main character, was a jewish girl living with her nother, father, and two sisters. In that time the Nazis were in power in Germany. There were restrictions for all of the jewish people. They had to wear yellow stars, they couldnt fo to school, they were forbidden from doing anything. Lisa's father said that he needed to go to America and he needed to go now. He left at night and told them that when he made enough money he would bring the whole family To America, so that they could have the freedom that they deserved as human beings.I would recommend this book because I think its very sad, but its very well written.

I got so excited at the idea of a remastered Loveless; I had to preorder it. Unfortunately, this CD sounds EXACTLY like the original.

I was expecting to drift off after a few songs . . . that didn't happen. I'd never heard anything like it - a gorgeous softness paired with nearly unbearable distortion. Can something exist as overpoweringly delicate, softly crushing or soothingly chaotic? After listening to \\"Loveless,\\" I would argue yes, yes and yes.If you are willing to try something completely original (still, even after 15+ years), try the masterfully orchestrated chaos of \\"Loveless.\\" I think you'll find all these oxymorons wonderfully appropriate, but also gloriously inadequate . . . and therein lies the genius!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album of the 90's","review":"I'm not going to try and explain this album, all i can do is strongly reccomend it.

It, along with Murmur, are albums that EVERYONE, evem REM haters, must own.

That speaks highly of the record though, which takes a safe musical form and warps it until it's vaguely unrecognizable and a bit threatening. Loveless has a genuine beauty and solipsistic originality that's invasive and fascinating; songs like \\"Only Shallow\\" and \\"To Here Knows When\\" become more and more interesting the more you hear them, and the record tends to have lines and songs that pounce just when you're about give up on them. Take a line like \\"Fall apart my bleeding heart/ Nothing left to lose/ Once in love/ I'll be the death of you\\" in \\"Blown a Wish\\" - it's a bit of a silent alarm, which basically describes the entire record."},{"rating":"2","title":"the twisting, beautiful noise","review":"loveless has been a close friend to me since my first listen. it encompasses every tender moment, aching nostalgia, fluttered kiss and discordant epileptic murmur. it is, quite honestly, love and the sound of love. the cover portrays a mangled guitar shifting and piercing a thick haze of pink and red. the music is just this -- every noise, every piece, every lone note or drop of feedback is washed into opaque fluid, rushing tones past the ear and inducing back-breaking vertigo and breathstopping love in the blink of an eye. this is the soundtrack to the blood in your veins."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new definition for \\"terrible\\"","review":"Oh dear Jesus.

Makes me feel ill every time I hear it. Just staggeringly dated and appallingly produced. They're a one trick pony, that trick only works on 'Come in Alone' and they nicked the trick from about 30 seconds of one Dinosaur song on Bug. This is one of the few bands where the bands that were influenced by them were better than the original. Listen to Bailter Space instead is my advice. Of course, track skipping is required there as well, but that's another story...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short, blunt and honest : misled by the critics","review":"First, I tried to distinguish the so called \\"amazing\\" guitar from the horrible noise.

If I could compare them to anyone it would be very early Cocteau Twins , though I must be clear I don't think the singer is anywhere close to the artistic sense and vocal talent of Elizabeth Fraser.It would be more palatable if the production value was higher....it sounds terrible. The sound quality is comparable to some old VHS tapes I have from the mid 80's that I recorded off the TV ( Then soaked in water for a few days!) ."},{"rating":"1","title":"how can it be so bad??","review":"well okay, I had heard SO many recommendations for this album, you know, I just couldn't believe it. I rushed right out the door of my dorm room eager with cash in hand to hunt the town for the prized CD LOVELESS. I had been a fan of the cocteaus before, and I had been getting sonic youth at the time. The way the press described LOVELESS, I thought it would be just about the best thing to ever grace my ears. DEAR GOD WAS I WRONG. this album just plain blows. It is not beautiful. It is just STUPID. I just don't know how people can get into this incredibly MEDIOCRE music... this is like the rock version of early rave music..

This cd has such a unique sound, the way they blend the vocals with the guitar gives the cd such a smooth feeling. i do admit it takes a little while to get used to the sound, but after a few listens you won't be able to stop listening.

Its wicked bad. I been listening to this for the past few days now and i still havent completely absorbed it. It seems a little difficult at first, but after a while you'll get it.

Probably the best album of the nineties, this record will last a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"aaron","review":"I bought this ablumn when it first came out only because it received a good reveiw from Rolling Stone.

Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legal Drugs","review":"That is how I felt the first time I listened to Loveless. It was in the dark at night and I felt like I was flying. There are two albums every music critic acclaims as giant footsteps in how music was made. These two of course are Srgt. Peppers and Pet Sounds. Well in 1990 a third album was created called Loveless that made that next step and unfortunately is not given the credit due to it. Especially now with all of the electronic music out and so many imitators that fall short, My Bloody Valentine and their creation Loveless are being lost in the haze of counterfeiters. To think they had the audacity to compare \\"Garbage\\" to this band My Bloody Valentine. When will they ever get their credit that is due to them and why do people not understand? That is my take, Loveless is heroin without having to take the disgusting wretched drug. And it only costs about 15 bucks, and it will last a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"The album to end all albums","review":"What is there really to say about \\"Loveless\\" that hasn't been said by every other person out there? Not a lot, but it all deserves to be repeated for the nth time. \\"Loveless\\" just about spoiled me completely--I'm still waiting in vain for Kevin to finish the album that will never come. But maybe that's the way it should be. We're going on what, almost eight years now without a sign of him finishing an album that's received his stamp of approval. Maybe we're better off knowing that MBV finished on the highest of highs with this album.

I remember the first time I touched the play button. I couldn't get what I was hearing at first. It was totally alien to me. But after a few listens I began to dive into it. It shook me, stirred me, sent shivers down my spine. I was lost in it. It changed my life. This album really changed my life.

THIS IS NOT A REMASTERED VERSION OF LOVELESS","review":"Buyers beware. Although I think MBV's Loveless is a perfect album in every way, I bought this version because it was specified as a REMASTERED version, which it is most definitely NOT. I listened to my old copy of Loveless on CD and I listened to this newer supposedly remastered copy back to back. There is no difference except for the price tag. Unless you want to pay 30 bucks for a second copy of Loveless with no bonus tracks and one that isn't remasterd I'd suggest you stay away. The only difference here is that there is an extra booklet, but it is entirely in Korean and there is a slipcover for the CD jewelcase. As a huge My Bloody Valentine fan, I was completely disappointed that I wasted my money purchasing another copy of the record with nothing of extra value. I'd give an arm and a leg for a real remastered copy of Loveless. This isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant & Revolutionary","review":"I've owned this album for ten years now...I can't think of a more awe inspiring cd in my collection.

Earthshattering power mixed with blinding beauty, songs to die for and an overall production matched by noone. I am always blown away by this album, it never ever stops to amaze me.

It is too amazing to describe. The only things i can say about the album is that it has amazing textures, is flawless, and as the title of my review says it is quite original. It is too bad that the pressure they felt to duplicate the quality of the album was too great and they decided to stop making music because of it. I would list my favorite tracks, but I might as well just list the whole CD. God I wish I knew how to get that sound on my guitar. What a genius Kevin Shields is.

I'm haunted by my love for this music. I pick it up every couple of years and play it out until I've had my fill and can put it away again.

I didn't even know that Kevin worked with Mould on that song, I just sort of felt the connection and I had to get them both out and play the hell out of them.

However I will say that when it first came out I thought this album was 10 years ahead of it's time. Now we are in 2005 and the world STILL hasn't caught up.

He once joked with a reporter that Mr. Shields of MBV had some widgets that he'd like to own, and that he had some stuff that Mr. Shields would like.But the similarity ends there. Notwithstanding the obscene expense to produce Loveless, the recording fails to impress. Mr. Shields does little more than drone on with monotonous chording. There's no arpeggio work here, no compelling technique, texture or tone. And the breathy vocals are impossible to discern in the poor mix.Don't buy into the hype.

Most of the tracks were recorded live.And, the sound quality is terrible. If your going to make a Louis Armstrong collection, AT LEAST REMASTER IT!

The story is OK, though not nearly as clever as the original. However, the first time I opened the book, the cover came completely unglued. Because the soft-cover is stiffer than the pages, it made it very difficult to read, and it obviously would not stand up to the abuse my son delivers.I returned the book for a replacement, which Amazon makes very easy. Unfortunately, the replacement has the same issue. While it did not come completely unglued, the cover did start to separate during the first (and only) reading.As Amazon started by selling books, I expected much higher quality products from them. This is my first bad review of an Amazon product, and it's ironic that it is for a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the orginal","review":"I LOVE the original Harold and the Purple Crayon, but this did not live up to it's predecessor.

This album delivers no message whatsoever: it has no meaning. It consists of sell-out beats and lyrics constructed off the top-of-the-head - the rhymes tell us more about vague sexual positions and platinum jewellary than they do Ludacris' (limited) personality, thoughts and views. This album is sure to be a chart-topper and over the next 6 months or so the majority of its tracks will be played-out by MTV, Kiss etc. But this album still won't be a success.

I would have to say this is underated making it suprisingly one of the better albums in 2000. First off this album is mostly worth buying for it's beats and production, the lyrics are ok, but the bottom line is, gets Ludicris his message through in every song. The best song on on the album is clearly \\"What's your Fantasy\\", the remix is kinda hot too. The other tight tracks include \\"Hood Stuck\\", \\"U Got A Problem?\\", \\"Southern Hospitality\\"and \\"Stick Em Up\\". I strongly feel that this is a great start for the Def Jam South Recordings. All Hip-Hop fans should seriously give this album a shot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"KING of the South","review":"Ludacris' debut album Back For the First Time is definitely HOT. He's original, charismatic, energetic, and he's... clever. The punchlines are sick and the wordplay's MAD nice.

There is a 4 disc box out there that will make you see GOD. It contains all of the surviving tracks from these sessions. This cd was a double album that never got released. It would have been Coltrane's masterpiece. Coltrane hand picked the tracks after hours and hours of examination. He also picked the sequence for the ultimate experience. The whole thing got shelved, after all he was pretty new to Impulse. Finally here it is as the man/GOD/genius intended it to be heard. Sadly this was not released during his lifetime.

It looks fabulous. I don't remember the laser disc video quality much anymore. The video does look date but sharp. If there's a defect, it's somewhat grainy. But again, we're looking at 80s video.I remember the gameplay more and this hd-dvd has serious branching issues. I know it's because of the way the designers structured it, but if you die, it randomly jumps to a different scene. the original game was basically trial and error like learning simon says. but this one jumps so randomly that you can't memorize the moves like in the original. the original was like building a story. you mess up, try a different move until you get it right, move on to the next scene and repeat. this one, you're constantly jumping so you can't memorize it properly.that said, it's still work owning just for the fact that it looks so goo."},{"rating":"1","title":"sadden","review":"I was really excited about this game being out. Now my rating isn't based on the game it's based on a current situation. It doesn't play in my HD player. It skips scenes randomly and acts up. I have checked the disc for scratches, there are none. I am currently in the process of trying to get it replaced. I am curious if anyone else has run into this situation with this game. It freezes at the opening before the main menu and when I Skip forward there isn't a play or game menu, when I am able to get it going it is skimming scenes right away.I used to play this in the arcade I know it fairly well and was forever excited to try it again...

Tarkan gets better and better with every album. Even though I don't speak a word of Turkish, I am still moved by the slower songs on this album, Bur sarkilar da olmasa and Sorma kalbim. The music has a much more Turkish influence than his last album,Karma which makes it even more intriguing to listen to. His voice is like nothing you have ever heard and he simply makes you want to dance. The music is also fantastic. This album deserves to be heard by everyone, it really is a rare thing. And theres a bonus...Tarkan is absolutley GORGEOUS!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great job!","review":"Well, this is a weird change for Tarkan.

I love Tarkan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real Turkish Delight","review":"This album will have the most unsuspecting listener up on their feet and dancing.I bought Tarkan's melodic and uplifting CD while travelling in Turkey last year and expected nothing.

It is now at the point where I know I can buy his album without hearing a single note first (which is what I did with this one) and it will be good. Dudu is a departure from his earlier work (also fabulous) in that it has a more traditional middle eastern sound, but it is just as danceable. Dudu (and Tarkan's music in general) is achingly beautiful at times but also loads and loads of fun. Great for singing at the top of your lungs(whether you understand the words or not) and dancing your .... off! Truly spirit lifting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tarkan Continues to Surprise!","review":"It seems tarkan shows no sign of slowing down,every album just keeps getting better and better.

So who do these guys sound like other than Pulp? I detect traces of the Dandys, Blur (from their Parklife days when they were still a real British band & not boring American alternative copycats), the Verve, Fool's Garden, Octopus, and Oasis. Where does this CD rank in my opinion vis-a-vis other Britpop CDs? Not as good as the Dandys \\"Symphonic Screams,\\" Pulp \\"Different Class,\\" or Oasis \\"What's the Story...\\" Better than the Verve \\"Urban Hymns\\" and Oasis \\"Be Here Now\\" (which isn't hard to do)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention Can fans!!","review":"I first would like to echo the positive views of the other reviewers here--I don't like soundtrack albums as a rule, and I have never seen this movie, but this album is simply wonderful. It has the last released track by Talking Heads (the terrific \\"Sax and Violins\\"), and top-notch cuts by U2, Daniel Lanois, Depeche Mode, and the others. There is not a bad song on this album, it is beautiful, cohesive, and atmospheric. But for appreciaters of the seminal German band Can (who did soundtracks in the '60s and '70s for Wenders earlier films) this soundtrack is most notable for the inclusion of the last track I know of by that band--the sumptuous \\"Last Night Sleep.\\" The track was presumably recorded during the sessions for the \\"Rite Time\\" reunion album, but IMHO is better than any track on that album. Even if you're not a Can fan (as most aren't), this album is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joining The Club","review":"Somehow, over the years I've become something of an aficionado of movie soundtracks - they're a great way to find overlooked musical gems. Like virtually everybody else here, I'll give this one a big thumbs-up. Definitely one of the best, if not the best soundtrack I've ever come across.If you're also a fan of this CD, I'll assume you have great taste in music (which, of course, really means your taste is similar to mine). For what it's worth, some of the other, perhaps more obscure, soundtracks that I feel are also well worth owning are: \\"Flirting With Disaster,\\" \\"So I Married An Axe Murderer,\\" \\"Blue In The Face,\\" \\"The Royal Tenenbaums\\" and \\"Starstruck\\" (good luck finding that one)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evocative & Eclectic","review":"Just an absolutely amazing album.

Will strongly recommend the product- price can be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a masterpiece!","review":"Pharoah Sanders is a wonderfully gifted saxophonist and a man doubly gifted with one of the most powerful voices of the twentieth century in any genre of music. In this album he demonstrates both of these sublime talents in two diverse tracks. Hum-allah is essentially a piece with the feel of sunrise. Beginning with simple clapping and a basic piano riff, layers of percussion and woodwind are slowly intertwined with the simple riff and a delightful tune emerges. The effect is transcendental and is an extremely heatwarming and humane piece, especially when Pharoah begins to sing. Sun in Aquarius is more of a piece for sunset and is a mystical amalgamation of layered percussion and 'free' playing. This is a powerful piece that is hard to take in at first, but with several listenings, one becomes accustomed to its evokations of spirits and nightly creatures. This ends in a tone more similar to the hum-allah. The result is a masterpiece of an album that you will never tire of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shweeeet.","review":"I have to be totally honest. I didn't think these would work when I first got them. I figured they'd be super uncomfortable or just completely ineffective. When I tried them though, it turns out they're pretty awesome. They work against the terrible onion fumes of doom... They fit snugly around the face... And they just look precious, no matter who's wearing them. ;)The only downside is the fact that I can't wear my glasses with them. Granted, they'd have to be a pretty crazy shape in order to be able to fit anyone's glasses, but it'd be nice to be able to not cut myself. :Dall in all, definitely worth it...especially if you wear contacts, or don't need/wear glasses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ya Gotta Have 'Em","review":"The bad news...you'll look totally silly wearing them.

Hand me the onions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for cycling in cold weather but not one-size-fits-all","review":"I bought these glasses to keep cold air from blowing on my eyes while riding my bike to work in the morning. Sure they look a little funny, but not as funny as ski goggles or running into something because my eyes are watering so bad I can't see it.The foam makes a good seal and is thick enough that my eyelashes don't hit the inside of the lenses. The only problem is that the ear pieces are make for someone with an enormous head. When the lenses and foam are positioned correctly on my face, the curved part of the ear pieces is about and inch above and behind my ears. So when I hit a bump or move my head in any way, they slide down my nose and I have to push them back into place. Adjustable earpieces would be a big improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't ignore recipes with onions anymore!","review":"I used to avoid recipes that called for onions since I knew that they would ruin my whole night.

Everyone's face is different so they aren't a perfect seal around your eyes, but it doesn't matter. Not enough of the \\"onion fumes\\" penetrate the small unsealed area around my eyes. I diced two full onions without even the slightest bit irritation. I've already recommended them to friends and thought I would write a review on here.

Everything that I have read by her (which is 6 or 7 books) has been either poor or awful.Her plots are usually pretty amateur 'B-movie' afairs and have some major plot holes, but I wish that was the worst of it. My main objection is that her writing style and characterisation is what you would expect from a cheap romance novel - it stops just short of heaving bossoms...This is a pretty poor effort and I would really advise any prospective reader to give this and her other books a wide berth, particularly her Voyager : Spirit Walk books which are staggeringly bad (go straight to the Kirsten Beyer ones instead).Kirk and crew deserved a better send-off than this..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good story, well-written.","review":"Set in the aftermath of \\"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\\", this is an adventure that deals with the crew of the Enterprise as aging, post-Enterprise members of Starfleet, mostly going their own separate ways. If that, and a lot of complaints about aging, aren't your cup of tea, then there is a definite downside to this book. But it IS handled well, so you may find it to be more interesting than you would think even if the idea DOES sound dull.Furthermore, this is one of those \\"Kirk & co. save the Federation and civilization as we know it\\" storylines, but it's handled better than I've ever seen the idea handled before. Most of the threats of that magnitude seem contrived, and the idea that our heroes can stem the tide even more so.

It's an oversized metro map with mini-maps to 50 attractions. I never found a tourist destination that wasn't easily found from the nearest metro. You can get a free metro map when you buy a ticket or pass. Buy this only if you don't want to pull out your reading glasses to use the Paris Mapguide, but you'll still need a regular map to find the location of a restaurant or shop. Get the Paris Mapguide or the Michelin blue book instead. (To add insult to injury, there's a advertisement for the Paris Visite pass on the back, arguably the worst value for public transport in Paris.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"good jazz album","review":"Got this for my Kindle Fire and now I enjoy a great group of musicans,plus when you get it for a Kindle it is very low cost.My advise is if you like jazz do not pass up this chance to get a classic sound"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Longevity","review":"I purchased two of these lamps in 2003, prior to law school.

So I opened it up and looked at the contents, and I was right. For a book that claims to have scenes from classical to contemporary, it seems to have a lot of classical with one or two contemporary plays mixed in.The whole book seems to have a very reserved element about it, as if it's reluctant to expose the reader to violence.

About 15 minutes into this one, he got up and requested to watch a different one. I consider that significant in itself.

We love the VeggieTale videos at our house but this is sooo bad. I don't know who convinced the Big Ideas leadership to experiment with this change but it was a BAD Idea! The cartoon style looks like a Veggie imitation of the Power Puff Girls and, frankly, the Girls do it better!There were flashes of the old inspired zaniness during the video but only flashes--such a disappointment. And no Silly Songs by Larry. (sob!) Plus the little 'bonus' cartoon at the end with Larry and the pesky fly negated the whole message of letting go of your anger, in my opinion. It might have made this part better if Larry had found some way to put up with or work with the little fly.This is just one mistake. Hope they don't repeat it or that they've killed off their market. That would be very sad. But I agree with the others who say don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even good companies can make Bad movies","review":"We are huge Veggie Tales fans in our house. My son (16 months)loves them so much that if he is upset, all we have to do is sing a Veggie Tales son. He loves the animation, the singing, I like the quality of the message. This movie is NOT a typical Veggie Tales movie. There is no music, not even the beginning theme song. The story line is silly bordering on stupid. Not even my son will watch this movie. The animation isn't even as good. I have liked the other Larry Boy themed movie but this one is not a Veggie Tales. I could accept this kind of movie from Cartoon Network but not from Big Idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Larry Boy I remember","review":"Okay, so I've only met Larry Boy twice before. Still, I know what I saw in the latest 'angry eyebrows' is not the work of a Christian superhero. In fact, if I didn't know any better, I would not have known that this video was Christian. There are no scripture references, little reference to God, and worse, there was a lot of inappropriate stuff for children whose innocense should be protected, not deflated. There were some scary scenes, bad language (I would not allow my children to call others stupid), and like I said, no mention of Jesus and His word. I don't know what happened when the production of Larry Boy videos was transferred to someone new, but it wasn't good. I miss the former Larry, the kind cucumber who did what he did because it was right with God. In other words, I am glad I watched the movie at someone else's house (who also will not be sharing it with their children), and did not waste my money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wondering why they ruined Larry Boy","review":"We have to agree with the others that are wondering what happened to the Larry Boy we had come to know from Big Idea. Our son loves VeggieTales and has them all. We prepay for each of them as soon as we find out they are coming out. We are very disappointed in this one, as well as the Leggo My Ego that just came out last month. We will NOT be purchasing anymore of the Larry Boy shows after this. We are hoping that Phil and Mike will see that this was a big mistake and return Larry Boy to his sweet, Christian character. Also, why did it go from 3D to 2D? We are very disappointed and would not recommend this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Larry Boy To The Rescue Again","review":"Another nice Big Idea production. Good values, cute story and a reasonable price for a kids video. I'm not as fond of the style of animation - a bit too Saturday morning cartoon for my personal tastes but a nice fill for their normally excellent fare while they were making \\"Jonah\\". Larry Boy is a cute character who bumbles about trying to save the world in his own superhero with plungers way. While Larry is a great veggie on his own I tend to miss Bob and the rest of the gang who form a wonderful ensemble comedy team. This series doesn't seem to have quite the ability to enthrall my kids as the others do and they haven't asked to watch it over and over (like Dave & The Giant Pickle etc). But again not a bad substitute until the production company gives us another \\"classic\\" video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and bad changes","review":"Veggie Tales are great! This movie improved Larry-Boy in that he was more of a super hero type. Unfortunately, he lost his pure Batman-ness and got confused with Superman, confusing the history somewhat and possibly preventing a cucumber's visit from [the destroyed planet of a vegetable sounding faintly like] Krypton.One BIG improvement was the addition of other super heroes. Electro-melon was perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Ruined Our Heroes!","review":"I can't begin to explain how much we have loved the Veggie Tales in the past. We have probably introduced two dozen familes to this once unique, charming, made-for-kids but delightful to adults series. Now, we are mourning the loss of our Veggie Tales. We own every single previous Veggie Tale tape, but we won't be buying anymore. The new animation just looks like yet another Nickelodeon cartoon - gone are the Veggie Tales charm and class. Where are the Gilbert-and-Sullivan style songs that make the adults at our house voluntarily sit down to watch over and over? I am really, really bummed - I just can't believe they did this. Toddlers won't even recognize it as Veggie Tales because the wonderful Bob and Larry opening is no more, and the drawing of the characters barely resembles the old ones. My little one was asleep when we turned this on - she will not be seeing it - it's in the trash can. I couldn't even watch the whole thing. 5 thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"This video was a complete disappointment. What happened to the snappy dialogue and the clearly Christian orientation of the previous videos? There was no mention of God or the Bible; the format was clearly aimed at an older audience familiar with classic cartoon conventions (and not very accessible to my preschooler); and LarryBoy has totally changed--rather than setting up the other characters to fix their own messes, he now fixes their problems for them (in true superhero style)--and somewhere along the way he lost his inimitable, gentle-hearted, and bumbling manner. Nowhere was this more clear than in the final \\"short\\", which showed him manically trying to kill a fly who happened to land on him. That \\"short\\" undermined the whole message of the main segment: to let go of your anger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply brilliant!","review":"Tracks 1, 4, 6, and especially 13 are phenomenal.

Unfortunately, those aren't the people most likely to read this book.

The writing is artful and succinct, the authors Pulitzer prize winners and accomplished in many other ways.

It was ignorant and irresponsible. This book clearly was dashed off in order to make a quick buck. Good luck, writers, but don't quote this book to anyone if you want to be taken seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straightforward and mostly useful","review":"The book's extensive information on the Chick Lit genre itself read like a Master's thesis, but its advice on organizing & writing your novel and getting it published was interesting, detailed, and helpful.Tips for structuring plot were very thoroughly explained. The author's extremely organized approach to writing may work for some but not others. I'm pretty \\"Type A\\" myself, so it made sense to me - and employing some of her suggested techniques has kept my writing focused and prevented a lot of wasted time in rewrites.Bottom line: Skim the first half (on Chick Lit genre), and slow down to focus on the second half (writing and publishing tips)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A highly recommended wild game guide","review":"Now in an significantly expanded fourth edition, Complete Guide To Game Care & Cookery by Sam Fadala is far more than just another recipe collection.

I've never fallen out of love with Earl's sound and style and , in fact , possess a fine live dvd performance by him . It's not terribly often , that a person from the smooth jazz crowd contributes such a delightful and relatively authentic traditional jazz record for consideration . What great fellow artists Earl selected for this trio date . The acoustic bass work of Ralph Armstrong in VERY strong in either support or solo capacities . Truly supple and lovely . The same can be said of drummer Gene Dunlap . The song selection and spirit of the recording don't harm it either . If you LOVE and appreciate acoustic jazz guitar , pull the trigger . Thank me later . Smiles and gentle grooves to uplift and thrill . Happy and \\"up\\" ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pretty...Fabulous bass work!","review":"The rap on Earl Klugh is that nothing very adventurous happens on his recordings. Here some lovely standards are presented in a very straightforward manner. They are well played and nicely arranged. I don't think the disc suffers a bit by not sounding like something more avant-garde. What really knocks me out is the quality of Ralph Armstrong's bass playing. When I first heard the stunning arco bass on Night and Day over FM radio I thought it must be Paul Chambers. This guy is really great! Listen to his playing on Too Marvelous for Words and think when you've heard nicer bass.

Unlike some of his newer, more commercial \\"smooth jazz\\" recordings which are contaminated by electronic effects and rhythm boxes, Volume 1 is classical jazz at its best from an acoustic trio with a virtuoso guitar player. Klugh's work on \\"How Insensitive\\" transcends excellent. Trio's interpretations of standards like \\"Night and Day\\" and \\"I'll Remember April\\" are elegant amd pure, while more contemporary tunes like \\"Bewitched\\" and \\"I Say a Little Prayer\\" are covered with original and cheerful rearrangements."},{"rating":"2","title":"STEADY, GOOD, BUT NOT EARTH SHATTERING","review":"I have loved Earl Klugh for years. My 9 year old son is studying classical guitar, so I wanted something to listen to in the car to influence him. Now he likes this album, and as background music it is excellent. But there seems to be something missing - maybe it is that extremely catchy phrasing, maybe it is a particularly memorable riff of notes - I am not sure what it is, but it all seems a little workman like, not flying.

Michael Patrick Welch has crafted a novel full of mirth, pathos, and love. Truly, I haven't had this much fun reading a book in a long while. The story unfolds over the course of one year in New Orleans in which we follow the main character as he struggles to keep body and soul together long enough to experience his first Mardi Gras. Along the way he encounters a large cast of misfits, thugs, and genuinely likable characters that propel the reader from one adventure to the next. It finally all comes together at Mardi Gras, and what follows cannot properly be described here. You'll have to read it for yourself, and you really should. No first novel should be this good.

As a remedy to insomnia it is ideal.

What a megalomaniac. His self-promotion was such a turn off I barely completed the book. Fortunately it was a quick and disappointing read.I am amazed at how people equate value to this nonsense.

This is Celtic knowledge with a Welsh/American perspective. But the Welsh Magickal culture it explores from an American perspective is enlightening. I find it refreshing and not unfavorable to The Welsh. I also, as an English resident of Wales feel the Welsh atheist witchcraft trashers should get a life and work towards obtaining a totally separate government, then they can make it a law that only Welsh citizens may write about Wales. I do not agree entirely with the author as far as some of his ideas are concerned but as far as I can surmise, ideas are part of the freedoms guaranteed by the United Nations declaration of human rights. I applaud the author. He obviously doesn't mind the attention for i have seen articles by some of his supporters in publications here in the UK as well as the US.

But as the author clearly states in the introduction, portions of the material are also mixed with some modern dowsing techniques. I found very little of this mixture, but it is present as the author readily admits several places in this book.Rhuddlwm states in the book that he created a system called the Y Tylwyth Teg Tradition for Americans to practice, which is a blend of old and new material. There is a chapter dealing with the modern Y Tylwyth Teg Tradition. The remaining chapters all contain older and authentic Welsh dowsing and divination material of Dynion Mwyn, much of it verified by master dowsers.For some additional background reading on Dowsing, I would suggest anything published by the American Society of Dowsers or the Britsh Society for Dowsing."},{"rating":"1","title":"quite some claims","review":"If you ar credulous you will love this book.

The book appears to have a grudge against the reader and seems determined to surrender its content only under protest, and after the reader's most determined efforts.

For fans of this band's memorable bubble gum hits, this will be a surprise. Sure there are a couple of hits (Simon Says, Take A Giant Step and Pop Goes The Weasel)but most of the remaining tracks cover a variety of styles and stand on their own as time period nuggets. Remember that these guys were in the studio after the summer of love and pop hits would soon give way to prog. Some of these tracks appear on the hits collections but most don't - I looked. I found this in a discount bin and took a shot. I am glad I did. You may also get a simliar reaction to the Ohio Express LP tracks - recent 2-on-1 CD reissues have tracks that are more Sugerloaf than bubblegum.

I told a friend who is active in animal rescue what the vet said, and my friend echoed the vet's sentiments--the rescue community has also noticed that it no longer works.

The vet recommended Anti Icky Poo, which is admittedly a stupid name, but you won't soon forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No success","review":"I have used this product time and time again to get out some new pee spots with no success. It initially gets the smell out for a short period of time, and then after it is dry again it starts to smell.

I've since tried this product on a fresh vomit stains after I'd already cleaned the worst of it (which it's also meant to get rid of, according to the bottle), and it hasn't worked, either.

I sprayed it on a spot on the carpet that smelled faintly of urine and next thing I know my cat who, as far as I know, has never sprayed anything sprayed the spot that I had just used the product on. The only reason I can think of for this is that something in the spray makes them feel the need to spray. Seems like a good plan if you're trying to get people to constantly need to buy your product. I will not be buying this again, and instead plan on trying a vinegar followed by baking soda hydrogen peroxide and dish soap home remedy which I hope will work better.

On the bad side, I simply didn't find anything deeply insightful like I was expecting. It is fairly simplistic book about developing a better relationship with yourself, and is probably best suited for someone who is starting out on this path. As someone who has done a bit of self-analysis and self-improvement over the years, I feel this book simply didn't offer anything new or have enough compelling content to earn a recommendation. If you are looking for something that is more meaty, I think there are better choices out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided examples of negativity","review":"I was hooked at the title and the great reviews. Books I own by Hyrum W. Smith, Zig Ziglar are often picked up, re-read and recommended to others. Optimum Thinking by Rosalene Glickman was also a keeper. I've kept \\"The Power of Self-Coaching\\" for too long. I bought into the title and thought maybe someday I'd get something out of it. After giving it one more try today, I finally threw it in the recycling bin. Each and every time I've read it, I wind up feeling more stress and anxiety from the plentiful negative examples and limited positive ones to balance them. Some good famous quotes sprinkled throughout weren't enough to warrant passing the feeling of negativity on to someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"self coaching","review":"I think this is a helpful book. As self help books go I would say this is one of the better ones. I read the author's first book and then purchased this book. Initially I thought the information would be very similar to his first book but it isn't. In this book, the author offers the 5 step process and there are tips and helps through the first part of the book. It takes awhile to get to the actual 5 steps that are referred to on the cover of the book. Over half of the front part of the book is an analysis of issues, I don't think the author needed to spend that much on that subject for me. However, if this is the first book you are reading from this author then this information and analysis is helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book That Helped Me Most","review":"Joe Luciani's easy-to-follow exercises and his viewpoint on life has made the biggest impact in my life.

I got addicted to the infectious sing alongs contained in \\"Wolves\\" and \\"Life\\" and to a lesser extent, \\"Let's Go\\". I popped the CD in a listened to the first track; I waited for the hook. To quote, \\"It's like waitin' for the bus, but the bus it won't come\\". The song started and then ended; in between was about two minutes of screaming guitar, obnoxious vocals, racing drums and quite inventive bass. To say the least, I was disappointed.Take this CD for what is is, it is nothing like the music put out in the late 90's. It's similar to Rancid/93, but not as fun to listen to. I admit that I am not an ardent punk fan, but I am a solid Rancid fan. Don't expect much from this unless you are just crazy about punk. Rancid is a punk band again and I don't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A forced piece of crap album.","review":"WORST RANCID RECORD. First hearing this album right before I saw them on the Warped Tour of 2000, I truly can't say that there were really any stand out songs. I was relieved upon seeing these guys play maybe one song from this. My conclusion to why these guys put out this album is because LIFE WON'T WAIT was excessively said to be a sell out album. Too experimental, maybe... I haven't listened to LIFE WON'T WAIT but I'll bet it is better than this album. This is more like 'thrash' than any of the other albums. Rancid are not good at playing thrash. I suggest a DRI record instead of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rancid can Flex","review":"the release of this album marked the muscle that rancid posesses in their ranks and their ability to use it. the release of life won't wait was an experiment for the band that allowed them to explore their creative side much like the clash did with sandinsta!. many critics and \\"fans\\" of rancid's music saw this as some sort of weakness in a formidable punk band. anyone who appreciates rancid's talent should recognize the evolutionary steps the band takes to keep the soul of punk alive and well in this conformity ridden genre that is turning more pop than punk everyday thanks to bands like new found glory and blink 182. rancid 2000 is the oratory spit in the faces of these [faux] punkers. the music is hard fast and loud, perfect medicine for the usual radio fodder. those who long for another \\"...out come the wolves\\" should wake up and realize that the music is moving on without you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Retreat","review":"Life Won't Wait by Rancid approached in musical terms what the Clash did on Sandanista! That album was ripped by the punker-than-thou crowd as being \\"soft\\" or a \\"sell-out\\". It was, in truth neither. After making svereal brilliant albums Ranid listened to their critics rather than their fans and regressed musically on the self-titled album. the album is a mind-numblingly dull set of 1:30-2:00 songs played in their best Ramones on crack style. The guitars are fast, the vocals loud, the message non-existant and it seems like the calls for social change so evident on their other albums is gone in favor of pointless anger. The only redemption for this album is the song Let Me Go which lives up to what Rancid has done before. Skip this alumb and buy Life Won't Wait, Let's Go or ..out come the Wolves to hears their band at their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"STILL THE BEST PUNK BAND","review":"Rancid is still the best neo-punk band. While bands like Blink 182 , MXPX , and Fenix TX , are certainly abusing the name of punk with their poppy riffs , and mediocore songs , Rancid pumps out some of the most personal , and true punk rock. People say that Rancid has \\"sold out\\" , they \\"rip off the Clash\\" . Who cares ? The Clash sold out after only two albums , but nobody seems to bring that up. Rancid II , is a grinding example of how today's punk rock should be. Rancid is staying true to punk rock , by sound , and by lyrics.

Rancid is my favorite band, I have all of their CD's and know most songs by heart. I feel like they made this record to prove they were still punk, whatever that means these days. Personally I could care less about what gets labeled this or that. I didn't enjoy this record from first listen and it never grew on me. If I wanted loud nonsense I would have headed down to a local high school punk band show. These guys are better than this and it left me very dissapointed.

In my mind, they're right up there with nofx, tilt, nufan, the vandals, and lots of others. And I don't think they sold out by going on mtv or the radio. But it seems to me that when they were criticized by 'hardcore' punk rockers about LWW being to ska-esque, they respond by trying to pacify those critics by giving them a 'hardcore' cd. I don't get it. Now it seems that if enough people told them they should really make a country cd, that's what you'd see next. In essence, it appears as if Rancid is now trying to look like they're hardcore just to sell cds. Once a band starts following the wind of popular public opinion, they've gone the way of politics, and the artificial life we know so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad album","review":"This is Rancid at their worst, maybe a few decent songs, but overall this album blows.

I must say I am very disappointed by what what now seems to be held in high regard in this catagory. This is such trash that it shouldn't even be compared with the Clash and others also mentioned in these reviews. And if you think that being called trashy makes it even more appealing, then you might consider just what it is that appeals to you and why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!Yes! Can Somebody Say Second Masterpiece.","review":"I thought no album ever could come close to being as good as \\"... And Out Come The Wolves\\", with the possible execption of Punk In Drublic by NOFX. Leave it to Rancid to make the one album that is as original and fantastic as \\"And Out Come The Wolves\\". Rancid 2000 is that darn good. Not only that, it is able to do it without sounding like anything Rancid has ever done. I guess Tim Armstrong finally decided to stray from his Operation Ivy roots. Rancid 2000 is more of a hardcore punk album than a ska-punk album. Choice tracks are \\"Radio Havana\\", \\"Rattlesnake\\", \\"Let Me Go\\", and the very expiremental \\"Rwanda\\". This album should be in any punk fans collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment from a great band","review":"I've been a Rancid fan since the first self-titled album, and this is easily their worst album. I don't mind that they went for a hardcore sound on this record rather than the ska and reggae sounds that were found on their two previous albums. My problem is that these aren't hardcore songs done well. There is no build-up, contrast, or surprises in most of the songwriting that would warrant the monotonous angry tone. For songs so loud and fast, they simply don't rock as hard as they should. I love good hardcore music, and I love Rancid, but aside from a few classic tunes like Radio Havana, I don't regularly play anything on this disc. Their other albums are just so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"They've done better","review":"This CD is awsome. The first few songs just blend right into each other. The vocals are a little different than past albums and Tim's voice is scratchy like in the first cd. It is really good though. The voice does get annoying after awhile but its only like 38 min long. All in all good cdTheir next one due out in June will be better.Keep up the good work guys"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best???","review":"If you are following my reviews on Rancid you can tell I love them... to tell you how good this album is I would tell you I only compare Rancid 93 to it. It's more than likely my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Step Back","review":"Rancid always wanted to be the Clash, but this time Tim Armstrong and Co. should have taken a closer listen to the Clash's \\"White Riot.\\" Rancid is definitly not moving forward with this release. Sure, it's fast and hard, but there is nothing on this album that's nearly as fleshed out as anything on \\"And Out Come the Wolves\\" and \\"Life Won't Wait,\\" and there's nothing as intense as earlier Rancid tracks like \\"Radio Radio.\\" This is the sound of a band that's trying to atone for the lackluster sales of \\"Life Won't Wait,\\" which is unquestionably the band's best release. It displayed a lyrical maturity, inventive punk rock melodies and a nice updating of the Clash's reggae/rock sound. This, however, is punk tried and true. We've been here already, and so has Rancid. It's a shame for a band that displayed so much growth on its last release to retreat to its old sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rancid Disappoints...Again","review":"I waited 3 years for this? For a generic hardcore punk CD? I did not get into Rancid because they sound like all the other punk bands out there. Don't get me wrong, I loved their first three albums, they had a unique sound, the perfect cross between punk and ska. Then they came out with their '97 rendition and it went too far towards ska. Their new album went to the opposite extreme. You can't understand a word they say (good thing the lyrics come with it) and every song is a blur of speed that is completely void of any resemblence to the style that made Rancid so appealing.For those who like this kind of sound, this maybe a good CD for you. But, for those who got hooked on Rancid because they stood out from the rest of the punk bands, this album is just bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rancid can't hold a tune anymore","review":"This is, I hesitate to say, the worst album from Rancid EVER. I really disliked Life Won't Wait because not only was it not punk, but it was bad reggae. However much I didn't like Life Won't Wait, it can't compare with how much I dislike this new album... at least they tried something new on Life Won't Wait. On Rancid 2000 (or whatever its called... I though a band could only have one self-titled album.) they go back to their roots and show that they've forgotten everything that made them good!Unlike the first three albums Rancid S/T, Let's Go, and And Out Come the Wolves, there are NO catchy or interesting songs on this album. The first Rancid album was catchy, heart-felt and hardcore, Let's Go was excellent Rock N' Roll, and And Out Come the Wolves showed that these guys could skank it up. This Rancid 2000 drek, has these rich guys acting like they still want to be gutter punks. I don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rancid has revisited their roots.","review":"I just got a hold of this album, and let me just say I was quite surprised by the sound. The title of the album is fitting, Rancid (2000) is much closer to their debut self titled release then anything else the boys have done in their time together. From beginning to end, this is a tight record, 22 songs clocking in at 37 minutes. Some of the transitions are a bit messy, but this is a minor gripe and doesn't take away from the album at all. This album stands as one of the best from Rancid... and is on par with \\"...and out come the wolves\\" although I still think that album is the best in their catalog. As it stands, this is a great release from Rancid, and any fan of their style of music will instantly love it. Rancid (2000) is a welcome change after Life Won't Wait, and now has me waiting for their next follow up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to basics","review":"Gone is the catchy pop and experimentation of And Out Come The Wolves and Life Won't Wait. Though I enjoyed both of those albums greatly, I'm not disappointed to hear the boys revert to the speed, power and volume of their debut album. Rancid 2000 is hard, driving and fast. (I missed track 2 on my first listen). In short, the boys have reverted to their punk ways. And that's not a bad thing. My only complaint is Matt Freeman's singing. It just isn't very good. But that's a small complaint. This is what the Clash should have done after all their experimenting: go back to the start and do it better. Viva punk, viva Rancid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying too hard.","review":"I never thought there would be such a thing as an overproduced punk album, But here it is. The only reason it sounds overproduced is because you can tell they tried too damn hard to make it sound raw. I didn't buy the guise, and neither will most punk fans.Rancids attempt at changing thier style doesn't go over well, and they need to learn not to be ashamed of thier punk/ska/reggae sound. If it aint broke, don't fix it guys.I'm giving it 2 stars just for the lyrics, which with Rancid are always great."},{"rating":"2","title":"rANciD","review":"An amazing album that includes stand out songs such as dead bodies, let me go and young al capone. Not as good as some of their previous albums such as ...And out come the wolves and let's go, but a harsh, fast, very well done up album indeed. That's another good thing about rancid, every album has a new sound and each one usually ends up sounding better than the last so you're not getting the same thing every album. Overall a damn fine record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Guilty? Yes, Guilty of Inspiration!","review":"excellent music, enchanting vocals, good variety.

It's not the best release that I've purchased by this artist, but it's still great soul-stirring music. Not Guilty was certainly the perfect name for this collection. The only thing he's guilty of is being a great artist and producer. Rev. Kee's songs are always spiritually deep, yet not overbearing. In my opinion, Kirk Franklin and other clones still can't touch the anointing that comes through this man's music. I love this double release. Great job, JP!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He's Done It Again!","review":"Rev. John P. Kee has done it again! He has surpassed his fans' expectations with a double CD that takes the listener on a journey into his heart and experiences. Eveything from the declaration of deliverance in \\"Not Guilty\\" to the humors of pastoring in the phone call from Grandma Smiley; from the youthful Caribbean flava of \\"Dance\\" to the upbeat churchy tunes like \\"Sovereign\\" & \\"I Believe\\". Also, Pastor Kee has once again silenced the critics that say \\"he can't sing\\" or \\"he can't play\\" by doing both- well! Whether you just want to hear good gospel or you want to be ministered to, there is something for everyone on this project. Pastor Kee has done it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"If there is a better gospel song as far as studio and live mixing than rain on us.....show and prove it! In my opinion this one song is worth the entire DOUBLE CD!.....that song is perfect.It ministers, it makes you dance it keeps you in awe and it has Donald Hayes, and Tony Scott and of course, MR.

Quarter cup of milk was way too much for the amount of cheese powder.

There was no noticeable tearout on the red oak molding, and the edges of the cut appeared as though they had been planed! I highly recommend this blade for use in your miter saw. I have said it before, and I'll say it again - I am hooked on the quality and value of Freud blades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"Great blade for the price.

By far the best all around bang for the buck blade on the market ! Plywood, particle board, laminate, solid lumber, whatever. This blade cuts them all with great results. This is the blade that is usually found in my Uni-Saw. I have a complete shop so if I need a better finish on the cut I go old school (AKA the \\"right\\" way) and use a jointer or sander on the edge. I dont expect this review to be much use to most guys since the pros already know what I'm saying and the nit-pickers will want a \\"specialty\\" blade to do each specific cut (laminate, glue line rip, plywood, etc) go ahead and waste your money on fancy blades and the time it takes to switch out blades, etc.Like I said, I've been using this model blade for years and so have many cabinet shops world wide.

Silent Film star Buster Keaton stars as a Woodrow Mulligan, a disgruntled janitor of a scientist who invents a time helmet that accidentally transports Mulligan into the year 1962. The craziest thing about this episode is that in the scenes of Harmony in 1890, you see the episode in silent film formant with piano music, captions, and sped up filming. Then in the scenes of Harmony in 1962, the episode goes to origonal TZ format with dialogue and sound. Anyway, the episode is hilarious.

KillDirt stated the Miele S251i was no longer made and they were going to replace our order with a Miele S2120 Delphi, which was portrayed as the \\"upgraded model\\" and KillDirt would give it to us for the same price. First, KillDirt is still advertising the Miele S251i, which is misleading. Second, KillDirt is selling the Delphi for the same price, therefore no \\"deal\\" was given. Lastly, the Delphi is not even close to an upgrade.

Even the fake beard on the Mortician looked like it was painted on.The movie is about a guy working in the morgue. The timeline for the movie looks like they are attempting to portray modern day. The morgue in this movie looks like early 1900s.The setting attempts to portray a large city urban area, however there is always a lack of people, sites,and sounds you would expect to see and hear in that type setting.

It certainly seems they skimped on the bitrate. Obvious flaws in the original videos have been left intact instead of being \\"digitally restored\\"Best feature had to be the slide-show.

ABBA was about the music more than anything and the quality of the sound is fantastic. The video that truly stands out is, \\"The Day Before You Came\\". The song has always been under-rated and it seems like a lot of thought was put into this filming.It's too bad this is not available on DTS Surround Sound, but maybe in the future it will be available on that and SACD! To top it all off, the profiling against face-on head shots is hilarious. You know they had fun with those.

Not to say there aren't some really good songs. \\"Heavy Fuel,\\" is a funky guitar piece where the narration is similar to \\"Money for Nothing.\\" \\"The Bug\\" will remind you of \\"Walk of Life\\" if you let it and numerous other songs creat a strong impression.Overall, \\"On Every Street,\\" is a strong Dire Straits album that is weakened only by a couple of filler tracks late in the proceedings.

A late night album for a decade of pessimism."},{"rating":"2","title":"transitional expose","review":"Funny how people get this cd, my friend found it on the ground and gave it to me.This is indeed a transition from Dire Straits to MK's solo career. I give Golden Heart the nod, and there's a definite blues theme here that is more a Brothers carry-over than an MK solo aspect, but this cd has several excellent tracks. If you enjoy it, you just HAVE to listen to On The Night. That cd has all but one of my favorites from this and much more. To oversimplify dramatically, this cd is \\"spookier\\" than any 'Straits before, even Love Over Gold and Brothers. Some of it, on the other hand, is very playful and lighthearted.

Knopfler's guitar sounds buried under the mix, and he affects a bass voice that just doesn't register. Even songs that could have proven to be winners like \\"Calling Elvis,\\" the title track and \\"Heavy Fuel\\" seem to have been recorded while the band was in a state of depression.

Too many songs here sound as though Dire Straits is now content to tread water and remake its own songs.The aptly titled Fade to Black should have been the closer on this recording, as something clearly is amiss---perhaps the Heavy Fuel had water in it---and Mr. Knopfler and company prove they are mere mortals here."},{"rating":"1","title":"did'nt recive the right cd I got a diff cd","review":"I didnt recive the right cd I got a cd by inya i didnt sent it back that would have not been worth it because it came from germany i still would like the cd i ordered Robert Smith"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy fuel sucks!!!!this album deserves no stars","review":"One of every street is the worst dire straits album.Heavy fuel is a awful joke of a song.The good album s from Dire straits are their DEBUT,BROTHERS IN ARMS and LOVE OVER GOLD albums.Avoid this and got those albums instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Dire Straits album much to last guy's chagrin.","review":"After releasing five great studio albums, Dire Straits released On Every Street which turned out to be its swan song.

The band expands upon their original sound and lyrics to create a well rounded album that is satisfying to listen to from beginning to end. Wade's voice becomes fuller and more textured, while the band's sound shows more of its gut. The songwriting is strong, with such cuts as Spin, Wash, and the lyrical My Precious which was written and recorded all within an hour. Sky Is Falling is a very catchy tune, and Take Me Away simply takes you away. Overall, Stanley Climbfall is a strong second album for Lifehouse, and they deserve a little more attention than they are getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifehouse Rocks!","review":"I've been a huge lifehouse fan since i first heard 'Hanging By A Moment', so after No Name Face I'd been hanging out for the next album.

Stanley Climbfall retains their unique sound, while also bringing a more refined, more integrated, and deeper style of music into play. They have definitely grown as a band; their new CD proves it. Stanley Climbfall is more diverse than No Name Face, with a range of different styles and techniques. Some of the songs are harder rock, perfect to crank the volume up to, while others are more rock ballads. The thought-provoking lyrics behind it all add to the powerful and emotional experience that is Stanley Climbfall. Lifehouse surely, could never do any better than this..! Anyone that likes bands like the Goo Goo Dolls, REM, Creed, Nickelback and Good Charlotte will totally love this album; I know I do!! It rocks, definitely worth every dollar (and then some!). If you've only heard Lifehouse's signles, you're really missing out on something special!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the first...","review":"I thought \\"No Name Face\\" brought out my emotions like no other album I'd listened to. From the first moment, there was so much in the lyrics that I could identify with. Lifehouse's second album brings out my self-expression even more so than the first. I've recommended the album to all of my friends. If you liked \\"No Name Face\\", then you'll love \\"Stanley Climbfall\\". My personal favorite tracks on the album are \\"Take Me Away\\" and \\"Wash\\". Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"lifehouse 's music is the best!!!","review":"lifehouse-their new cd is awesome!it's more upbeat than their last one,and they stiil have great lyrics in their music!i hope that they never change,you guys don't ever change! your music is different,in a good way.keep writing great music i'll forever be your #1 fan!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome cd","review":"I am a huge Lifehouse fan, and this album is just as good as the first one. It's a little less intense, but it is still great. \\"Spin\\" is good, but I would have picked a different song from the CD to use as the first single. Anyway, I just wanted to say howmuch I love the CD!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Letdown...","review":"\\"Stanley Climbfall\\" had some big shoes to fill, a job that it failed to accomplish. This is nowhere near the Lifehouse quality that was shown on \\"No Name Face\\". Talk about a Sophmore slump! The first singe \\"Spin\\" is pretty good, as is the title track. The best track on the record is \\"Take Me Away\\", it is BEAUTIFUL!!! Unfortunately I can't say the same for the rest of this cd...that's junk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is better than No Name Face","review":"It's not perfect, however it is five stars.I want to see them get harder, louder, faster. They did all that in stanley climbfall, but they can do so much more.This is actually similar to Nirvana, just softer and happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I didn't think it was possible for Lifehouse to make a cd as good as 'No Name Face' but I was very wrong. 'Stanley Climbfall' went beyond my expectations. The entire cd is just marvelous, especially 'Anchor' (which is not, i repeat NOT about drowning) and 'Empty Space.' However, if you like shallow, stupid, awful music, this cd is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite The Follow Up","review":"Got this cd for christmas and was blown away. The lyrics and the rythms and the beats are all over the place. they move from melodic slow warm songs to punchy, kick you in the teeth rock and i love it. The bonus tracks are awesome. Jason wade and the boys have struck again and this time they are taking no prisoners, just like this cd. it lays it all out there for you to relish and enjoy. Stanley Climbfall is a modern masterpiece. rock on."},{"rating":"2","title":"you should buy this","review":"I want to keep this brief because I don't want to ruin it for you- its like before you go out and get a book- you don't want to know the ending. I will just say that if you haven't heard Lifehouse much before, now is the time to get into them- this album is amazing but I can't say if this is better than the previous albums yet. Just try it- ... investment & don't download it- this band desreves every penny plus you get lyrics & a computer thing- I LOVE STANLEY CLIMBFALL!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stanley Climbfall - A Masterpiece","review":"trying to write you a review for this cd, trying to find the words to express lifehouse's follow up to the amazing \\"no name face\\", well, that's just something i dont think will come easily. lifehouse has always been a personal favorite, and yes, i was aniticipating this album's release. when i got it the day of its release, and listened to it first to last, over and over, i realized i had just fallen in love with lifehouse again. jason wade hits hard with his deep, profound lyrics. every song on this CD is easy to relate to, cause we or someone we've known has experienced what is written about, sung about. this CD is a masterpiece. it's BEAUTIFUL. to not buy it, means you are insane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I know that Stanley Climbfall was not received well by many people, but as a 5-year die-hard Lifehouse fan I have to tell you that this album, although it is quite different from their debut No Name Face, is just as incredible as their earlier works. This record carries the more positive side to Jason Wade's lyrics, and features a more upbeat, dynamic sound. This is the first Lifehouse record to feature current drummer Rick Woolstenhulme, and his amazing rhythm talent is well showcased, especially in songs like Spin and My Precious. Even if you didn't like No Name Face, give Stanley Climbfall a try. You might be pleasantly surprised. Look for Lifehouse's new self-titled CD, to be released March 29, 2005."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Sophmore Slump for Lifehouse","review":"It would have been easy for Lifehouse to stumble when writing and recording their follow up to the smash No Name Face, but I'm pleased to say that hasn't happened. While it breaks no new ground, Stanley Climbfall is filled with the ripping guitar and strong vocals you'd expect from this group. There are many standout tracks on this CD. Personally, I like Spin, Am I ever Gonna Find Out, Out of Breath, and Take me Away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Follow-Up to No Name Face","review":"I bought this album the first day it came out, and I was pretty anxious to know if it would be as good as their AWESOME debut CD, No Name Face. The first track, Spin, is great. The three tracks after that seem to be not very good, although they are \\"listenable\\"! Then, starting from track #5 \\"Am-I Ever Gonna Find Out (my personal favorite) the tracks seem to be very good! I really like this CD, although I think I prefer the No Name Face CD. But don't doubt me: This CD is great, and still has the same \\"energy\\" as the first one...!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Am i listening to the same cd?","review":"After an adequate if a little bland debut album, i expected and anticipated great things from Lifehouse. Although second albums are known to be difficult, i beleived the band to have promise. How wrong was I.There is not a single song on here that lives up to the standard of any of those on 'No Name Face'. Its all highly irritating, mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless. I have a very varied taste in music and I do know a melody when it comes my way, but there is no melody on this album worth writing about.I write this to stop others making the same mistake I did, and if you like Lifehouse because of 'No Name Face', trust me stay away from this so you still have some love for the band.Switchfoot, Vertical Horizon, Jimmy Eat World even the Calling(whose album I also think suffers from having only one good song on it but is still better than this drivel) are in a class of their own when compared to Lifehouse im afraid. Spend your money and time elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"There's no climbing, only falling.I just bought this CD, and I was looking forward to hearing it. But I was thoroughly disappointed.Mainly, the songs this album lacks are the ones that made \\"No Name Face\\" a great album. Like, for example, slow, melodious, meaningful songs like \\"Trying\\" and \\"Breathing.\\" There was none of that here. It was all clanking noise. Very un-harmonious. Too bad. If you're thinking about buying this, I would say save yourself some pain, unless you want pointless noise to listen to. Buy Coldplay Live instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Dissapointment","review":"I was greatly looking forward to the followup to their previous CD,No Name Face. I bought the CD and was appalled. The CD lacked all of what made their previous one such a smash. I loved the first one but Stanely Climbfall just plain sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the fanboys","review":"Don't believe the hype. Honestly, from a musical perspective this album is a mess. The production and mixing are a bad joke, and the bands arrangements leave a lot to be desired. It sounds like the band sleewalked through the entire recording and Wade's voice is voco-coded to death cos he has no range. An avid fan will doubtless overlook these glaring faults at first but ask them again in a year if they're still playing this dog's dinner of an album. One more thing, just who is their drummer? He's shocking, the session drummer outplays him by a million miles. Why was a session drummer brought in to begin with? The answer is simple, they have very little talent as musicians. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"What downloading is for...","review":"I love the two singles, Spin and Out of Breath, so I thought I'd download this first and give it a try. As much as I hate to give an album with meaningful lyrics such a low rating, I have no other choice. Sorry to all you hardcore fans, but this didn't cut it! I tried to like this album and I still couldn't get into a lot of these songs! There's too many slow, sleep inducing tracks! I can get the same thing from my relaxation CD!! Not even the bonus track How Long is worth the extra money! I gave this two stars for the five songs I like: Spin, Sky Is Falling, Am I Ever Gonna Find Out, Out Of Breath, and Take Me Away. My advice: Go ahead, if you're a hardcore fan! If you're just a casual fan like me, just download it or borrow it from a friend! And while you're at it, try No Name Face instead! So far, I've only heard sound clips, but it still seems like a better album than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LOOK WHO'S BACK...","review":"...with more boring mainstream pop-rock dreck? One hit wonders Lifehouse, who are attempting to cash in with yet another album!Like their dull and sickengly Top 40-style gloss \\"Hanging By A Moment\\" made you sick. Well their back with a couple of meaningless numbers aimed for rock radio airplay! Don't buy now. It'll be in the bargin bins soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is Climbing to the top of my most liked charts","review":"After having heard the first album by Lifehouse. I knew that i was really diggin everything this band put out. From the first song \\"Spin\\" to the last one. I didnt skip a track on this cd. The majority of times even on a very good cd. I will do this at least once. But that's not the case with \\"Stanley Climbfall\\" and its also a cool name for the title of the CD as well.I'm looking forward to Lifehouse's next CD due out in March. I'm sure that i will enjoy it if not more than i did the previous two. There's a new Lifehouse fan in here and that's the end of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome music","review":"I really enjoy lifehouse. I saw them in concert, great live show! I did't have the stanley climbfall cd, so I am glad I got it. It sounds good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifehouse Does It Again, Better and Harder!!!","review":"I'll have to admit, I was not expecting such a powerful follow-up record by LIFEHOUSE! STANLEY CLIMBFALL is just that! I personally liked it better than their debut. The stand out tracks are the 1st single SPIN, it has a popish sound, at the same time has a harder edge, with the guitar, and drums. OUT OF BREATH, reminded me alot of \\"hangin by a moment\\" with the same musical arrangement, and radio-friendly sound to it, should be the next single. ANCHOR, is a great sounding song that also has hit capability and shows a little of the bands maturity as musicians, and on vocals TAKE ME AWAY, is another very good rock/pop sounding song. All in all this record has a harder-sounding edge to hit, without neglecting the ballads, wich are scattered throughout, I thougherly enjoyed LIFEHOUSES latest effort STANLEY CLIMBFALL, and would recommend it to anyone who likes pop/new rock music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great music!","review":"I am thoroughly enjoying this whole CD. Every song is incredible. The songs have a passion and just grab you. I strongly encourage that you purchase this CD. You will have hours of enjoyment. Great job, guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifehouse has done it again!","review":"Stanley Climbfall is another great CD by Lifehouse! Spin and Just Another Name get your body moving, along with many of the other songs. I love the heavy hitting guitar riffs... crank it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifehouse ReStrikes those Chords","review":"Lifehouse has literally struck the chords of my life again with their new cd, Stanley Climbfall. The lyrics in every song relate to life in every way and for every person. Wade's voice is perfect for the words he sings, and for the instrumentals in the background.Stanley Climbfall has 12 new songs from Lifehouse that I instantly began to favor. Although some more than others, I am sure to come around to the songs I've yet to listen to a lot. My favorites right now are Spin, Out of Breath, Just Another Name, Take Me Away, Precious, and Am I Ever Gonna Find Out.Just like No Name Face, Stanley Climbfall has soft, meaningful ballads; songs that make you happy with life; and power songs that speak meaningful truth. Lifehouse has now proven they're here to stay with this great, great cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Lifehouse Albums","review":"More mature than the self-titled album and superior (or at least equal to) to No Name Face, the unfortunately overlooked Stanley Climbfall album remains the best work by the band to date. Smoke and Mirrors? Okay. But it's not in the same league as this disc. Sure there's no pop single to jump out and grab you; if you're into that sort of music check out their other albums. What the band did deliver here is a deeply layered and introspective work with well crafted songs, brilliant lyrics, and thought provoking rock that will make and endless road trip not seem like such a bad thing. After years of listening, it's still one of my favorite albums of all time. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost as good as the first","review":"This was almost as good as their first album. Several of the songs sounded a little darker, Maybe a bit on the \\"negative\\" side, but I still liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my forever favorite records.","review":"It's a fabulous Lifehouse record, such a great follow up to the first one. I still listen to it a lot. Having the real CD is important to me, in this digital era where everything is virtual. Thanks Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Successful Follow Up","review":"It was hard to repeat the success of their amazing debut [ASIN:B000050HZO No Name Face]], but Lifehouse found some way to craft a worthy \\"swquel\\".Stanley Clibfall is a different CD than No Name Face. It isn't as mellow and the songs are as deeply religious, but that only makes it a classic in its own right.Spin, the first single, and the most known, doesn't do this great CD justice. It's nowhere near the best song on the album.The songs I suggest are Stanley Climbfall, Just Another Name, Take Me Away, Empty Space (#1 favorite) and The Beginning. Awesome CD. You won't be disappointed.Highly recommended.Also:No Name FaceLifehouseWho We Are"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifehouse is not \\"Just Another Name\\"","review":"This CD is awesome. No Name Face was in my car's CD player for at least 6 months, I'm sure this one will stay at least that long. It reminds me of Lifehouse, good 'ol Lifehouse, that can lift me up on a rainy, rotten day, and put me in a good mood, songs that i know every word to and can sing at the top of my lungs, songs that make me smile, make me think, make me cry. Now, granted, I'm in the process of listening to the whole thing right now (i'm only on track 11) but so far i love Spin, and Sky is Falling, definately, and Just another name. Great music. If you liked No Name Face, you'll like Stanley Climbfall. I promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A+ Album!!!!!!","review":"Lifehouse is back with their follow up album to \\"No Name Face\\" called \\"Stanley Climbfall\\". With the albums charming lyrics and Jason Wades deep, angelic voice, it retains that classic Lifehouse sound. The first single off the album is 'Spin', which is out of this World! The album is excellent and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"And they climb higher....","review":"Many people, who had just heard Hanging By a Moment, thought this band was a one-hit wonder. I knew, from actually seeing them in concert and listening to their first album (many times) that they were should be the ones topping the charts with their intelligent lyrics about life and learning to think for yourself. With this album, they bring a more rock-mainstream oriented album, but, thank God didn't lose their unique sound and inspiring lyrics. The last album was more about discovering yourself and trying to find your place in the world; while this album is about going through life after finding you do have purpose. Just listen to the lyrics. More groups like this should be on the charts, with inspiring lyrics that leave you, as the listener, to interpret what they mean. And they don't need to scream to do this. You wouldn't believe the songwriter/lead singer Jason Wade is only 22 years old. I encourage you to listen for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!","review":"Trying not to have too high expectations after No Name Face, I approached this album cautiously. By my third time through I really warmed up to it. It's getting better with every \\"Spin\\"! Jason's open and honest lyric's toward the Lord and his relationship with Him are refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"energetic fun!","review":"I love this band! Fans like me will not be disappointed! This cd is as good, if not better than \\"No Name Face\\", which is excellent in itself. The songs of \\"Stanley Climbfall\\" are very powerful, energetic and catchy, and the lyrics are thoughtful and poetic. The music is complex without being too busy or overproduced. This band is unpretentious and have developed a sophisticated style all their own. Jason Wade is a fine singer with a strong, yet naturally soothing voice. Even when he is very nearly screaming, his voice remains melodious and hypnotic. I'm very impressed by the quality of this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I think this album is wonderful! I'm a huge Lifehouse fan adn I'm so happy that they came out with an album like this. It's definitly worth buying :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Climbfall Falls Flat","review":"Being a huge fan of the great craftsmanship that went into their previous album \\"No Name Face\\", Stanley Climbfall could not compete in the least.The songwriting was very dull, the production boring, and the album continuity flat. Nothing of the great creativity that went into songs such as Everything and Breathing.Not worth the money. Better luck next time to Lifehouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this garbage","review":"This album pales in comparison to no name face. No name face is without a doubt a five star album, but these songs are somehow horribly inferior. The lyrics are still emotional but sung without the same conviction of no name face leaving the songs sounding dull and boring. I was expecting so much more after their debut brilliance. Forget this, get no name face."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the first book I bought about the security+.","review":"This is the first book I bought about the security+.I an a network specialist, but not a security specialist.So I check technical terms and abbreviations.The index of the book is very usefull, because it contain full spells of the techinical abbreviations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well.......","review":"Let's start with the positive sides of this book:1.) The overall book layout is good.2.) Explanations are pretty easy to understand.Now, move onto the negative side:1.) Doesn't cover a lot of stuff in the exam. In my 2 exam experiences, around 25 questions were not mentioned in the book.2.) The exam simulator is on the internet. Personally, this is bad because I like to do last-minute study before exam.3.) Questions in the book are good for checking whether you understand concepts covered by the book, not good for the actual exam.4.) The 2-hours DVD instructor-led course is not so good, either.Well, these are just my personal opinions on this Security+ study guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed using this book","review":"After reviewing after taking exam, there were several questions I got wrong because this book had errors.

The questions in this book were not even close to the real exam as the reviews suggest. There are also no fancy diagrams on the test and I found the \\"DVD training system\\" usless for exam fucused study. My question, did the people writing the reviews here use a diffrent book to study?I am confused here..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete coverage, matches CompTIA","review":"This is a great book--covers all the objectives that CompTIA has listed, and in great detail (sometimes more than you need for tha exam, but who can quibble with that!). The DVD was worth the price of admission--I'm pretty sure I could have passed just watchign that and not even using the book. But I did use both, sometimes together to study and I found it a great way to learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors, and does NOT match CompTIA","review":"This book had way too many errors, and does not match the actual material! This probably coincides that the book was developed before the actual exam even went live. Nevertheless it is a lot of redundant material for such a simple exam, and does not even match the material, and all with too many typos and mistakes. There are too many other quality material to say that this is a 5 or even 4 star book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I had this for the beta","review":"I took the beta exam before this book came out and I just missed passing (ok, I failed). I got this book right when it first came out, because I really do want to get the cert, and I've beenr reading it ever since. After taking the beta and reading this book, I really feel like I'm prepared to pass. Thre's so much stuff on the exam, it's hard to know everything. This book talks about all of the test objectives and the questions in the book really help. They are hard. If you get these right you will pass. The DVD is pretty cool also. You can only read for so long, but if you know you need to keep studying you can throw in the DVD and relax a little bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"No updates on website. Author not security+ certified","review":"I find it hard to believe that a book that has been out for over 2 years doesn't have some type of update. After reading the first chapter and going through the self test questions I was disappointed. Figures were out of place in the appendix, and 2/20 questions were ambiguous at best. Also, I guess next time I get a cert book, I will make sure at least one of the authors or technical editors has that certification. Yeah, they have higher level certs but I believe anyone interested in writing a good/great cert book would at least have that certification themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book. But remember the Security+ is for the experienced","review":"I used this book as my primary study guide along with the Passport book. Easy to read and also covers subjects not on the exam that are very useful in real live situations. This is not an exam cram type of book and should not be used as the only study guide for the inexperienced. The 2 hour DVD is poor in quality and low in content but then again for the price what can you expect. Overall, I give the book a four star rating because it was well written and kept me interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as bad as people say it is","review":"well i am not one of those who follows people blindly i hear the stuff for myself, people visualise kane as a hard spitting battle mc so he didnot cut it with this album but just listen he has made a smooth album, it just shows the mans flexibiltyif you do like BDK i suggest you add this to your collection and finish and respect the great big daddy kanePeace out..."},{"rating":"2","title":"BDK does some of his best work here","review":"I understand that some of the filler on this album is not good, but there are many songs on here that are among kane's best raps.

Sure there's a four-pack of movies, but I've viewed them too, and well, there is not the quality that you get with this three pack. Trust me I fought tooth and nail for the other set, but viewing them both showed the four-pack is just not as good as this set, especially for the price.

There's simply not a better series of buddy cop movies ever made, especially because the chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover is just superb.With that said, I write this after the sad news about Mel Gibson's DUI arrest, and the charges that he said some anti-semitic comments. All I can say is this. The man has a messed up father, and because of that Mel has had some demons of his own. I believe that he needs to resolve some issues, and I think he will. He's not running and hiding people. He's admitted his transgressions and is doing something to get help. Maybe, just for once, wouldn't it be nice if we didn't try to tear down every great icon of this country? Maybe instead could we give this man some support, and help him overcome his problems? Don't discredit a life full of achievements because of one mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works, but...","review":"My C60 just bit the dust and I wanted another so I could use up the extra ink cart's that I've been storing. I suppose the C60 has been discontinued so I went for the nearest thing - the C66. Compared to the C60 this printer just creeps and I thought it would probably be faster. I have had less trouble with nozzles clogging, but it is still only several weeks old and this could change with the next priting. My biggest complaint is that it will not accept a standard 4 1/8x 9 1/2 envelope feeding landscape. It goes exactly to 8.5 wide so the envelopes must be fed portrait which now screws up my envelope printing program as it will not print portrait. I thought it would be a new and improved C60, but it is actually a step down. It will also run a sheet of blank paper before it starts printing my CD labels for some reason and this is a major waste of time. I wish the C60 were still available honestly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bargin 4 your home office needs","review":"&#65279;This is my 3rd ink jet printer.

So I would give it 3 stars. Except for two things. One, the draft print mode is VERY faint and basically illegible. Two, it's VERY slow to start printing the first page. I'll keep using mine (at least until the ink cartridges run out), but I wouldn't recommend buying one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gift","review":"I was just given this printer as a gift. It only had the power cord, so I thought it would connect with my laptop wirelessly. It won't. It didn't come with a USB cable it needs to connect to the computer to be able to print. It's just a worthless hunk of expensive plastic without that cord and I can't find the stupid thing anywhere online. Go with something better.UPDATE!I just got my cord today and plugged it in. Luckily it made the printer work. The downside is why I reduced my 2 star rating to a 1 star rating; despite putting brand new never before opened ink in the printer, it just cycled the paper but never actually printed an image. I tried with different images/documents and it just kept cycling the paper as if it were printing, but the page remained blank. Anyone else have this problem? Can it be fixed easily without sending the thing into the company?Save your money and go with something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok while it works","review":"Cheap printer, but even for a cheap one, it is quite poorly made.

Where they are made isn't what bothers me about these shirts now but what really bothers me is when they outsourced the manufacture of these shirts they also have manufactured them from a thinner cotton material. Their thickness is what so many of us liked about these shirts. I will no longer buy these shirts due to the thinner material the are made out of currently. If enough of us boycott purchase of their current pocket T shirt perhaps Carhardt will get the message. MAKE THESE SHIRTS OUT OF THE SAME THICK COTTON MATERIAL THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MADE OUT OF.

They are nice and thick and I have no doubt they will long outlast the other cheaper shirts, so in the end the cost will probably come out the same. The only disappointing thing is that even these shirts are not made in America - I for one would pay a little more if they were. That is the only reason they didn't get five stars.

The large was huge! It was my first time to return anything to amazon, and it was a breeze. They make it very easy and pay for return shipping.

But I had great difficulty ripping 4/4 Oak... had to really push the boards hard and they even burned some. Although the blade didn't seem to be dull, having it sharpened would likely have improved things. Even so, solid Oak is pretty dense and so I thought it would be good to instead try a blade that was designed for ripping hardwood. This Freud 24T FTG Thin Kerf Ripping blade works wonderfully -- it cuts right through 4/4 Oak without much pressure and with no burning.

This is hard stock and my other blades left lots of burns and saw marks in the ripping process. This Freud blade has reduced that by about 90% thus easing the finishing prep hand planing or sanding and sealing. As long as your saw is all squared up, this blade should do the trick in getting the rip and tenon cuts you want with a minimum of after cut work.

A tiny little staple will suffice to chip some."},{"rating":"2","title":"great rip blade","review":"Great ripping blade. Price was pretty good through Amazon. The effort it took to push Douglas Fir through the blade was minimal, almost effortless. Absolutely no burning. The ripped edge was very smooth. Freud's teflon blades are high quality blades, and I own several. But I make sure that when I'm in the ripping mode, I use ripping blades.

Tough stuff.The first time this blade was used on Chanu it cut like it was being fed pine 2x4 !!! Was very pleased with the performance. My cheap saws have new life !!The thin kerf requires much less power and the saws perform better. The thin kerf wastes less material and is important to me because most of my rips are \\"free\\" lumber scraps from the lumber yards or from the \\"fruit box\\" fabricators !!!

Today I put it on and all I can say is WOW. It felt like cutting butter and the cuts came out amazingly clean.

I had bought a cheaper blade for it and it bogged down my saw even in thinner materials such as 3/4\\" pine but the Freud blade rips 2 by stock like butter. I put this saw in a Rousseau stand with out feed table which I highly reccomend. The stand makes the saw safer to use and gives you more working space for ripping full sheets of plywood, paneling etc. and can be done by yourself which is nice. In my 27 years of building and buying tools I have learned that when you buy cheap you get cheap, so if you want good quality then you have to spend more but in the end it's way worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul Burch \\"Blue notes\\"","review":"I purchased the CD because one of Paul Burch's song was on the Oxford American Southern Music edition.

They basically flash three separate LED's one at a time which makes it pretty dim.

It will give a whole new meaning to the word chill...It sets a real cool mood to your party... and even if you are not a big partier...you can listen to the Buddha party and that is truley one of a kind cd....ON this buddha cd you will here songs from all over the world mixed to make you move and chill at the same time...The songs come from Greece, Persia, Arabia, Spain, Asia...it feels real cool to listen to a Buddha bar cd... it is an experiance that you will never forget......"},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to say something....","review":"I have read many, but never written a review before. I felt compelled this time. I recently purchased this CD and thought it a collection of the most ridiculous music ever. There are a couple of nice tunes but what seems like it may have potential, is abruptly destroyed by some incongruent whim.Thinking perhaps that I was being a musical snob, I asked the opinion of a friend. She and I laughed so hard at how awful it was, so, I went for a third opinion. The result was the same. In fact it got worse with each listening. We've decided that it will make a nice \\"booby prize\\" for my next party. Avoid this like the plague. It is musically inconsistent, non-relaxing and a complete source of irritation. If you want your dinner guests to leave early by all means play this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overindulgent Crap","review":"Awful. People say this is THE album for the \\"lower-West-Side-trendy-martini-party\\" but it is NOT!! If you play this at your party people will leave.

Too bad 1 is the least amount of stars I can give."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Uninspirational","review":"Reading the reviews, I was hyped to finally receive this CD. On the first listen I was not impressed. Second and third also. It is fine as background music, but for something to relax to or get into more reflective state of mind it did not deliver. Given the price tag, this CD is way overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"over-hyped","review":"There are a few good tracks on each disc.

Even the Cafe Del Mar compilations are better value.Sure the Buddha Bar in Paris is great but it is nothing unique, special or worthy of this price for 2 CDs !

In the past my normal technique would be to rip the boards to a uniform width and the run them through the jointer to get a good enough edge for a nearly invisible glue line.This blade is advertised to make glue line rip cuts and it does just that. I'm able to make rip cuts in thick hardwood that require no further preparation prior to glue up. That includes some 13/16 maple that I just used for a dovetailed blanket chest. That makes for a nice time saver.Bottom line; If you do a lot of ripping, this blade is definitely worth the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carbide teeth chip very easily!!","review":"I bought this blade to rip white oak and it cut very well at first. After a couple hundred feet it slowed down so I took it to my sharpener and he couldn't sharpen it because of all the chipped teeth!! None of the teeth were missing, but al of them had chunks of carbide broken out. Not very impressed....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"This is my second rip blade - its hard to find places to sharpen blades around here, and it takes a while, so I needed a back up.I added the Freud blade stabilizers, and was able to rip inch and 3/4 ash with no blade marks whatsoever (on a delta contractors saw with link belt and zero clearance insert). I could feed it as fast as I was comfortable.I can't imagine what paying an extra $[money] for a Forrest would gain me (not having to change blades, I guess)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carbide meets nail","review":"This blade performed admireably cutting through 1.25\\" hard maple gym floor that I am trying to recycle. It really moved a lot of wood and didn't even seem to dull to quickly when we got into the finish and grime on the edges. However when it met a nail it slowed down our feed rate. Upon taking the blade off and having it sharpened we lost one tooth and dulled the rest. Not the blades fault. Operator error and I have since bought another of the same blade to add to the arsenal and have been very pleased with it's performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great rip blade at a good price!","review":"We are using this blade in a 10\\" portable table saw. It is super-quiet and leaves a nice, clean edge. It's amazing how much better a saw can perform with a good blade in it. The motor doesn't bog down even when cutting thicker stock, and the blade powers right through the material. Definitely not a thin-kerf blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent preformance for the price","review":"I use these blades on a 5hp machine and have good luck getting clean edges on multiple spieces of wood. The full kerf cuts clean rip joints as advertised.The carbide on this blade is massive and should yeild at least 6-8 sharpenningsThe cut on this blade is close to the woodworkers but at a lower cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Usually not necessary","review":"Unless you are doing a lot of ripping, or re-sawing, a ripping blade is not necessary. General purpose blades do the job. I find that Forrest blades are the best. They give the smoothest cut with no splintering except the following edge. I would not return blades to Forrest for shipping. The service is good, but shipping costs raise the price to almost that of a new blade. Try your local woodworking shop. My Woodcraft sharpened the blade as good as the factory at half the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely erotic tarot features 18th century Venice","review":"The Tarots of Casanova, illustrated by Luca Raimondo and published by Lo Scarabeo of Italy, shows actual places in Venice, often with characters in various erotic poses at masked balls or in boudoirs. Women are depicted fully or partially exposed, while the men are semi-dressed or covered (now, really, is that fair? But it does keep this deck from being classified as hard-core). The pale illustrations suggest gentility and an \\"Anas Nin\\" kind of sensuality. A lovely addition to Tarot and erotic collections, or to appreciate 18th century Venice in an unusual way.

The book takes you through a snow day with Peter. He does all the things typical little children would do in the snow. He makes tracks, snow angels, etc. I think this book is amazing. I read this book to my 3 year old son and he got so excited because he could relate to everything Peter was doing. My son loves to do the exact same things in the snow as Peter did. This book is one of a set of books that Ezra Keats wrote with Peter as the main character.

It is a good but not a great read for my grandchildren. We enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buggy implementation of a classic","review":"I was looking forward to this based on my memories of the arcade version. I wish I'd waited until the reviews showed up.The first challenge - works as expected. If you die, you go back to the start of the game. After that, it throws you into a random sequence if you die, making it nearly impossible to complete anything, because you only get one try. If you're patient, it'll eventually start behaving properly again, and you can actually play it as a game.The default setup is also poor; you need to turn on indicators to actually be able to play it.As a piece of history, it's interesting. As a game, it doesn't have a lot to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buggy and Un-usable","review":"The game I received was so buggy it was unusable. I will return it or throw it away. It is hard to say what is good about the game when it simply won't work properly. The game did not respond reliably to input, it frequently hung, and basically acted as though it was horribly scratched or something (but it was not scratched -- it was fresh out of the box with no handling whatsoever). Maybe mine was faulty, but from reading the other reviews, it seems like this disc just isn't ready for prime time. It appears to be a faulty product and should be recalled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had read all the reviews first","review":"The only portion of the positive reviews that I would agree with is the amazing detail in the game. The clarity is awesome, but the game itself stunk in my opinion. I had played it a few times as a kid and was always fascinated by it, but when I tried it on my PS3 I was very disappointed. The interruption/delay in between scenes was very annoying. I would most definitely not recommend this game.

I played through the whole game last night and it was the best version i have ever played. It looks better than the arcade version. The detail and color in the backgrounds are astoundting. If you ever played this game in the arcade you will love this.Adding to the awesome trasfer of the game (which includes all stages!!! even the flipped ones!!!!) you get come really cool interview and commentary videos.

The watch mode allows you to enjoy the lovely animation, but I wanted to play Dragon's Lair. Sadly, even with the latest PS3 firmware, playing the game is a joke. Glitch after glitch, and the scenes randomly jumping from one to the next if you make a wrong move, make this a sad experience. This is nothing like how the arcade game plays. I love Dragon's Lair in the arcade, on the Atari Jaguar CD or on the PC, but this blu-ray version is just terrible. Digital Leisure should be ashamed for releasing such buggy garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny if u have a ps3","review":"The game play is flawless, just like I remembered back in 1983 ( Yes I'm an 37 year old still playing video games ) Using a PS3 and a controller with this game is a must!!!! I used to be the high score champ of Dragon's Lair at the local arcade, If u are a hater then u wouldn't understand how big this game was when it first came out!! In the arcades people would line up to play at 50 cents a turn, no one knew the moves, so it could last only a minute if u suck, I invested a lot of my allowance money to finish this game. It was worth every penny!! Some people watching would even clap after the dragon was killed.

But you know, supergroups will be supergroups, which means they will inevitably suck. Especially annoying are \`Don't Think About Her When You're Trying To Drive' (I hated typing that even more than you hated reading it) and \`Don't Bug Me When I'm Working' (are songs with really long titles ALWAYS bad? You decide). Fans of Lowe will dislike this album, as will fans of Hiatt, I can't say for sure about Cooder, I don't like him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good idea...","review":"As others have commented, teaming up the musicians responsible for John Hiatt's 1987 masterpiece, \\"Bring the Family\\" must have seemed like a good idea, but it wasn't.The difference is that this time the others get to write and sing. Seems pretty obvious to me that it wouldn't work; \\"Bring the Family\\" is so good because it's a JOHN HIATT album.This album doesn't even work when the song is obviously Hiatt penned, because he's trying to be Little Village, not John Hiatt. I don't think a single song on here is memorable, except for its dullness. When Hiatt is singing, it's just about worth the effort of putting it in the player, but otherwise... not a good idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock & Roll Masters","review":"Fantastic recording by four elite musicians, Ry Cooder, Jim Keltner, Nick Lowe and John Hiatt. Like other reviewers, I am struck by the great rhythms on this record. It is funky, bluesy and very much rock & roll. As usual, Nick Lowe proves to be one of the greatest livng masters of rock & roll \\"style\\". His songs are full of hooks, memorable guitar-riffs, harmony vocals,etc. That said, everyone shines on this disc, including the not-often-mentioned Jim Keltner who is responsible for the ultra-chunky rhythms."},{"rating":"2","title":"somebody thinks this cd was bland?","review":"Reading some of the other reviews makes me wonder what gets these folks excited musically. This cd is one of my favorite all time works. You take the funky, synchopated rhythms of Ry Cooder, the steady pop of Lowe and John Hiatt, mix it all together, and you got something special. Which this is. The first 2 cuts are rhythmic materpieces. For those of you who could'nt get into it, go back and listen to the 3 or 4 different rhythm patterns going on at once. In this you get great vocals by Ry and John and Cooder's ever-spectacular slide guitar. Geesh.

Hibiclens is a standard of care for handwashing and wound disinfection in many hospitals. Many people use Hibiclens as a pre-scrub several days before an anticipated surgery, with the intent that it will inhibit bacteria and prevent post-operative infection. At 4% concentration, this is very strong. Avoid contact with eyes, nose, mouth, rectum, as at this concentration, it is quite irritating to non-skin mucosa.Although expensive, this is perhaps the best hand cleanser on the open market.

It does it's job killing bacteria so I'm not concerned it's contaminated or not the real thing. The only reason I don't give the product 5 stars is because of the lack of seal on the bottle.

Even so, there's a lot to like here. Particular favorites are \\"500 Miles Away From Home\\" (great guitar work!), \\"Alabama Wild Man\\" and \\"Huggin' and Chalkin'\\".The songs run the gamut from country and pop ballads to country funk rave-ups. The sound quality is excellent, which is surprizing considering the age of this little known material.

Most of the easels I have found that claim to be dual sided are really just one drawing side and one dry erase/chalk side. Past that, I can't really find anything nice to say.First off- this is NOT worth the money I spent on it. For what I spent I highly expected something of much better quality. Instead, I got some slabs of wood and bolts. The storage bins are cardboard and you have to fold them together yourself. They will not last past the first use and I'll have to go through the trouble of making my own. To top it off, for the size, the actual work space is small.

Unfortunately many people are not able to hear this music and use such words as weird, abstract, dissonant, and intellectual to describe their reactions. However, this just means that the person's ear is not able to hear the music. The Kenny Barron version of \\"Well You Needn't\\"was particularly good.

The colors are not very vivid, but they are not totally washed out. This transfer is just bad enough to make you wonder if the Roan DVD would be worth the money. Roan states, \\"from a pristine 35mm print.\\" I thought the acting and story very engaging. To me the costumes were very colorful even in this average Alpha transfer. It would be worth the money to see this movie in \\"pristine\\" Technicolor.

Vera Ellen dances beautifully as always and David Niven is fun to watch as the almost boyishly charming love interest.The plot is as follows: Janet Jones (vera ellen) is late for her practice and hitches a ride with the driver of millionaire B.G. Bruno (niven). All of the other dancers and her director (cesar romero) seem to think that janet is engaged to B.G. bruno and that therefore they will be able to get lots of money from him (as they really have no money) for the show if Janet (after getting fired for being late) gets the lead. Of course true to the genre Janet and Bruno meet and fall in love.A wonderfully entertaining movie you can watch many times. i didn't give it 5 stars because of the picture quality. With a lot of musicals being remastered i have become spoiled and this looks untouched. Especially the dance scenes where the dancers are mostly wearing white seem to be overly lit, causing loss of definition."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great musical","review":"This is a great dvd of \\"Happy Go Lovely,\\" a really good musical.

North Carolina Handbook should be a welcome guide for anyone desiring to visit or just know more about North Carolina. Moon Travel Handbooks have been around for 25 years and are best known for being the guidebooks for adventurous travelers. Moon Travel Handbooks excel in their historic and cultural focus, their significant coverage of flora and fauna and are especially welcomed by this reviewer for their maps and clear directions. North Carolina Handbook is no exception to these trademarks. Especially impressive for a first edition is the comprehensive coverage that Rob & Jenny give to the history of this fascinating State.I checked out various recommendations and found all to be right on the money.

Because it gives unbelievably bad directions. I dont't think the authors have ever been to N.C. My husband and I were in Charlotte for only 3 days and this book led us on a wild goose-chase for an entire afternoon. This book directed us to go east on I-85 for 20 miles to find the Schiele Museum...well it turns out the museum was in the other direction. The next day we consulted the book on how to get to the Latta Plantation. We were told to take I-88, but there is no I-88 in Charlotte. Avoid this book like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost their Funkness!","review":"Being a fan of all things Cameo related, I picked up this 1992 release of the group expecting great things. I don't think this CD was the album that broke the camel's back, but I do think it was the end of an era for a fantastic group. I think that with each passing albumReal Men Wear Black&Machismowith a changing musical landscape that was going for a more polish sound, as opposed to a funk backdrop, Cameo were always going to sound dated. Because they either couldn't see this musical change happening, or which is nearer the truth to be, they wanted to either try and embrace this new musical frontier, 'Emotional Violence' sounds like a band that have gone on too long. The only decent song to my ears is 'That Type of Guy' which adheres to the formula of a horn/brass section, and is the only reason that I will be buying this CD.This album was in fact the group's last on a major label, as I write. Unless you are a die-hard fan, I would avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of my fave groups, but not this album","review":"Cameo strong from the beginning and funk for the '70s and '80s...they are the bomb act, but this album's sound was bombed out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This is a much higher quality item than the photo on Amazon led me to believe.

So, I will save it for another use."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth checking out if you're a fan","review":"Released in 1990, this compilation consists of Soundgarden's first two EPs, \\"Screaming Life\\" (1987) and \\"Fopp\\" (1988). While at this early stage the band had yet to really hit its stride and evolve into a truly great band, early Soundgarden is definitely worth checking out if you're a fan. While the songwriting on these two EPs isn't as tight or memorable as their later albums, these early works are still quite good. One can hear a bit of the Stooges and Sabbath in Soundgarden and earlier Soundgarden in particular. Along with Tad, Green River and Mudhoney, early Soundgarden exemplifies the \\"grunge\\" sound: distorted guitars, intense drumming, and \\"the fuzz.\\" Although Soundgarden was always a bit more metallic than some of their Seattle peers. And while these two EPs are angrier, more aggressive and unadulterated than Soundgarden's later work, the band knew how to write good hooks even at this early stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry I waited on this one..","review":"After going through SERIOUS Soundgarden withdrawal, I had to finally pick this one up...I was not expecting much with this being a first release (an an EP, at that). BOY WAS I SURPRIZED ! The energy from LOUDER THAN LOVE and BADMOTORFINGER was always here ! You can hear the rawness and punk influence that Soundgarden began with, but it still leaves you wanting to hear more !HUNTED DOWN, ENTERING, TEARS TO FORGET are all hard rockers. NOTHING TO SAY is classic Soundgarden stuff with its heavy riffs... SWALLOW MY PRIDE is 70s-type of rock...WOW ! GOOD STUFF !IF ANYTHING, check out Chris Cornell actully RAPPING in the humorous LITTLE JOE...Yes, I said RAPPING !Soundgarden does it all...and does it all well. NOW what am I gonna do ? Wait for another solo project from Chris, I suppose."},{"rating":"1","title":"One keeper","review":"This is the birth of my favorite grunge band, but I'd have to say that the only song worth hearing more than once here is \\"Nothing to Say.\\" The others are attempts at sending up the whole heavy-metal genre's cliches, but they aren't too great. Strange how Soundgarden went from this to the layered darkness of its later recordings, though we would still get the occasional blasts of ironic humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap.","review":"This is not a good release compared to any other Soundgarden release which are just ok anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total F-ing Godhead!","review":"This CD is very good, considering it's a first release. It's not like the crap that came out of Seattle in the 90s, which I hate. This is darker. Instead of 'Fopp', they should've called their second EP \\"Total (CENSORED) Godhead\\", and put a bunch of new songs instead of just one & 3 covers. It's still good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good buy for Soundgarden fans. Not so much for non-fans.","review":"This is some good music. It is much more stripped-down than their later stuff, but the songwriting is still strong. The song quality is inconsistent, though. Very raw, it probably wont appeal to most people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Screaming Life/Fopp","review":"The first half of this CD (Screaming Life EP) is ideal early Soundgarden--a little rough around the edges, but it has some good metal tracks (\\"Hand of God\\" has some of the best guitar solos) and trademark Chris Cornell wailing, like in \\"Entering,\\" \\"Tears to Forget,\\" and \\"Nothing to Say,\\" though the middle song sounds more like AC/DC. However, the remaining half of this CD (Fopp EP) is pretty short and skippable, though \\"Fopp\\" is an unexpectedly fun song, both versions. Even though \\"Screaming Life/Fopp\\" is one of my least listened to Soundgarden CDs, it's still worth checking out if you're a diehard Soundgarden fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative Reflected in a Not-Only-Valentine's Day Tale","review":"My six year old took the board book version of this book out of my hands.

When I first put them on..., my bike handled quite a bit differently. Diving into turns, I did not seem so confident with these. The bike felt as it it were drifting.

These tires are just plain weird."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mean cutting machine!","review":"I bought this blade to cut cellulose PVC trim boards as the manufacturer recommends a blade with around 30 teeth. This blade cuts so quick and smooth. It is a very heavy well made blade. The carbide tips are excessively wide(which is a good thing for ripping)so you end up losing a good deal of material when cutting trim. The wide carbide also made it more difficult to set the laser guide on my miter saw, however it was still possible. Overall, great blade.

Salsa de verdad","review":"Definitivamente este es el mejor album de Victor Manuelle porque tiene una mezcla de salsa clasica y la salsa que nos hemos acostumbrado de el, que es la salsa romantica. Las 2 mejores canciones sin duda son las que esta con Eddie Palmieri \\"Puerto Rico 2006\\" y \\"Dos Generaciones\\" donde Victor nos encena que es un sonero de veras, cosa que otros salseros como Marc Anthony no lo son y esto hace a Victor Manuelle en el mejor salsero del momento. Estas canciones dan ganas de bailar y nos recuerda la salsa vieja y dura pero Victor no pierde su salsa romantica con temas como \\"Nuestro Amor Se A Vuelto Ayer\\" que hacen este album en un clasico. Las 2 canciones con Hector el father y Don Omar la verdad no me gustan tanto pero eso es para otros gustos. Se los recomiendo este album a cualquier fanatico de la salsa y como dice el sonero de la juventud \\"para aquellos que pedian 'cantame salsa tradicional' \\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use Your Hard-Earned Money Elsewhere","review":"Wow was I disappointed with the performance of these clamps. First of all, they scratched and marred the wood faces to required extensive sanding to remove. Next, they are much more difficult to operate than advertised as the clamping pressure is lost when trying to squeeze together a joint (I was using dowels which can be very difficult to join). Finally, I found the removal of the clamps very awkward and had to release some of them with a hammer.

Secondly, all this book does is throw in a couple hundred names of designers and places. Third, when the author speak of different designs which were created by people there are no images to back it up, so you really can't produce an image in your head of what the author is describing, the images that are in the book are mainly black and white and drawings which really didn't give me a sense of what the designer was trying to portray.

These now 80 year old houses were often constructed in newly developed subdivisions. Now many of these subdivisions are being discovered as artistically attractive, close to town, shopping, entertainment. The bungalow houses often retain their characteristic style, and many even contain their original fittings such as light fixtures, plumbing, fireplaces.This time, this style of home was made for Art Deco.This book shows how these houses would have been decorated when they were new.

I was replacing a 6 year old JVC shelf system that was superb. Right out of the box this changer had a bad habit of stopping play for no apparent reason during multi-disc shuffle play. I changed discs, using a variety of pre-recorded discs and CD-R's, and wasn't able to pinpoint a reason for the stoppages. There didn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it. Sometimes the player played for a couple hours, and sometimes it would stop after only a song or two. It seemed to stop only while it was between tracks. After two weeks of playing with it, I exchanged it for another player (same model), which did the exact same thing. Finally, I took the unit back today for a refund and bought a higher-priced Onkyo changer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in this Sony product.","review":"I had to get a new CD player for my stereo system and purchased this one because it was a Sony.

Three months into owning this thing the carousel doesn't work property - it picks and chooses what CD's to play (one try a CD will play, the next try the same CD won't play). It's completely frustrating. It even skips while playing brand new CD's. Of course it can't go back to the store and spending money shipping it back to Sony ends up being as much as buying a new player. Save your money on this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"Pros: Easy to set up, easy to use, good sound quality, great price.Cons: optical digital output cable not included, no MP3 playback, no remote (though Sony receiver remote works fine).The conflict of interest inherent in Sony's decision to buy a US record label is clear in products like this. The lack of MP3 playback capability is an obvious shortcoming in the product driven by the record label's attempts to squash music piracy. Sony as a company needs to understand that MP3 is just a music format, a format Sony should support because their customers want it. People violate copyright law; MP3 is just a technology standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning visuals....strange universe","review":"This film to me was a facinating \\"remake\\" of sorts of \\"The Eye\\" Where as \\"The Eye\\" was a horror movie, \\"Naina\\" is more of a twisted Disney land.It is bright and colorful, with a creepy undercurrent.

The wireless works great and I was able to use it on my computer using a converter, but without the analog stick I can only play fighting games and I must swap out controllers if I want to play something else that needs the second stick."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BUY!","review":"Calling alone is a great and sweet pop ballad. Not too slow and not too fast Geri sets the right tempo for a romantic mood. The cd also contains the video of Calling which is in black and white (which is something Geri hasn't done since Look At Me).

I am a person who designs web pages. Since this book was only ten bucks, I thought I would give it a try. This book does an ok job of teaching JavaScript. It will clearly walk you though each of the basic JavaScript functions and give you one example of how it works. You can download all the examples used in the book from their web site. However, this book does not teach you how to use functions together to build applications. I wish the book had exercises using combinations of JavaScript functions. It teaches you about the pieces but not how to put them together to build a simple application. I thought that teaching you how to build simple JavaScript applications would give you a greater understanding of how the functions work. Overall, this book is worth the ten dollars I paid for it. However, I will probably look for another JavaScript book with more practical applications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of the better books of this series","review":"I bought this book because of other books I have read in the series.

All the examples are placed in message boxes which allows you to execute commands but doesnt show you how to really use JavaScript with a web page save making a pop up message box. Because Amazon didnt deliver the book in time for a gift I was able to send it back and dodge a bullet. I would recommend the JavaScript book from Visual, JavaScript: Visual Blueprint. It has a building on the fron and is around 300 pages. I would recommend other books from the In Easy Steps series but not this one.Cheers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantabulous CD!!!

It's the album where she had a hit duo with George Michael and, as sole (at least remotely) creative point, recorded \\"Jumpin'Jack Flash\\" (was Keith Richards on guitar at that particular song?).Don't get me wrong, if Jarreau sounds like Whitney Houston on this album, it still makes this CD better than the music of Celine Dion...

As other people have mentioned, in Chapter 8, page 114, they are conducting an interview and are using the wrong name for the victim!! They use the name Wilson McDonald when they are referring to Daniel Kresge. It was rather frustrating to have such a blatant error in this part of the book. Other than this and the fact that Del's name is spelled two different ways, I enjoyed this book. I wasn't surprised about the relationship change either, after all, Lucas has had a different lover in every book. (Maybe he is getting a little old for this.) Good mystery, don't mind the killer is identified before the end, most people have probably figured it out by then anyway. Hard to put down, hated it to end.

This book does not, exactly, meet up to the standards of previous books. Lucas Davenport is not the \\"loose cannon\\" that he was in the past. The search for the villain is not as compelling. I felt that another character in the book should have, either been the murderer, or, at least, an accomplice. This mystery woman could have been the missing element. John Sandford is one of my favorite authors. He seems determined to rehabilitate Lucas Davenport. (He tried in Winter Prey, and now, again in Secret Prey.) Maybe, he needs to read Mickey Spillane and make Lucas more like Mike Hammer, like he was in Eyes of Prey and Silent Prey, the best books of this series, by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Secret; It's Another Good One","review":"This is not only a good murder mistery of \\"Who Done It\\", but also of why were the victims picked; only the murderer knows for sure. Lucas and detectives Sherrill, Del, and Sloan do a great job unraveling the case and the author keeps you guessing the whole time. Oh you got small town cover up and big time banking politics in the one. Lucas has a new love interest in this one too, to help his recurring depression.

If Secret Prey is your first Sandford story then by all means go ahead and read the others that came before b/c this storyline is little on the slow moving side.

The rich and well to do have trouble in their sect and Lucas has his hands full once again. The start with the hunting, the stuggle for power in the bank, the suspense of who the suspects are make a good story. Lucas a has attacks on his loved ones as well. Through it he manges his usual affair with a fine lady, this time a co-worker. The cast, Sloan, The chief, Del, Loring, Sherril all live up to their billing. The \\"Cancun\\" ending had me laughing.

They always appeared to me to be generic suspense fiction. I must tell you how pleased I was to realize how wonderfully written this Davenport tale is. It is a finely crafted novel that lets you in on the secret mid-book, but captures your attention until the last page. I will admit this may not be the book for first time Sandford readers. It is a sequel and often difficult to pick-up on what was missed. However, it is still worth the effort!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Boring!","review":"As anyone who has read a few 'Prey' books will tell you, the first 50 pages are ALWAYS spine-tingling and terrifying. In this Prey book, we spend the first 100 pages going over all of the characters situations to encourage the reader to guess the killer's identity. This is done in a very slow and useless fashion. I don't think Sandford actually wrote this book, I think he had someone under 14 ghost-write this for him. By far, the worst Prey book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sandford Misses with \\"Secret Prey\\"","review":"You'll spend more time learning how the Corporate hierarchy works than being entertained in this latest installment of the \\"Prey\\" series. However, Sandford does have a way with climactic description, namely the prelude to the altercation between Lucas and the hick cop, and then the final confrontation with the killer. An unbelievable prelude to his new relationship also detracts from the reading experience. But hey, he was due for a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!","review":"John Sandford has historically been one of my favorite authors and the \\"prey\\" series among my favorite books, but this one PLAIN STINKS. Ridiculous character names (i.e. Bone, Weiner), grammatical errors, editing errors, and a rather slow moving plot plague this book.

Boring, slow, stupid, dull...I will try another one, One other one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am an avid fan of Sandford's Prey Series, but this book was a tremendous letdown. I had major problems maintaining any kind of interest mostly because the characters are duds, including Lucas. Previously, reading any of Sandford's other novels in this series was a pleasure--words flowed and the plot was flawless--but this book just \\"ain't all that and a bag of chips too.\\" I really hope Certain Prey doesn't turn out to be the letdown this novel was."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good ride!","review":"I'm new to John Sanford, but I read two previous books before starting \\"Secret Prey.\\" I thought it might be nice to know a little bit of the hero's history. The two books I read were pretty brutal and graphic, but I liked Lucas Davenport.I read \\"Secret Prey\\" in one day...and I enjoyed it. I thought the plot moved right along and I liked the little side trip the author took with the silver-haired opium club.I look forward to other Lucas Davenport stories...and I like him with the lady cop much better than I liked him with the lady surgeon. The lady cop understands the nature of his work and she doesn't take anything from him that she doesn't give right back, in spades. There's more fire and vinegar in this relationship and I thought it really rang true.\\"Secret Prey\\" is a great summer book....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another strong entry in Sanford's \\"Prey\\" series","review":"I enjoyed \\"Secret Prey\\" thoroughly. It divides into two separate parts. The first part is essentially a whodunit. I was entertained as my probable suspect, in classic whodunit fashion, was promptly murdered. After I got further into the book, however, I realized that the author cheated somewhat in this first section--even an astute reader will not be able to guess the killer. The second half of the book is much better. It gets into the mind of a smart, creepy killer, who can match strategy step-for-step with Lucas Davenport. This is reminiscent of the best of the \\"Prey\\" series, like \\"Eyes of Prey\\". I'd give this book a try, and stick with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say - I'm a fan","review":"I've been reading the Davenport series on my tablet, in chronological order and I highly recommend this approach. I'm going to try it with other character series books that I like.

This latest venture gets off to a slow start as Sandford takes on the task of introducing a whole slew of corporate nasties who may also be murderers. This completed, the novel takes off like a rocket. Few can write action/suspense as cleanly and economically as Sandford. A great read that will satisfy long-time fans and new readers equally. Ignore the cheap homage to Carl Hiassen in the middle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yaaawwwwnnnnn.....","review":"Well, this is my first attempt at reading a \\"Prey\\" novel. I really could not get much farther than the character \\"Del Capslock\\"....I found that such a repulsive name for a character. Why not \\"Tab Esc\\" or \\"Alt Shift\\"?

Mark captures and comfortably fits in with the roots of the music, while inserting a dose of his own playful whimsy that I am coming to know with his singing and the sound of his harmonica. This is music that is authentic and fun to listen to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Go","review":"Normally I don't review this way, but because so many people are venturing into the wonderful world of the Ipod I thought I give the heads-up. I can't get this program to run on my Mac. Yes, I have the right system requirements, and I promise I'm not a total moron who forgot to turn the computer on or something. Also, being a woman, I did read the instructions. No dice. I tried it on another one of my Macs, nothing. So either some copies of the program are flawed, or it is me, in which case beginners beware because I am not a beginner and the only way I'm getting a crunch out of this program is if I eat it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't convert commercial DVDs, others take forever!","review":"The front of the box states this is \\"The Essential Video Converter.\\" The first sentence on the back says \\"Roxy Crunch helps you easily convert your DVDs, movies and TV shows...\\"Ha! I was really excited to get this product. In my work, I often have to study cartoons and movies, and being able to store them on my Mac would really save me time. Installing this software was easy, and it was easy to learn how to use. But then... it wouldn't convert ANY of my DVDs. Yes, it does say it won't convert copy-protected material, but that information is in small print on the bottom of the box.I finally found a DVD it would convert, a promotional freebie. However, just one 30-minute segment took over an hour to convert! Not exactly SAVING me time!For what it's worth, I have a dual processor G5 with 2G of memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roxio Crunch for My mac","review":"I used this item a few times; however, it didn't function the way I hoped it would. I have since used other more funcional and professional items that I like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roxio Crunch too Slow","review":"This product is too slow to run on a normal PC with Windows XP. The processor usage goes to 100% or the PC crashes. I have tried several PCs with lots of memory and with no other applications running. But... still the PC crashes. I contacted Roxio tech-support. They opened a trouble ticket but then closed it without resolving the issue. Further communications to Roxio have resulted in no replies. So... do not buy this application. Go to WinX DVD and evaluate their solutions. These solutions are more reasonably priced and in fact deliver the promised features. The definition of quality is... it does what it is supposed to do. Roxio Crunch does not do... what it is supposed to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other products are better...","review":"I have to add my agreement to the other reviewers that this product doesn't do the one thing I wanted - convert a DVD for an iPod. I'm guessing it is an issue of copyright, but if I own the DVD why can't I watch it on my iPod? Plus, it is extremely limited in what products it is designed to work with.People who make home movies or personal films may find value in this software for converting those for the iPod, or uploading to youtube, but otherwise it is a complete waste. Other software programs do more for the same or less cost. It appears Roxio was so concerned with not stepping on copyright toes, they didn't bother giving consumers a useful product. Though I do not recommend Crunch, the new Roxio Creator Suite 10 is an excellent product for managing and manipulating multimedia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and pretty limited","review":"Installation was uneventful. I selected the first DVD in the \\"Area 88\\" set: three half-hour animes. You have the option of selecting languages and titles, and Crunch keeps the orginal Dolby soundtrack. But first: it cached all three selections, an agonizingly slow process. Then, when I selected \\"Itunes\\" as the target destination, it didn't default to the \\"Library - Movies\\" section. Why not? In fact, Crunch didn't even SEE that destination. Now for the converstion. Whaaaaaat?? It hung at \\"0% complete\\" for at least 30 seconds, then sloooooooowly started. At the rate it was working, it would have taken hours to convert the material. DVD Fab does the same job in probably half the time. And guess what? It will only convert unencrypted DVDs, so don't count on this as your tool for loading your video Ipod.There are free products out there that do the job, and do it faster, than Crunch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Choices Elsewhere","review":"It is indeed unfortunate that this company, which is known for its reliable software, would put out a product that is not an improvement of the video converter programs that already exist. Unlike some other users, I did not have any techincal problems converting various types of files. However, like everyone else, I did experience excrutiatingly slow conversion of files; much longer than the videos themselves. Moreover, I thought the user interface was not very intuitive and did not allow the user much in the way of customization. Look into dvdclonemobile or other programs mentioned in the other reviews. This company needs to demonstrate in a revised version why this program is necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Price","review":"As far as paid products for compressing and ripping this just isn't up to snuff. It doesn't give you any idea on progress. There is a bar at the bottom when you are ripping something - but how long it will take is never known. There are free softwares that do a much better job of this. It is easy to install. Easy to understand. But doesn't do movies or music that is protected (which is like 99.9% of all movies). I wouldn't spend the money to buy this software, I'd download something for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONLY FOR HOME VIDEOS!","review":"I felt like an idiot the moment I installed this on my computer ready to load my movies to my computer, then to my ipod.

Just a friendly warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word: it doesn't work!","review":"Maybe if you are a computer techie you can get this to work. I couldn't.

There is no instructions and the help menu is terrible; no help there."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best part about crunch is that it's easy to un-install....","review":"What is it about media converters? No one can make a stable, fast one-click converter. I had my hopes up about Roxio, because I've used some of their software in the past, and it was decent. So I'll give it 1 star for Roxio the brand, and easy installation/un-installation.However, as other reviewers noted, the rest of it stinks. It's an absolute system hog, even though I'm running a 3.4 Ghz computer with 4 gigs of RAM.And then mid way through, my computer locked up and I had to reboot. Well, time for the uninstall.I wouldn't touch this with a ten foot stick, even if you gave me the stick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Useful","review":"I was really looking forward to this product. I'd heard that it was possible to save your DVDs in a format that would make them transferable to ipods. Great idea, how can I do that? This product looked to fit the bill exactly. Well, it's not very difficult to install, but that is about the only good thing about this product. I tried to transfer several commercial DVDs and none of them worked. When I pulled them up, there was an icon with a lock on it--no explanation, but after a while it became clear that commercial DVDs won't transfer. So, after all that, I'm still looking for the product that will help me transfer DVD movies to my ipod. Maybe this is something the movie industry won't let me do, but I warn anyone who is thinking of buying this product to consider what they will use it for. If you want to transfer your own movies, that'll probably work, but if you want to run out and buy Knocked Up so you can watch it on your ipod during your commute to work, this won't help you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Do I Need This?","review":"I'm confused. When I saw the description for this product, I thought I could convert my DVD library to digital format and watch it on my iPod.NOT!I already have a product that can do that, actually. It's called AoA DVD Ripper. Works great.CONS:Took a long time to install on my Windows XP SP2 PCNo documentation. Took me quite a while to figure out what the \\"lock\\" icon over the DVD meant. It means, \\"You can't copy this DVD.\\"What possible use is this product?PROS:It's a 1.0 product. Maybe it'll get better.In summary, if you (like me) saw \\"DVD Conversion\\" and thought \\"DVD Ripping,\\" think again. Crunch does not do that (and if you hunt around long enough, you'll find this explained somewhere in the fine print.) I can't wait to read a review from someone describing how they found value in this software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crunch by Roxio","review":"Roxio Crunch Win/Macworks, as far as converting video to an iPod formate--however, it can NOT rip DVDs that have copy protection, which most movie DVDs have.

It is a quick read and at times gets very heavy into the statistics. The basic problem of the French is they are outgunned and towards the end of the war outmaneuvered almost everywhere. Dull does a wonderful job with clear prose of illustrating this and it is a great book for someone who wants to learn more about the Seven Years war. This is not a good intro book to the war but once you have a basic sense it is a great way to expand your knowledge. It is highly recommend for colonial students that want to learn why the colonies shaped the way they did and how the dominance of France was replaced by an empire where the sun never sets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Naval History","review":"This book is more about the colonial empire of France than it is about naval history. Great if that's your interest, but it was't mine, and it's not what I bought the book for.

I have close to an acre of ground and its totally fenced and was somewhat skeptical about a cordless product. A lot of edging and trimming around fence, house, and driveway, flowerbeds, trees, gutter ditch, dog run, 4-car garage area. However this trimmer is so easy to use and it cut everything I wanted and still had battery power. I have used it four times since purchasing and it still has the original trimmer line in it. I can't believe it, so lightweight and since I am a woman its great. I hung it in garage and keep it plugged in all the time. When I am ready to use it, its ready to go. I am very happy with this product.

You only end up with about 3\\" of string during the lightest of trimming. And now the lower bearing in the motor is worn out. I guess I'll strip the battery out of it and trash the rest.If you need to trim anything but the LIGHTEST of grasses, this machine is not of any value to you.And, customer support from Black &Decker is nothing more than a bunch of form letters... and they are automatic and have nothing to do with your queries.I was poised and ready to purchase their cordless mower, but with the experience I have had (or lack of) with their \\"customer support\\" and the quality of this product, I have purchased another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap case/trigger assembly","review":"Used my cordless trimmer twice and the switch case / plastic assembly fell apart.

It was 99% sex with strangers, and to me, that just isn't erotic, it's empty. Just as this book and the characters in it were empty and didn't make me care one way or the other what the out come might be for them. Especially the cute blond neighbor who'd slept with every guy , and girl, on campus, only to of course, fall in love with the one guy who makes her wait. Snore. Not to mention, he is only inspired to make his move after she'd hosted an orgy, his reason being that, what? He doesn't want her to get used to stuff like that. Stuff like what?

Some of the interludes and sampling on the album border on the bizarre (Wilson, Etienne Gonna Die) but most of it is terrific, 60s-inspired pop. Spring and Nothing Can Stop Us are absolute classics....I still love those songs 11 years later and they always pop up on any CD compilation I burn, and their cover of Only Love Can Break Your Heart is fantastic. Incidentally, though many people compliment Sarah's vocals on that track, it is not Sarah singing, but the singer she replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunny electro dance Brit pop.","review":"In the beginning Saint Etienne was just two men, Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs. They produced a few singles (tracks 2, 13, and 10, in that order), with various personnel doing the vocals, and it was their third vocalist, Sarah Cracknell, who became the voice of the band. Foxbase Alpha was their debut album, including all previous singles, some new songs, and some experimental sample-based pieces (1, 3, 11). The sound combines the sunny optimistic styles of 60's Brit pop with 80's electro and dance. Want to feel generally good about life?

Even if you disregard the promotional hype that the Second Season Edition contains \\"Outtakes\\" and \\"Commentaries\\", the cover of the box set proclaims it is \\"Loaded With Extras\\". It is loaded all right, but not with extras. It is loaded with mistakes and printing errors. And no \\"Commentaries\\" or \\"Outtakes\\". There is no excuse for a DVD Video company to be so careless with their product. Indexes and menus are intended to help the viewers navigate the programs, not hinder them. Criticism aside, I bought this box set because I am a fan of the show. The episodes are funny and entertaining, even if the final product is not. Shame on NBC Home Entertainment. You are a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"The Season 2 DVD box set of \\"Will & Grace\\" was released on March 23rd. The 4-disc set includes all of the season 2 episodes along with 12 featurettes. Previously specified outtakes and commentary tracks were not included. The set also contains numerous print errors and mastering errors. Errors include: mis-aligned cursor graphics in the menus on 16x9 televisions; incorrect episode order (particularly Disc 4); featurettes are spread across all 4 discs - not on disc 3 as printed; one-hour season finale split into two episodes rather than shown as originally aired (and are the first 2 episodes on Disc 4); episodes not on the disc specified in the print; episodes missing content aired in the original broadcast (\\"Ben?

I'm not saying it doesn't have a right to exist, that the cause of civil rights needs to beaten down to the ground, that internment camps should be built.

Down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine season in awful DVD presentation","review":"While many have observed the Season 2 finale, presented in this set as two parts, carelessly appears at the *beginning* of Disc 4 rather than the end, no one has pointed out that the original broadcast of the Season 2 finale was NOT in two parts at all: it was an hour-long episode. The two-part division was made for later syndicated reruns. More importantly, substantial cuts were also made, totalling three missing minutes. As I read on this site, this shameful situation is the same in all of Seasons 5 and 6 (probably 7 and 8 as well), where the cut, syndicated versions are used--the same ones people can see for free in daily TV reruns. We buy TV shows on DVD to see them in their original form, so with many Will & Grace DVDs, we're getting cheated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Episodes, Mediocre DVD","review":"This is some of the best Will & Grace of all time! I'm getting hours of enjoyment out of this DVD set. Others have been complaining about the fact that some episodes are out of order, and that is true. However, this is still an outstanding set with a wonderful value. You'll be a little confused at first about the fact that, due to the mix-up, Will magically teleports from the Caribbean island to New York, but that's a very small detail. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but lacking.","review":"I love this DVD box set. I love Will & Grace as well. That's why I have Season 1 as well on DVD. I have no real problems with the way this DVD box set has been assembled. Only thing missing is the ability to watch the show in Spanish(dubbed), being that I'm bilingual. That's why I love Season 1. I get twice the laugh on that 1. Maybe they will re-release Season 2 dubbed in Spanish. If you're bilingual like I am, you'd know what I'm talking about. Can't wait for Season 3 on DVD!

She seemed to give the band a needed contrast to Kristin Hersh's depressive songs.I am a fan of Belly and the Breeders, so it should be no surprise that post-Donelly Throwing Muses has very little appeal to me.

We have found it to be accurate, easy to use, readable from the person standing on it, easy to keep clean, convenient to stand on(plenty of foot-space), reasonable in cost.If there is any aspect needing a change, it is the metal used for the scale. I note that after some years, the edges of the scale are rusting a very small amount. The scale seems to be painted metal, so the company might want to consider a different coating for the metal or to use, for example, stainless steel. We like the plastic weight markers that are around the scale meter, as one can slide one of the 4 markers to a target weight one wants to achieve, ormark where one is so that changes can be seen at a glance, etc.Tannyscot 5 Dec 2009"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice size, easy to read","review":"I like this scale because it has a large area to stand. I also like it because it is very easy to read. It does seem to not be exact, but within a couple pounds. You can get on and off several times in a row and be a pound or two up or down each time. But, if you don't need it to be exact, it is a nice scale. I had a similar one which my husband smashed under the garage door which had chrome around the numbers and that turned green which was kind of nasty so I prefer the white plastic on this one.

I gave it 3 hours to get up to temperature (from 45 to 70 degrees, seems reasonable to me), and it was still 20-30lbs light.

It arrived quickly and has the same great taste as the product I brought back from Austria. My only quibble is that I can't get the organic oil that I found over there, but it's pretty much a case of beggars can't be choosers when it comes to finding this oil in the US.

I bought this for my oldest as a substitute to paying for preschool the year before kindergarten. Now that I he is a 2nd grader, and my next oldest is just finishing at a professional preschool, I can see that the book is seriously lacking in explaining how to prepare your child for kindergarten. A good preschool will mimic kindergarten by having a routine with the children where weather, numbers, handwriting, reading, fine motor skills (cutting and gluing), large motor skills, and structured play are built in every day. Typically with stations to rotate through. The themes are added in to give meaning to each practiced skill.

I was quite thrilled by it then and i still am now at the age of 18. Ofcourse when i heard it was a sequel i was thrilled. 'Cause everyone says sequels aren't as good as their predecessors. Anywhoo, i sought out When a Stranger Calls and was quite disappointed. It was a good movie but When A Stranger Calls Back is far superior. I think the long-lasting presence of Carol Kane was the redeeming factor of this movie. It was quite entertaining and thrilling to see Kane's characters turn from the frightened girl in When a Stranger Calls to the independent and tough woman in When a Stranger Calls Back.This is the type of movie that will have you feeling genuinely frightened and tense and you will cheer for the very woman empowering finale and showdown between Carol Kane and the killer."},{"rating":"2","title":"When a stranger calls back.","review":"I watched this with my friend when we were alone in the house and it scared us both to death. The beginning is fantastically good, very scary and continuous and when your not scared(which isn't often!) you can try to work out how it's done. However the rest of the film is horrendously awful and pointless, except for the very end which is very clever, though I still havent managed to work out who the murderer is (but Go Jill!). It's great if you like psychological scary films but not if you like blood and guts horror films."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first twenty minutes or so","review":"The opening sequence of this movie, yet another variation on the \\"When a Stranger Calls\\"/\\"Scream\\"/\\"Scream II\\" yarn about the imperiled babysitter, does it better than any movie I've ever seen. What distinguishes it is (1) the babysitter here is intelligent, mature, and kindhearted, and you identify with her moral quandary, and (2) for the longest time, you just don't know that the person she's dealing with isn't as innocent as she is. It's the moral dilemma that draws you into the situation, and it's the realistic, could-easily-happen details that get under your skin. The rest of the movie is good, though inevitably not as good, and it drops off a second time once the plot conveniently sideswipes the babysitter character so that Kane, who starred in the original, can take over. But it still stays above the pack all the way through, and the ending is one of those that I hear people talk about even if they can't quite remember which movie it was from."},{"rating":"2","title":"a 90's classic","review":"Who ever thought a sequel 14 years later would be just as terifying as the original. Director Fred Walton gives the old \\"babysitter receives phone calls\\" legend a completely new twist while remaining loyal to the original film. Using Carol Kane and Charles Durning's characters in a new story and situation rather than just continuing Kane being stalked is one of the best ideas to come along in years and keeps the events fresh. The mood remains suspenseful and though certain plot twists seem a bit far-fetched, the story and actors make it seem entirely plausible. Prepare to find the first 15 minutes just as unbearably terrifying as the first 15 minutes of the original. Too bad more people didn't get a chance to see it when it originally came out on showtime. It definitely makes me await Part 3 anxiously!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When A Stranger Calls Back","review":"I just watched the movie last night on TNT. I think the movie is great. The opening where she is babysitting is very scary. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. It kept showing the door being locked. I was just waiting for her to look at it and find it unlocked. I thought the movie was very good in my opinion. But I think the first part where she is babysitting is the most suspenseful. I didn't care too much for the ending. It left you not knowing about the little kids, if they were ever found or not.

The first scenes will haunt you for a few months and I gurantee you will never want to babysit again. The tactics of this stalker scared me out of my wits. He left little signs he had been in the house, opening a door the main character had just checked, ripping out paper from a notebook the main character had just written on.

It doesn't rip through them like the blade I use with hardwoods, but then that blade makes a total mess of melamine in particular.

Putting aside the known improbability (I'm a former jet fighter pilot)of a non-pilot being able to quick-study command and control of a B-747, even with expert coaching, Black's emoting captivated me to the point where I BELIEVED her; she made it real for me.

Basically the central premise is a lawyer joke--e.g. \\"How do you know when a lawyer's lying? Her lips are moving\\". I believe Sandford had this great idea for a contract killer character in Rinker, and tried to wrap a novel around that character. Mr. Sandford--you can't have neat, symmetrical TV miniseries morality and produce a the kind of novel that frightens and enthralls fans. The easy and ridiculously improbable ways Lucas finds clues in this one make it seem like Sandford was just wearily pugging in plot details. Plus, the demise of C.L. was just bizarre and meaningless.

Clara Rinker and Carmel Loan could have been electric, much like Becker and Carlos (?) in two of the other Prey books (titles escape me at the moment!), but the desire wasn't there on the part the author -- although I hope Clara will be back for another go 'round with Lucas. It would be nice to flesh out her character a little more. But I'll wait for paperback for that one -- Certain Prey has cured me of buying hardcovers!

Davenport always rings true as a character and in this book I also found the two prime women characters -- the hotshot lawyer and the unerring hitlady -- very well done, if somewhat unbelieveable.

About three-quarters of the way into it I realized that the two women protagonists were so one-dimensional and uninteresting that I just did not care whether Lucas caught them or not! It seems that all the typical Sandford police department banter and wit was missing from this book, and Lucas was as bland and boring as when what's his name from ER played him recently in a forgettable Prey movie on HBO or one of those networks. Come on John! I know you can do better than this! I think you need to sit down with your very first Prey book (since the one right before Certain Prey was awful too)and read it. Maybe then you will be able to make the comparison. Let's get Lucas back to his borderline psycho state and let's get some real nasty bad guys!

I thought she personified Davenport, if he could be reincarnated as a woman. The only way to capture this was for her to be on the wrong side of the law. I think Sanford has tried to capture this with other women in his books, but just isn't able to do it with her as a cop or civilian. The book was fast paced and full of action.

Try harder, John."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murder novel? More like bored to death!!","review":"I have read every Prey novel and this one was such a let down. Not enough Lucas Davenport, to much Thelma and Louise. Where was our tough guy Lucas? The one who is sensual, intriguing and smart? Instead all the reader gets is the very boring story of a women who has been treated badly by men who then turns to a murder for hire career. Give me a break!!! A real yawn fest!!!

If you have yard work to do that you hate or a chance to read this book----- get out the mower!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Phoned In","review":"Davenport is one of the better lead characters alive in the genre today, but the reader can't help yawning most of the way through Certain Prey. The writing almost sounds as if Sanford has lost his way and his will just as Davenport has on the pages of this series.In this genre the reader has to be prepared to suspend disbelief from time to time. This novel, however, requires far too many lapses of reason. Characters act out of character. Much of the scenery is black and white. And, Davenport goes way outside the lines of the law, which is a luxury a private detective has, but a public one does not. Too much to overlook.If you've never read a Lucas Davenport novel, don't start here. If you're a Lucas Davenport fan read this book, but be warned that this is far from the best we've seen in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"The author could at least try and make the characters believable.

Now I read at least thirty plus books a year even with my busy practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this really a Lucas Davenport book?","review":"The focus of this book is the killers, Clara and Carmel: Their motivations, rationales, actions. Lucas almost -- ALMOST -- is a secondary character, and would be save for the fact that he plays such a large part in the killers' reasoning and responses. Though I enjoyed \\"Secret Prey\\" more as a total story, \\"Certain Prey\\" is worth reading just for the ending alone. Sandford sure knows how to write a closing that actually satisifies while still leaving the door open for new possibilities. I know Sandford writes faster than one book a year. Can't we get the publisher to break down and publish more frequently???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing--lacks believability we expect from Sanford","review":"This new Prey book seems shallow and not well-thought out as if Sanford were under pressure to make it to the market. Accustomed as we are to his usually on-the-money characters, this book is peopled with characters that don't fit their own profiles. A successful lawyer that doesn't manifest any psychopathic behavior prior to becoming an out-of control serial killer?? A shrewd, career criminal who compromises all her own self-preservation standards?? Sanford needs to retake Psych 101."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an exciting, engrossing and original story.","review":"\\"Certain Prey\\" is the first Sandford book that I have read and I was pleasantly surprised by its quality. The character of Clara Rinker is one of the most delightfully orginal villains I have ever come across. You can't hate her even though she's a sociopath, because she's funny, smart articulate and somewhat poignant. It's hilarious that she wants to strike up a friendship with Carmel, a truly coldblooded witch. Clara says that she'd like a girlfriend, since she's never had one of those. I also love the way Clara handles the hit men that are sent to get her. The plot is workmanlike, the dialogue is witty and clever and the ending is satisfying. The character of Davenport is fine, especially since he doesn't come across as infallible as so many police detectives do. I recommend this book to readers of police procedurals, especially to fans of Ed McBain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovers and snipers","review":"This Lucas Davenport novel is one of the better ones. Well, they are all great, but the main-characters apart from Lucas Davemport and his team, are criminal women. And they are as hardcore as the male villains and serial killers we have met in other Davenport novels. Carmel is a high profile lawyer falling in love with a married man. As Carmel is used to get whatever she wants, and also is a sociopath, she is quick to put a contract out on the man's wife. She is recommended the female hit-woman Carla. Carla quickly takes out the wife, and Carmel can start her affair with the widowed man. But pretty soon things start to go wrong, and Carla is forced to bond with Carmel, and from then on, one killing takes another. Not only is Lucas Davenport on the look-out for them, the FBI is also trying to find them, and the book is a pageturner, an exciting and quick and satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT FROM SANDFORD","review":"As a big Prey fan who was extremely disappointed with Sandford's last novel (Sudden Prey), I held hope that this would be more along the lines of his earlier novels. No such luck. Boring, boring, boring are the three words I would use to describe this book. The only reason I finished it at all was because I was on a trip and it's the only book I had!! Don't waste your time...read one of the earlier ones instead!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who likes brutality?","review":"I'll be brief. This is the most brutal book I have ever read. I guess I'm not into brutality and torture. I quite reading at about page 150 because I'd had enough. I didn't really care if the two psychopaths described got caught or not. I don't see any reason for books like this in a country that should be interested in psychological improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Glowing Reviews must have been written by relatives.","review":"After forcing myself to finish this poor excuse for a novel - I have come to the conclusion that the glowing 5 star reviews written for this book must have been written by Mr. Sandford's relatives. This read like a reject script from a network tv crime show. Carmel Loan and Clara Rinker are not at all believable. Davenport's skills as a deputy are more a product of luck than skill. Amazing how everything turns up in no time at all. Just in time for the commercials. Whew! Since this is my first (and last) Sandford book - I can only speculate that he got the book deal based on his past journalistic accomplishments - not his literary skills. I will be a very cautious buyer next time I shop at Amazon and will not look to these reviews as a kind of guidence to buy the book. Can I get my money back?! djp@capgroup.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sandford hits the bullseye!","review":"This is a really good read. For once, Lucas is not quite as \\"on top of things\\" as usual. I know my sense of humor is off beat, but there were times when I was actually laughing over poor ole' Lucas' utter bewilderment as the action unfolded. Too bad the hit lady is beyond redemption. She is a real match for Lucas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed sandford fan","review":"I only recently began reading John Sandford's \\"Prey\\" novels and was addicted until i read this one. I wouldn't go so far as to say I would not read any of his new works, however, this one was almost a waste of my time. I found the characters very difficult to relate to-I never felt I knew them, as I have with past books. Lucas did not seem to be the same person, the person I had come to expect. While reading the other books in the series, I found it extremely difficult to put them down; this one was difficult to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to first Prey novels.","review":"I liked Lucas better when he was with Weather. He showed more depth of character. I felt sorry for Sherrill who still had feeling for him. His killers are getting very BORING! Bring back the psychos please. I enjoy when Lucas is stalking his prey and delving into their minds. Eyes Of Prey and Winter Prey, now that's a true Sanford experience. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A page turner!","review":"From the first page to the last, Certain Prey kept my attention. John Sanford allows his characters to develop in such a manner that you are always second guessing him in your mind. Took me three days to complete the reading - and I had to take it to Altantic City to finish it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"His best?","review":"I like all Davenport novels. But seems the best to me because Sandford has changed the pattern of these novels slightly here. Not only is Davenport not in one of his periods of depression. But this time his genius is not the only factor that solves the case. Like in real life accident plays a great role. When he finds out about Tennex he sees it from a completely different angle than Clara Rinker when she found the name. And there are still more examples. In this book Davenport becomes a little more human than in the others. I enjoyed every single page of it. Come on, John, let us have more Davenport stories!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm 5'3\\" . . .","review":"I'm 5'3\\".

FORBIDDEN is an engaging read and one which I recommend if you can't resist strong, sensitive heroes. Josh is one of the sweetest romance heroes I've ever come across. He's sexy, supportive, patient, tender and wears his heart on his sleeve. He's not afraid to confess his love even though he knows it may not be returned, and he's even willing to give up the heroine if that's what she wants.

It seems to have worked. She's introduced many of the featured ingredients and cooking techniques into her meal preparation for herself and her young son. The fact that the book is published by Mayo Clinic lends it substantial credibility. The recipes are creative, plentiful, beautifully photographed, and easy to follow.

I've looked through it several times and haven't found anything that even looks appealing.

When Mr. Garcia passed away that was truly the end of the Grateful Dead as an active creative group. What we have now are record companies, who continue to cash in on their library of stored away live grateful Dead music.

I also enjoyed as always the upbeat songs such as \\"Good Lovin'\\" and \\"I know You Rider.\\" \\"Looks Like Rain\\" also was very well done.

It seems that Grave manages to get closer to their earlier sound (80s & 90s) each album since 'Back from the Grave' & comes close at times & dare I say, even right on the mark on this release; and boy this was desperately needed. Not to say that the last 2 albums were bad, they were great but they were often mid-paced throughout & they even managed to get even SLOWER at times & it sometimes would make you lose interest. On 'As Rapture Comes' you will still hear some of those similarities from the last 2 Grave releases but as I was eluding to, this time there are faster songs but even heavier than on the early Grave albums which makes for a much better listen! Look out, Grave is back w/ a vengeance...and folks the GODLY Peter Tagtgren is back as producer so there is no need to fear! Metal at it's heaviest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a Dive into the Deep","review":"This movie demands your full attention from beginning to end! If you blink, you'll miss an intricate detail in this well crafted science fiction thriller. Michael Biehn's absolutely brilliant protrayal of the main character, Joe Keyes, bonds you with Keyes until you think you're immersed in the action. John de Lancie, Star Trek's Q, plays the villian with credibility and style. As the film splices it's way to its climax, all the pieces fall together and leave you amazed at the brilliance of the plot and it's stylish filming. You'll want to hit the rewind button and rewatch it again with your eyes unscaled! This film doesn't disappoint the first time nor the fifty-first time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too much red for me","review":"this whole movie was.... well...about red.The concept sounded interesting since I like sci-fi and fantasy movies. Deep red is a substance that can make you immortal. A little girl has it in her body, and there are evil scientists who are out to get her. Even this simple storyline could have been made so much more interesting if (1) they did not spend a major portion of the movie just using the word \\"deep red\\"... it sounds cheesy after a while (2) the action scenes were better shot (3) they added some sidelines to the story rather than continuing with the monotonous main thread."},{"rating":"1","title":"oops","review":"when i bought this i thought it was the argento film but its just some 90's sci-fi action with some bad 3D effects"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Readable Reference Book","review":"Yes, this is a very thorough reference book wherein I feel like I am having an interesting chat with Lorna Sage about all of these fascinating authors, their books, and their times.

Because of that, I keep this book out of sight instead on the top of a table where I would rather have it for easy reference, and even for conversation starters.

For me, Hoff's original \\"Danny and the Dinosaur\\" is a classic work, a brilliantly simple book, with a lovely fantasy story and exquisitely simple, highly memorable illustrations.Unfortunately \\"Happy Birthday\\" was drawn by Hoff in his eighties, and the illustrations barely resemble the characters I know and love. Sad to say, it looks like the poor guy can barely control the pen. I can't deny that Hoff (and now, his estate) deserves every penny he could squeeze from his beloved characters, but the characters (and the readers) do deserve better than this weak sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Flaming Lips take chances...Luckily","review":"The Flaming Lips seem like a sort of morphous brilliance that has sporadic outputs of utter genius. This album is exquisite as it is rockish but also shuns the alternative sound by being quirky and rejecting the easy way. From the redundant, incongruent sound on the first track, I knew the album was a masterpiece. Their refusal to allow the song to be just another Dinosaur Jrish alternative ditty, they interject this annoying sound which does nothing to enhance the sound but at first is quite annoying. But to listen the Lips a lot is to understand this. In a sort of smarter Pavementish way they dont take themselves too seriously, but yet create such brilliant moments that are brilliant in there irony. The rest of the album is an echo of the first track. An equivocating voice coupled with layered instruments makes this a intensely delicious listening experience. Except for gingerale afternoon this album shines from beginning to end..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"The title pretty much says it all.

Bridging the gap between the ragged guitar madness of their previous albums and the pop mastery they'd later exhibit, the Lips (which at this point included Jonathan Donahue of Mercury Rev) write beautiful melodies, and then bury them beneath layers of gnashing guitars, used to best effect on \\"Frogs\\" and \\"Hit Me Like You Did the First Time.\\" It's good, noisy, psychedelic fun. -Chris Willie Williams"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unreleased material that shines as good as his best","review":"This double cd has songs that were previously unreleased. Aside from \\"A Small Cigar\\" the vast majority of tracks are definite keepers and propel you deeper into the universe of Jethro Tull and Ian Anderson's wonderful talent. Great tunes on these 2 CD's period ! Enjoy. I would have paid for a real cigar box had Ian been in touch with his true fans and not the marketing people that put it in a cute cardboard cigar box. Plus today's my birthday and I get to see Jethro Tull in concert in 3 weeks in a smoke free bar! Woo Hoo !

A very strange mix of tunes some of which work quite well -- some do not. The band shelved the effort and instead went back to the studio and produced the controversial Passion Play.CD #2 contains songs that never made it onto a Tull album and a number are terrific: Man of Principle, Silver River Turning, Truck Stop Runner, I Don't Want To Be Me, Broadford Bazaar among them. You get rock, folk, folk/country, etc. For me CD #2 and the few songs I liked on #1 made this one well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A toast to Tull for a treat!","review":"The first CD is nonsensical, but in a Very Good Way. It's much more playful than its cousin (A Passion Play), though it is quite interesting to listen to the two side-by-side just for the sake of comparison.The second CD leaves me, like many other reviewers, wondering why some of these songs were left off of the regular releases.

Could actually hear noises coming from inside the controller when moving the joystick to the right, so I assume that something broke in the inside.

The heroine is unique in American literature. Carla isn't an earth-mother, a sentimental fool, a quivering neurotic, a control freak, a femme fatale, or a bloodless nonentity. A feisty blond blues singer in love with a moody black musician, Carla is as capable of examining her soul as she is of questioning society's assumptions about color, shape, attitude, style, and hierarchy. She convinces us that she's got a right to sing the blues the way she sings the blues, and she always stops singing when the music stops. Madame Bovary, meet Carla. You could learn a lot from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"This emperor has no clothes","review":"Wow--did I read the same book the reviewers read? \\"Don't the Moon Look Lonesome\\" just earned the dubious honor of worst book our book group has read in over ten years. Crouch's thin and unconvincing portrayals of Max and Carla reflect a deeply rooted racism that would be unacceptable coming from any white author, and dropping a few names into the mix doesn't make it a book about the jazz scene. The \\"Don't the Moon Look Lonesome\\" that I read is misogynistic, homophobic, and profoundly antisemitic. To top it all off, Crouch's prowess as a journalistic writer isn't reflected here: his prose is alternately turgid and cliched, the book rambles badly, and it takes him far too long to say what he has to say--he could easily have offended as many people in half the number of pages. Where was this man's editor?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diappointing","review":"As an admirer of Crouch's essays, I was looking forward to this book. But fiction is an art that Crouch has not come anywhere near mastering as he has done with the essay form. This book reads like a stream-of-consciousness first draft that went straight to the publisher. Where is that laser-like precision with language Crouch is noted for? Not in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great on race","review":"I found \\"Don't The Moon Look Lonesome\\" to be a marvelous illuminating novel on America, and on race. I liked the wide sweep in the novel, and I find the fact that Crouch takes no one point of view, there are no stereotypes in this novel, amazingly refreshing. Crouch sees America to be an essentially mixed culture, and that our survival depends on ourselves accepting -- and celebrating -- that we are part of this mixed culture. Crouch's musical training -- his expertise on jazz -- serves him well, as there is a terrific undercurrent of the Blues and swing in this novel. Most important, the characters are original and great. Carla, the complicated white protagonist, carries the story forward. I think this is definetely a must book for those who want to know and understand what's happened to America since the l960s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't the praise look dishonest","review":"I quit after just a few pages of this book, because Crouch made some errors unworthy of a professional writer, misusing \\"whom\\" as the subject of a sentence, and making up a Yiddish word \\"zhlulbby,\\" when he presumably meant \\"zhlubby.\\" Crouch claims Saul Bellow as a \\"mentor,\\" but I wonder whether Bellow (who lauds the book on the inevitable back-cover blurb) even read this novel.The problems that Crouch was trying to write about deserve better treatment than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"i tried to like this book.","review":"honestly, i did...i spent over a month trying to get into it, even skipped some chapters. sometimes i think crouch tries too hard to show readers that he can write, by utilizing multiple voices, flashbacks, etc. it left me confused and it made the story very hard to follow. i tried to stick with it, because i loved the subject of interracial love, but the convoluted telling frustrated me..i may go back to it later...sometimes, less is more, stanley..."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous","review":"This cd is just fantastic and everyone on the radio should hear this talented new star.

Erhman's view is more liberal than other scholars but he also notes the more conservative views of other scholars. Overall his prose is easy to read and spiked with humor. Especially helpful are the numerous \\"boxes\\" or sidebars which provide interesting snapshots on various notable characters and incidents. Also helpful is the glossary at the end of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Challenging Text","review":"If you read this text and join a study group using the\\"Introduction to the New Testament\\" DVDs you cannot belp but learn something.

His self publication in the media, as a reactionary sceptic, in reaction to his former protestant (sola scriptura) fundamentalism means his work is suspect at best.Ehrman's origins as a naive fundamentalist were exploded at university and this embittered him to the point that he became a biblical iconoclast. This is not the foundation for sound scholarship. Ehrman's academic blood is poisoned. Any academic work Ehrman produces has a sceptical agenda which is either explicit or, in this case, implicit.

It appears that Mr. Ehrman doesn't have a conviction that Jesus was divine -- that he was the literal Son of God and that his ministry encompased more than good teachings; the ministry of Jesus brought about the atonement -- which gives man the freedom from sin. (I guess if you don't recognize that man is burdened by sin, then you don't need a redemtion (a Sacrifice) from sin). Well, there are too many good books about the REAL Teachings of Jesus Christ, that you don't need to waste your time reading about the Teachings of Jesus from a non-believer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Qualified Very Good","review":"Dr. Ehrman gave me a good review/update. I needed this very much as I earned my degree from seminary in 1958 and so much has happened since then. The book was very readable; it was in tended for his students. I appreciated his bibliography. As an historical overview it does not cover all the material that is necessary for a rounded education. Sometimes his conservative Christian theology creeps in to his evaluation of material. I find his insistance that Jesus is an apocalyptic prophet is unconvincing, and it pervades a good deal of his findings of other New Testament books. That John the Baptist was apocalyptic and that the early Christians had among them people who were apocalyptic is not proof of Jesus' position. I feel it is possible, but nopt probable. Read Crossan or Funk for another view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting reading","review":"I love this book! It offers such in depth analysis of biblical scriptures not traditionally taught.

This is a difficult read! Instead of being a purely scholarly presentation, it was 50% conjecture, mixed with the idea that you would know some of the scholarly research. There were multiple times where the author assumed the reader knew things no one but a student of Hadrian would. And fully more than half of the book dealt with Antinous, not Hadrian. (The author theorizes that Antinous was a homosexual lover of Hadrian, whose death an a trip to Egypt drove Hadrian insane.) What reading this book did for me was teach me that Hadrian was a fascinating individual--and I'd like now to read something about him. Previous to this, my only knowledge of him was that he commissioned a Wall in Northern England. Now I know that he commissioned thousands of projects all over the Roman empire. It is a pity the author didn't more than mention a few.

After those chapters the book pretty much ends. Speller relies on invented diary entries by an historic poetess to fill pages and clumsy attempts at irony and endless foreshadowing to give her narrative impetus.This book is not a travelogue filled with the sights, sounds, dangers and pleasures of a lost world.

It consisted mostly of period still photos with a voice-over of a man reading a script. There are some color clips of the site today, a tourist attraction. All the prisoner barracks and other important buildings are gone. One gets little sense of how Buchenwald looked back then.As for the central character, the villainess, she is a slightly cleaned up version of what I had read about her. According to this, many of the crimes of which she was accused were never proved, i.e., of having lampshades and other items made from the tatooed skin of slain prisoners, of hhaving shrunken heads, of having sex with prisoners and then seeing them killed. It almost feels as if she were not really an ogre at all but a somewhat misunderstood victim of her time.

She means no adoptions ever. Well of course I was totally throwed by that view. The author doesn't say what to with children if they don't get adopted. What a nut case I thought. I threw the book in the trash. The author is a birthmom, and I think because of her pain she had in her adoption plan, she thinks its best if all adoptions stop. I wouldn't pay much for this book.

Amazon recommended this to me and i got it and it is up there with any of my all time favorites now.Really great guitar playing! The songs are diverse but unified. Focused and wide at the same time.

Not for the listener who wants quick answers, Los Lobos incorporates a surreal, yet understandable mix of America in each song. It's a masterpiece that requires listening to again and again. Don't worry, all of the thier pioneering East LA sound is in here. But they enhance and layer a whole new essence to KIKO.

Two weeks ago it started turning super slow, so I tested the voltage of the charger and the battery and found the battery was bad. With this model you have to take upper part of this unit completely apart to remove the battery, which costs $27.00 at the local battery store. I tried the Black & Decker website and it's not listed. Not worth replacing, only to have small change when I get it running."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trimmer and no electric cord.","review":"What I like about this trimmer is I can trim the lawn without putting an electric cord out.

It's just your normal yard trimming around trees, fence, sidwalk, etc.The .060 trim line just doesn't hold up and the bump line feeder either continually jammed or didn't work at all. During the first and only use, I had to take the feeder apart roughly 6 times.The battery charge held up as I didn't loose power in the 15 minutes of actual operation time (not including repair time).It is light weight and easy to handle. Easy assembly.The unit was returned to the store after it's first use in exchange for a slightly more expensive gas trimmer.I would give this a one rating, but I'll give this trimmer the benefit of the doubt in hopes it can function in maybe a smaller setting.

The \\"theory\\" section on \\"how it works\\" bothers me because it uses a diagram where the earth is shown as flat and the star so close to the earth that it erroneously explains the difference in angle (as you move away from the position directly under the star) by simple trigonometry. In reality, stars are so far away that light rays from them are essentially parallel no matter where you are on earth (the sun and moon are closer and need a parallax correction, but this is a minor adjustment), so the difference in angle is due to the curvature of the earths surface. Understanding that the difference in angle is due to the curvature of the earth is so essential to understanding celestial navigation and why you need spherical trigonometry to solve this, I think the book does a disservice to the student by over simplifying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"Poorly recieved upon release due to a hopless marketing campaign that portrayed it as a comedy!

Like originality in your films? Good dialogue? Characterization? Basic coherence of plot and structure? Yeah? Then stay away from this [film]. And how can a movie so bad be so long? 3000 hours to Graceland is more like it, or 3000 hours to the poor plot device they made up to give this thing a title.

While I found myself really liking this movie, every once and a while something really silly would happen that would make me think 'NO WAY'.

I think the director get so envolved with a certain aspects of a movie that they completely overlook a bad line or bad acting or just something really stupid. This movie, from these reviews, is UNDER RATED. Overall, it is a cool action movie with some needless, but entertaining, violence.

It's a fast-paced, in your face action flick with a musical score to match. Yeah, it's got gratuitous violence and some far-fetched parts, but it doesn't bore you with too many details and criss-crossing sub-plots. It's a lot better than the over-cast and over-rated Oceans Eleven.I cant believe the slamming this movie got from some reviewers. ...

I like Kevin Costner, I like Kurt Russell and guys robbing a casino dressed like Elvis sounds fun. Well, sometimes the critics get it right. This movie is, in a word, awful. Kurt Russell tries his best with his part, but he can only do so much with the horrible script he's given. Costner's part is written even worse and he chews scenery like he's channeling Pacino. There are bad edits, scenes that make no sense and have nothing to do with the plot (what plot there is), and violence just for the sake of violence, sex for the sake of sex and nothing has anything to do with storytelling.

Do yourself a favor and leave this one on the shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Good, The Bad & The Pretentious","review":"This is a movie that wastes talent like spent rounds. You can tell this is an MTV director on crossover. They reveal themselves in their fervor to generate a style with almost no concept of how to run the plot threads of a feature length narrative.The sad part is that the \\"style\\" that is being generated is trite and visually mundane. Time compression photography as a transition between scenes is a look that is as old as time. The other slick camera moves just cry out \\"poor man's Matrix.\\"What's worse is that there are some decent actors in here in roles that they all should have been embarrassed to take. Christian Slater gets my vote for the most underused of the lot. Kevin Costner's lead is the Postman without a heart.Thank god more of the actors didn't try to step out of type, or this turkey would have sprouted megafeathers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A one of a kind movie","review":"In what may be the darkest comedy since \\"Very Bad Things\\", \\"3000 Miles to Graceland\\" is loud, nasty, violent, and funny as hell. Kurt Russell is getting too old to play the action hero, so its a twist of fate for him playing an Elvis impersonating antihero. The storyline is simple at first, Kurt Russell plays an Elvis lover who just got out of jail, has a fling with a surprisingly good Courtney Cox, then joins his old buddy fellow Elvis impersonator Kevin Costner and his partners Christian Slater and David Arquette. The plan is to go into a casino, rob it, and get out. But some things go wrong, and double crosses are abound. This may well be Kevin Costner's best performance ever as the maniacal, but hilarious, Murphy. A no holds barred dark action comedy that only those with a twisted sense of humor can truly appreciate, \\"3000 Miles to Graceland\\" is an underrated movie no one should miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunka Hunka Burnin' Doody","review":"I imagine Elvis Presley alive somewhere in North Dakota, perhaps going in disguise to the video store, purchasing Frito's and a Surge Cola and renting this movie. He chuckles to himself and takes delight in seeing Kevin Coster appear in more putrid roles than Colonel Parker ever made him do. The movie hints that Costner was Presley's illlegitimate son, who knows, who cares. Ensemble casts are a great indication of a bad movie and this turkey delivers on all levels. All the characters (with the exception of Kurt Russell) are totally un-likeable, the plot is as thin and weak as a balsa wood airplane, and the characters that may have provided some comic relief were all killed off at the beginning of the movie. I see Elvis returning this DVD to the store 5 minutes before closing time, glad he is in disguise so that nobody will know that he rented this train-wreck of a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"3000 Miles To Graceland","review":"Ok, so lets get this out of the way. Nothing special about the movie. Its your basic crime caper, no twists, nothing of the sort. But what makes this a terriffic movie is just that...the fact that it isnt special. No twists, no scene skipping. Its a good action movie, with lots of panache. Tacky and entertaining at the same time. If your an Elvis fan, or a fan of mindless violence then I highly recomend this. If your brain needs a rest from such excellent movies as Pi, Usual Suspects, Memento and the such, then grap some pop-corn and park your self infront of the TV for a bit of mindless fun for once."},{"rating":"2","title":"3000 Miles to Graceland","review":"What can i say, this movie has all the actors my husband and i love to see in films, Kevin Costner, Kurt Russell and the list goes on.

I almost went to the front desk to ask for my money back.What a awful movie! Definitely made for the short attention span, violence obsessed, completely brain-dead set. If that describes you, you will probably enjoy this movie. Otherwise, don't waste your time. If you want to see a good movie about a Vegas heist see Ocean's 11.

This movie doesn't know if its serious, funny, dark, dangerous, emotional or exciting... and as a result its none of the above. This movie may be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

Three of my favorite stars Kevin Costner, Kurt Russel, Thomas Haden Church did not make there careers any better by making this movie. In fact it discussed me to the point that I through it away.

It is the most stupid movie I believe I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Bunk.","review":"There is just nothing redeeming about this flick. I was so excited for it, too-- I haven't seen Kurt Russell in anything for a while. It started out good, and could have been a whole lot better, if only the director and screenwriter hadn't decided to flush it down the toilet.

Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner are two diametrically in tandem partners. Gun battles, car chases, doubles crosses, twists and turns abound in this high-octane pursuit to the closet thing to utopia these characters can possibly conceive. Trust no one and believe only half of what you see is the best way to survive this cross-country quest for El Dorado. This is the 21st century's version of the \`Auteur theory' at work here. However, as usual I can see the handwriting on the wall. This is another great Kurt Russell movie that nobody is going to go to take serious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected - but really good anyway.","review":"I somehow got the impression before seeing it that this was a comical robbery-gone-wrong movie with extreme costumes and a lot of Elvis jokes. Well - not quite. This is an out-and-out action flick with a decent plot and characters that are way more than the one-dimensional types so often seen in the action genre. Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner played varying degrees of bad guys with honor, and Courtney Cox was wonderful as a trashy trailer princess, though the boy who played her son practically stole the show. Yes, it's a very violent movie. I'm generally not a big action fan (because most action movies fail to bother much with plot), but I liked this one a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Stupid and Ridiculously Unrealistic","review":"With the bulk of the better action sequences crammed into about 10 minutes in the beginning of the movie, the rest of this movie is about as interesting as watching the Garden Channel.Sold on trailers and previews as a movie \\"about\\" robbing a casino dressed as Elvis impersonators, instead they decide to rob it in the very beginning and skew the movie as something totally different. The movie is an average length of two hours, but feels like a 4 hour long journey from Vegas to Seattle, with bodies piling up about every hour just to make the audience think this terrible cinematic failure is \\"fast-paced\\". And there is a certainly a body pile up, since Kevin Costner kills a person in practically every shot he's in. \\"Waterworld\\" is more interesting than this movie, so maybe he should stick to making big-budget movies that don't make any money instead of moderate-high budget movies that don't make any money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent something else","review":"If you watch the DVD version, you'll get good quality viewing of a really bad movie.

That is a warning sign that should NEVER be ignored. 3rd sign - it was directed by a bad music video director.

The beginning of the movie was fast-paced and took a few twists, and you're thinking \\"okay, now what is the rest of the movie going to be about?\\", but it slowly shows you the plot.

Costner as the bad guy is a joke. Cox is a \\"great and sensitive\\" mother who taught his son how to commit robbery. All characters are disgusting, you only which they all die as soon as the movie starts.The \\"Elvis-disguise-robbery\\" premise is a plot intended to swindle audiences in the trailers, because it is gone right in the beginning of the movie.Alright, you can say sometimes it is good to watch a nasty movie.

If anything positive comes out of this lousy movie's existence, it's the hope that she will do more nude scenes in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a fantastic actiozzzzzzzzzzzzz!!!","review":"Talk about bad. This movie flat out sucked. Kurt Russell as a good guy lead, I dont mind. But an over the top Kevin Costner as the bad guy just makes for bad movie watching. The plot is simple with some twists, but the movement of the movie is too slow and watching Kevin Costner in his god like elvis frame of mind was just irritating. Dont waste your time or money on this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad","review":"This movie pretty much sucked.

The plot and storyline are horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent film you might find something you like in it","review":"I saw elements of \\"Out of Sight\\" and \\"Honeymoon in Vegas\\" in this action movie. The film deals with a heist pulled off by thieves posing as Elvis impersonators during a convention, and their following dillemas afterwards. The film becomes fairly predictable and unbelivable in the ensuing chaos, as most of the action takes place in showdowns between Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner's character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good performances, poor direction","review":"The first 1/3 of this movie was really good. Some great action scenes, great chemistry between all involved..... and then all of a sudden, most of the cast is killed off and what we are left with is; Kurt Russell and a child actor who really never work, a relationship with Coutney Cox that was never believable, hot potatoe with a bag of money, and Kevin Costner in a Wombat suit. How is that for a mental image?This could have been a great movie if they would have done the following; take more time with the build up to the actual \\"heist\\". Since that was the highlight, to have it happen within the first 20 mintues leaves the rest of the movie gasping for air. By doing this it would have given more screen time to \\"the crew of Elvis's\\" plus given the audience more of a shock when Costner goes renegade.All the pieces were in place for this movie, it could have been great but as it stands, it's just another in a long line of almosts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low grade action--semi typical storyline","review":"I was expecting a more mysterious movie, but in the end this movie was just a collection of cheap lines and impossible situations. If not for the cool cars, the cool sideburns and the gorgeous Cybil, I would have given it one star. It is really a pretty mindless movie not to mention quite impossible. I also believe that Kevin Costner really had to 'stretch' his acting efforts to play this character. Kurt Russel on the other hand does a fine job as his role is well suited to him.I would not recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent stories!","review":"The introduction and sixteen stories are very interesting.

And this CD really is a 'Best Of' collection in every sense. They've chosen the best songs from just about every one of his albums, and in chronological order to boot! Now, every fan of his already has all this stuff, but it saves us all the time and energy of making a great 'mix tape.' It's all here, from the pop sweetness and sleighbells of \\"Someday, Someway\\", to the country twang of \\"I'm Sorry (but so is Brenda Lee)\\", to the harder, louder, but no less sing-along-able \\"Whenever You're On My Mind.\\" This collection does a good job of showcasing Marshall Crenshaw's ability to craft a pop song, from jangly guitar to fantastic melody to intelligent lyrics. And he's always had great producers working with him. This is one fine 'Best Of' collection for a severly underrated artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is EZ lo-fi sigh","review":"Pop master, singer/songwriter, historianall thatBUT! does that have to mean poorly recorded?

WAIT! look at the producers; T-Bone Burnett Steve Lilywhite Alan Betrock etc.. are ya kidding me?

Snappy tunes, catchy rock hooks and intelligent lyrics abound. For people who like Elvis Costello, Crenshaw's music is somewhat reminiscent and equally good. This best of compilation is a superb introduction to some of Crenshaw's best songs. My favorites are all here including: Someday, Someway, Cynical Girl and Whenever You're on My Mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy pop that holds up well.","review":"This album has all my favorites on it. Happy guitar driven tunes in the style of Buddy Holly and others. If you can get through \\"Someday, Someway\\" without dancing there's something you need to put right. Just a blast to listen to.

Stampp's look into the North in the year preceding the Civil War is simply the best I've ever read. Detailed yet captivating, this well written work looks into the hearts and minds of one-half of a nation on the brink of civil war. Those of you whose Civil War research has extended little beyond Thomas DiLorenzo and the South-was-right crowd should read Stampp's book to learn how a real historian works. He never espouses a point of view and does not judge the actions of those who lived a century and a half ago from the political and philosophical basis of modern society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith and reason","review":"An excellent book about faith and reason, and what it means to be human.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Elton's best","review":"I originally had Blue Moves in its original record format when was first released.

Victim Of Love and Leather Jackets vie for that title. Thoroughly uninspired on every level. The only positive is that Dee Murray and Nigel Olsson were spared from wasting their time playing this rubbish. Instead of taking a hard earned vacation and coming back refreshed, Elton and Bernie went to the well one too many times. The blood is also on Gus Dudgeon's hands too. I will never understand why a band that has Davey Johnstone in it has a zero like the ever embarrassing Ray Cooper so much up front in the mix. This was Elton's first warning that the drugs weren't such a good thing. He did not heed that warning. \\"Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word\\" and maybe, \\"One Horse Town\\". Would've made a great single. The rest is tepid pablum. I hated this when I bought it brand new in '76. It didn't age well.

You don't even have to have a computer ... just your MP3. Some minor design drawbacks but not worth mentioning. Get em while you can. Radio Shack keeps running out of stock & they are more money. Of course, doing business with Amazon is ALWAYS a delight. Very pleased and the price is right."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"Well, these speakers are cheap, no doubt about it. And they do work. But that's about it in terms of positives.They really sound lousy. They sound like you took a pair of decent speakers and smothered them with a pillow. The sound is very muffled. No highs, no punch or presence whatsoever. They are also very underpowered.I think this was a penny-wise and pound-foolish purchase. If I had it to do over again, I'd spend some more money and buy something that sounded decent. I recently bought a set of Klipsch 2.1 speakers for another computer that were twice as expensive but sounded great.Don't buy these unless you are really pinched for cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"It all depends","review":"Well,Lets say this. If this is all you can afford, then get them. Not bad for the money. However, if you are really an audiophile then these are NOT FOR YOU!!!Sound delivery was not manageable even with a equalizer.

If you want TRUE SOUND..the way that your ear is meant to hear it...spend a few more dollars and get something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"One drawback","review":"I just finished hooking up this system, which was very easy. However, I use a business desk with a hutch that has the hole at the back to access the CPU and outlets. The stow away dock/volume unit is hard wired to the sub-woofer. I can't string it through, so it is sitting below my desk on my CPU. Not a great spot given the little people in my house. It would have been better if I could have plugged the stow away unit into the sub-woofer separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be better","review":"I just expected better from logitech. I think this because at louder volumes the system struggles, significantly.Also the ipod dock needs serious improvement. Its not really a dock rather a jenga game. Everytime i try to change a song, and i don't take my time, i end up knocking the ipod off the dock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"From the moment I opened the box I was struck by how cheap these speakers looked and felt. My suspicions were confirmed when I plugged them in. The light weight speakers lack treble and are overwhelmed by the subwoofer, which must be kept at an extremely low level to not drown out the highs. The controls feel filmsy and poorly thought out. After about three days I got fed up and took them back to the store and got a set of klipsch which were well worth the extra $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Bought them, they barely sounded like much, and then the corded crap was the worse.

The real problem, however, is feedback. Not only are there loud pops and clicks, but they constantly pick up radio frequencies. As long as the speakers are on and the volume is low, you will hear various radio broadcasts in myriad languages (sometimes more than one at a time), and if you turn the volume up to avoid this, you get the pops and clicks. The voices made me curious at first, then it was kind of amusing. Now it's flat out annoying. This seems to be a frequent problem with Logitech speakers in general, not just this model. The Mp3 player dock is certainly nice, but does not outweigh the annoyance of the incessant feedback. Even for such a low price, these speakers are not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome speakers","review":"these speakers are great i was on a budget and just needed somthing with a sub and 2 speakers.

The sub-woofer is a perfect size to sit right next to my desk. I didn't think I'd really use the MP3 player dock, but it turns out to be a nice feature. The one thing is that when you put your headphones in, you cannot adjust the volume; it's just one setting unless you change the master volume on your computer itself. The quality is good when it's loud, and can get loud enough for my taste. However, listening quietly, you sometimes lose the middle tones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not shielded! Stay Away!","review":"I bought these speaker's at my local K-mart about 3 weeks ago thinking I was getting a good deal on a pair of decent speakers....Wrong!!The included mp3 tray is somewhat cheap and wasnt really a major factor for me when I made the purchase but if it was I would be disapointed.But the number one most annoying reason you should not get these speaker's is the simple fact that they are not magnetically shielded at all...I even went to radioshack and got some magnets to see if I could isolate the noise or cancel it out that way but to no avail because I can still hear a local FM station constantly in the background.I unfourtunatly cannot return these speakers as I got rid of the packaging, I am just out $50.00 but by writing this review I hope I saved others from having to deal with this fualty product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price, 1 gotcha","review":"These are fine speakers considering the low price. The bass is a little boomy due to the subwoofer handling frequencies up into the low midrange. Mid to high detail is fair to good. You won't mistake these for audiophile gear, but they are pleasant to listen to and fine for the price.One gotcha: the control unit that sits on your desk (power switch, volume control, headphone jack, iPod jack) is permanently wired to the subwoofer. If you are using these at a office desk or anywhere else where you want to take advantage of cable management holes and channels, you may not be able to do so with these speakers. The control unit is too big to fit through even the largest of cable management holes. The top of my desk \\"floats\\" above the sides and modesty panels of my desk, and the control unit won't even fit through that large space. How much could it cost to wire the control unit using a jack?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice shot","review":"I found everything I was looking for.

I figured it'll be Ok for the money I payed for it. But in 3 days they started producing terrible static I couldn't stop.It's hard to expect anything good from 20-dollar speakers. So here are bad parts:Charger dock is useless. Subwoofer produces very muffed and unclean bass. Speakers sound very cheap too. Whoever came up with terrible design idea of permanently attaching charging station to a subwoofer with a wire needs to have his head examined.

It doesn't take up much room on the desktop, the cables are long enough to allow me to place all the components in convenient places, and the sound quality is good enough for me (at age 61, my hearing may not allow me to notice any sonic shortcomings).My only comment is the cheesy MP3 player \\"holder\\" on the control unit. It's not a real dock, it's a little platform that you can rest the player on, and there are little adapters that let you attach the player cable so the player can charge or sync while it's sitting on the platform.

Pretty versatile and helped me edge the concrete pathway and trim near the walls and fence which are spots that are hard to get a mower near.Pros:- Lightweight- Very effective and helps with heavy edging/trimming operations- Easy assembly/operation/conversion from edger to trimmerCons:- Poor power cord retention.

I couldn't ask for more for a mere $40.00 ($30.00 after rebate). It is lightweight and easy to change from trimmer to edger. I have never mowed, trimmed or edged a lawn before so having a tool this easy to use is great! It does appear to use alot of string but I was also doing some heavy edging to an unkept lawn. I don't anticipate this to be the case with normal use. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Line Hog","review":"I bought this trimmer/edger thinking how great it would be to just trim with the auto-feed feature. I have had the most difficult time with this trimmer. I used over 75 feet of line in an area smaller than 250 sq. ft. of mainly grass and some weeds. After using the spool that came with it which lasted 10 minutes, I constantly had to stop to re-wind the spool (yes, I read the directions and did it properly - 5 times). It continuously cut off pieces of line and threw them close to 100 ft. through the air. This is not safe in a California neighborhood.

Among other things, it's got the only fragment we're ever going to get of the projected new Marid novel _Word of Night._"},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding","review":"It's a shame when a book like this is marked ages \\"8-12\\" because I'm afraid it keeps the very people (those of us who are supposedly Grown Ups) who may most need to read it from ever giving it a try. This is a wonderful book. The format is extremely appealing (journal entries that bounce between Sophie and her cousin Cody), and helps to set up early on a question that keeps the reader wondering until the end. The author uses enough words to give the feeling of being on the ocean, without bludgering the reader with overly descriptive passages. The ending is unexpected and moving. After this and Walk Two Moons, I'm off to read Sharon Creech's other works. I recommend this to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wander","review":"I have been a fan of Sharon Creech ever since i read Walk two moons but this one was probaly the best.

This was an incredible book. Sophie is a thirteen year old girl that loves the sea, but has horrid dreams about it.The book starts at her house right on the ocean. Later on in the book, Sophie, her two cousins, and three uncles are going to set sail across the Atlantic Ocean all the way to England.They are going to England to find their grandfather named Bompie. On the way they hit some major problems with the boat and the sea.This is my favorite book that I have ever read. This book was hard to put down with all the action and fun.

So go get this action packed book and read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Sharon Creech's others, but good nonetheless","review":"This book was a disappointment after others such as Walk Two Moons, Bloomability, and Chasing Redbird, but it still draws you in and is a story worth having."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exactly why did this get a medal?","review":"Maybe you shouldn't trust my review because I was too bored to read the whole book. I only bought it because I saw it was a book about the ocean. Sophie, the main character, is very unrealistic and quite annoying. Cody, another major character, was pretty realistic and I liked him better. I was disappointed to see there is more of Sophie's diary that Cody's. And like another reviewer said, they're crossing the whole ocean just to visit their grandfather? The author could've done a better job on that. And the way I understand it, this book is mainly about family. I personally consider that to be kind of boring. From what I hear, Creech's other books are better, so read one of them instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"No likey, no likey, no likey","review":"THE WANDERER ... is very similar to the author's WALK TWO MOONS. If you like Creech's style, which tends to be a bit cutesy, then you'll like this book too. If you don't, stop reading here.Sophie is meant to be humorous and quirky and sensitive, but she simply comes across as annoying. Her cousin Cody is uncomfortably odd -- it's not clear what his age is at all -- but at least he's more likable.The storm in the middle is the best part.

It's kind of like her other books since it's about self-discovery, but the setting is very different. The main character, Sophie, is interesting and unique. She is sailing to England on a boat with male relatives. Along the way, there is humor. Even though this book is vintage Creech, it is also different.

I also recommend it to pre-teen girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"i loved this book. it used great adjectives and expressive words and ou really felt like you were in that boat and storm with sophie and cody. the only problem with it was that it said my teacher(sr rosalie)'s name in it. lol just kidding."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wanderer by Sharon Creech","review":"THis is a great book to read.

Or perhaps it's because she has just started really enjoying reading. But, in any event, we both really enjoyed reading this book to each other. Creech's mystery slowly unfolds amidst sailing adventures, some reminiscent of The Perfect Storm, as she develops the two wonderfully free spirited, yet very different, teenage personalities of Sophie and Cody. Sophie's mysterious past often clashes with Cody's out there and sometimes irrating personality, but in the end their commonalities bind them, and teach the adults on board a thing or two in the process. You don't need to be a sailor to like this book, just sit back and enjoy the sail-- young and old!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This was a great story about a girl sailing to see someone by Sharon Creech the best author ever!great book 2 most favorite book ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"Great for any reader who likes adventure.

The reason I hated it is because it had no excitement. That is why I hated it partly. I also hated it because a lot of guys never talk. The reason I like the book is because they are out in the sea.

First off it is full screen CGI Animation, which means it contains 3D computer graphics. This Thomas DVD is actually animated rather than its usual its usual live action and models show. Aidan really got a kick out of it because it was different than the other Thomas DVDs we have. Splish Splash Splosh also features a new host, Driver Perkins, who can only be seen on this DVD so it was nice to see a new train character. Throughout the DVD, there is lots of excitement, great morals, and wet fun! Overall, this DVD is definitely our new favorite Thomas adventure mostly because of the awesome animation. It is 46 minutes of Thomas fun and was just released earlier this month.

The longest any patch appeared to hold was three days, which is when I removed the block. This was a lot of work and expense with poor results.

Most Samsung LCD's I've seen have been great. This TV is a below average product from Samsung. Picture quality is average, off-axis viewing is poor (common LCD problem) and sound is average.

YMMV (your mileage may vary)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Image for HD, Not for SD, Poor Audio","review":"Samsung image quality for HD sources is very good. The design of the display is nice. However, standard def. does not look very good, thereis glow at the top and bottom from the backlight that is very obvious inblacks.

Tweaking the settings helps a little, but not much. The biggest drawback on this item is the white halo that other reviewers have mentioned.

Not disappointed. The total height had to fit under kitchen cabinets. The fit was perfect, set up was relatively easy. Picture was excellent with some channels and less than brilliant with others, but always clear and crisp up close. Sound from the speakers is only mediocre but most TV's of this size have small speakers. Sound was as good as it could be and better than others like Magnavox.

We will probably purchase another one in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this TV if you want a good looking TV","review":"I own a repair shop and I have been repairing TV for years. This TV is great only for it's compact format. On the other hand, the image is just awful. White will shear and bleed at a higher contrast ratio. The high and low lights are also wrong (blue high/low lights). The sound is not great but good for the size of the speakers. Obviously, when there is movement the focus goes way off (common in all LCD, Plasma and DLP) and the image looks even more awful. You can also see the smear(lag,trail) when there is fast movement ( caused by slow LCD response time in the miliseconds). In the end, I have seen 1986 RCA 14\\" TV's who had a better image quality. Mitsubishi 37\\" TV 1992 beats this TV by about 10 times and has a response time in the nanoseconds. End of line, this LCD TV has a very poor image quality. I give it 1 star since the menus and remote are very easy to use and the TV has a very compact design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little TV","review":"Needed a small tv for our bedroom that didn't take up much room.

There was a two inch green stripe running vertically down the middle of the tv. No amount of adjustment to the settings would make it go away. We had to send it back, but Amazon no longer had them.

But I didn't find anything. The picture quality for this wasn't what I expected either, my old Samsung had very crisp images, this had a very noticable graininess to it. It was like that with my Xbox360 for both games and DVD. The PC connection wasn't any better. No matter how I messed with the settings for both TV and computer, I couldn't get a fine, clear image.

Be sure to catch sight of the wires that are holding on to the Pterdactyl's wings when they grasp \\"Ogar\\" a half idiot pre-modern man who befriends the lost adventurers. The ending left is open for further rehashing of the same effects in \\"People that Time Forgot\\". Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for it's genre","review":"No, the dinosaur effects are not Jurassic Park and yes you can see the strings on the pterodactyl, but other than that this is a great flick. Had they been provided Harryhausen effects, this would be an all time classic. Everything other that the dinosaur effects are a bullseye. Gotta give Doug Mcclure some credit as a likeable enough hero. Great acting, good story and believable characters make for an awesome 90 minute diversion. The first 40 minutes when the sub and battleship battle looks great. I have always loved this flick and it's sequel, The People That Time Forgot. Widescreen DVD, anyone?

It was as fun to read as the title suggests and informative as well. It brought back to my memory days of my rambunctious youth, and painted a picture of the settings beautifull in my head. I would give it all five stars, but it does seem to be lagging in some places.

NB seem to always work for me. Shoes are well made. I would prefer the NB 621s, an all-leather shoe, but they have not offered that model for some time. As I understand the NB numbering system, more expensive models have higher numbers. The MR859 model is good looking and comes in several colors. I found the orange/silver appealed to me. Orange is popular at the moment. For the most part, I just need comfortable shoes for walking and bike riding, so these do nicely for those limited activities. I generally use my older shoes for yard work. That means my trusty 621s are still in use after many years of great service. I doubt the new shoes will last nearly as long, but so it goes. What does?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Quality Poor Fit","review":"I run four to six miles per day and having been wearing New Balance shoes for years. I haven't found any other brand that works as well for me. The price on these shoes was excellent; the quality is excellent; however, the fit is not consistent with previous New Balance models--the toe fit is shorter and wider than the 768 series (I have three pairs of these.) and the earlier 765 and 766. Additionally, I can feel what appears to be the gaps in the tread through the soles of the shoe, giving the impression that my feet are not on a uniform platform of support. While I have only worn them once, at this point in my experience, I am reluctant to recommend them, despite the great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuter in the picture","review":"I saw a friend wearing similar and thought they were cute, but they didn't have the same impact on my larger size foot.

Perhaps I should go back to buying running shoes in a shop where a proper fit can be confirmed."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!","review":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. I ordered this because it said it is The Best of the Price is Right and what I got was a bunch of old shows from before I was even born. Where's the stuff with the Price is Right with Johnny Olson and Janice and Holly and Diane and Rod? I ended up fast forwarding through most of it looking for anything familiar. The name is misleading. Definitly NOT WORTH $40 and the hassel of returning it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Best","review":"As a long time Price Is Right fan I was eager to see The Best of The Price is Right. Unfortunately it is not on this dvd set. I did find the Bill Cullen shows interesting, and those old dark haired Bob shows were entertaining, but a little goes a long way when you are eagerly waiting for the best to begin. I expected to see the Price Is Right that I loved with the beautiful girls Janice, Dian, Holly, and the adorable Johnny. Those shows aren't anywhere on this dvd set. I was expecting The Best of The Price Is Right but sadly it's not here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the \\"BEST\\" of TPIR","review":"As a life-long fan of the show, I am very dissapointed. Fremantle would be better to put together a disc set of bloopers, set mis-haps, behind the scenes (showing the entires soundstage) and cast/crew interviews.I have a problem with this being promoted as the \\"Best of The Price Is Right\\". This is in fact a compilation of what seems as the first season of The Price Is Right, their move to 1 hour episodes and the last week of Bob Barker.I have seen better episodes on the Internet. I wish I could get my money back, but I would not be able to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Price is right with \\"Price Is Right\\"","review":"Many have harped about the DVD set \\"The Best Of The Price Is Right\\" for its selection of its earliest four years of the CBS show and Bob Barker's final week as it excludes some noted show models. Others, who were born way after the CBS show began, think the Bill Cullen shows shouldn't have been included (\\"It's not in color!...\\" \\"it doesn't have pricing games!...\\" \\"the contestants aren't crazy!...\\" \\"we can't psychoanalyze the lettering font in a game display!\\"). Cry me a river, all of you. Cullen's show was TV's top game in its day and Barker's version probably wouldn't have made it on the air without it paving the way. As for the selection of Barker episodes, let it stand as a testament, a litmus test, of how it started as a \\"Let's Make A Deal\\" ripoff and became TV's longest running game. If anyone's to blame for not having a wider spread of shows, blame either CBS or Barker himself and his beef with the excluded models."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barker's DVD, with Cullen Only Along for the Ride","review":"The DVD set is chock full of early Barker material, as many have mentioned here, which is usually the point of these DVDs. So, if your a fan of that, this should be a good purchase. However, being more a fan of early TV, the first of four discs offers just four shows of the Bill Cullen years, which is sadly not enough. The most interesting part of looking back @ such a show as this is for the history of our economy, specifically our cost of living: boats, cars, Hi Fis, Americana, etc. I've seen the early years on the Game Show Network and it's by far the most fascinating. I mean, this is how we lived in the 50s & 60s!!! However, this is just not the DVD set for that! So, beware!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Definitely not worth watching if you are looking for the best Price Is Right. Just old stuff from the seventies.

Definitely NOT the best Of The Price Is Right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it -- and I hope to see many more volumes!","review":"Seeing the episodes from the early '70s brings back fond memories. Obviously with such a long-running show, there should (if this one sells well enough) be a Volume 2, 3, 4, etc.Remember Bob's first show with white hair? (Oct. 1987) He said something like, \\"If you were watching yesterday, my hair was dark. Boy, let me tell you, the blind date I had last night ...!\\"There are countless moments like that in the vaults. And I think TPIR's comedic moments are way funnier than 95% of recent sitcoms!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF MONEY","review":"\\"The Best of the Price is Right\\"??? HARDLY! I bought this collection for my kids who grew up watching The Price Is Right but not one of the shows from their childhood are on it. It's only old shows from the early seventies and before. I'm returning it tomorrow. I think if you are a game show enthusiast and you think that really old episodes and the black and white years of Pirce is Right are \\"the best\\" then this would be interesting to you. Otherwise it's like watching a really long PBS documentary on the early days of tv gameshows...BORING!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, but condensed.","review":"I love the price is right, watch it every day almost. I was excited to get the best of, and it truly is awesome. You can see the development of the episodes, the introduction of the wheel, episodes from the 60's before Bob, and Bob's last week.The DVD's in between are all from 1-2 years.. I figured the Best Of would be the Best Of, not just one episode from each month of the year 1976.Very enjoyable though, love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I bought this for my brother who was a huge fan and I thought he would enjoy it.

Sony should re-release this disc immediately, since Szell still owns this music. There are other good performances of all of these pieces, but they don't quite come up to this high standard, and no one else ever will. No one has ever had the superb wind choir which plays with such ebullient bounce as the Cleveland Orchestra has in these recordings, and the almost chamber-like give and take of much of the playing on these recordings makes them very special. SONY, bring this one back!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book worth buying","review":"Just like many other reviewers commented, I heard horror stories about having to take this exam 2 or 3 times.

This book is pretty thorough in its detail and explanation of the material. I passed the exam on my first try and I know I would have not have been successful had I not used this study guide. I recommend this book to assist in mostly anyone's preparation for the MTEL Comm/Literacy. There were some errors in the practice exams though. On several questions, the book indicated the wrong \\"correct\\" answer. This might sound like a contradiction, but the book's errors helped me to reinforce what I had learned. I learned the material so well that I KNEW the book was erroneous without hesitation. Definitely worth the time and money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"Despite the 2005 copyright, this book has outdated test information, particularly for the writing subtest. It refers to a no-longer included dictation section and has other inconsistencies with the current test.

I found this book to be no help at all studying for the test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not adequate to the task","review":"It is a shame that in this day and age,that no one has been able to create a viable resource to supplement one's preparation for the MTEL examination. I purchased the book to facilitate my tutoring of a young woman who has grave anxiety regarding the test. I chose this book because it had three sample tests. Unfortunately, the tests did not parallel the MTEL formats and contained many errors and omissions. Often, prompts were not written clearly or had overt editorial errors. In some cases, due to improper editing, it was impossible to decipher the intent of a paragraph.If the purpose of the text is to make the student comfortable with the testing vehicle, then the vehicle must be free from error. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The errors create increased anxiety regarding the test and impede the student's ability to pass. This book is not just insufficient, it it a travesty inflicted upon an already vulnerable group of test takers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book confused me more than it helped! Some of the questions on the booklet had Nothing to do with what was on the exam. A whole chapter was dedicated to how to formulate sounds, which would be perfect if you were going for speech pathology but of no help if your aim is to teach ESL. The practice test is nothing like the actual test. Some of the theory information is helpful and if you focus on that portion and the assessment guide it should be good for a few points but this book CANNOT be used as your only study guide because you will fail the test."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Soul!!!","review":"Some of the most heartfelt Soul I have ever heard!

David Levithan does it again. This book just puts your mind in a different world. It really is the Realm of Possibility. There are gay couples and struggling souls. All of this in the form of some wonderful poems. The church choir girl can fall for the goth guy, the beautiful song writer can fall in love with a girl of her own, and sooo much more. After I read this book I was shocked at how much of an effect it had on me. If I bought it I would read dozens of times. You'll love it. This author really knows what he is doing. I hope you enjoy it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to Novels, Mr. Levithan","review":"I was really excited to read The Realm of Possibility. I'm a fan of Levithan's many other works, and thought this would be on par with his other writing. Character development is a personal favorite feature of novels, and with 20 different characters featured, I thought we'd get to see plenty of that. Unfortunately, 20 characters ended up leading to 20 disjointed, messy, incoherent stories, to the point where I was confused about the very purpose of the book. It read more like an outline for a book than a finished copy. It was a good start, and could have been executed better, perhaps in using short stories rather than poems, but there wasn't much cohesion between the 20 stories being told. The writing itself was classic Levithan, full of Big Life Truths, and it did not disappoint. I can't say the same for the book as a unit, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard To Follow, Tedious To Finish","review":"This book is written in the point of view of 20 different people.

There is a nice turn by Jon Cypher as the heavy. Soap opera vet Eric Braeden gets some on-screen time as does, of all people Robert Duvall as the straight-arrow cop.Fun for a lark. Connoisseurs of the genre only please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pan n scan","review":"VCI's budget DVD starts out well enough for the obscure thriller Lady Ice, with nice letterboxed credits foreshadowing interesting widescreen photography to come. Unfortunately, as soon as the credits end, the aspect ratio changes to full screen and the rest of the film is presented in one of the worst pan and scan jobs I've ever seen on DVD.

Having said that, the Dipsticks are noticeably lighter.These boots, while still adequate, are of significantly lower quality to the original Alaska boots and hence will wear out more quickly. I've used the Alaska's quite heavily for three years and have only just replaced them with these, I expect to replace the Dipsticks within the next year and a half or less.If you're trying to decide between the Harley Dipsticks or the Caterpillar Alaska FX, I would strongly recommend the Alaska FX"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent work boots!","review":"I own a steel-toed pair of these boots and they are proving to be the most comfortable pair of safety boots I have owned in years.

Shoe repair places charge $65.00 for new soles so just buy a new pair at a good price and use the old pair as a good solid work boot as long as you don't need super traction.

I have tried other brands, and either the elastic fails, or they ride up, causing me to have to constantly correct a \\"semiwedgie\\", which is not only annoying, but has to be done discreetly. With FTL, the elastic remains in good shape and they don't ride up. They are comfortable all day, even with the holes.

The Symphony No. 2 is more substantial, yes, but the No. 1 has always appealed to me almost as much. After a quiet start, the work expands into a restrained but still propulsive first movement that almost takes on the qualities of a gargantuan waltz. The two middle movements have always been the center of my interest -- a yearning Andante followed by a lilting, upbeat allegro. The final movement has never really worked for me; it has always struck me as being a bit disorganized and out of spirit with the rest of the work, but despite that criticism I still adore this symphony. If you're searching for some post-Brahms symphonic music that tells an emotional story, this Symphony No. 1 and the No. 2 are terrific finds, and Jarvi and the Gothenburg Symphony deliver them both quite competently, though for the No. 2 I'd suggest the recording conducted by Stig Westerberg on Caprice instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sequeal","review":"I first saw Psycho 3 back in 1986 with my wife when it first came out to the movies. I thought it was a surprisingly good sequeal, however, it offered the most graphic, gory violence of the \\"Psycho\\" series. So for those of you who are turned off by extreme violence, this film is not for you. Anyway, Anthony Perkins did such a great job portraying Norman Bates that he gave me the creeps as I watched the movie. Overall, a very good sequeal, and a great horror movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 1/2 STARS THIRD TIMES A CHARM! GOOD SEQUEL!","review":"It's hard to believe they made a descent sequel for the original Psycho. It's even harder to believe that they could do it again. There are plenty of references to the original in both sequels and that's part of the fun. To enjoy these films you have to have a sense of humor and just go with it. Perkins is twitchier than ever in this third installment and mother is up to her old tricks! There are some good scares to be had too! The DVD transfer looks very good. I bought this in a 2 disc all 3 sequel edition of the Psycho franchise. It's well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessary tripe","review":"Psycho was an enormous success.Psycho 2 was an excellent original sequel.Psycho 3 is a joke. After an excellent twist at the end (Norman's real mother( the series should have finished on that note. Yes, a sequel could have been made but what would have been the point in rehashing the original idea? Psycho 3 is basically a repeat of Psycho minus the action, camerawork, acting and, oh, pretty much everything else. The plot mirrors practially mirrors Psycho, a woman seeks refuge in a motel but the difference is she falls in love with Norman. However as she grows to know Norman better she starts to suspect things are not as they seem. As the bodies pile up Tracy must decide whether this is the work of Norman or nothing more.Rubbish sequel which I would say has been disowned by now.Better to have a powercut than to watch this mindless drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Favorite Psycho Movie!!!","review":"I loved Psycho with Anthony Perkins, that was a classic and I liked Psycho 2, though it wasn't as good as Psycho and not a classic but still good, as For Psycho 3, I didn't really like it that much, Anthony Perkins was great as always as Norman but I didn't really like the other characters they were kind of annoying, especially the guy who was a total scuzball!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME!","review":"This is by far the best of the Psycho sequels! Anthony Perkins did an incredible job staring and directing in this one.

As I watched this movie I was thinking to myself....Alfred Hitchcock must be rolling over in his grave!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It ought to have been much better.","review":"This film saw the series descend into a sad parody of itself, which is a shame. Only Anthony Perkins emerges from this with his integrity intact, his performance being as believable as his others as Norman Bates. As a director, however, he ought to have known better. The script is weak, relying on comedy and the audience's knowledge of the previous Psycho Films for many of its laughs. By playing it 100% straight, Perkins does not tarnish the role of Bates, which is just as well, because the sequel made much better use of him."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of all Sequels","review":"When I watched Psycho 2 I thought that it was a great sequel to the original but after watching Psycho 3 it didn't even compare. I believe Psycho 3 is the best of all the sequels because it has a lot more action and it shows a more human side of Norman Bates. At times you really feel sorry for the poor, crazy guy. Warning, it is very graphic, especially with the closeup shots, but it makes the movie more realistic and frightening. Anyone who is a true Psycho fan must see this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"they did it again","review":"Another wonderful sequel, its hard to keep a series like this good this long, I felt all the sequels to this point have been well worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psycho III","review":"I know what you did last summer, Norman! There have been many films and TV shows shot at the famous \\"Psycho\\" set at Universal Studios, but this was the worst. Set not too long after Psycho II (the first pile-of-crap sequel) Norman Bates is back to his old wacko self. The Bates Motel is open for business, again, and his first guest is a suicidal nun...yep! But wait, there's more! She's accompanied by a drunken sleazeball, who Norman hires as a part-time motel clerk (I'm sure it's just because Norman wants to off him first).The movie has some funny scenes in it, but none can hold up to the crappy slasher mentality that later follows. Anthony Perkins' directorial debut - I'm sure that really helped his career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very impressive.","review":"Not very impressive at all.

They have some abortive contacts, and finally meet, by coincidence, as old women taking the baths in SPA, Belgium. Most of the book consists of their account of their lives, with their lives post WWII treated cursorily (well the German goes a few years past the War). The salient point is that the Dutch woman cannot forgive the German for being a German. She does at the end, but the whole account of their interaction in SPA is very weak. De Loo has definite narrative skill, so the book is readable. What I found particularly strange, is that the author seems to go out of her way to make the discovery of the two earlier visits between the two twins surprises to the reader, for no apparent reason, and to the detriment of the integrity of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Road Map for the Quaternionic renaissance","review":"The quaternionic movement seemingly ran out of steam in the early twentieth century, about the same timethis bibliography was compiled.

His timelines are off, certain things mentioned in his book were not invented at the time he claims to have been exposed to them, and great many religious people I know, myself included are at best disturbed with his version of the gospel.

First, the construction of the media is very open -- which I thought meant that it would function better than our older wicks. Not so. These filters aren't strong enough to support the weight of the air funnel in the humidifier or their own weight -- when wet. They also don't wick enough water up into themselves to humidify the air. I ran our humidifier on high for eight hours last night. The humidity level in the house was 20% and the humidifier consumed about two quarts of water. Using our old wicks, the humidifier reservoir would have been almost empty.

When I first looked at them I thought they would be a much better design due to the very open material weave. They look like a big honey comb. However, they worked very poorly. The original Kenmore filters would last 1/2 of the winter season before changing. These only functioned for about a week and poorly at that. They do not wick the water well and seem to get clogged very fast. The performance at the end of a week was about the same as the Kenmore filters after a couple of months.

I used the trimmer and the edger without difficulty for the summer. However, during the second season, I continually had to leave the choke on in order for the engine to run. The performance and power level is drastically hampered with the choke on. I added the leaf blower attachment during the second season to assist with the leaves. Even with the choke running, the blower worked well.The engine is not built well on the 725r. I have taken it apart to clean it thoroughly; however, the performance has not improved.

I expected a lot more than what I had already read on snort's website.There were a few errors on setting up ACID, but having read snort's documentation already, it was easily figured out. Too bad I can't get my money back because if I knew it was this bad, I would have never bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"SNORT COMPLETE...with a great suite of utilities","review":"I teach a graduate level course on Intrusion Detection. The core textbook is long on security concepts, network topographies, and is about 900 pages. It's long on theory and short on specifics---even shorter on actual tools and products.This book has proven to be a breath of fresh air. It provides detailed product specifics and is a reliable roadmap to actually rolling out an IDS. And I really appreciate the CD with Snort and the other IDS utilities.The author team is well connected with Snort.org and they obviously had cart blanche in writing this book.

The movie lacked any flow and many scenes left me feeling embarrassed for everyone involved in the production of this stinkfest. If you're looking for a funny, romantic comedy (like I was), LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE. I read the bad reviews beforehand, but still decided to give it a shot.

Kristen Bell is boring on a scale of 1 to 10 she is a serious 12 and a mediocre actress at best. She would be better left to low budget TV movies. She completely lacks charisma, while Josh Duhamel has it in abundance. As for the writer, he should be shot at dawn.

These ideas are simple (notice I did not say easy...) but it is their simplicity that gives them so much power.You don't need a 6 CD set with a 500 page workbook full of theory.All you need to transform your thinking and take your life to the next level is ONE, straight to the point, no punches pulled, CD recorded by someone who \\"walks his talk\\".You don't need a boatload of hard to implement (or even understand) strategies and tactics.All you need is a handful of simple to follow (yet incredibly empowering) ACTIONS to take.All you need is \\"Life Management 101\\"...Buy it.

Perhaps, this is one of those stories that does not translate well to film. It seemed as though this was a production put on by a theater company in a small town. Also, be aware that running time for this video is just twenty minutes, which makes it a pretty expensive videotape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had high hopes","review":"This video production does not do justice to O.

IT'S A BIG WASTE OF $16.00The story was completly ruinned the setting was to be a small flat in NY's village the appartment in this movie looked like a victorian place. Thsy dresses well and the entire feel was wrong including an added twist of a grandmother telling hea child the story with some stupid put on twang. The whole production was really a waste. I guess the producer paid for the awards it won.IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE A GREAT VERSION OF THIS BELOVED STORY BUY O'HENRY'S FULL HOUSE BY CIMINA CLASSICS I BOUGHT MINE ON AMAZON, IT'S LESS EXPENSIVE AND YOU GET 4 O'HENRY STORIES WITH A CAST OF GREAT OLD TIME MOVIE STARS.

There is a lot of Hindi religous symbolism but that is the culture. It is a very clean, moral and beautiful story. It is what good people aspire to in a loving arrangement. The actors are wonderfully cast and Amrita Rao and Shahid Kapoor are naturally convincing in their roles. I have to admit I've never seen Shahid Kapoor fail at being convincing and he again lives up to my expectations. It is a must see with a box of tissues(yes even the men will need them). Don't think this is just a chick flick. There are some awsome lessons about true manhood in this picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"70's Artist, 90's Recording, 80's Sound","review":"Very enjoyable, excellent of it's type. Any fan of King Crimson or Foreigner will enjoy parts, if not all, of this CD. The songs, production, and playing have a soothing, MORish quality which, not coincidentally, makes this perfect for long drives. It's fun to hear the different singers do their thing too. A bit of a guilty pleasure, seeing that the styles are somewhat anachronistic, but Ian has always had a very pleasing, unique, variation on commercial prog rock. I hope he released more music in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite new releases in 99!","review":"This one was one of the best surprises of the year.

Music with some great hooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Crimson Ian","review":"I'm a huge fan of Ian Mcdonalds work with King Crimson and especially the Mcdonald/Giles album but this albumis pop drivel with no hint of prog. The drums alone destroy the album as they stick to power rock style with no integrity.Save your money and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"forgettable performances by all-star lineup","review":"The list of contributing musicians reads like a who's-who of classic rock. But the performances on this, McDonald's first solo disc are utterly forgettable. Talented singers such as John Wetton and Gary Brooker sound very uninspired and are too low in the mix. There isn't one great song hook to be found, and the music suffers from a minimal amount of (much needed)time changes. \\"You are a Part of Me\\" would pass as a Foreigner-type ballad if Lou Gramm were singing it. The instrumentals sound like bland versions of Alan Parsons Project styling. It's not a progressive album in any sense and the songs seem underdeveloped overall. The only halfway-decent tune is \\"In Your Hands,\\" but it alone is not worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bah.","review":"Los discos de los exmiembros de King Crimson, a excepci��n de Bruford son bastante insulsos.

Wells classic pales considerably. Good production values, but Don Taylor's direction lacks punch and Burt Lancaster is woefully miscast in the title role. Despite everyone's best intentions, \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\" represents another failed remake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lancaster better than Brando","review":"If you saw the Kilmer/Brando version I urge you to see this version.

If you liked the original book by H.G.Wells than skip Brando and see this one instead. Youll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice pice of splicing!!","review":"Written in a time when gene splicing was only done with plants, and set in a day when it was barely done on plants, this oddity was awesome. A scientist who breaks all the rules to create his mutants on a lost little island. The scientist played by Burt Lancaster was a role made for him. He was controlled, fearless and very believeable. As with all good things, his empire crumvbles when the mutants see him breaking the LAW and all hell breaks loose. A great film written before it's time and reminiscent unfortunately of the Nazi scientist of old.

Although it doesn't hold up when one is an adult so much, it is still a decent flick to watch if you sprained your ankle and can't get out of the house. The plot concerns a stranded engineer (York) of a freighter that lands on a remote island that is inhabited by strange creatures. Lancaster is superb as the ingenious Dr Monreau who is a gifted geneticist and biologist who wants to merge animals with man to get the perfect creation that only science can manufacture. He is obviously a disciple of Nietzsche and Spencer. There is a creepiness about the island that the film manages to sustain throughout. The make-up is excellent and the beast men are rather frightening (not recommended for children under 7). Basheart plays the sayer of the law, who as an aged and wisdom filled creature whom attempts to dissuade complete anarchy amongst the beast men. Not a bad production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use in the Classroom","review":"I teach 9th grade English, and after reading Wells's \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\" in my English I class, I chose to have my students watch the 1996 remake rather than this version. Although both movies greatly deviate from Wells's story, the 1977 version would have bored my students to tears. If you intend to show a movie version of this novel, then I would choose the 1996 version since it is faster-paced and more dramatic. Plus, Val Kilmer plays a very convincing Montgomery. The redeeming quality of this 1977 version is the cave scene during which the Beast People teach Braddock \\"The Law,\\" though your students will probably be asleep by the time that scene occurs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crocodile","review":"It is the older version of Crocodile. Set in China or Asia.The picture was boring, because you could not see the movie plainly. It was too dark. Daytime looked like almost night all the way through the movie.

This year, that changed. The endoskeleton has gotten its best representation since the vinyl kits of ten years ago, hard to find Japanese kits, and a clunky Kenner action figure. The mold is just spot-on accurate and the articulation is superb; all the pistons in the legs and arms move for a touch of realism. The surface is gritty for that battle-worn look, but its only fault is the puny gun; otherwise it's a great sculpt and an excellent study in mechanical design."},{"rating":"2","title":"T-TOORIFIC","review":"Without hesitation I'd have to say that this is the best reproduction of ANY character that I have ever seen.

Upbeat, fun, danceable, melodic-- boogie to the max!! The playing on this album is amazing! Max's drumming is sharp as always, Jimmy Vivino plays hot lead guitar as good as Brian Setzer ever could; and the MW7 horns are pumping and jumping. There's lots of great vocals, too --\\"Buzz, Buzz, Buzz\\" is one of my favorites, along with the new song, Catch Em In The Act, featuring the lacivious growl of Dr. John telling a juicy story of \\"Long-Legged Lena\\", Filthy Willamena\\" and \\"Sweet Sally\\". \\"The best band on TV\\" shows that they are all that and more.

Every song sounds the same as the last -- 50's-type swing, simple blues patterns, and the same monotonous drumming. And where's the Conan theme??????? Not on this CD, that's for sure. I really expected more from such good musicians. The only high points are the sax solos and an occasional trumpet solo that try to break out of the mold but are still quite restricted.

Part of the Time Trilogy- which has, incidentally, expanded beyond three books- A Swiftly Tilting Planet provides a rare blend of mysticism, science, and characters so real you want to call them and ask what happened next. The basic plot is thus: Meg Murray communicates telepathically with her brother, Charles Wallace, as he enters the bodies of several people from the past to avert a world disaster. As always, L'Engle is superb. I highly encourage any human, of any age, to read this fine novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"One GRRREAT book!!!","review":"The book A Swiflty Tilting Planet was a fun page-turner with adventures on every page. The Author portrayed the characters very well and in some parts of the book, I felt as if I was riding on the unicorn's back with Charles Wallace.

I enjoyed them, but also found them a bit simplistic, understandable since L'Engle mainly writes for children.However, I haven't been able to put down A Swiftly, Tilting Planet. The story is so wonderful and the suspense keeps you turning the pages as you try to put the mystery together. I wonder why no one really mentions this book, because in my opinion, it is the best of the Time Quartet."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Disappointed","review":"After reading A Wrinkle in Time as a child, I decided to read Tilting Planet... and I am very disappointed.

At the time, I was very concerned about the possibility of nuclear war (it was around the beginning of Reagan's second term, and The Day After was just being shown on TV). I found this book to be quite heartening, with its premise of avoiding holocaust by nudging history in different directions. Basically, this book seemed to affirm the basic goodness of human nature. To this day, the rune still brings delightful shivers up my spine."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"I read Wrinkle in Time when I was 11 and thought it was the best thing I'd ever read.

When I picked up Swiftly Tilting Planet, I thought that I would enjoy it, but it wouldn't be up to par with Wrinkle. Boy was I wrong!Planet was the most magnificient book I've ever read. I'm 46 years old and have read thousands of books over my lifetime, including all of Madeleine L'Engle's titles. This story is so inspirational, suspenseful, frightning, heartbreaking and joyful. It's just the best.I use The Rune when I need a little \\"igher power\\"in my life as well as traditional prayers. I recommend it to everyone. It may be complicated for some children, but Ms. L'Engle doesn't write down for anyone.

Also included is the remake of the Ben E. King chestnut \\"Stand by Me\\" by Spyder Turner (this is the 3 1/2 minute single version instead of the longer LP version found on earlier compilations). You even hear the original hit version of the Burt Bacharach/Hal David tune \\"Always Something There To Remind Me,\\" years before Naked Eyes hit the charts with the song.

Great track with Migs - just heard the lads will have an album coming out. If you're into West Coast housemusic, this is an absolute must-have.

Sadly this is not the case here. There are certainly some moments that might warrant a return listening, but after editing out the poorer moments here, you'd be left with very little of merit anywhere near the level of the former live work. The main problem here seems to be Eric Clapton's very bland, & corporate sounding, backing band.

Sharing the stage with Eric Clapton and taken from his last, very abbreviated, solo tour in 1991, Live In Japan (re-released after a ten year plus absence) brilliantly showcases a reinvigorated Harrison in top form - ripping through his Beatles and solo canon with a delicate ferocity that is both moving and completely unexpected.The Beatles chestnuts are all here however, it is on some of his lesser-known solo compositions that his enthusiasm for the material really shines - in particular \\"Devil's Radio\\" and \\"Cheer Down.\\" The \\"quiet\\" Beatle delivers a landmark performance that is worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The editorial review recommends this book for all levels of experience.

Why?The trouble, in my opinion, was not all the talking. I appreciated the idea behind the performance and it was even fun. The trouble was the execution of the songs. I knew it was all to be acustic (with only Bruce playing), but I never figured that he would suck out the essence of the songs to the point that they became unbearable to listen, so boring and lifeless they became.

But then Bruce began to talk...and talk...and then he talked some more. Yes, he talked about the songs and the story they told. He talked about his philosphy of life that was inherent in those songs and the stories they told. Had I not been expecting and looking forward to hearing him sing songs, perhaps I would have been more interested in his outlook on life.

The hardcover \\"library binding\\" of this edition of Tales from Watership Down (ISBN 0-613-37671-4) is of the worst quality. It is a paperback book poorly disguised as hardbound by the addition of cardboard reinforcements to the cover. The text seems to be printed on public washroom paper towels pasted together. The newspaper critcal reviews occupy a page in the front and the outside back cover. There is not just a mention of, but full page advertising for Watership Down inside the back of the book. There is no dust jacket, but then what here is worthy of protection? The pleasure of holding a hardbound volume cannot be found in this edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unpleasant aftertaste.","review":"A continuation from the utter delight that is the first book; how could it go wrong? I'm still baffled with just how wrong it went.The feel between the two books is the difference between fine spices and more salt on your fast food fries. The characters were flat and returning personalities were almost insultingly out of character. I felt myself ripped back from the pages on multiple occasions exclaiming 'That's not Fiver!'The book feels as though a list was created first of generic 'after school special' themes, then a story written forcibly around them. Rather than feeling a certain way about the issues, you are told to feel that way.I have a hard time accepting that this what even created by the same author.A note to those who loved the first:Just avoid it.

There are also many 'stuffups'. For example, In Watership Down Bigwig tells Hyzenthlay that they'll escape Efrafa by floating down a river. \\"What's a river\\" she asks. Then in Tales, Hyzenthlay:\\"the secret river, we USED to call it\\"Bad, boring, spoils the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll Take It","review":"This book is no where near as well written as Watership Down. However, I don't feel cheated, the title says \\"tales\\" and thats what we got, a series of \\"Tales\\" from Watership Down. I must say I was very disappointed at the tales that talked about the warren from Watership Down following the defeat of Woundwort. I was; however, pleased with the tales of Elahrairah. These tales gave me a little more insight into the world Adams created. Adams created mythological stories (which are by no means easy to create).

For years I wanted more and back in 1981 I got more - The Rabbits Ghost Story, published in a collection of Richard Adams' Favourite Animal Stories. I was surprised and elated to find that had been incorporated into this new book. However, when compared to the incomparable Watership Down this book left me cold. It had its moments but a female chief rabbit was not one of them. Nor was finding out that Bigwig was probably not the father of Hyzenthlay's kittens. I felt the format of eleven El-ahrairah stories on the trot was a mistake as was the overt attempts at political correctness. Well, at least nothing can dim the spirit of the original book. Watership Down was a product of its time (it was written in the late sixties) and it seems that in our time the rabbits of Watership Down have changed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adams recaptures the magic of Watership Down","review":"For those who didn't just read Richard Adams \\"Watership Down\\",but lived every moment of the spellbinding tale, this book willpleasantly stir those feelings again. \\"Tales from Watership Down\\"brings forth more of the lapine folklore about the rabbit prince,El-ahrairah, and his daring deeds.Even more satisfying is a brief continuation of what happenedto the rabbits of Efrafa and Watership Down following thegreat battle with General Woundwort.

Recently I have been reading and re-reading all the books in my library. I never read Watership Down, and maybe that's why I had such a hard time reading this one. I found the stories completly unconnected, some of the charechters not at all well developed, and the plots horrible. For example, just at the right moment in one quest, when the rabbit was ready to dispair, a bird comes hopping along and gives the rabbit the answer. Then the bird dissapears, only to reappear later and do the same thing! I was happy when I finally finished the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing. But worth a read.","review":"Okay, it's nothing close to the origional. This is a collection of short storys about El-ahrairah, Rabscuttle, Hazel and the rest of the Watership Down crew. For the most part the storys are unintresting, unimaginative, and pointless. The book spoils the image of El-ahrairah, and makes him look like a clown. There are a couple of good storys though, I especilly like the one concerning Campion. But don't expect the quality of story telling evident in the origional."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was way too short!","review":"I finished this book in two days commuting to work.

I find in amazing that the same author wrote these two books. Adams can do so much better. I had watership down read to me when I was younger, and loved it, and read it again and again. Then when I heard about Tales from watership, I went crazy. I was so happy and bought it right away. Gross. It is so lacking in the beauty and warmth and tension that Watership down is full of. If you've read Watership, don't read this one, it simply draws a VERY bad close to a beautiful book. It's just to easy.

Secondly, when it does focus on the others, it mostly focuses on the new characters, Hazel needs everything decided for him, Fiver is stuck in the Twilight Zone, Bigwig hardly says a word, and there are suddenly two chief rabbits.

And you certainly can't sling it around your neck; it's too short and it could put a lot of stress on your neck. I had a spare canvas shoulder strap lying around which is almost twice the length of this one, and now I'm completely satisfied with the bag. The handles are very rugged, only they come together with a velcro wrap for easy carrying. As with all velcro, it eventually gets worn and useless, so be forewarned. Don't be fooled by its size; this bag can carry a lot, thus making it quite heavy. So you will build some bicep and shoulder muscles. Other than these issues, this is the best bag I've ever had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item not as described!!","review":"Contrary to what the description says you do not get a Quadra-cut bit, you get the regular 2 blade bit.

So I emailed Freud and told them what I had been told and they said that noone at Freud had told them any such thing. I had to go elsewhere to get a Quadra-cut bit.

They were usually about 2 degrees apart in their readings. Also, the \\"automatically adjusting\\" clock was reset 3 times over 3 days and was placed in various locations as instructed. The closest it got was 3 hours early. Now the directions say that it adjusts to the Colorado Springs Atomic clock.

If the unit works for two or three years, I will be happy at this price. One negative is the location of the alarm button on the front. I tend to depress it when clearing the high/low memory and the alarm is set unintentionally.

It can read through my exterior walls because if I place the outside sensor just on the other side of the wall where the receiver is located, the receiver can read the sensor. Move it more than 5 feet away and the signal is lost. As to the atomic satellite reception, I've tried the clock in several locations inside my home to no avail.

Watched movies on my 160GB iPod Classic on a flight from San Francisco to London. This battery pack enabled me to watch movies and listen to music for 10 hours non-stop and it still has charge in it. Even after 10 hours of use, the iPod battery is still fully charged. Only gotcha here (as others have commented) is that the meaning of the product's red/blue lights is reversed (and thus a bit confusing) because they were wired reversed at the factory. Even though the little manual tried to correct for this it is still confusing at first.In general I am very happy with this purchase. It's sleek and surprisingly very lightweight (but not built cheaply -- this is a quality product). The sound quality is excellent from the dual headphone jacks and it's very nice to have independent volume control for each.Highly recommended. A must have for travelers on long flights.Kevin"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea/product","review":"But it doesn't come with ipod universal dock adapters, so you need to have one handy or order it if you threw it out when you opened the ipod box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unit does not work to company's specs","review":"Bought unit, instruction manual says a solid blue led light indicates a full charge for the battery.

This was quite a bit more expensive than the direct replacement because it is the hinge used in the 5000 pedal, but I can feel a difference in the speed and smooth movement. I'd say it's worth it as an upgrade or especially if you have to replace the hinge anyways.When installing this take care not to strip the screws holding it together. I almost stripped one trying to use a normal screwdriver and they would be really hard to get out if you strip one. Especially if your pedal is older, they will be kind of hard to get out. I took them out by using the exact right size bit on a power drill then pressing down with most of my body weight and slowly loosening them."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of good money","review":"The 700r is not a soft pull start machine and because of this ,I changed approximately 5 pulleys within a two year period.I hardly use this machine because of the hard pull.I t is very difficult to start.

Then, one day I attempted to start the engine and it simply would not start. After making numerous attempts to start the engine over the course of many days, all of which were unsuccessful, some component broke entirely. The mechanism that attached the flywheel to the piston no longer catches like it should, and the flywheel will nearly spin freely, not moving the piston at all.The weedwhacker was only used less than a dozen times, and was only a couple of months old. Lesson learned - you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear. Make sure you heard it before you buy it.","review":"After their first three albums, I was really looking forward to this new release. Unfortunately I felt that it to be an all-round disappointment -- but I realise that the band has a progressive style, and they're probably just moving away from my tastes. If you're thinking of buying this album based upon their previous albums' standards, I'd strongly recommend that you listen to the track previews beforehand. The artwork is less imaginative than previous albums, and I was disappointed by the unashamed commercialism in the lining notes. The songs seem dull and half-hearted, and (with the exception of track thirteen) the no-holds-barred, all-out crazy performances have gone, replaced with sample-based mediocrity. Perhaps it'll grow on me. Probably not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bedlam Ballroom","review":"Personally, I believe that this album would rate best with those SNZ fans who have followed the band from the beginning. It took some getting used to for me, but over the past few days it has started to grow on me. My favorites are Bedbugs and It All Depends. Their new sound is definitely more studio enhanced than previous albums. Although the songs do sound much better live, I would still consider this album perfect for those who want to escape for awhile. Katharine's voice is exceptionally beautiful on this one as her vocals are reminiscent of her Jazz Squad debut. The addition of the pianist really adds to the dixieland effect created in many of the more up-tempo numbers. There is really something for every listener throughout this album, you just have to be patient and let the music guide you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great","review":"Well, I am a real fan of the Squirrel Nut Zippers, and have all of their albums (except their live one). This one just didn't quite do it for me. FOr my money, HOT is track-for-track their best; it has an energy and a cohesion that none of their other albums have acheived. Which doesn't mean that the other albums are anything to shake a stick at. Even this album, with the fantastic opener \\"Bedbugs\\" and the playful \\"Missings Link\\", is a very good listen. The song \\"Hush\\" is probably their greatest ballad, and so lush you'd think it came from some great old movie. However, as a whole, I just didn't enjoy this album AS MUCH AS their others; but for a band as fun as the SNZ, their worst is still worth the price of the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, but not as much fun as their earlier efforts","review":"This is a first-rate CD, well worth owning, though it doesn't have the breathtaking madness of, say, Hot. It's much slicker, better produced. There is still quite a bit of Squirrel Nut Zipper originality here, but there are also moments when I felt like I was listening to just another nicely orchestrated swing album. As Squirrel Nut Zipper albums go, this may be a better one for background music at a cocktail party (except for the slightly out-of-place \\"Do What\\" track, which has a weird, almost-but-not-quite James Brown feeling to it) than for pure listening -- whether that's good or not, is up to you. Other tracks at times have a bit in common with the Cherry Poppin' Daddies and other swing groups. I still highly recommend it, but I hope their next album has more edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"SNZ Bedlam Ballroom","review":"Who are these people, and what have they done with my favorite band? I have six other SNZ CD's as well as Katharine Whalen's solo project and I love them all, what happened? Gone is the spooky southern aura that hung around their music. Sadly it's been replaced by a freakish mix of pop, funk, and a touch of latin beats. I miss Tom Maxwell's voice, and the only bright spot is Katharine sings a lot more on this disc. I listened then hoped and finally prayed it would get better as the tracks wound down, and it never happened. I hope this is not a new direction for such a great band.

This one does not live up to the standards that the first 3 set. Much has gone wrong. The main problem is that some original members have left the group and their replacements don't match up. I had the fortune of seeing the Zippers in mid-November at the Crocodile in Seattle. They are still fun live, but something is sorely missing. The sound on Bedlam Ballroom is different and not as stirring as the first 3 recordings. The ZIP is gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 5 star band produced a 2 star release","review":"I am a big SNZ fan. I have all 3 of their other releases and absolutely love them.

I just received my Dell 700m and I couldn't be happier!! I wisely chose to get it with the 8 cell battery. The downside of the 8 cell battery is that it sticks out about a half inch more than the 4 cell. HOWEVER, with that added inch and about 3/4ths of a pound, you get twice as much unplugged time. That's right instead of getting the 4 cell battery that lasts 2.5 hours, get the 8 cell battery that lasts 5 hours!!! I mean if you are getting this computer to be portable all day you'll definitley want the longer power time! if you're going to get a 4 cell battery because it's smaller and lighter, and you aren't planning on being unplugged for too long, go to an auction site and bid low! you can get a 4 cell battery for 80 bucks! not over 100 like on this site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Received Generic battery","review":"Returned battery due to receiving a generic battery and not a Dell which would've voided my Dell warranty.

After less than a few months the battery life started going down, until now over a year later I may get 20min. Any of these reviews that say \\"oh, you shouldn't expect more than a year of life on a battery\\".

At first the noise and movement scared him but he got over that soon enough. He liked that he could cause the reaction (the button is easy to push) but he was quickly bored with it. After a few months it stopped vibrating (as was stated in several other reviews) and even changing the batteries didn't help.

The focus on the fact that she was a rich lady didn't add any meaning to the story (except, perhaps, that she is able to have 100 dogs and take care of them.) As a picture book, the illustrations are interesting and the dogs have funny and silly names (all 100 are listed twice.)As a story, however, it lacks substance. The fact that the lady is described as a very kind rich lady throughout the book and not just as a very kind lady never sounds right to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fantasy Romance!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this exciting fantasy sword and scorery romance.

With nary a misstep in sight, the disc also contains some of their early work, which leans toward country-rock/pop(think Maria McKee or Cowboy Junkies), highlighted by 'I Don't Want A Lover' and the gently rocking 'Everyday Now'. As good as their early work was, they really hit their stride when they began drawing on their pop strengths, supremely represented here by 'Say What You Want','When We Are Together', and 'Halo', among others.

I am very impressed with the power mine has, plus it's made here in the USA which is a huge selling point for me, I would be willing to bet Shop Vac is the only brand made here. It's also surprisingly quiet, not much louder than a standard vacuum you use for your floors. My only complaint is the tool storage deal, it comes with several attachments/tools and they don't fit very well onboard, so you'll have to pay attention so you don't lose any of them.

Kwanzaa apparently is an American creation, a manufactured, totally unreligious holiday for blacks who don't wish to subscribe to Christmas. All right, they're entitled. But Christmas music, both secular and sacred, has been amassing for centuries. Popular Christmas music has a long history, and the accumulation of those decades' worth of songwriting is amazing. You can't suddenly say, \\"Okay, we've got a new holiday here. Anyone got any songs?\\" You get some truly uninspired results that way, and that's what has happened with this album. These are fairly mediocre tunes that fail to grab you. Maybe if 10 more songwriters chip in with albums of their own, then someone can put together a collection of the best of the bunch and from that a set of \\"traditional\\" Kwanzaa songs might evolve.

You know their 'romance' is doomed. She wants The King, but she's already Promised to Another.We're also cruelly tantalized by the lovely Barbara McNair as--you guessed it--Mary's foxy-nun nurse-buddy, Sister Irene.

At the end of the film, she is deciding who to go with: the church or the doctor, the church or the doctor. It keeps flashing on-screen: a crucifix, Elvis, a statue of Mary, Elvis.

While it tries to raise serious issues including the role of the church, civil rights, racism, and autism, you come away with nothing but a bad case of side burns.

This movie shows the destruction of part of New York, including the Twin Towers, by a meteor that is a splinter off an incoming 5 mile-diameter asteroid. Earlier splinters had hit the Pacific, devastating Hong Kong with a tidal wave, and the Swiss Alps, devastating the ski resort areas.Although the visual effects are primitive, as might be expected for the time, the point is driven well across. If the ICBM's fail to dislodge the asteroid off from its collision course with Earth, it will produce earthquakes orders of magnitude greater than ever experienced by humans before, and inject enough dust into the atmosphere to block sunlight for several months, quite possibly dooming all of humanity to extinction."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever made!","review":"After just watching this on TV, I wondered what others would think of it.

Plus the fact that somehow the missles from the USSR and USA never collide with each other, but fly in neat rows. What a joke!Sure, the premise is viable,and the cast top-notch, but this film is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor story and terrible special effects","review":"Meteor was a disaster film that turned into a real disaster.The film was a box ofice bomb and one of the reasons for this was it's terrible special effects caused by budget problems.Even for the time it was made,they were very poor and in fact one snowslide special effect was borrowed from another film.Although it had a top cast of actors,the film had a poor script.

This is possibly the worst film Sean Connery has ever appeared in. Hammy acting, leaden direction, inept storytellying, etc. It's worst offense is the super cheesy special effects. They don't even pass the mustard with the original \\"Star Trek\\" standards. Heck, \\"Plan 9\\" had more convincing visuals.

Neame, who just passed away in June of this year, directed such classics asTunes of Glory - Criterion CollectionandThe Poseidon Adventure (Special Edition)apparently just couldn't do anything to make Meteor even an entertaining film.

The production is pure warm analog, the sound of a band playing together in a room. Listen to this with the headphones on and you'll know immediately what I'm talking about.

Not since the mid-sixties Beatles did an artist/group dominate the musical landscape the way Stevie Wonder did from 1973 - 1977.

It sounds compressed and equalized excessively, it's harshly brighter, more distorted sounding and overall unpleasant to listen to. Also, the level of the analog tape hiss is notably hotter than on my \\"old\\" version! Certainly compressing and EQ'ing old masters can effectively raise the level of hiss, but this seems like more than what I would expect from that and I can't figure why.

The book is majorly boring. I agree with the reviewer who said it was depressing. There are ideas in the book but they almost don't matter because they are presented in context of the narrow prescribed Pottery Barn \\"look.\\" My friends and I make fun of the \\"Pottery Barn look\\" because it's a kind of suburban decorating uniform.

It's not. \\"Pottery Barn\\" and \\"style\\" don't go together because Pottery Barn sells a canned look whereas style is all about doing your own thing today and not buying into a canned look.

Let me count them off: Colt is a \\"street-smart\\" soldier with a \\"book-smart\\" know-nothing commanding officer; Colt's wife has been kidnapped by hostile Indians, and Colt has to break the rules in order to set up a small band to rescue her; a young and brash Indian(who are quite 2-dimensional) wants to have her and he goes after Colt; there's a traitor that happens to be in the rescue party, but he ends up in the same boat as the others; said traitor redeems himself(the old bad boy gone good routine). I do like the character of Amity Colt, but this is way too cliched and overdone to be a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luv it","review":"It's country, rocky, and bluesy all in one. Fun tunes like \\"Your Easy on the Eyes\\" combined with ballads like \\"I'm Alright\\" combined with \\"Now That I found You\\" along so many others. It's hard to catorigize. It comes off as an \\"I lost in love; I found love; and I lost love again\\" type album. One of my favorites because of the different styles on one album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terri Clark - How I Feel","review":"Terrific. First of all, she has a very distinctive voice that you couldn't compare to any other with the exception maybe of that of Patty Loveless. Nevertheless, this is her best album. While her previous efforts showed Terri has a tough and proud woman unafraid of any man, this set shows her a little softer and, I guess, more mature musically. The song that made me buy this CD is the first single, \\"Now That I've Found You\\", which was contemporary enough to get her into Billboard's Top 3 but still had enough emotion and I thought it was quite better than most of the songs at no. 1 around that time. There are better songs on this set, though, like the traditional Melba Montgomery-written song, \\"Cure For The Common Heartache\\", \\"Unsung Hero\\". Another single that did it for me here is the rockin' \\"You're Easy On The Eyes\\" (\\"but hard on the heart\\"). All songs are top-rate. She's a great singer and this is a great album, her best actually."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I like Terri Clark.

In the song, it starts out ballady and slightly complicated for this man, than rocks out when he's feels he's not going to let noone get him down. This song pulled me into the way of understanding that when you know right from wrong, lonliness from the wrong people or things is not really being lonley."},{"rating":"1","title":"critical of books content","review":"after reading this book i believe that mr pollan wants us to \\"die on the job\\".if you invest wisely you can retire early, lets say at age 52.if you lived frugal then retire frugal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good investment of spare time","review":"The book is obviously aimed towards the baby-boom generation as a motivational tool.

This is such a book. It covers new ground and offers compelling reasons to reconsider the entire notion of retirement. This book is also very readable and really is a must read for anyone who wants to retire or is in retirement. Here you will find the antithesis to all the retirement advice you will get from most every other source on retirement investing. At the very least, grab this book off the shelf of your favorite library or store and read the first 18 pages. This synopsis covers the heart of what the authors have to offer and will help you decide if you need to read the whole volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Baby Boomer Claptrap","review":"The authors attempt to justify blowing all your money on yourself, leaving your children penniless, and clogging up the work place until you are so old they have to wheel you away from your desk on a stretcher. It is pretty ironic considering the unprecedented economic advantages given to the Baby Boom generation by their parents, who generally did exactly the opposite of what this book says is okay for Boomers to do. Utterly predictable, self-absorbed advice for the Me Generation.The only good advice in here is to cut up your credit cards. But anyone with a brain figured that one out a long time ago.If you are a Baby Boomer looking for a pat on the back for leaving your kids high and dry or treading water in a job that should have went to a younger person 15 years ago, then buy this book, you'll feel better about your actions. If you are anyone else, leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only Book to Get on Personal Finance","review":"I bought this book because I liked the quirky title. I then proceeded to read the entire thing in a single sitting. Once you get the idea, following it through to the various logical conclusions is enthralling. Imagine saying that about a book dealing with finance! It is also engagingly written. I thought I was the only crackpot who looked at things this way, although I had not carried out the ideas fully. Now I am encouraged to continue owning my life. Bravo."},{"rating":"1","title":"baby boomer selfishness shines through.","review":"This book is, it seems to me, a view of one who is selfish and concerned only with himself - maybe typical of the baby boomer generation. No matter that one of his children or grandchildren may suffer from a life threatining illness that may wipe out family savings, the author recommends that one live a life without carefully planning, and ignores the fact that individuals themself or those they love may need to save in order to plan and help the one's they love in those times of need. While an individual with all the money in the world may, although doubtful, live a life of complete content, one would think that his or her love for others would encourage he or she not to spend as the author, but save and live a more humble, and likely more pleaseing life, so that that individual may not have to suffer needlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it!","review":"...

Please, don't buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review","review":"When I purchased this there were only 3 in stock on amazon and the price was only $7.00 for a 12 x 24 x .048 sheet. Less than half the price of a 12 x 12 in the same thickness. The material arrived 1 day early, packaging was good, material was not bent. One side of the material had a plastic protective sheet adhered to it. The unprotected side of the material exhibited numerous scratches and the protected side had at least one deep scratch that had cut through and damaged the surface. I looked at the same material on amazon today and it is listed at $19.00 per sheet. My assumption is they knew the material was damaged and that was the reason they offered it at such a cheap price. The scratches will not be an issue for me because I will be welding and grinding the material and using a 60 grit pad on a dual action sander to create a scratched finish for the end product anyway. I'm happy with the purchase because it would have cost me a lot more money somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the downward spiral","review":"This may be the worst album yet. I'm a Lenny fan and unless you've seen him live, you have no idea what a talent he is. After the disappointment from LENNY and hearing the first BORING single, I refused to buy this album. My girlfriend got it for free and I've given it a few spins.It's embarrassing to listen to. The overall sound is very canned and the lyrics are make the man a sitting duck for ridicule. \\"Don't wanna a Rock Star!\\". There is very little if any funk or variation from his standard sound. And it sounds MUCH more \\"pop\\" than any of his previous efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"Not much here. A big disappointment. Drum tracks sound like a kid who knows a couple of beats practicing as the neighbors cring. No memorable songs. I actually was 90% of the way to flinging this out of my car window. Is he kidding or what with this. Guess one should bring the bong after the recording. Yeh, we know the routine Lenny. At best this is a Pro Tools recording demo. There are many better albums to buy right now unless you are a diehard Kravitz fan I cannot even fathom why you play this more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new, or interesting","review":"I would consider myself a big Kravitz fan, seen him twice and own all the albums. However Baptism is hardly an improvement from the last album Lenny. It is mostly rock rooted, but the songs have nothing that really get you. I also wonder why Lenny is now insistant on playing all the instruments, when all the fans know that his live band is one of the best in the business. I think these songs would have more punch with Ross on lead guitar and Blackmann on drums. Instead Lenny pounds us with drums that don't really sound any different from Lenny and guitars that sound like they were recorded with the amplifier buried in a tin drum. I think Lenny Kravitz really needs to reconsider how and who he uses to record new material."},{"rating":"1","title":"this album is terrible...and this is lenny were talkin about","review":"lenny kravitz is one of my favourite singers of all time... but this album tumbled down... the last 3 lenny albums have been commercial...

It's the most basic, simplistic songwriting outside of the teeny-bopper set (Britney Aguilera, Jessica Spears...whatever). If he made country music, he'd fit right in. But he doesn't. So he doesn't. It's music that has already been done since the beginning of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jimi Hendrix and Bob Marley rip-off","review":"I dont like this guy.

No, not goundbreaking but good solid rock. Sure it's been done before, but really good rock is still hard to find. Why the Hendrix comparisons? It doesn't make any sense. Hendrix was a virtuoso way ahead of his time. Kravitz has always been retro - ON PURPOSE - and he does it better than anyone. He practically channels the 70's rock/funk groove. If you want it authentic, buy the Sly and the Family Stone catalog. If you want guitar supremacy, buy Hendrix. If you want a fan's love letter to both, buy Baptism"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is better than the last one.","review":"I was hesitant at first from buying this cd after reading the negative reviews on Amazon. However, after listening to a few sound bites I decided to take a chance on this. The only Lenny cd's I have are the greatest hits, Lenny, and \\"5\\".

Where'd the funk go?At his best, I always though Lenny was a perfect hybrid of Jimmy Hendrix, Prince, and a little bit of Paul Stanley circa 1970's KISS, but I think he has now become a parody of himself.\\"Fly Away\\" becoming a hit was the worst thing to happen to him, because everything he's done since is trying to emulate that.This CD will make a good coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"We lost him since 2001 and this album does not redeem him","review":"I had hopes, I must admit. I really wanted Lenny Kravitz to rediscover deep inside him that long lost feel that he captured us with back in the days of his first few albums, all the way to the grand '5' from 1999. But so life goes... After his 2000 Greatest Hits release it all went downhill, and 'Baptism' is not doing much to redeem him from his sin: to deprive music lovers of the world from the great music he's capable of. I honestly don't give the album one star, because all creative efforts entail enough work to be worth something, but there's so much more potential in Lenny that I can only be dissapointed at this album.

His sound is honed, his lyrics shine, but the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because it is missing... something. It just doesn't feel complete or something... i'm not sure. One mistake was asking jay-z to guest star on the album. A rapper on a rock legend's album. Oh no! That just didn't fit. Overall the album is very good, but i must mention the album is a little toned down rocking wise and does seem to focus more on ballads, which is good because the songs are very good. THere are also alot more spiritual songs (the other side, Baptized), both yearning for a love only God can give. Some very good production, and voice changes make for an interesting album. Also some great guitar work that gives the album a retro feel; which of course every lenny album gives off. Overall, LEnny is a great talent, and i appreciate his gift of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The wonderful restraint of the Younger Dagars","review":"As in everything by the Younger Dagars that I have heard, there is a wonderful restraint in this rendition of Raga Multani. The music is revealed in an unhurried, controlled manner that borders on the minimalist tendencies of some modern western composers, such as Morton Feldman.

The idea of merging real footage was also a winner.But (and that's a BIG BUT), I wonder who at Universal despised this movie so much as to give it this sh...t transference job to DVD or, apparently, to no no job transfer at all.

Furthermore, the explosion of the vessel at the end of the movie was filmed in black and white. I understand why -- it allowed for the interspersement of actual historical footage into the movie -- but it took away from what would have been a spectacular visual effect in color. Of course, the video quality was so bad that maybe it would not have mattered.

I realized that the paint had some pollen and sap and other junk that probably accumulated while it sat on the dealer's lot. So, I decided to order this product. This evening I followed the SUPER EASY directions, and within 5 minutes, I had an incredibly smooth hood. It was as if the car had just been painted.

This makes the make feel brand new. It doesn't fix scratches, swirls, etc but you can't expect it to. It is not the job of the clay bar to do that. That's the job of a good swirl remover. This will make your paint feel like smooth glass. You can glide your finger across with ease afterwards.Kneed it after every 2x2 ft section and use a good amount of the instant detailer. Too little of it and you'll mar your paint. The clay should slide across the paint like a stick of butter in a warm pan. You'll feel a very tiny amount of pull when you first do it, then zero pull at all. If you feel a lot of pull, there is not enough instant detailer on the paint. BE CAREFUL NOT TO DROP IT.

The car didn't really need it but you could tell there was some stuff on the surface of the car so I figured that it couldn't hurt. I did put a tarp under the car and did drop the clay bar a few times so this saved a few clay bars. It's not a big car so it didn't take as long as I thought it would, less than 2 hours. It actually took less effort than I thought it would. It comes with 2 bars but I cut one in half and used just that half and that did the job very well and looks good enough to use again (can you use one again, it looks as yellow as when I started). I highly recommend Mothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can cause scratches","review":"This is going to a brief review. I tried clay bars after reading all the rave reviews on them. I think that claying helps with removing a good amount of the contaminants lodged on the surface and gives it a smoother finish that can be felt with the hand which will bring a smile to your face.On the other hand these contaminants transferred to the clay or in the paint cause scratches even when using a generous amount of the lubricant and rubbing carefully. I have frequently noticed new scratches just after I clayed my car. This did not bring a smile to my face. I had to spend extra time and effort polishing and waxing to get rid of these new scratches. I followed the exact instructions posted on the product but was not able to avoid these scratches.I think that either the directions and usage conditions need to be specified with more exactness OR the whole idea of claying is flawed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Results!!!!","review":"2012 Beetle Turbo / Reef BlueUsed this on my Beetle today before applying wax.

I guess if you wait too long in between clay barring, it takes a while to get all the crud off. If you do it more often, maybe twice a year, it should probably take less time.For your reference, I have a Subaru Impreza.

You can also use clay bar for cleaning windshield - you'll see amazing results.- Remaining detail-liquid can be used to clean the car after wash.- You probably will need more than one towel to complete one vehicle.

The car was in pristine condition, but when you looked closely at the doors, wheel flares, and bumper you could see these little orange, rusty looking specks. I have never owned a white car before so I was concerned it was the actual finish that was degrading already. After reading online I found out this is normal to see on white cars and is caused by rail and break dust, acid rain, and other causes. Those contaminants stick to the finish and themselves start to corrode. I could not remove them with basic washing or spray on cleansers, so I researched what could work. I kept coming across \\"clay bars\\" as the way to fix this. So I bought it and voila! Finish looks brand new and shiny white now. It is extremely easy to do and scrubs the car nice and smooth.

Yes, the rapping itself is lame and trite, but the concept unto itself is what mattered. And for that, Miles delivered some very confident playing.While certainly not essential listening, \\"Doo-Bop\\" did re-prove the obvious- Miles did everything his way, when he wanted to do them.

But a big part of it is probably that Miles died before the thing was even halfway finished, and this assclown got put in charge of the final mix and track selection, at which he is hopeless. And what the %$#*^% is with that title? When you mix Hip Hop with Be Bop, you get Be Hop or Hip Bop; seems Easy Mo Beeyotch got confused with Doo Wop.

A few days ago I picked up the album myself and loved it even though I'm mostly a fan of Miles stuff from the 50's and 60's.

If you love Miles stay away from \\"Doo-Bop.\\" Miles does some fine trumpet playing as usual, but the backgrounds by Easy Mo Bee are absolutely terrible. I feel that to even produce the album was a dishonor to Miles. For example, two of the songs were compiled after Miles died, and the later added background absolutely ruined any respect I might of ever had for Easy Mo Bee and his taste in music. In addition, the lyrics to some of the tunes are so stupid. We already know he's playing with the \\"legendary Miles Davis,\\" and that his (Miles') \\"horn can't be beat,\\" so why does Easy Mo Bee have to rap about it.

I can think of nothing else of interest to note regarding this disc. If the liner notes are to be trusted, Davis chose hip-hop tracks laid down by \\"Easy Mo Bee\\" and played his trumpet over them. To give credit where it is due, some of his trumpet passages are worth hearing. Many more are not, certainly in comparison to the 40+ years of work he had laid down prior to this. As for the backing tracks, \\"Easy Mo Bee\\" hasn't been heard from again, and the reason why is not hard to determine from a quick listen to this: as hip-hop goes, this is not prime material. What seals the 1-star rating is the rapping. Even in the banality-drenched world of hip-hop, \\"Easy Mo Bee's\\" lyrics are worthless. This record is just awful; for Miles Davis completists and devotees of second-rate hip-hop only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable","review":"Perhaps Miles owed his dealer, or he was just plain bored, but this is an underwhelming foray into hip hop by a legend. It's not Miles so much as his collaborators, actually. The rapping is awful, and while this is from 1992, it sounds even more dated. Easy Mo Bee is not very impressive, period, and it's a rather ignominious note for Davis to go out on, though I believe he croaked while making it, so there's somewhat of an excuse. The best track is the opener, Mystery, which is reprised in the finale. It does sound rather generic now, but it's the high point on a forgettable chapter (his last) from the master himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"New York Popout Map: Double Edition, Manhattan Maps","review":"I believe the person that invented this format is a genius.

You can quite easily set it up so that you can see pictures on your webcam from any internet connected computer at any time, or set it to alert you via email if anything moves in the room it's in. Also, the little clip holds the webcam on a laptop quite securely, and though it doesn't turn left or right, you can easily place it left or right on the laptop. Overall, I'm quite pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't, just dont","review":"the only good thing about this product is the price. the pic quality is so unbelievably bad and the clip is so small and hard 2 stabilize. just not worth it.do yourself a favor people. keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is a really nice looking little web cam but that's about the only positive thing I can say about it.The picture quality isn't very good and when you're talking the lips don't sync with the video.I have a much older web cam made my Logitec that works much better and has much better sound.It also took a long time to install the software and after installation it had to download and install updates which didn't seem to improve the performance at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is this so unappreciated?!","review":"As a big fan of Talking Heads, David Byrne, and everything else I had heard related to TH, I saw a used copy of this on sale for pocket change, and thought I should definitely pick it up. On the first couple listens, I was a little unsure about it . . . Seemed sort of weirdly disco-ish in some ways. But the more I listened, the more it grew on me, and it's now definitely one of my favorite albums. \\"Who Wants an Ugly Girl?\\" has a really catchy reggae-ish beat, \\"Daddy Come Home\\" features some really cool and creative instrumentals (bagpipes, etc.), \\"You Sexy Thing\\" is a very hip cover, and every single other song on the CD is also wonderfully fun and catchy. It seems like it just doesn't get old. I also discovered this is the BEST music I've ever listened to while exercising...So upbeat and energetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Tom Tom Club CD by far","review":"Tom Tom Club is a spin off from the Talking Heads, featuring Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz. This is the group's fourth CD. It is 57 minutes long and the sound quality is very good. For some reason, the Tom Tom Club is relatively unknown and their CD's are hard to find.This is a great album. It is along the lines of what the Talking Heads were doing during the time of Stop Making Sense, especially the songs that featured Weymouth.This is a collection of great dancable songs. There isn't a bad track on it. And even at 57 minutes, it never gets slow or boring. They do a wonderful version of You Sexy Thing.This is their best album. The earlier albums are OK. I don't like their last album, The Good, The Bad and The Funky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book..I cannot wait to read the sequel and third book!","review":"I think that this book holds great promise.It may not be the best fantasy ever writtem=n, but it still is a great book, and a well rounded plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early Hill/Spencer western has some good moments","review":"A better film than Boot Hill, this is one of three early Terence Hill/Bud Spencer westerns that led up to the classic \\"Trinity\\" films. Their characters here are nearly up to their mature \\"Trinity/Bambino\\" forms, but they must share the spotlight with Eli Wallach, who slows the film down enormously. There are some good scenes with Hill/Spencer antics that make the film noteworthy for their comedy fans, but mainly for completists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book on runes","review":"Mr. Blum's book was good for one thing, bringing runes back into mainstream popularity. Unfortunetly, everything he writes lacks historical accuracy. His approach to the runes stems from a psychological view, as are his meanings. He has a tendency to use different names for the runes without any consistency.His creation of the blank rune even further shows his lack of historical accuracy, and shoddy research.There are so many books on runes that are muc better than anything made by Blum."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR","review":"I oredered this item In October and received it 3-4 weeks later.

N.B.: I can only comment on the 2-channel stereo performance, not the 5.1, because my system is only 2-channel capable. Rest assured, however, that it is of sufficient quality to be definitive for 2-channel audio (custom headphone amplifier, Grado headphones).I have other good-sounding SACD's as well: Billy Joel \\"The Stranger\\", Norah Jones \\"Come Away With Me\\", Buena Vista Social Club (DVD-A) as well as other not so great sounding SACD's and DVD-A's. IMO, BluesQuest is the best sounding musical disc (SACD, DVD-A, or CD) I've ever heard with one of the best track lineup top-to-bottom of blues songs on one compilation. Robert Lucas' \\"50 Lbs of Bone\\" on Track 9 is simply a gem. Such delicious humour and good music all in one song. And you can't go wrong with Mighty Sam McClain. His Track 4 \\"Too Proud\\" is almost too good.Highly recommended for any blues-loving audiophile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good performances, excellent sonics","review":"The first and last tunes are fantastic, the others good performances.

This is the most symphonic of any concerto I know for a single instrument and the orchestra must be an equal partner. They are more than adequate. Helmerson has flawless intonation coupled with very lyrical phrasing, but he tends to rush certain phrases and sometimes this cuts off the beauty of the music. I have more than 25 different versions of this piece and I will come to this version often for its focus, clarity and dynamics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Radio works ok if you don't like clear sound, and it stops playing cds after 2 weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of power in this 4 stroke","review":"I have had this for about a month now The first time I used it the line used up really quick and the spool gets tangled inside really easy.

The trouble is that Jessica (Amy Smart) is already engaged to a workaholic (a bald Billy Zane) who's always on his cell phone, while Jake (played by screenwriter Tom Malloy), who holds the title of World West Coast Swing Champion, is still carrying the torch for a former flame who has already moved onto a new love interest and dance partner.A paint-by-numbers romantic comedy, \\"Love N\` Dancing\\" has moments of undeniable charm - in its early stages at least - but the triteness of the plotting, the uncharismatic performances, the motley secondary characters (Rachel Dratch and Bette White make brief appearances), and the surfeit of implausibilities wind up taking their toll in the end.The dancing is cool, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible..","review":"...save your money...this film is terrible. Thank goodness I only rented it from Video on Demand. Dialogue is atrocious.

Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love N' Dancing","review":"I like this movie a lot. As a West Coast Swing Dancer myself I definitely enjoyed all the dancing scenes.

These examples only begin to depict the 6th grade jokes and stereotypes that run through this movie. The dancing is exciting and energizing. It's too bad the world that it inhabits is so flat, predictable, and juvenile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Secondary characters are the stars","review":"I love dancing and movies about dancing. The brightest spots of this movie are the secondary characters played by Billy Zane, Rachel Dratch and Caroline Rhea. There are also cameos by Dancing With the Stars winner Benji Schwimmer and partner Heidi Groskreutz-Burns. Otherwise blah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the new age....","review":"I've read some of the previous reviews that say that Sid Roth is a \\"traitor Jew\\", but I do not agree with that assessment. Sid Roth is a man who was deeply involved in the New Age movement and occult practices. This book details his search for \\"something more.\\" He found that in Jesus, the Messiah.If you enjoy biographies of saints or other spiritual people you will enjoy this book.

This book can help you past the doubts and fears.Sid is well educated, ambitious, and successful. You could only benefit from knowing about his relationship with G-d. This book is a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy followup to first album","review":"This is a classy followup to the previous year's hit self titled album (released on CD as Come to Me). Producer/writer Tony Green has diversified things a bit, with one side of the original album being ballads and midtempo songs that really show of France's voice. These are great but the disco side still holds up, with perhaps France's best song, The Heart to Hurt the Heart standing out. Green has taken the track into the 80s a bit with a sligthly more electronic edge than his previous disco tracks and it works.As usual Unidisc messed up the song order--which is why I only gave it 4 stars. On the original LP tracks 4-7 were the A Side. The B Side was 8, 2-3E"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorrowful Schubert","review":"This SACD of Schubert's 9th symphony is one of the worst recordings I've ever heard.

The other 2 discs had a list of wav files and some buttons on them. I called Nova for help and the tech tried to install the program with me but to no avail. The comment was that it is a new program. He finally got me into the web site with clipart that you get free with this program. What they don't tell you is that most of the clipart is online on this site and after a year you will have to pay $100 to continue your subscription.

I have fiddled with this program and as far as I can see, there are only about 100 images that are high quality. (Maybe there are more, but I have not been able to figure it out.)

As Kidd and his group of thief/pals begin looking into the death, they see connections to the high-tech company where Jack was killed.Who cares?I could not even finish this book, it is slowly paced, and filled with too many characters and high-tech jargin that I quickly lost interest.

A Sanford novel is usually a treat especially if Davenport is prowling the Twin Cities. This Kidd novel lacks any real plot development, is trite and has no imagination. I picked up this book and read it in one sitting. There was no spark that would hold the reader. Being in the computer field, the book was even more tedious. Sanford should stick to what he does best. There seemed to be little effort in writing this book and the story meandered all over the place.

I'm in high school and I found this book to be very boring. The premise was interesting. The lack of insight into the characters and little setting discription lead me to believe that the book was written just to get another book published.

Wish I could say the same for this Kidd novel. I have to say I thought the characters were shallow, and Kidd was a pig. I had trouble getting past Kidd's behavior.

I have no idea what this book is about or why Mr.S. chose to load it up with so much computer esoterica....It is not my purpose to demean the author who, I know, can write up a storm when he's on.

The smokey essence is very artificial smelling. There are no ingredients listed on the box or any indication as to what they have used, but it smells like \\"artificial smoke flavor\\". VERY pungent odor before even opening the box, almost intolerable when steeping. Should be a softer smoke. Not as strong on the tongue but artificial smoke scent was unbearable. Sorry Twinings. I'd say spend a few bucks more and get a looseleaf variety instead. It'll be a much more \\"real\\" Lapsang Souchong experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twinings - poor choice","review":"I'm a big fan of Lapsang Souchong tea; have been drinking it since LBJ was in office. That said, Twinings version is dreadful. The tea itself seems to be of low quality, and as one other reviewer suggested, the \\"smoke\\" seems to be out of a chemistry set, very artificial, burnt, and harsh tasting rather than a rich, smoky taste. Maybe they smoke it over discarded tires.My favorite Lapsangs to date have been Wagner's loose (now out of business, apparently), and Numi's tea bags. Unfortunately, Numi discontinued their bags a while back, and for some reason, their loose tea doesn't seem the equal, which is pretty weird. Still, Numi is quite good, and far better than Twining's pathetic effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"must be an acquired taste","review":"I do not like smoked foods (cheese, meats, etc). So, I took a gamble by purchasing this tea because I was looking for new and unique flavors. The description says \\"golden black tea with a delicate smokey flavor.\\" Delicate could not be farther from the truth! This was shipped to me along with 5 more boxes of different Twinings flavors. When I opened the package, all I could smell was this - despite the fact that each bag is sealed in a paper bag, inside a plastic wrapped box! The smoke smell was overwhelming. When I showed it to my husband, he said it smelled like tobacco. The smell was so bad, I could not even brew a cup.Other reviewers obviously enjoyed this, but for me it was a complete waste of money. I could not even give the tea away."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your taste buds are gone.......","review":"If your taste buds are gone you may like this tea.

This tea, however, is the most nauseating blend I have ever sampled. I brewed as per directions, and the \\"stench,\\" not the aroma, almost prevented me from tasting it, but I did. Taking one small sip proved more than enough. If a smoked side of a hog or such were to be immersed in water, and served as tea, it could not be worse than this \\"smokey\\" blend. Even when poured down the sink, the odor left behind required some added clean-up. This was given to me as a gift; a very poor choice.

This has allowed me to \\"grow\\" with the tape by doing more challenging variations with my \\"strong\\" muscle groups while still working lower levels on \\"weaker\\" areas.

It's also a great full-body workout, with a nice balance of vinyasa and standing poses, foward and backward bending, action and relaxation. Plus, Kathy's a rare bird for a work-out queen-she's motivating in both appearance and presentation without being too perky (a la Denise Austin). And though she's known better as an aerobic instructor, she clearly knows her stuff-which shows in both her verbal cues and perfect postures. Get this one and Ally McGraw's tape, and you're set."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Video you can own for beginner and intermediate!","review":"I have done this yoga tape over and over and over again since I bought it in '95.

Almost every song is in a different key than from the movie and many of the songs that should be 8,9 and 10 pages long are only, at most, 4 pages. In other words, this book leaves out some of the best parts of the songs such as \\"mess around\\" and \\"Georgia\\".

I am very disappointed. Kathy's cueing is way off, the music isn't exciting at all, and the dancers are intimidating. I have done the tape twice now, and both times I found myself checking my watch to find out when I would be done. I exercise to videos about 5 times a week, consider myself at an intermediate level, and the tape didn't even allow me to break a sweat. This video will surely collect dust at my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun - Muy Caliente!","review":"I have never had so much fun with an exercise video until I did the \\"Latin Workout\\". I was very impressed with Kathy and her assistants. The music was marvelous and very authentic. I love Afro-Cuban music. I really worked up a sweat. You can get a lot out of this video when you put more effort into the moves. This video is so enjoyable the time just flies by. I really had to get used to moving my hips.

Some reviews have said you don't \\"sweat\\" but I like latin dance and I really don't like the generic \\"fitness\\" routine...I really get into the moves and I sweat plenty.The Merengue setions work you the hardest in my opinion (its got the fastest beat)and I love the cha cha sectionI think to get the most out of this video you really have to work it and I always do the workout all the way through...not stopping after the first \\"beginner\\" portion.

Her annoying \\"Oooowwws\\" throughout the dvd are just awkward. The selection of music is okay but the instructors that helped her with the dvd must have been playing a joke on her. This dvd lacks latin style, rhythm and professionalism. This dvd seems like someone filmed a free salsa lesson at a low rent club and then decided to make an improptu workout dvd as an afterthought.I'd like my money back, please. Don't waste your time on this one. All parties involved in this video should be embarrassed. [...] I also have to fault myself.

There are too many dancers on the floor so its hard to concentrate on the instructor. Plus the instructor flys through the dance moves way too fast to keep up. Only did this video once, wasn't worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened Kathy?","review":"I couldn't wait to get this video. I purchased it from Amazon.com. As soon as it arrived, I put it in. It was terrible. I have had some lessons in Merengue, Salsa and Latin Dancing (I am a Spanish Teacher) and thought this would be a great 'different' way to work out. I was wrong. Kathy was too dressed up and looked like she was going out, not working out. I didn't break a sweat, was bored and kept telling myself that it will get more challenging. Wrong again. I have only used it two times and I feel like I wasted my money. I love her other videos and feel like I have worked out when doing the others. Not with this one. I don't want to use this video as my workout video because I don't feel like I'll get a good enough workout from it. I hope Kathy comes out with a new, normal, video soon. Don't let us down again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had great fun!","review":"I have used several of Kathy Smith's tapes in the past 10 years and have always found her tapes to be a good workout. This one is so much fun that I am sweating like crazy and don't even realize it. Some of the dance steps are a little difficult for someone with no rhythm (I am definitely keeping my day job) but you are busy trying to master the steps and don't realize you are working! The music is great and quite motivating. A great alternative to repetitive exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great...","review":"I was disappointed with the video. It was difficult to follow Kathy because she just didn't have that \\"Latin Rhythm\\" You get used to following the beat and suddenly she is slightly off beat and that throws you off. Her companions were easier to follow because they had more rhythm. I did eventually work up a slight sweat but it still left me wanting more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissapointment.......","review":"Well, my title say's it all, what a dissapointment. What you think your getting, you don't get at all. To keep my review as \\"to the point\\" as possible, this looked like an amature video. First of all, they are wearing black pants in a dim studio so therefore it is really hard to see exactly what they are doing with there legs and feet. Secound, Kathy is all over the place with her movements and not in a benificial position for the viewer at times. There were times where she would introduce a new movement, and the camera wasn't even on her. She almost at times looked like she had forgotten that she was suposed to be \\"teaching\\" this routine. There are also moments where she had forgoten in the original taping to que a new movement, so you will here an overhead of her voice, which is just so amature and cheap. I give this video 2 stars because it is not worth more then 2 dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found this tape disappointing and below Kathy's usual high standards. It wasn't much of a workout and unless you're a dancer, it's rather difficult to master the steps. I hope Kathy goes back to putting out her aeobics tapes and gets away from \\"trendy\\" videos!"},{"rating":"2","title":"difficult yet motivational","review":"I found the workout to be a bit hard, but its so much fun. It takes some practice to get used to the steps, but thats what makes it motivational.I love this video!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Great","review":"To those who are wondering if you should buy this vid or not. I read all the people's reviews on this site, and overall I had a good impression, so I bought this vid. But..... You know, when you buy any exercise vides, you think \\"Right, I wanna get a bottom like hers, so I'll do the exercise she does and get a good body.\\"or something like that. You wouldn't wanna get a video of someone who's very ordinary, cause that wouldn't motivate you at all. From that point of view, Kathy is good, but other dancers, I didn't think they were good enough. I don't mean just the appearance, but also the way they dance. I'm not saying they were bad or anything, but I didn't find it amazing at all. No offence to some of you who love this video, but this wasn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it!","review":"This is the worst workout dvd I ever purchased. Kathy Smith zips through the steps in seconds and you can't see because it is so dark.

The little brunette professional dancer grinning up at the camera and completely showing off made it unwatchable. Let alone keep up with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast moving, fun and genuine dance moves...fabulous!!","review":"The combination of the music and moves make this tape about my favorite cardio workout. It's fast moving, with inspirational dancers and after a couple of runs you get added icing on the cake of smoother dancing movements. The only complaint is that sometimes she is hard to follow and doesn't make it clear when to balance both sides with repetitive moves...but the fun outweighs it all (I even did it with my daughter, age 11)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fun video","review":"Unlike the other reviewers I find that by modifying the intensity of the dance moves in this work out you can get your heart rate up to your target zone. There is a dancer in a white t-shirt directly behind Kathy who really 'moves' and if you follow her arm movements etc...you will break a sweat. I enjoy doing this video and find it inspires my 14 year old daughter to get off the couch and cha cha with me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Easy","review":"This is a great tape for those times when you want to work out, but don't want to FEEL like you're working out. It's fun, goes by quickly, and the steps are fairly easy to learn. Do this tape in the mornings, and it will give an energy lift that will last you through lunch. However, if like me on most days you want to push yourself harder, this tape works best as a compliment to a more challenging, traditional cardio workout. And another thing- wear comfortable shoes that have flexibility in the toe area or your feet will be yelling at you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful DVD!!","review":"This was the worst thing by Kathy Smith I have seen!! Of course I haven't yet seen the Bellydancing one. The warm-up starts out okay. Then you get to the \\"work out\\". First the people are not wearing workout clothes, but it looks like their out at a club. Second, their all wearing black pants/dark shoes in a dimly lit room. I CANNOT SEE THEIR FEET! How am I supposed to learn the steps if I can't make out what they are doing with their feet?? This was one the poorest attempts at dance instruction that I have seen to date. I had a very good opinion of Kathy Smith prior to seeing this video. I am really glad I did not pay more than $5 shipped for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"Sorry Kathy, this one didn't work for me. I've been a fan of Kathy's for many year's and have many of her video's, but this one disappointed me. The steps were poorly described, and the other dancer's often demonstrated more advanced moves to the dances which made it difficult to keep my attention. Overall, I don't recommend this one unless you want an 'ok' cardio work-out with basic moves to latin rhythms that are hard to follow.Patti"},{"rating":"2","title":"Her back should face us","review":"This tape seems to be designed for people with an extra pair of eyes in their back. If Kathy Smith wants us to start with the same foot as hers, she should have her back facing us. The only way I can follow is to have my back facing the TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHEW!","review":"I was getting bored with the same exercise videos, so it was time for a change. This DVD was very fun and exciting. It's so easy to follow, my seven year old can do it with me!I didn't realize how hard I was working out, until I noticed I was sweating! This video is GREAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun change for your workout routine","review":"This is a great video to add a little spice to your workout routine and get out of a rut.First off, do not buy this video if what you are looking for is to learn Latin dancing. This is not a dance instruction video but a fun exercise routine made out of three basic Latin dance moves.I also would not recommend this for someone looking for a lower impact workout due to bad knees as the dance moves in this involve a lot of knee bending, squats and leg twisting.So if your knees are doing fine and you're just looking to change up your exercise routine I recommend this video. It was a lot of fun, though today was the first time I tried to do it so I haven't quite got all the steps yet, I can't wait to have the steps down and really have some fun with it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a deviation from the norm...","review":"Yes, Kathy Smith has really motivated me in the past, and I give her a lot of credit for her capacity to catch so many fitness trends and make them accessible to those of us who can't get to glitzy gyms.However, this tape really disappointed me. I felt like the workout was really limited to my lower legs, no matter how hard I tried to incorporate the rest of my body, the only part of me that felt worked was my calves. I need a more whole body approach, so I will turn back to Kathy's other workouts. This one is dusty on my shelf..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Fitness","review":"The live music, enthusiastic dancers, and Kathy Smith's motivating professionalism are a plus. Though I've found the more I do it the more likely I am to hit my aerobic zone, I think it's also important to get the word out that there's more to working out than just working up a sweat: I pop this tape in when I need to shake off the work day, get in tune with my body, and remember indoor exercise doesn't have to be drudgery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kathy Smith's Latin Workout","review":"This workout is perfect for those days when I really don't feel like huffing and puffing through a workout. Days when I know I SHOULD do some kind of exercise, but can't motivate myself for something more exerting. It's a really fun video to do, you don't burn near as many calories, as say a Cathe Friedrich video, but at least it motivates you to move (and isn't that the whole point?)! Steps are really easy to learn, and finally I learned something in a \\"dance\\" fitness video that I can take to a dance floor. It's one that I probably won't do every day, being an intermediate exerciser, but certainly one I'd do at least once a week, on those days when I'm in a slump. I'd recommend it just for that reason, cause we ALL have those days. I never turn down the opportunity to do this video! Very fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"I barely broke a sweat","review":"The Latin band and dancers were great fun, but I would recommend the video only to people who are brand new to working out and to dancing. I've got some experience and felt like I wasn't working at all. I went through the tape once and will give it away.Probably in an attempt to make the dance steps as easy as possible, Kathy Smith focuses for too long on each one. Each segment of the video uses just one step, which you do over and over with only minor variations. There's very little upper body involvement, so it's hard to increase the intensity unless you get pretty far from the basic choreography.If you're looking for a more involving Latin aerobics tape, I highly recommend Viva! Aerobics by Elise Foss. She uses many of the same basic steps but combines them in much more interesting ways, plus she involves the upper body and makes it easy to add intensity. She's also fun and engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scam!","review":"If you want to a) Have a good workout or b) Learn Latino dancing, please go elsewhere. 'Coz this video helps neither. The latino dancing steps are covered in 2-3 minutes and then you're off on your own to figure out how to synchronize yourself with the video. And the workout aspect of it is just a sham. If you already are a fluent latino dancer, you might get a kick out of this, 'coz the workout might warm you up just a little bit.I am looking for other videos for structured Latino dancing lessons and separate viedos for working out. It should be well worth the money since I love both dancing and working out....separately!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"I just played this video for the first time as a novice to latin dancing and I found it incredibly hard to follow. She doesn't take the time to really teach you the steps and there are too many tight shots of the dancers where you can't even see their feet!! This is - by far - the worst work-out video I've ever used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a better learn the moves section","review":"The camera person tried to be fancy and shoot lots of angles, some of which don't show the feet! During the no-feet sections I just stand and lose momentum. The dance steps are precise-- I'm not a natural dancer and I ended up shuffling around flat footed. I wished there was a section where I could do the moves slowly and gain the muscle memory necessary to execute the moves quickly. The moves involve a lot of stepping backwards and forwards with your knees turned in, be careful not to strain your knees."},{"rating":"1","title":"knee pain","review":"Two things that I haven't seen mentioned here. Dancing requires a hard floor. It is hard to follow this tape with turns and pivots on carpet. Forget about sneakers. Smooth soles only. Second, the tape is definitely not low impact. One dance requires you to pretend that one leg is shorter. If you follow this tape a couple of times a week and experience knee pain it could inflame them. The other dance steps are equally hard on knees.I also found the retape portions distracting, where Kathy shows up mid sequence in different surroundings (blue floor) and then suddenly switches back to the big group in the dance studio. (wood floor). This could be part of the cueing problem that eveyone refers to. After a while it looks like they are doing the same step for every dance sort of a modified chacha. If you want to jump around to latin music, its a winner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No, not as cool as I thought it would be....","review":"I didn't really like this video. If you are somewhat athletic, this video would not even make you sweat much. It is some kind of BAD cardio workout, that doesn't target any specific muscles. Kathy is horrible with her instructions and changes them the last second. Had a feel that she is making them up as she goes. Plus, you won't be able to see their legs properly since all are wearing black pants when background is already dark. In other words, not worth spending money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome...........................","review":"Kathy Smiths video's are usaully very difficult to follow.

This video is fun and you work up a sweat. I love it. I've done it 4 times, and I still don't have every single move down pat. I do it on my carpeted living room floor with aerobic shoes on and have never had a problem with falling or twisting my ankle. If you like salsa, or want to learn, this tape is perfect. It really does work up a sweat too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"If you are thinking of b) Getting a good workout or a) Learning to latino-dance, pl. look elsewhere. This video will help neither 'coz the dance steps and cueing is pathetic. I am a good dancer otherwise, but wanted to pick up on latino steps. This video has just put me in dis-array as for learning a new dance. I would buy videos dedicated to lessons and workouts separately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"I think that this workout was pretty good. Because it didn't FEEL like working out, I didn't think I was doing anything. However, after I found myself out of breath and sweaty, I discovered it is a pretty good workout. It was just that it wasn't boring, which made it different than other videos.My only complaint about this video is that the music was somewhat stale and Kathy yelled too loud. There was only one good song in the dance workout sequence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Near-Complete Failure to Exploit Unbelievable Potential","review":"This film, with its superlative cast and the terrific book upon which it is based, miserably failed to deliver the depth, richness and impact of that fine book. The actors were just perfect -- Roscoe Rules and Harold Bloomguard, in particular, were portrayed stupendously -- and some of the vignettes came across properly, but in total this movie ended up being a real shame. I read that Joseph Wambaugh wanted to have himself completely dis-associated from the film (which is one reason that the next movie made from a Wambaugh book, The Onion Field, more closely adheres to its source).Read the book, watch this film once (mainly to see how well the actors just NAILED their roles!) and then hope for a remake or, perhaps, a re-edit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Disgraceful!","review":"The book was a work of art.

Low expectations are richly rewarded here.If you read Wambaugh's book, you will loathe the movie because it betrays your hopes and expectations so badly. No wonder Wambaugh wanted to have his name removed from the credits. The movie tears all the flesh away from his excellent book and keeps just a few bones.If you have not read the book, but \\"kinda\\" liked the movie, read the book. You are in for a huge treat.

I decided not to waste my senior years on a book and then not sell it.It's more fun and productive to try and produce short stories, articles and poems that magazines are willing to publish. The same thing can be done with or without the software; it just takes will power and structure, with persistence. The screen on the software I did not like. It was small and the words would cut off at the end, in other words the screen is too small. Yet I've read where some writers love it. So when I decide to sell it, I will, for half price.

Cutler's impassioned folk-inflected voice, enthralling guitar, and sense of syncopated rhythms allow her to widely explore the personal terrain of these songs, which were written in the aftermath of personal tragedy and a period of seclusion. The result is a stirring, often provocative look at human spirit in the face of emotional challenge. Cutler exercises daring lyrical perspective that manages to shed some universal light -- \\"Dirty Truth\\" quietly advocates for full honesty in relationships over the \\"mercy lie,\\" and \\"Sorry\\" illustrates how inadequate our quick-fix apologies are. From the Sting-like dramatic presence of \\"Stolen Fire\\" to the melodically touching \\"Love and Let Go\\" and the ultimately embracing \\"Sweet Spot,\\" Tower of Silence weaves many sonic environments while challenging the listener to look openly and inward."},{"rating":"1","title":"BBQ...I don't think so!","review":"Taste is ok but it does not BBQ well, it dries up and flakes off making the food look disgusting.Maybe ok as a dip but i havent tried that yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"This product was only okay.

The story makes you wonder where is my \\"Boaz Brown\\". This story dealt with a lot of issues involved race, peer and family pressures. LaShondra meets the Mr. Right. The only problem is that he is white. Once she gets pass the color and her prejudices , she realizes that he is what she is God has sent her."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANNOYED BY LASHONDRA","review":"I don't know about everyone else but I'm getting tired of the black \\"sista\\" routine. It gets old fast. All minorities have experienced racism, but Lashondra takes it to another level. Not all black women are soulful, eye rolling, hand on the hip preaching to anyone who will listen or care. I couldn't stand her character and I don't understand why anyone like Stelson would want to be with someone who has a chip the size of the universe on her shoulder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boaz Brown","review":"I found this book to very boring and repetitive with the reference to religion, racism, and irrelevant flashbacks that the story got lost. In fact, the book's jacket is very misleading. I thought it was suppose to be a love story when it really has nothing to do with the romance between LaShondra and Stelson, but basically about LaShondra problems with her own her religious belief and racism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different...","review":"Boaz Brown wasn't quite what I expected it to be, but it was a pleasant read in spite of that. The story crossed racial lines and addressed some really important biases that we sometimes have, but don't know, or at least won't admit to. Love can be found in the places we least expect and when we limit our horizons with racial prejudices, we can sometimes miss out on the blessing God has prepared for us. Michelle Stimpson did a very applaudable job crafting this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"phenomenal","review":"I can't believe this was the author's debut novel. She is truly gifted because she wove multiple themes together without being over-bearing. Loved Stelson and LaShondra and I know for myself that these kind of courtships DO still exist.I also liked the biblical references. As Christians, we can forget that living right includes loving people of other races."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful love story","review":"This was a really touching book,especially for someone like me who is a sucker for romance. It wasnt exactly a page turner, but the story moved along at a pretty good pace. Right when i got into the ending i broke up with my boyfriend, so it was pretty hard to read about all the love going around, but it did sort of help me get through it. The story gave me hope that there might be that kind of love out there for me.Great christian theme, without being too preachy. Lashondra was a great example of \\"if you take care of Gods business first, he will take care of your business\\".Mrs Stimpson did a good job of weaving a couple christian messages in here without actually pushing them down our throats.Job well done!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"I am not one to write reviews, but I have to thank the author for taking the time to teach a message to believers, Christs love. I shed a few tears twice while reading this book. It isnt just the love story between Lashondra and her Boaz, but the true understanding of Gods love and will for his people. I love the fact that Lashondra truly meditated on the Word, it through her conversations with the Lord. After reading this novel, I catch my self saying I want my own Boaz, but like the main character, its all about trusting and waiting on the Lord. I really enjoyed this book, I only wish more romance novels included characters with a spiritual life, it allows readers like me to really relate to the story. I truly enjoyed this book, I'm only sad that the book ended before reaching the wedding ceremony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book with twists","review":"I read this book years ago, yet I still remember many of its details. That's how great this book was. It just goes to show the reader, no mater what level your career/social/economic status is, God will give you just what you need. It may not be what is expected, but it will be great and you will be extremely happy. The young lady had no idea what tremendous blessing God had in store for her. Her Boaz was not what she expected, but was exactly what she needed. Enjoy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Novel In a Long Time","review":"I absolutely adored this book. I was so glad to finally read a good romance story that was truly Christ-centered. I hadn't read a romance novel in ages I picked this book up abroad because I'd finished reading this other one about Revelations and wanted something a bit different \\"easy reading\\" I took this book up and well lets just say I learned allot. It was Christ centered and just romantic I'd recomend it and am looking forward to reading her next one.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sequel please!!","review":"This had to be one of the best love stories I have ever read! Once I finished the book I quickly wrote Michelle Stimpson a letter of thanks, because as a Black Christian female I hear too many of us say \\"I would never date a White man or any other race besides Black\\". I think that way of thinking is antiquated and unwise particularly if you are a Christian. God can send a man who is of another ethnicity to bless your life , but if you choose to box yourself in with this \\"I only date my own kind\\" type of attitude you could miss out on a big blessing. I am waiting on my Stelson whatever color he turns out to be. And I won't settle for nothing less!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love In All Colors","review":"LaShondra seemingly has it all - a wonderful career, a strong family and a confidence in herself, yet she has been on a roller coaster ride in the love arena. When she commits her life over to Christ, she confesses that she is looking for her Boaz - a man to love her and treat her like a queen. When Boaz himself comes knocking on her door, LaShondra has to conduct a deep self-examination because she never thought her Boaz would be of another race.BOAZ BROWN confronts racial prejudice in the face and subtly provides its readers with a Christian message of love and acceptance. It examines familial values and provides an account of how deep seeded our believes really are. Kudos to Ms. Stimpson on her debut novel. I look forward to her future works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treasure","review":"Saw Jeff at a small church in N.E. Pennsylvania. He put on a great show so I decided to buy one of his CD's.

Reebok used to be made so well. To replace my old pair, I've now gone through 10 different Reeboks (expecting at least one would be like the old shoes I used to buy and love). Each pair is so cheaply made that they are not wearable. My biggest complaint is how the tongue is fastened. Instead of the smooth transition, the latest model shoes, including this one, all have a big seam and overlapping material that rubs on the top of the foot. I used to wear a size 7 and have recently upgraded to 7.5. This pair of 7.5 is way too small to fit on my foot. And to think I am still wearing my old pair of 7's that I am trying to replace.

OUTDOOR LIFE, however, remains fresh and interesting. Its approach is general, but it has some of the best names in the field writing for it.It's a great place to start if you're interested in conservation or almost any other outdoor activity.

All the residents believe Chuck is an alien who wants to eat their brains and turn them into zombies. Lem befriends Chuck and finds out that he's a good guy. The military take over Chuck's ship so they can dissect it. If Chuck doesn't get back to his ship in time, he will never be able to return to Earth.

I thought they could've done a lot more with the human/alien role reversal. I caught a few of the throwbacks such as Star Wars and E.T., but it wasn't enough to carry the movie.Kind of slow, and (maybe it's just me) there seemed to be awkward pauses during some of the dialogue, like they should have taken out a second or half second of silence between lines in the conversations.I thought the general was waaaaay too one-dimensional. He had no thought process, and was practically a zombie prior to the astronaut's arrival.It's one-and-done for me; saw it, and probably won't ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely rent first.","review":"My son's grandmother took him to see it in the theater. He fell asleep, she said he liked it though.He got excited when I told him I'd buy it the day it came out. It's been out for 3-4 weeks and he still hasn't watched it. Had his friends over who hadn't seen it, they wanted it on. He wouldn't sit and watch it with them. They seemed disinterested after awhile too and would join him on the floor away from the tv to play with toys too.My son is 4 and his friends go are from 6-9. I'd give it a one star, but I haven't seen more than the first 15-20 minutes. What I saw wasn't objectionable, but I could see why it didn't hold their attention.I also never saw more than the first 15-20 minutes of G-Force, I would put these two movies in same category."},{"rating":"1","title":"A space of time I will never get back","review":"After seeing previews for this movie i had high hopes.

There was also a few dirty scenes that just should not have been in a kids movie. All in all a major let down.

The animation is very good indeed...pity it's wasted here. This is one of the dumbest films I've ever seen, and that is saying something regarding animation. Usually there has to be a degree of dumb.

I thought this was an unacceptable rate for a watch of this price. Digital readouts can be impossible to read since, at times, they are partly covered by the minute hand. Countdown was worthless! It ONLY counts down to a specific date - you can't set for example, a 5 minute countdown. You can only set it to alert to midnight of a specified date. Due to the metal wristband it is somewhat heavy (if that's a concern - it didn't bother me).

His natural, effortless, singing ability jumps up through out the film.The story is about a young boy being raised by his grandmother in the early 1900's. His dreams of owning a champion race horse change when a black lamb is born and is not accepted by its mother. Jeremiah soon falls in love with the lamb and dreams of taking him to the state fair.

The clips are interspersed with entertaining commentary from a narrator who was prominent about 40 years ago as a host of B horror movies on TV, Zacherley. Surprisingly, his little snippets are a welcome addition to the programming, although I am not sure I can say why, since his narration is in the form of sidebars of nonsense during what would have been commercial breaks on TV. Anyway, the video is thematically arranged by star and sub-genres, such as zombies for sub-genres and Bela Legosi for an example of a star. The best stuff does come in the first half hour, but the entire video is certainly worth watching. With the exception of one short scene, I can also recommend it for fun family viewing.

The peppermint is not a strong as you would imagine it would be. At first I was squeezing the powder out of the bottle on to my toothbrush and I was wasting powder everyday. Then I transferred the powder into a small container and dipped my toothbrush into it (I was the only one using it). I did see some whitening of my teeth once I started using it consistently but I wanted something with stronger whitening results and more of a minty taste. So I am still looking for a good natural toothpaste. I would use this again though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes Horrible!","review":"I usually use tooth clay, but ran out, so thought I would try this. I can't handle the taste. I thought someone put soap on my toothbrush. So I tried a dot on my finger and realized it was the tooth powder. The little I used seemed to clean the tooth pretty well. Will not use again. Hey I can use on my kids though.... threaten to brush their teeth with Ipsab tooth powder :)Another reviewer stated it isn't sea salt used. They don't say on their site. If it isn't... then another reason not to use it. You are missing a lot of the beneficials qualities if it is table salt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item for the price.","review":"I am really glad I purchased this. I wasn't sure exactly what to expect since I had never used one of these but I love it. It is smaller than I thought it would be which is nice for space in my bag. It also came with several different adapters and instructions (which I really appreciated)."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's the fuss about?

But this little Seagull is clear, solid, swivels, easy to attach (to my Canon 40D), and I can focus with it even with my (vintage) eyes... Which, coupled with my (classic) body, makes getting down for those low-angle shots a real challenge. Great deal; can't imagine what paying more would get me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable quality of optics.","review":"I purchased this Seagull Right Angle Finder for my 60D based on the reviews, but when I received it, I could not be more disappointed.I just could not see clearly through the viewfinder.

Possibly original Canon, as I do photography for living."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seagull Right Angle Findeer","review":"I bought this to use on my Canon XTi to take pictures through my telescopes. It has served that purpose well. It is easy to install and the built in magnification is a big plus in focusing on stars. Construction is very good and the fact that the eyepiece can be rotated is a big plus. Anyone taking pictures through a retractor telescope needs this accessory. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Canon, but are 90% there","review":"For the price, I think these are great, specially when compared to Canon brand. The plastic slips look a little flimsy: they hold on tight, but it does not look like they will last. I believe other posted reviews can attest to this. That said, I still think this is a worth while product. It will induce you to more creative framing, and is a great tool if you need to do on-the-ground photography such as with flowers, macro, etc. I don't find the magnification to be useful, but zoome out the image is crisp and I think the overall construction is not bad. It has some weight to it and while it might not be prime optics, it does the job, at just a fraction of the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits Nikon D3100","review":"I took the chance on this fitting the Nikon D3100. My gamble payed off as it does fit and works well. I am able to use it for my astrophotography. I just wish that there was an eyepiece that would fit on the adapter so I could quickly take it off and put a regular eyepiece on. The adapter is tight on the camera, but the right angle is loose on the adapter. All in all, it beats paying for the Nikon version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I found Ocusoft Lid Scrub Foam","review":"Approximately 8 years ago Blephritis developed in both eyes.

So I've stopped using it and will not buy this particular brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Shipping & Customer Service","review":"Long story short I got my item a month after my order because they shipped me someone else's order. After emailing with the company rep, he didn't keep me in the loop as to when I would get the item I ordered. Very frustrating experience. You'd expect more from a medical supply company. The item I ordered was for my health and the company rep had no urgency for the mix up. I'll never order from here again.

You really have to rinse it off quickly after use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Making your eyelid scrub better","review":"Like most people using this product, I have blepharitis. I've tried several different products from foaming cleansers to eye scrub pads. Occusoft eyelid cleanser works very well and is economical in the 215 mL size. Sterilid eyelid cleanser works excellent because of the melaleuca (tea tree) oil it contains but is very expensive. The melaleuca oil is a natural antiseptic and solvent. It is also the distinctive odor of the SteriLid product.I find I can have the best of both worlds by blending the two products. I mix 9 parts of OCuSOFT foaming eyelid cleanser with 1 part SteriLid eyelid cleanser in a used bottle of one of the products. (Note: the lids of each type of bottle unscrew.) This works great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ed","review":"I have used this product for about 1 month (for Blephoritis) and am not sure if it is helping. I was following my Ophthalmologists instructions of baby shampoo for about 8 months but it left my eyes dry and itchy. Then I tried a bottle of SteriLid foaming cleanser until it ran out (1 month). The SteriLid seemed to make my eyes feel better but it was very expensive so I decided to try Ocusoft. Ocusoft is a similar foaming cleanser but comes in a larger bottle that would last 6-8 months or more. However, at this time, I don't think it may be effective for Blephoritis. Today, I used Ocusoft Plus lid scrub pads and my eyes seem to feel better. Unfortunately, the Ocusoft Plus pads are very expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"occusoft foam","review":"Great product .

They really do work and have more threads than you expect in the lid so little ones wont unscrew the lids unexpectedly.

It can serve as a good introduction to spiritual dimensions as well, particularly for those who might not be open yet to the broader dimensions of psychic animal and spirit communications."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Animals Can Teach Us About Spirituality","review":"What struck me about this book is how Guerrero combines her passion and expertise as an animal trainer and healer with a spiritual philosophy that opens a door and welcomes us into a world of magic, myth, and personal discovery. If you've ever experienced that special connection with the animal kingdom, then I think this book is a must-read. And, if you haven't, then this book is especially for you. I know that I am making sure every animal lover I know gets a copy of What Animals Can Teach Us About Spirituality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over, Cesar!","review":"The author's empathy and sincerity become immediately apparent in this must-read book for animal lovers.

When the father's pay is reduced, the parents tell Lilly that she cannot go back to school and will be sent to the home of a couple known by them to become a general maid.

It sounded like an intriguing story - a lonely, insecure 14-year old is beaten to death by a group of schoolmates - and I am always on the lookout for good new true crime. Unfortunately, interesting as the story is, the author is incapable of doing it justice. Her prose is flowery and overblown, more fitting for a bodice ripper than a true crime case, and the narrative is redundant and disjointed.

The first few chapters were great. After that, the trouble began. In the first few chapters, there were small elements of fantasy that caught the reader off-guard. However, after that, Beatty went totally overboard with the fantasy element of the story. It turned from a charming story about a young black man's struggles while growing up into a combination Tom Robbins novel-sermon about what is wrong with society.

So, when I saw that Paul Beatty is a poet, I was a little wary. But I very quickly realized that his poetry is what makes this novel move. Besides the array of interesting characters and odd situations this book offers, for me, it was Beatty's be-bop writing style that I was swept up in. His prose just bounces off the page at you, creating action just in the words alone.I loved this book, I couldn't put it down and I immediately had to get \\"Tuff\\" after finishing \\"White Boy\\" (which I liked, but didn't love). I say balls to the \\"politically correct\\" that call this book racist. Here is a voice that's not heard in modern fiction and in many ways hearkens back to 50's and 60's literature (read Chester Himes, Ralph Ellison, the beats).

I did this one for 6 week everyday and lost 28 pounds with diet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I ended up sending this one back because I ordered the wrong tape. I know that all of Kathy Smiths tapes are great for your health, but because of my health I could not keep up with this one. I know that it is wonderful for someone that is,"},{"rating":"1","title":"too many people in the video","review":"I love Kathy Smith, but I have to say, this video stinks. The work out is so-so. I had a hard time following because the camera moves around alot and the people in the video kept moving around all over the place. Also, there was a lot of talking and yelling in the video. I prefer that there were few people and less chatter. I usually can keep up with the exercise, but I felt that there were too many distractions to get a good work out. I rated this video 1 star. I will stick with Kathy Smith Step exercise video. I definately feel that I am getting a better work out."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad...","review":"I try not to judge my vids the first time I do them because the bulk of my fitness dvd collection (which is very large) are comprised of ones that took some getting used to, but that I ended up loving. This was not one of them - I have given this one 5 chances, and I still dislike it VERY much. The set is SO cheesy, and so is Kathy. Unfortunately, this is my first Kathy video - I have heard she has some good ones, but I am completely turned off by her and will not purchase another. The timing was off, and even after I mastered the steps, they did not feel effective. Sorry Kathy, I am looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I own many Kathy Smith videos and this one is far by the worst. This workout includes two 20 minute workouts, a 10 minute stretch, and a very short section on snacking (DVD bonus). The first aerobic workout is progressive in intensity, the other has short cardio bursts to increase the heart rate. The moves are quite complicated and often clumsy, the music isn't very good either. Generally disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"workout","review":"i like adding this workout and mixing it up among my other workouts just to have something different in the mix"},{"rating":"1","title":"timing is off","review":"Although I did break into a sweat, I didn't enjoy this dvd. The movements did not match the timing of the music. Very frustrating. The moves are a little tricky for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"I really like Kathy Smith, even though she is always letting out cheesy hoots and squeals. (It gives me something to make fun of when I workout.) I like this DVD because I can do either or both sections and still get a good workout. On days when I only do one, I still have time to follow up with a Lotte Berk Method DVD for toning. I didn't have a problem following the steps and there aren't many moves that \\"form\\" needs to be demonstrated on.The second workout is good, but its hard to follow the modifiers. They don't show many clear shots of them. Going off of what Kathy says and the weird camera angles, don't expect to get the modifications perfectly the first time through. I had to stop and watch and then join back in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"I recently bought this DVD as well as Kathy Smith's lift weights to lose weight, and I have to say both are huge disapointments! I am relatively fit and used to exercising but these DVDs do nothing for me - in fact if you could rate them in the negatives I would! The choreography is messy, there are so many people jumping around it is hard to see what you are meant to be doing at any given time. The camera jumps from shot to shot so quickly that a lot of guess work has to be done in order to keep moving! I have had a lot of success with other DVDs like Leslie Sansones Walk away the pounds, and I would have to say that even though they may be monotonous after a while, they are certainly better choreographed and filmed, and all in all a lot more effective which is what counts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely below average","review":"I think my main mistake was to try out this video for the very first time at 6 a.m. I should have waited until I was more alert. By yawning for a second too long I think I missed half the routine. I mastered about half the moves by the 3rd or 4th time using this tape, so one can expect the steps to be quite challenging for newbies. Kathy runs through each move *very* quickly (mercy if you must pause for a sip of water), so pay very close attention. I honestly think I'd have better things to say about this program if I could just get past all the annoying whoops and you-GO-girl yelps from her MC Hammer-like entourage. They need to go away (or shut up). Bottom line: If you have a knack for picking up fast-paced moves, this tape will give you a pretty decent workout -- it's hi-enegery and will make you sweat. Otherwise, stick with something more intermediate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tae Bo meets a night at the dance club","review":"I was disappointed with this video especially since I thought I had two reputable recommendations, Parents magazine and Shape magazine. This tape is rated for beginners to intermediate. I beg to differ. I've participated in my fair share of aerobics classes and I had a difficult time following the moves. Therefore, I wasn't able to get a good work-out. You wonder what you're accomplishing. A night at the dance club would do as much. In addition, the tape is noisy. Similar to a Tae Bo tape. For all you moms out there trying to get in a quick work-out, this is not the tape for if you've had enough noise for the day. This one is going back on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really a Timesaver","review":"This workout is really great for those days that you can not get up in the morning. You can still catch those 20 minutes of workout. Kathy is both enegetic and keeps you going. I don't recommend this video for everyday because I don't feel that I get enough of a calorie burn, but 20 minutes of workout is better than no workout at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun heart pumper","review":"This is my first Kathy Smith video and I must say its something i've been able to stay with consistently. Kathy makes it easy to follow her moves. Other cardio tapes Ive tried use complicated moves that are not explained adequately--making me lose interest. This tape is easy to follow--I think of it as my \\"meat and potatoes\\" work out because it's a straight forward video that gets your heart rate up--quite similar to an actual aerobics class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I own almost every Kathy Smith video from 1990 on. I have found all of her videos excellent in content and easy to follow. This video is not consistent with all of the others. I was very disappointed with this video. I found the sequences on this video VERY difficult to follow to the point where I got frustrated. I won't even watch it anymore. Now I am a little leary about purchasing her videos because I am concerned that the content may be too difficult to follow. (I read this about some of the reviews on the new Fat Burning Breakthrough video). I am not the most coordinated person but she always was very instructive in her past videos, this one reminds me of a Reebok or Corey Everson video.As a Kathy Smith video fan (and supporter) I hope she doesn't continue to follow this pattern because I won't buy anymore of her videos unless I can view them first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware! - Buy only if you have 4 legs ******","review":"I bought this together with the latin rhythm workout. Only to have it droned every time I put the DVD on that my hand eye coordination must be that of an 80 yr old (I'm only 28!). The moves are way too complicated and i feel so frustrated trying to keep up that i've not managed to get an effective workout from this even once! I have learnt my lesson - PAY ATTENTION to the negative reviews they're TRUE!P.S. I haven't been able to pay ppl to take either DVD off my hand!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kathy Smith Timesaver","review":"She put together a nice video. I use it with another DVD. I use one of her 20 minutes aerobic segments, with another DVD's toning exercises. Then I go back to Kathy's stretching segment. The moves she uses for the aerobic part are very effective at getting your heartrate up. The moves are relatively easy. There were even a few new moves that I had to learn. She does not include any weight exercises. There is also a cardio fat burner where you are shown how to do high impact or choose the lower impact, if you so choose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not hard at all","review":"I'm not sure why so many people think the routines on this tape are too hard. They're not! And I'm not the most coordinated person on earth. Just do them a few times, and you'll quickly get the hang of it. The moves are well-choreographed and fun and you'll really get a good workout. The only complaint I have with Kathy is that she has a habit of saying \\"last time!\\" and then proceeding to do the routine again. It confuses her crew, since you can see a couple of them actually stop as Kathy keeps going. Other than that, this tape is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much rush for a workout","review":"I have another Kathy Smith DVD so I am familiar with her steps but this workout was just way too rushed. It was not a smooth, rhythmic workout at all. The combination moves are not introduced well - by the time they were on the 4th move of a combination, I was still trying to get the 1st and 2nd one down. I agree with the other reviews that this DVD is not a good idea if you are working out on a carpeted surface. I would rather slow it down a bit even if it means working out for 10 more minutes so that I could actually participate fully in the routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"This is a great workout! If you can do both 20 min. workouts it's best but if your short on time then just do one. I personally like the second workout better but the first one is good as well. She has a lot of energy and makes the workout fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A TERRIFIC FAT BURNER -- IN ONLY 20 MINUTES!!!!!!","review":"I love the high energy and the party atmosphere. The 20 minutes goes so quickly and I feel like I'm getting a real workout. Kathy is a bit louder than usual, but it felt like she was having a class right in my living room! Thanks for another great workout Kathy. I highly recommend this video to anyone who wants to burn fat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kathy Smith Timesaver workout","review":"This is a must have for any high intensity fan. It is fun and keeps your heart rate up for the full 20 or 40 minutes. Completely satisfying and energizing. I combine this video with the Timesaver weight workout for an even better workout. I highly recommend.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginners should give this some time...","review":"I agree with a prior post that this tape does not seem like a beginner's workout, especially when compared to something like Kathy Smith's \\"March to Fitness.\\" However, I've had the tape for about a month, and now I can easily do either of the 20 minute routines, although I haven't worked my way up to the full 40 minutes (YET!) Since buying this tape, I've become pretty addicted to the Firm series tapes, but I still like this one for a quick, intense aerobic workout. It's especially great on days that my toddler chooses not to nap and time is limited! Also, this tape has a nice \\"bonus stretch\\" at the end, which I often use after other workouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR THE BEGINNER!!!!","review":"I bought the tape a week ago, and am totally turned off by the pace and difficulty of the moves. I love her step tapes.. and thought she would have done a better job in this aerobic tape. The other instructors are annoying, and Kathy has WAY too much energy.. she's almost \\"fake.\\" The tape is a total waste of money for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"This was really bad. The dancing was cheesy and Kathy was cheesy. The moves don't seem to match the beat of the music and I really didn't feel like I got a good cardio workout. You have to focus so much of your energy on doing the crazy moves that you can't focus on your workout. It really wasn't worth the money. I would reccomend some of the Self videos. They are easier to follow and I feel like I get a better workout with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give no stars","review":"I have several Kathy Smith videos this is the absolute worse! I agree with some of the other reviewers that Kathy has not rhythm and in this video the steps do not match the beat of the music which makes it frustrating and makes her look very uncoordinated. Also, it seems like there a too many people in such a small space, the whole set looks very chaotic. I wonder if Kathy thought up the choreography for this one herself, it is very poor. All those crazy shuffle moves! Any other Kathy Smith workout will be better for you than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"the poorest production quality","review":"Kathy Smith had made some winners, but this one is sad. I cannot believe she let this out - sloppiest work-out video I've seen in a long time! The qeues are not timed rythmically to the music, which is SO frustrating. I watched (and moved) to approximately 30 minutes of this workout before I finally shut it off and threw it in the trash. Don't buy this one -"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fancy but useless footwork","review":"This fitness routine is not easy to follow, despite what other reviews say. As a former gymnast and dancer, I have plenty of experience with complicated choreography. This video is much too complicated for the average user and the moves are not aerobically challenging even if one does figure out the footwork. Kathy Smith is constantly yelling and \\"woohoo-ing\\" at the camera, which gets irritating really quickly. All in all, I would not recommend this video. Kathy has some other good videos but this one does not even come close to the standards of those other videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as happy with this one","review":"I love Kathy Smith's videos. I have several which I do as often as time allows. I've had this one for a number of years, but since I favor her step tapes I hadn't really given this one a try. Until recently that is and I was disappointed with it. She goes right into the work out and doesn't do a warm up, which is unusual for her. It made a difference for me. I stopped doing the tape and haven't done it since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like the backup crew","review":"When I first popped this tape in, I didn't like it at all. I have other Kathy Smith tapes, and she usually does an excellent job of paying attention to the body to help prevent injuries. Not with this one. You have to warm up on your own first, and once you do get started the moves are awkward enough you can easily twist an ankle or knee. Although I think I might eventually get used to the moves, I'm not sure I'll ever get used to the overcrowded crew constantly \\"whoo-ing\\" in the background. Some call that motivating, I call it distracting and annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game overall, but missing some UMPH!!","review":"I enjoy playing this game, but it's missing something (constructed well, though it could use a holder for all the different 'carrot' cards during play - like what Monopoly has for its $$)My little kids LOVE it, even though they are too small to really get the strategy of it (4 & 6) -- My wife thinks it's boring and won't even play it.I'm sure the game would be more fun with more serious Adult gamers.

The GoGo brand was specifically recommended by a very experienced breeder on her website. When I received it, I was immediately impressed with its quality, design, and heavy gauge wire. The removable poly floor is well made and softer (quieter) than others. The door latch design is very strong and secure but a little awkward to manipulate. The crate arrived quickly. I will definitely buy another GoGo brand crate if our Goldendoodle grows out of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"VDO C Series D Wireless Cadence Kit - I hope it keeps working!","review":"I installed the VDO C Series D Wireless cadence kit on my recumbent bike about two months ago. As very few accessories are designed with recumbents in mind, the installation was challenging. However, I was able to install the magnet and sensor so that it worked--until about two weeks ago. I have not had time to figure out how (or even if) I can get it working again--time is precious and it is frustrating when things do not work as they are intended. If I cannot get it working again, I will be extremely disappointed as well as disgruntled that I paid for this inoperative device because cadence monitoring is quite important for my attempting to keep a relatively high spinning cadence on the recumbent bicycle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great band, a must-have for true rockers!!","review":"If you already have just about every rock cd, then you need to add this to the mix!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great price - to bad it's broken","review":"I bought this hoping for a good portable 12v source.
