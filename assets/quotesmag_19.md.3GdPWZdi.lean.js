HOLY COW I AM IN PAIN!! I woke up to nurse my son and could barely sit still while he was nursing. I eventually had to put him down there is so much burning and itching (thankfully he was full at that point and fell asleep). Now I am up and can barely sit still I am so uncomfortable. I wish there was something I could do to make it go away!

I am crying right now, wishing I wouldn't have bought this product. I had no idea so many other women felt the same way. My entire genital area is burning and swollen, and it's been 24 hours. MAJOR redness, MAJOR swelling. I felt itchy when I woke up after inserting the suppository last night, and as the day progressed I only felt worse. Tonight, I had to leave the theatre to a show I really wanted to see this evening because I feel like I am going to die.Pain level 10.PLEASE TAKE THIS PRODUCT OFF THE MARKET.I've had no problem with the generic Monistat 7.

Stupid me thought I'd give it another chance a second night and third night, but the itch did not get any better.

If I had known that the \\"remedy\\" was going to be worse than the infection, I would NOT have chosen this. The only reason I chose Monistat 1 in the first place is because Diflucan is not approved for nursing mothers.

I figured I would get to the OB eventually but would try this in the meantime. I used it last night and holy God almighty. It was like fire ants had crawled inside of my body. I have never experienced such awful burning and pain. I tried to shower and clean it out, then eventually tried to douche to get this terrible stuff out of my body. Getting it out quickly helped but I went to the OB today and he took one look and said, you poor poor thing. My doctor said that he used to work for the FDA and likened this stuff to a chemical burn inside your body. He said it is an entirely different chemical that monistat 7, and that it should not be legal. He used some long cotton swabs to get the rest of it out and gave me a prescription for an oral pill for the yeast infection.

Yes there is a little discomfort after you insert the ovule but it seemed to me like the burning was due to the fact that I had irritated my already burning vagina so of course it's not happy (at first). The feeling of relief that I would soon be yeast infection free over powered the burning sensation and I slept like a baby! Then in the morning the symptoms were gone! There was still a bit of medication leaking out for about two days after but that's a good sign because it means it didn't all leak out in the first night.If you've ever had a true yeast infection you know that getting rid of it is your main goal/all you think about so a little burning shouldn't scare you away"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE: HORRIBLE, UNBEARABLE SIDE EFFECTS","review":"so its 2:51 am and the only reason i am up is because I took Monisat 1 and i cannot sleep due to the horrible burning sensation \\"downstairs\\" I really wish i would have read the reviews before I bought this product.

I have had yeast infections all my life, so I know I didn't self diagnose incorrectly. Too bad I didn't read reviews before being dazzled by a sale expecting relief from the really tame itching/burning sensation compared to my current condition. I will also echo another comment that the five/seven day treatments are definitely recommended choices. I did forget that my doctor also recommended that type of treatment. I won't forget again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It happens, and this product is the best for when it does","review":"Every woman hates it, but this product is easy to use, not messy, and the least invasive in my opinion.

I was seen on thursday and yes I still had the itching and irritation. Not to mention my private area was swollen. The dr told me to NEVER buy the 1 day treatment and prescribed terazole 3 day treatment. I'm on my 2nd day and the swelling has gone day and less iritation.

I put it in before bed, used the cream (to hopefully get better sleep), and within a few minutes I felt the burning and increased itching. I immediately took a shower, hoping to wash it all off. I'm not sure if that's the reason, but I began to feel better and went to sleep. Well, it's just a few hours later into the night, and I woke up to the intense burning and itching again.

I can't say that I have experienced the itching, because...itching was terrible to begin with. However, I am on day 3 and I am still experiencing the burning. Honestly, feels like I am recovering from child birth. The inside of my vagina is red, and feels like I have scratches lining the inside. It also left a weird texture and their is severe pain with penetration. No happy hubby or wife for that matter. Please do not use this, if you are one of the lucky ones, great.

An hour after I used it I was in class attempting to find a position that would put the least pressure on my fiery vagina. It was like someone had lit a bonfire in my pants; I have never experienced burning this bad. The yeast infection was NOTHING compared to this.

It is now 6:40 & I am now overcoming the horrible itching and burning sensation that occured 15 minutes after inserting the ovule. It is still itchy but not as itchy and no longer burning. The itching and burning was worse than the actual yeast infection. I assume that it is because the 1-day has way more meds in it than a 3-day or 7-day.

I figured these people were all just exaggerating and being drama queens. I gave this item almost 3 days before I concluded that it just wasn't doing its job.

At first the bad reviews terrified me but then I saw others that tried it and said the product worked wonders. The \\"burning\\" sensation that the package WARNS about in the first place is only a mild increase of a feeling of heat. Honestly I find it kind of soothing. It doesn't hurt, it's just warmer. Always make sure you have a yeast infection FIRST! If it smells funky, it's probably NOT a yeast infection. Yeast infections don't smell, discharge is chunky white, it itches and there's inflammation and tenderness. I highly recommend this product!!

I have had 3 children and multiple surgeries including a laparoscopy to remove a softball sized cyst on my ovary. I don't ever take the prescribed pain meds.

I've never had an STD before, but I imagine this is the burning feeling they're talking about. I don't know what about, \\"I'm suffering from itching due to a yeast infection,\\" made Monistat think that BURNING would be better. I never expected that the burning would be so horrible. Furthermore, I think I was one of those unfortunate yeast infections that Monistat couldn't cure. So I suffered the burning for nothing- and still had to go to the doctor's office.

I've been on strong antibiotics for 10 days and was not surprised when the itching started. I decided to get Monistat 1 to get it over with- BIG MISTAKE!!! Inserted the ointment at 10:30 pm and went to sleep. I woke up at 3:30 in excruciating, burning pain! Now it's 9 am and I'm still in agony. Had to call in sick. My vagina is literally inside out because it is so swollen! I should have called for Diflucan like I usually do. Praying for relief-soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the pain","review":"So first off, I have to say that this product did get rid of my yeast infection. I woke up yesterday and knew I had a yeast infection so I schlepped over to my local pharmacy and saw Monistat 1, 3, and 7. I noticed that Monistat 1 said you could take it day or night so I figured I'd get a head start on this thing and treat it as soon as I got home. All was well until about and hour after I inserted the ovule. Holy freaking vagina pain! I could barely take care of my 2 year old. I had to park her in front of the TV with DVRed episodes of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse so I could keep running to the bathroom to deal with my burning and itching vajay. After a few hours and after taking Advil and using Cortizone 10 the pain started to subside. Now this morning I don't have any symptoms of having a yeast infection, so I know the Monistat knocked it out. Was it worth the discomfort HECK NO! Next time, just get the 3 day or 7 day treatment. I've never had a problem with those products."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!","review":"Like many other posters, I am writing this review because I wish I had read some others before buying this product. In fact, I inserted the medicine about 6 hours ago and am now experiencing the most excruciating burning and itching of my life! I am extremely uncomfortable and I certainly won't be getting any sleep tonight. I hope that I don't end up like some of the other posters with symptoms that are worse than the original yeast infection and end up having to go to the doctor anyway. I've had success with other Monistat products, so I thought I'd give this one a try as well...but don't do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID AT ALL COSTS","review":"I really have nothing to add that hasn't already been said in the reviews, but I am APPALLED that this product is still on the market. My insides felt like they were on fire. NEVER BUY THIS!! If you're like me and are sitting here reading horrible reviews AFTER using Monistat 1, hang in there. For me, the intense burning lasted about 2-3 hours...which is awful enough, but there is an end in sight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taking Monastat 1 kinda felt like....","review":"I had not only set my entire vagina on fire but decided to sandpaper off all my skin in the nether regions and proceed to wash salt water over it, while having the inside of my uterus ripped out....Do you think this would feel good??? Most crippling pain I have EVER experienced. I spent half an hour crying in pain, motionless on my bathroom floor. Thank god I had leftover Vicodin from a surgery months ago. It took two pills to go from excruciating pain into a hot burning sensation that persisted for the next day. If I did not have prescription pain killers leftover I would have called my friend to drive me to the ER. I put up with pain fairly well...but this was like nothing I had ever experienced. Ladies PLEASE DO NOT use this product. This medication needs a warning sign....unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't use the one day stuff","review":"My doctor told me never to use the one day yeast infection treatments. He said to use five or seven day treatments only. He said that he has seen many poor patients calling him, in terrible discomfort after taking this medicine. It is too harsh and the infection comes back worse than ever. Five day treatment is a happy medium. You will feel better after two days or so and the rest of the medicine will keep it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER the FUDGE again!","review":"MY Word, this was by far the worst thing I ever did to my self. I can not even believe that I put myself through this. I always read reviews. ALWAY. However, twice this week I have messed up and paid for it. After having a allergic reaction to KY her( I guess my kitten doesn't like the menthol), I developed a yeast infection. yes I am sensitive. I have used Monistat 3 and no issues. I have never ever felt so much pain in my life. After about 1 hr after application, I couldn't stay out the bathroom more then 5 minutes. Could barely sit down and had to insert my finger to rid my V of most of the cream. It was horrible. I am embarrassed. I have never written an Amazon review and am quite sad that this had to be my 1st one. NEVER AGAIN...They should take it off the shelf. It is not worth the pain at all!Doesn't deserve 1 star!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GODSEND!","review":"This is my second yeast infection, so at first I bought this 'syringe' thing with this liquid goop that had the consistency of neosporin. Worst thing ever!!! I was literally squeezing it out of my lady flower within 30 minutes of putting it in. Then my awesome mom got me Monistat One Ovule, and after shoving that up there I read the reviews and was horrified! So I sat in my bed, ibuprofen 500m in hand, waiting for the pain to start. I fell asleep waiting. Next morning I wake up feeling a lot better, with some minor leakage with is perfectly fine compared to what was going on down there before.Maybe this product isnt for everyone, but I had a really good experience and I'd be pissed if they took this off the market. :D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Monistat 1","review":"I too am experiencing a burning after using this product.

Before using it I had a mild yeast infection and had taken difluican for 3 days and waited several days after that and still had the infection. But after using this product my vagina is so red and irratied its not even funny. My only relieve right now is a cold soda can against it. I know sounds wild but it is working. Now I can only pray that the burning goes away and the infection. DO NOT USE THIS AT ALL... the infection is so much better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worse experience with medication","review":"Don't buy this and save your 20 bucks you will spend at the local drug store. I was crying and in excruciating pain after seeking relief from the yeast infection. I had to go the emergency room at 11am at night because the itching inside was unbearable. I never have negative reactions to medicines and this was the first time. I was given an alternative at the hospital and felt immediate relief. Save your money. Go to the doctor, get diagnosed to make sure it is a yeast infection or seek another medication.

This book shows you what you score would be around if you took the test. Then you can decide if you want to take the test. The bottom line is: if you want to study for the test then don't get this but if you want to see where you are at the present time then buy it.P.S. The test are also outdated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to take more SATs than you have to?","review":"SAT scores are not that important.

Texas as well as France are in for some parody but it is well done and not really mean spirited at all.The action as Piper works way into taking over Starla's life a la Single White Female (minus the CSI style violence) is a scream. The actress who plays Starla is great as well. The movie is comedy but also manages a unsappy message about self awareness while causing you too laugh your butt off.Melanie Mayron directed. Many of the funniest bits are visual, check Starla's kid brainy kid brother reading Tropic of Cancer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Xenophobic?","review":"This movie is just about some preppy girl from France who gets all the attention and gets envied by the person she butted out...

That crosses the line..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I watched because I like Piper Perabo...","review":"My husband or kids would have never sat through that. It was truly lackluster.

ANYTHING is better than this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable but funny","review":"I didn't have any preconceived notions about this film, and when I read the description, I passed at first. but I'm glad I came back to it. While it is predictable, especially the ending, still there's enough of a story to keep you interested. And it's funny, to boot. So, if you want a nice little mindless comedy to watch, I recommend this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Epitomizes every bad aspect of teen movies.","review":"Though the individual performances by the actors in this movie were were well played, the script was terribly lacking. Everyone expects a teen movie such as this to be comprised entirely of various highschool stereotypes, however in this case, most of them were so far over the top that they lost their real comedic effect. Also, several characters do everything but stay consistent with who the character really is. For example, the excessively stereotypical photographer, social outcast, self-hating, [bad]-car-driving character who hates everything about everyone falls in love with Starla (Barbie-type character), who excessively embodies everything that he really hates.Overall, this movie had a premise that started off with a little promise, but ended up wandering around in so many circles that it leaves viewers scratching their heads, wondering where the story went."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potentially good, Doesnt deliver","review":"She gets what she wants is a flimsy movie that has potential but it never fulfills it. It's not that funny and the characters are so annoying. It plays into Texas stereotypes, which is getting old and lacks in humor.

The acting is flawless (this was Cate Blancheet's first starring role) to cinematography superb, the costumes on target, and the story, the musical score gorgeous, and the plot though not a break neck action flick, very involving.But above all I plead with anyone in a position to help in this matter to please see to it that this movie gets the DVD treatment it deserves, and SOON!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A flawless film.","review":"This film is simply perfect. It is extremely rare for me to feel this way about a film. Acting, story, costumes, casting, cinematography, sets (which include the amazing glass church). Perfect. Flawless. Every single aspect works in support of the whole.This is not to say that this is one of my favorite films. It is not. It is a dark story of introverted characters with obsessive, compulsive behavior. The fullness with which this is explored, in the complexity of family history, religious influence, the restraint of both social construct and insecurity, make this a remarkable gem that deserves the overwhelming word of mouth that this film has accumulated.If this type of film (period piece, character studies, off beat story and characters) is not your cup of tea, don't waste your time. If this IS your kind of film, don't waste any time - see it now!Amazing film story telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please DVD","review":"This is a beautiful movie, but please have no misconceptions about what you're getting into. It is not a traditional love story. It does not have a happy ending. You are taken on an incredible journey, and grow to love these innocent people, who burn with passion-- then you see terrible, undeserved things happen to them.But it is still a wonderful achievement in the arts of filmmaking and film acting. It is a story about the human costs of founding a nation, among many other thought-provoking things. It was shamefully overlooked in 1998, and I do not understand why it has not been released on DVD. I appeal to Fox Searchlight, please DVD this soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point?","review":"I suppose there was a reason to this film I could just never figure it out. The acting was decent but the story line was ridiculous. I generally like quirky off-beat stories/movies but I think this one was trying too hard to be offbeat and quirky and it ended up just being silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to categorize gambling movie, but its uniqueness works","review":"The only way you will be disappointed with this film is if you go into it in the mood for a \\"certain kind of movie\\". It is a blend of many genres, but in the end really can only be solidly categorized as a period piece that focuses on two good natured characters that have little in common except for their love of gambling. Sometimes their shared addiction is used to help each other, othertimes it unintentionally leads to problems, but always down unique and unexpected paths that ultimately take them around the world. In what other movie can you see a church made of glass spectacularly sailing on an Australian river?I am guessing the film was a box office disappointment, because it would be difficult to market. But if you are tired of formulaic movies and want to see something that is \\"different\\", but not a rambling, incoherent artsy mess, then this is definitely worth taking a chance on. For the price on Amazon you also have little to lose."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Unique & Fascinating Film from Amazon","review":"I happened to see the last half of this unusual film on the Independent Film Channel & I was so caught up in the story that I immediately went to Amazon & ordered the DVD.The acting is excellent & the two main characters are fascinating people. You never know what they are going to do next. It's a love story like no other I have seen & I have told all my friends about it. In fact I'm planning an Oscar & Lucinda movie night in the near future. I have a feeling it will become a regular event. If you enjoy offbeat, you will like Oscar & Lucinda!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ralph Fiennes makes a mean redhead","review":"This is one weird movie, but one which is ultimately so touching, it's worth waiting through the first reels. Described as a story of two gamblers, Oscar and Lucinda is so very much more, a mythic fairytale beautifully played and portrayed.Rarely does one see a quirky movie so magical it begs to be viewed again and again. The sweetly offbeat love story will bring tears to your eyes in its conclusion; it's impossible not to wish the star-crossed duo could have lived happily ever after.I would recommend Oscar and Lucinda to anyone who wants to float for a couple of hours along a river of dreams and come out of the fantasy eager to experience more. An offbeat, lovely film but not for the average viewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Highly absorbing adaptation of Peter Carey's Booker Prize winning novel about two eccentric \\"misfits.\\"Highlighted by excellent performances from Ralph Finnes and Cate Blanchett in the title roles, gorgeous cinematogprahy, and a compelling score, the film pares down some of the novel's more long winded passages without short changing the viewer its odder (a compliment) components.

And then, after the first hour, it all falls apart. I slowly cared little for the main characters, which makes the end of the film seem entirely unplausible and somewhat ridiculous. Two fine leads, but the writing and the drama eventually go nowhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my fav's","review":"I rent movies all the time and enjoy period films such as Oscar and Lucinda. I rented this movie solely based on the '2 thumbs up' on the cover, which I often do. I enjoyed this movie so much, that I immedidately rewound the tape and watched it another time. I have only done this twice. The protagonists romance and common addiction is intertwined into a much larger story of fate. Cate Blanchett, as I read in an earlier review, is absolutely stunning in this film as she is in Elizabeth. If you fell for her in Elizabeth, you will certainly love Oscar and Lucinda. By the way, the other movie was Picnic at Hanging Rock. I'll have to admit to an ecstasy hangover as the reasoning for being interested in watching this one twice. This movie needs to be made available on DVD ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is better.","review":"This film is based on one of my favourite books, so I was really looking forward to seeing it. Despite great performances by Blanchett and Fienes, it just doesn't hold together well. Too much of what is in the book has been left out and that which is there lacks weight. The characters in the book are so much more complex and endearing. The book was very moving and engaging while the movie is not. There is also an ending tacked on that doesn't exist in the book, and that always annoys me. I was very disappointed. I think had I not read the book, I'd have stopped watching the movie about 1/3 into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic waste of film","review":"Don't ever watch this film unless you want to see how a bad director can ruin good actors' performances. Both Feinnes and Blanchett are pathetic and affectatious. The script is poor, the scenes are loose and do not connect. There's no real emotional impact even in the most tragic moments of the plot. I found myself lauphing rather than moved. Attempts at moralizing make the film even more ridiculous. A total failure if not for the beautiful Australian scenery."},{"rating":"1","title":"long and inexplicable","review":"I watched and I watched (and I watched) until the end, and when I got to there, the story wasn't any more clear to me than it had been in the beginning. Ralph Fienes plays a very pathetic character. Cate Blanchett is quite the opposite- confident and independent. I wish I could give you a summary of accounts, but it wouldn't make any more sense to you than it did to me. There's actually a narrator to the movie who speaks every once in awhile. The narrator is a descendent of Ralph Fienes's character. The movie starts out showing first Ralph and then Cate as children. Ralph's child-self is a redhead! It takes quite some time before their paths cross. Your attention may have been lost by then. I hope if you do watch this, you make out better than I did in fully understanding the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"A STUPID","review":"I'M FROM DC AND THIS BY FURTHER IS A STUPID BOOK AND A STUPID GIRL.

I can do my hair in half the time and tell everyone how I could never live without it. My RevoStyler has been used daily for a few years now and I am just now noticing that it needs to be charged more often (originally it was once every 5 days) I am preparing to buy another as I would not want to go without it even one morning! I use this on my 15 yr old daughter's hair too which is also very long and thick...and she loves the look better than using a straightener.

The artist teaches you with available tools around your home and it is relieving to know that you don't have to have this and that tool before embarking on a simple project that may take you just a day to finish.

But then in the next chapter, she told who it was. The book might have been better if she had left the reader in the drak for most of the book like most mysteries are. Also, this story line was not what I was expecting at all. I had loved the other books in this series, but this one didn't seem like part of the series at all. It had a darker undertone and would have seemed more in place in New York or San Francisco. I didn't get the \\"fantasy\\" feel from this book. Sure, magic was mentioned, but it didn't seem to fit the story line at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I was a little disappointed that this book is below Misty's standards.

I am amazed at how ponderous it was, to be honest I have not read many of her newer books because they seemed sort of rehashings of old story lines; but the Bards have always been fun.

Did not give it much thought. After 2 episodes into the 1st season, I was a convert. The Sea Shepherd have to work within their boundaries with their ailing ship. But what lacks in their old vessel makes up well in their passion and love for the cause. Paul Watson is crazy ( in a good way ). He perfectly fits the personality of captain. Season 1 and 2 were pretty good. The Season 2 did not end on a good note, not atleast for me.Season 3 brings in new crew and Pete B. I won't reveal the details but he stole the show in my opinion. Also, in Season 3 they are well matched and well prepared. Loved the show. Their drive and passion is just over and above.

So, he is humble.In other books he is trying to use modern scientific terms, may be as he understand them. Here he is also using them, so if you are educated in natural sciences, this book will be difficult to cope with. You must overcome your natural reactions when somebody are using words without knowing what they mean by definition.But this book is better than others, because it is much like the fairy story, without many attempts to look like the truth and science.If you like books of Castaneda, you may be disappointed, - this author, Drunval, is much less intelligent. But his experiences are much greater. And also their meanings are easier to understand, it's all about love to each other, love to Earth, love to the Universe. Nobody is enimy, nothing is wrong. Ease and pease."},{"rating":"2","title":"a book of great benefit","review":"The book was written in a way to be easily understood. Knowledge shared in the book would help people who meditate to understand the deeper meaning of meditation, and how we are connected to the universe. Instead of the kind of pursues by most people by using the five senses, which are limited in terms of receipt-ability, it makes good example to let reader understand that we have much greater receipt-ability from the use of the third eye. Further on the book introduces the secrete space of the heart and the inner space of the heart, it is a glimpse as to how one may one day develop to share the greater responsibility for the good of all kinds & all livings. The book perhaps is not an instruction manual to open the different abilities as mentioned above, afterall it is always better to initiate our hidden abilities through the help of more experienced teachers, nevertheless it helps to increase the understand of the tools that we could seek to open up our natural abilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living in the Heart","review":"Drunvalo gives us a map for creating our future selves, from an ancient way of living/being.

Also, not to nag on everything, but the main villains sidekick was a girl? No, a little homosexually needy boy named....wait for it...Ralph. However, this is sometimes really fun to watch due to its shear stupidity. There was a point where the main villain and hero clashed in a epic battle in the snow....what happened?

A sense of the imminent danger felt by this scientist should have been the easiest thing to convey about his life in Iraq under Saddam.

It provides great coverage - even under my eyes, where I have terrible dark circles - and is not as messy as other mineral makeup cosmetics like Bare Essentials. When I used Bare, I used to have to use an additional concealer, too, but not with the Pur Minerals foundation. It was also really easy to find a good color to match my skin tone - and I am Italian, so I have yellow undertones, and it has always been hard for me to find good matching foundations in the past.

I couldn't stand leaving my face on my boyfriend's shirts anymore (not to mention my cell phone, my work phone, my reading glasses, a tissue I used to blow my nose during allergy season, the collar on my coat, my winter hat, etc.) so I had to give it up.

I went to Ulta last month and purchased a new powder only to find that everything was different. There was no sponge, no place for storage in the compact and worst of all, the formula is very different and looks horrid on me. While I never used to have to retouch my makeup, I now had to retouch about 30 mins after each application. The powder seemed to melt off of my face and looked caked on as soon as I applied it. While Pur Minerals 4 in 1 powder always been a bit creamy, the new formula is just plain greasy. I am very disappointed in the change and have switched to the Gabriel Cosmetics lightest shade.

They are stiffer than a gel-disposable but still fit well and we haven't had any problems with leaks.I originally bought the toddler size for my toddler who fit the weight requirement but changed to the large size because the toddler size is extremely long.

You can get other people's (ie law students') corporate law outlines off the internet and have pretty much the same thing.

When that happened, I tried to clean the spray valve to no avail, then suddently it would mist again. The pump mechanism (manual) is somewhat difficult to create adequate pressure, and we suspect persons with arthritic hands would not be able to use it.

I used a small flashlight to get a better view, and I was shocked to see that it was clumps of mold. It is impossible to take it apart to get it out of there.

My only complaint is that the disc isn't longer than it is but it whets the appetite for more of AAE's future projects and product.

I could not believe how impressive this band is live and I regret the time they cancelled a show I was scheduled to attend back in the late 80's. The mark of a great band is how they sound live compared to their albums. This live performance is better than their recorded work. If you like Talk Talk's CD's you will love this DVD.

It had all the features I required and you can't bet the price. You will give up some RAM and a shorten battery life to the competition. But to me these where minor tradeoffs for great performance (larger processor), great screen, small size, light weight and it comes with a cradle (the iPAQ 1910 does not).I had the device for over a week and my only complaint how the device fits into the cradle. It's a little shaky and not as good a fit as my old Palm VIIx. You just have to be extra carefully when docking.There is not doubt in my mind that Pocket PC is the way to go.

It has been running very stably and so far seems surprisingly sturdy. I suspect that the HP iPAQ Pocket PC h1910 is similar but the specs show a lot shorter battery life. The Toshiba e310/e335 is also similar but a bit larger and the screen did not look as bright. The Dell Axim X5 is heavier and larger but can accomodate a CF type II card in addition to an SD card.

I think the Folk Song Suite was performed particularly well, as was the Toccata Marziale. Holst's E-flat Suite sounds great, but the Chaconne (1st movement) is way too fast for my liking.

It then offers a few lines of text showing a tail script, and then tells you to modify the passwd file.That's great, but what EXACTLY needs to be modified? Do I stick the tail script at the end of the user's entry? Do I have to snip out some text somewhere?If you want some general instruction about the what Linux is capable of, this is a decent book.

The sound is exactly as advertised: smooth and full. It's louder than the old speaker, but the highs are not piercing at all. It's much less fatiguing to listen to, and almost invites you to try to listen carefully. The clean channel sounds great, and the drive channel, which I never much cared for, now sounds a lot better too.The speaker is well-built, was packaged nicely, and was easy to install despite the magnet part being a little bigger than the old one. It feels like it weighs twice as much. I had to turn it about 45 degrees counterclockwise because the amp's wires were otherwise too short to reach it.

Don't get me wrong: I agree CHINATOWN is a great movie, but the *script* ... okay, it is obviously well crafted, but by no means overtowering everything else.

It spends too much time glorifiying the Jack Nicholson film CHINATOWN than providing any practical information on such important things as formatting or maximum number of pages or even what font to use.

It has all the elements of popular modern literary fiction: a hackneyed, archetypal plot; a melodramatic but overblown love story (what a surprise, the girl has been hurt before); the obligatory loss of love and gaining of redemption; the prose style masquerading as 'elegant' because it is told in a half-hearted stream-of-conscious style, which the author believes gives license to present a story in a fragmented, verbose manner that attempts to conceal glaring weaknesses in plot.This book is average at best; if you're reading for the WW2 stuff look for Halpert's A Real Good War and if it's for the love story there's really nothing to distinguish this from the thousands of other patently mass-produced love stories cluttering bookstore shelves.

It was very uncomfortable in my hands, hard to hold, had cheese (hard parm) coming out both sides and going all over the place; was difficult to deal with left-handed and just plain not worth it. I was looking forward to having a S/S grater, but not this one. Will put it in a yard sale and try for another one after I check it out in a store. Having a reverse grater is very important to me. I had a plastic one that worked great for years, but it finally broke. :( This one just isn't it. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"I purchased this grater to replace a plastic grinder that had a similar design. The plastic one didn't work as well,felt flimsy, and would actually grind small grains of plastic in with the cheese. This grater is very well built and grinds well. The metal construction gives it a solid feel that should last many years. I took off 1 star because the vender didn't inclued any information about replacemeny parts. I would like to add second grinding tube for a less coarse grind option but there isn't any information as to whether that would be available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rotary Cheese Grater So Far","review":"Easy to grate and simple to use and clean up. I bought 3 of the white plastic ones in the past and they didn't last. They were all junk - I hated them. Elderly people in my family did not have the strength in their hands to use those. This stainless steel grater is the answer if you've been searching for a real one.The only design flaw I can think of is; there is an eighth-inch space between the grater drum and the side wall. This potentially allows small chunks of cheese to slip through there every so often. I only use it to grate Parmesan when I eat Italian food, so if little chucks of cheese fall through the cracks onto my spaghetti, it is no big deal for me. If fact, I actually like that. If you're grating the Parmesan on a clean plate, you can always pick the chunks back up and put them back in the reservoir if you choose.Don't buy those stupid white plastic ones - you'll hate them. Get this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"lefties beware","review":"My poor husband thought he had found a great grater for me The picture shows the barrel in the left-handed position; the carton claims right or left-handed use.

He fell in love with the cheese graters they use at Olive Garden, so when we were in Walmart one day he saw one and we bought it. He was thrilled because he could buy Parmesan cheese in a lump and grind it fresh at table. The only problem was that it was plastic and when he reached the rind one day, the plastic was not strong enough and it broke. This one is steel (and he knows not to try to grind the rind) so I have high hopes that it will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I gave this thing one star only because I had no choice if I wanted to review it. I would have given it minus 5 stars if it were possible to do so!!! This poorly made product fell apart within the first five minutes of use. While attempting to grate parmesan cheese, the grater barrel caved in and the handle fell off.

Almost always in the end something remains. A good example of this, is the myth about homosexuality in ancient Greece.That myth was mainly created with mistranslations, misquotes and ignored sources. Dover's book is considered a classic on the subject and there are quite a lot of people who believe in the myth because of it. So for those who read the book and thought it was informative, had mounds of evidence etc. as some reviewers say, you should get your hands on this:Homosexuality in ancient Greece: The myth is collapsing by Adonis Georgiades."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREEK HOMOSEXUALITY","review":"The book is well researched and that is not my problem, what I do however do not like is when one buys from a seller from Amazon (even if the book is used) it should still have all its pages.

The process, as simple as it is, really helped me narrow down the things that should be priorities in life. I also agreed with the concept of following one's instinct and moving forward when you are inspired and feeling comfortable and stopping action when you feel distress or negative feelings.

They are part of a group that promotes each others' products through cross marketing and reviewing each others' products, so I'd take the raves for this book with a large grain of salt.One thing is clear: The author's passion is marketing pap to the pseudo-spiritual seekers.

For me, there was no new information. What there is, are reminders of what I need to do to maintain where I'm going; check in continuously to see if I'm on the right path, AND, one thing I've found is that, someone may say something I don't get one way, and someone else might say it another. I found the use of their words \\"passion\\" and \\"markers\\" instead of goals quite useful as, when living one's passion, the markers are just signs and symbols that one is getting what they say they want while living their passion. The book is well written; I reveled in and related to Janet's path of discovery and I enjoyed reading Chris' contribution.

Personally, I think there should be some kind of tag on the cover of books to indicate that it is a Chrisitan work, that would no doubt save many a few bucks and avoid purchasing books that are mostly old worn-out Christian reference manuals. I am disappointed that many of the 'endorsers' of this book also hold a Christian view. If you can't explain 'that which all things are created through', it would be a good idea not to waste our time writing a book. The group consciousness is at that stage now, we are no longer intrigued or interested in the old worn-out \\"GOD\\" explanation.I must say that the content of the book - less the Christian references, justification, and explanations - seems intelligently written, and since I don't know how to get a refund from Amazon (which I would prefer at this point), I will continue with the book and provide a comphrensive review upon completion."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Free Gifts\\"","review":"This book comes with a fortune of free gifts, or so the marketing goes.

The test is sitting down and listing out 10 attributes of your dream life. How did that make a book? There are no new ideas or messages presented. The most telling part of this book however, is that the authors admit you will need to retake the test every six months! EVERY SIX MONTHS! Because your passions and moods change.

This film showcases Turner at the peak of her career at MGM. Lingering closeups fill the screen with her luminous beauty. Her character in this film is an outsider who rebels against the strictures of small-town life. Tracy plays her much older husband and the two have a delightful and unexpected screen chemistry. Several scenes demonstrate what made Turner one of MGM's top box office draws--her delight as she models some new clothes in a swank New York shop, a tender scene with Tracy after she is seriously injured in a traffic accident, and her heart-rendering portrayal of grief when she learns that her much-anticipated baby is stillborn.

You have to give new actors on low budget movies a chance, you know? I agree with the person who stated that Josh Hammond stole the show. I also thought he was great.My only issue with the movie was that I thought it took too long to reveal why the Black Cadillac was chasing them. I started to get bored by the time the real action started to take place... My attention was recovered, though, and I stayed well tuned in for the rest of the movie.

I was hoping the series would get a treatment like transformers did, with a completely new master from new telecine of the original film reels.

The music is very complex in many places, which makes it rather difficult for someone of modest ability to follow, but that is no fault of the book of course. On occasion the tablature is rather difficult to follow and sent me scurrying for a chord directory so as to figure out the proper fingering of some of the more advanced stuff.The product description says the book is hardback, but it is not: it is paper like most other books of this ilk. I gave it four stars for having a slightly misleading description. Overall, a great book for advanced guitarists (but a bit ambitious for less advanced players, like me) containing some of Knopfler's best solo work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled nonsense","review":"Pretty much like every other Vince Vaugh filler. Ben Stiller, in my opinion, has stepped down a notch. Maybe good for 12-13 year olds or 18 to 20 year olds that still like to live in fantasy.

Jona Hill had a minor role .. and again wasn't even funny .. he didn't really do much in this movie .. which was a dissappointment. Ben Stiller was the biggest dissappointment though. Even though yet again he played a neurotic weirdo I had higher expectations that he'd atleast hold this movie together. I don't mind some raunchy topics as long as they are intermingled with some comedy. This movie was just crude and rude .. which is apparently all hollywood is capable of anymore.

Apart from the obnoxious product placement, and lowest common denominator sex humor, the most painful aspect of the film is the several points in which the \\"comedy\\" leads attempt to improvise material.

Jonah Hill is getting better all the time. Loved the part where R. Lee Ermey runs the guys off his front yard with a shotgun, no one can cuss out a bunch of idiots like him.

Weird things start happening and the new Neighborhood Watch decided to take matters in their own hands. I won't say what was happening, but it was not at all what I expected!

They talk about all sorts of \\"gross\\" stuff that I can totally see a lot of more conservative viewers not enjoying. Having said that, I'll just say that this is a hilarious tongue-in-cheek movie.

I wish they did it like 21 Jump Street and made the threat be distracted by the incompetent heroes and then busted. Also the aliens were ridiculous.

I can't believe Ben Stiller and Vince V. actually did this movie. Jonah Hill is another story, but even as a young comedian he should have turned it down immediately.

I love all the actors in it ( in other movies!) and actually feel embarassed and sorry for them for the bad script. They must have suffered doing this ... It is a wild nonsense orgy of aliens, lame jokes, chlichees, and - in case everything else hasn't caused enough damage - really awful sex jokes. It actually made me cringe with embarrassement.

As good a movie as I've seen in a while, but very hard to compare with other works. It is more serious than Mars Attacks, Galaxy Quest, or Paul, but not as serious as Pitch Black, Alien, or Predator.

Well, at least that is what I saw until I turned it off. Ben Stiller has made some great movies \\"Night at the Museum\\" and the sequel being the best. Too bad they don't try to make quality movies instead of trash to get a rated R which should be a worse rating than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Decent cast worst movie ever. Collection of random scenes with very little story. Vince Vaughn plays the exact same character as all his other movies. If you're a 10 year old boy you might like this movie otherwise its a total waste of 2 hrs. I would rather sand down old people's bunions then watch this awful movie again.

It is a movie that tires to be funny but never really is funny. Should have known any movie with Jonah Hill would be a week movie. The development of Ben Stiller 's character was slow. The movie was sadly not entertaining. It jumps around so much that it seems like the other characters story times were vague and worthless to the rest of the story. Not worth watching unless you are extremely bored and wanting something stupid to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously??","review":"It's really a shame because those guys are really funny.

It reaches my lamest-comedy list that actors seem to be sleep walking throughout. In other words, one of the un-funniest \\"comedies\\" I've lost 90 minutes over. Who ever approved this film must not really understand script writing or else be stuck in his/her stunted adolescence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor use of good talent!","review":"Could have been a good movie....Childish antics and extreme foul language throughout the entire movie.

Ben Stiller & Vince Vaughn have lost it - not funny!What happened to the great comedies of the 80's/90's? This was a total guy movie, only lacking fart & butt crack jokes. Had Adam Sandler been one of the writers I'm sure those sad excuses for comedy would have been inserted too.The dumbing down of America is evident in the comedy coming from Hollywood.Feel guilty of promoting this movie by having rented it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a COMEDY, not a sci-fi masterpiece!","review":"This is a good film with lots of fun to behold. Yes, it's somewhat predictable: a group of rag-tag buffoons are the only ones in the know and what will happen? Yes, the three stars are playing the same basic roles they always do, but it IS FUNNY. I find it fairly comparable to Wedding Crashers in comedy, maybe not as riotous, but The Watch has no saggy moral middle. The sci-fi elements are actually quite good and the mix with comedy is pretty great."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few chuckles is all","review":"This is a pretty stupid movie, but if you just want to switch off for a couple hours and have a few (literally, just a few) laughs, I wouldn't talk you out of it. Jonah Hill and Vince Vaughn provide the only real comic relief, and most of it looks like improv and outtakes. Utterly forgettable and sure to be found in the $2 bin at Walmart very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was okay, 3.5","review":"I kind of enjoyed the sci fi part more than the expected comedy.

Jonah Hills lines were terrible as usual Vince Vaughn was very predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should be called 'Dont' Watch'","review":"How can such a comedic cast fail on all levels? The writing seemed poorly improvised? Also over the last few years Vince Vaughn seems to be doing a bad Vince Vaughn impersonation. If you watched the trailer it seemed like a funny no-brainer comedy. When you watch the movie mid-way through you are watching a totally different movie that what it should be. I won't, but I should, but I won't give away any spoilers, but this film has to be nominated for a Raspberry Award."},{"rating":"1","title":"The (End Of The) Watch","review":"I knew THE WATCH was going to be bad from the get-go. However, the only reason this reviewer wanted to check the film out was to see British actor Richard Ayoade who was so hilarious on the Brit sit-com, THE IT CROWD. His talents are wasted in the film as his character is as stupid as everyone else in the film. The film is another failed attempt to mix paranormal with comedy that hardly works (GHOSTBUSTERS being the exception), and we've seen Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, etc., play variations of these types of characters so many times in other films that they seem to be morphing into each other. Predictable, not fun to watch, terrible script, and characters we don't care about makes THE WATCH just another tax write-off for 20th Century Fox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"I feel after watching this and laughing maybe 20 times at most, that they tried to use the wrong actors for the script. Stiller and Vaughn are funny guys, but not in the roles they were cast. Hill and the tall man, were good, but i left feeling with two other main actors and a more jovial style to the movie, it would have been a lot funnier and a lot more interesting. It was hard to care for most of the characters, because there was little in way of development.Special effects were pretty good, music was well done, and the cinematography were all fine. As a movie it works. As a comedy the plot is weird, but strangely they play it too serious throughout the movie. A different tone for the movie would have gone a long way to salvaging it. As it was, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Watch","review":"Old men acting like Middle School children.

This movie is no exception. Bait and switch. The cast was great, too bad that they had such a poorly written script to work from. With all the countless writers selling their wares in Hollyweird, and this is the best script you could come up with? It's almost as if the script was an afterthought. As a consolation prize they even threw in a little porn, so parents take note.Stiller, Ayoade and Vauhgn: What were you thinking?It took me two days to watch this because I fell asleep midway through the movie. And actually had to replay the very end again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed...","review":"This was worthless from the start to the point that I couldn't even finish it.

No one with an IQ over 60 will find any part of this movie interesting. It seemed to be 90% improv by the 4 unfunniest guys in the world (I guess Steve Carell was busy, as he was not in this one). However, Vince Vaughn plays the exact same manic unfunny person he played in his last 6 films, and Ben Stiller plays the same unfunny guy he has played in the last 27 movies.

A lot of chasing and shooting and sex talk and beer drinking and shooting and chasing and bad language. It does have an R rating, but like I said, not really date night stuff.

One is an overly verbose and touchy manchild. One is a weirdo outcast. One is an overly positive uptight square. If you guessed Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill and Ben Stiller, you'd be right, because these actors have played these exact same characters many times before. Here's the thing, I liked Wedding Crashers, I liked 21 Jump Street and Meet The Parents. They're funny movies. But stuffing those characters into what amounts to a 2-hour advertisement for Costco wrapped inside a wildly predictable plot.The only positive to this movie was the performance of Richard Ayoade, who has a nice deadpan delivery to a couple of his lines. I actually felt bad that a talented actress like Rosemarie DeWitt had to lower herself to such a trainwreck, but I guess actors need to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Down The Toilet Goes Stiller!","review":"Ben Stiller is falling in Adam Sandler's footsteps, he just keeps on making crappy movies one after another.

As with all movies, I imagine it would have been better if they had replaced Ben Stiller with someone who is actually funny. The dry wit of Richard Ayoade, Vince Vaughn, and Stiller culminate in in stagnant, un-clever quips that leave you just begging for an alien to eat them all. I also wished Jonah Hill would magically gain about 60 pounds so he would be a hysterical fat guy again. Trust me - don't watch this flick.

Everyone wants to be a pop star, don't they? (If not, you might not enjoy this so much). I was a bit baffled by the shift forward in time by its sequel Stardust, which seems to take place in the 1970s whereas this is set in the 1950s. Writer Ray Connolly has written a lot about the Beatles, so the film's story has some similarities to their life, but it is clearly not meant to be about any one actual person any more than Spinal Tap is meant to be about Status Quo. Nevertheless the central performances from David Essex and Ringo Starr are good, and there is a superb cameo by Billy Fury, reason alone to buy this film if you're a Fury fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"That'll Be The Day","review":"I found it to be quite boring. As far as it being related to John Lennon's life as a young man I see no resemblence other than the fact that his father left. After that fact there are no similarities.

Now I know why I didn't remember it, there was nothing memerable about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very effective workout!","review":"Very good workout, even if you are not familiar with kettlebells. Still, it is challenging enough to give you good sore muscles and if you are able to actually follow along all the way, you are in excellent shape! Anyway, you can always change to heavier weights and the workout becomes more challenging.You do not need any timer yourself, but can really just follow along. That's what makes it makes it so useful for me. I don't need any other gadgets to be able to start working out. Just two kettlebells (a light and a heavier one) me and the screen. That's it! No excuses anymore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost total lack of instruction","review":"I have quite a few kettlebell DVDs and I was looking for a little something to spice up my workouts. This DVD was not it.There is virtually no instruction provided and let's say the instructor will not win a prize for being personable. A timer is provided and that's probably the best thing I can say for this DVD. If all you are looking for is watch some guy doing a kettlebell routine in an outdoor setting (I not sure, the background does look kind of fake), then this is the workout for you. I could have gotten more from going to my local gym and watching people doing their kettlebell routines. The Iron Core series and the Skogg System are far superior in my opinion. And yes, I am definitely returning this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute as a Button.","review":"My son wanted this bow tie for 8th grade promotion. He was so cute.

Ralph Fiennes was a very believable schizophrenic.The plot of the movie was decently involved (but not overwhelming).Especially good points:1. The characters were developed in a certain way to lead us to think one thing, but it later became clear that they were viewed through the lens of schizophrenia.2. One woman played several characters, and she did a great job with all three of them. That was a testament to training and study!3. The movie came together at the end in an \\"Aha!\\" sort of way. It is not one of those types of movies that would hve to be watched two or three times to put everything in place-- but not so pedestrian as to be boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A daring and brilliant psychological study","review":"This movie, by Canadian director David Cronenberg, fulfills the earlier promise of his tragicomic reprise, The Fly. Get the connection? I just wish Rod Serling (\\"Hollywood's a great place to live - if you're a grapefruit\\") were alive to appeciate \\"Spider\\" - he would have loved it, as would the great French crime writer Georges Simenon, who loved to explore the psyche behind the crime.This is a thinking person's story, superbly filmed in chameleonic tones of gray, with a pace that makes a laughing stock of the entire Hollywood production culture, and with an absolutely dedicated cast. I needed to watch it twice just to begin to appreciate Cronenberg's \\"spin\\" on the story.

Although I've never met younger David, I have met the Senior and if he's incrediblely gifted and talented -- a bank full of knowledge -- than David the young eloquently and rawly gives voice to his nightmare -- of survival -- at a time when there were only questions as to whether he would.

About the writing style: I felt it was quite good (thus four stars), but I would have liked the story to move along faster. Much of the book could have been condensed, leaving room for all of the things that were left out (and I'm convinced a whole bunch of stuff was).The author seemed determined to show how it was rational for him to haved joined this group, but he failed. I kept reading between the lines thinking, WHAT WAS HE THINKING? This is not an objective report. This does not tell you what really happened at Waco. But perhaps that is not the author's fault. I doubt any book on the subject CAN be objective. What those of us who weren't involved must do is read everything we can on the subject and draw our own, hopefully rational conclusions. A lot of people made mistakes in Waco. David Thibodeau is no exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of truth and a lot of lies","review":"If they were so peaceful then why did they not just exit the compound? Why have such a long standoff which they knew would end that way? Overall, this book answers a lot of questions and raises more.

Because the notion of such an unconventional religion scared me, I allowed myself to accept that one-sided negative view without question. After reading this book, however, I learned that you don't have to agree with the rules and practices of the Branch Davidians to realize that there was NO NEED for the actions undertaken by the government of this country. You may expect a biased view to come from someone who lived by David Koresh's teachings, but Mr. Thibodeau is remarkably objective considering his experiences. The parts of this story that will infuriate you are based on documented fact regarding the ATF, FBI and Department of Justice. Read with an open mind.

While it focuses on the work of one doctor, the methods that were used previous to his work are more frightening than most other books! (when treating an accident victem, there was not much that could be done except waiting by the roadside for the victim to expire and record the time of death) And, as with many pioneer books, the ideas that were considered and thrown out, such as the idea of putting trauma wards onto tractor trailers and shuttling them about the country going to patients as an oversized ambulance.

I found the whole album to be very boring. There was hardly any variation between the songs, and sometimes I didn't know whether a new song started or if one was still playing. The singer isn't bad, but definitely over-rated I think. She sings very quietly and her voice doesn't have much variation either.

The album is easilly the most mellow album they've made but it lacks the solid single needed to grab people's attention. \\"I want to believe in something\\" is a great song but so many people have forgotten about these guys that it hardly got some airtime. The album is fantastic though with terrific songs such as \\"expectations\\", \\"greedy man\\", \\"I remember\\", \\"objectify me\\", \\"can I love you now\\", and \\"politically correct\\" being the best of the bunch.

I, like many golfers tend to come over the top with my swing, this caused me to hit the mat where it attaches at the synthetic grass and the base molding. The grass is threaded into another layer which is glued into place on top of the base. Eventually this second layer separated from the base and the \\"grass\\" separated completely. Cheap glue = not a well made product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This might be a nice mat if you NEVER miss hit but if you strike the mat with any kind of force you will damage the mat.

The author places all mathematical formulas and derivations in boxes that are separate from the flow of the text so you don't have to do the math if all you want is a knowledge of the history of this era in mathematics. The author does a great job of explaining this history, covering the story of the factoring of polynomials in general but focusing on the unsolvability of the quintic. Abel's life of poverty is covered in detail. There is a lot of mathematics, if you are interested, including how to factor a cubic polynomial and Abel's proof of the unsolvability of the quintic. I found the math somewhat hard to follow but worth the effort of doing so. I found Abel's story to be very sad. The book is worth reading just for his life story alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abel's Proof","review":"This book is intelligently written and does not assume advanced mathematics. Look for it to become a classic. It includes, as an appendix, Pesic's translation of Abel's 1824 paper \\"Memoir on algebraic equations, in which is demonstrated the impossibility of solving the general equation of the fifth degree\\", along with a brief commentary. Two additional appendices further help in understanding Abel's paper. In his notes, Pesic offers a wealth of suggestions for reading beyond his book.The story is of mathematicians' pursuit of solving polynomial equations. Pesic tells this story with concision, clarity and brilliant elegance. Technical details are boxed and separate from the main text. Not only does this allow readers to bypass such details if they choose but, in being highlighted, the details can be easily located later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reply to a Reviewer","review":"To this reviwer who claims the author made a mistake be referring to Al-Khwarizimi and Khayyam as Arab Mathematicians, the author did not make any mistake nor did any of all the authors who wrote on math history. Those two Arab Mathematicians as well as many more did live in an Arab Empire. Al Khwarizmi, his name is Muhammad bin Mosa - arabic for english moses - was born and lived in Baghdad. He was a close friend to the great Calif Al-Maamoon. Al-Maamoon used to pay the jewish translators the weight of their translation - from greek into arabic- in gold. The arab mathematicians preserved and added to the greek mathmatics. Later at the beginning of european renaissance, a latin scholar had to pretend himself a muslim to translate from arabic in todays Morroco the books of Euclid into latin because the greek original was lost. - Ref.

Possibly this represents an attempt to enhance ecumenical dialogue, a worthwhile goal, but not at the expense of declaring optional the v ery beliefs and teachings of one's own church.For American Catholics interested in falling right in with current society's norms, this book is for you.

I tried printing on the recommended photo paper and it puts black lines down the back of the paper. It also does not accept card stock very well. Lexmark support (misnomer) first said that it was a defective black cartridge then later said that the printer does not accept the type of paper I was using. Either way I'm dumping this sucker and going back to the HP. I'd advise anyone who wants to use other than just regular bond paper to not waster their money on this printer. Unfortunately I bought it at CompUSA brand new but can not return it because they're going out of business. An expensive lesson but I did learn.

The chapter on Naked Lunch, for example, focuses entirely on some rather questionable ideas about how to historicize the queer identity available in the 1950s, and thus ends up ignoring everything that is funny or satirical in a novel that is essentially comic and satirical (as well as being savage and caustic). The result is that every novel is viewed from a partial perspective that makes the book seem entirely thesis-driven, to the point that it simply ignores whatever is not grist for the author's mill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!","review":"It's amazing that it's taken this many years for someone to actually consider about Burroughs as a gay writer. All those Wild Boys are finally talked about as gay heroes in this excellent book. Jamie Russell made me return to the novels with new eyes.

The format chosen is a series of brief entries on genera that contain some ornamental species. Each entry starts with a sketch of what the genus is used for, followed by a sketch of some species and what they are used for. A typical entry is a quarter of a page or so. Alternatively such an entry might be described as a few lines on a favorite species, preceded by a few lines on the genus and a few lines on a companion species. Information given is on gardening only and apparently very limited in accuracy (the author proclaims that Coffea has only a single important species!).One in every two entries is accompanied by a color picture of a fifth to half a page.

Takes two seconds and because you don't let them go all the way down to the bottom before refilling they don't dry out. Wipes dry out becuase there are not enough in the container to maintain the moisture.Second...BUY A DIFFERENT WARMER! The organizer does not hold diapers past a size 1 without a cramming struggle to get them in and zip. The warmer just stopped working for no reason.

I used both, the Especially for Baby and Lionhart, and both dried out half of my wipes each time I refilled. Also, it doesn't provide that much warmth for the wipes--maybe \\"room temperature.\\" I used the wipe warmers (after returning them twice) for about two weeks, then gave up because both broke (or stopped heating the wipes!). I don't even think my daughter even noticed when I stopped using them--at least she never seemed bothered by the cold ones. Besides, I have a feeling the containers harbor bacteria and mold (after a while of being moist inside) so it may not even be healthy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"baby likes warm stuff","review":"this little gadget is great. I don't know anyone else who has one but my baby definatley appreciates a warm wipe to his bottom. The only thing i didn't like about the warmer is that the ones on the bottom dry out if you leave it on all the time. Depending on which wipes you use the number will vary. I've found that you'll waste fewer huggies wipes than pamper's."},{"rating":"1","title":"warmer good but not other features","review":"pockets are too shallow and don't hold lotions or powder...don't really hold much of anything bigger/taller than q-tips or alcohol swabs...diaper section is okay but not really ideal...doesn't hold enough diapers, constantly would have to be refilling it. Wipe warmer was best feature and was okay but at the same time wasn't that great...if don't keep full at all times seems to burn and dry bottom 1/3 of wipes in container...if looking for a wamer, go for the seperate pop up type...and for storage just go for baskets to store things and place on changing table or get a changing table with drawers to store things in...also, entire item doesn't really hang well on the side of my changing table, not very secure...definately would NOT recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"A friend recommended a wipe warmer after he got one for his 4th child. Since the Especially For Baby one seemed a reasonable price, we experimented with it. Unfortunately, it doesn't work well with either of the wipes we tried - Pampers or Huggies. And the extra storage just didn't provide much \\"storage\\". So we've taken it back and our daughter doesn't seem to mind the room temperature wipes that clean her cute tushie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD BUY","review":"When we first brought the baby home he use to scream when changing him. I had no idea this product existed, but when we came across it in the store we figured we would give it a try. Well, changing diapers has become a totally different experience. Now our baby seems to be soothed, and I no longer feel like I'm causing him discomfort. This has been a real help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all its cracked up to be","review":"This item is really a waste of money. The wipes do get warm, but they dry out so fast that you can only get through half a stack before having to throw them away. Further, it warms from the bottom, which means that the ones that get dried out are the ones that are the warmest...totally defeating the purpose of the product. Huggies wipes are the quickest to dry out. Pampers wipes tend to stay moist longer, BUT...they make so much condensation on the lid of the warmer that I make a mess just reaching in for the wipe. Bottom Line: wate of money and space on the changing table. My son doesn't even seem to notice cold wipes anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY IMPRACTICAL!","review":"I RECEIVED THIS AS A SHOWER GIFT FOR MY NOW 3 MONTH OLD LITTLE GIRL. I THOUGHT IT LOOKED LIKE A GREAT IDEA, AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF THE PRODUCT WAS MADE A WHOLE LOT BETTER. FIRST OF ALL THE MACHINE SHOULD BE BATTERY OPERATED NOT PLUG IN. IT WOULD BE SO MUCH MORE CONVENIENT THAT WAY. SECOND OF ALL IT DRIES THE WIPES. LASTLEY THE UNDER COMPARTMENT IT TOO FLIMSY TO HOLD ANYTHING. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT. EVEN IF YOU RECEIVE IT AS A GIFT RETURN IT FOR STORE CREDIT AND GET SOMETHING YOU CAN REALLY USE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warms, but seems dangerous!","review":"My husband purchased this item for our daughter. It does it's job, though we had to change from pampers wipes to ones that are more narrow to fit in the holder. The problem that I have is that if it is 2/3 full or less, the wipes on the bottom dry out and seem to start to burn! I pull out 4-5 wipes weekly that are dry and orange/charred from the heating element on the bottom. I seem to be refilling it more than once a week to try and combat the drying out. Also, instead of using the storage we put it on the dresser, which also gets too hot to touch if it is moved. It just seems a little dangerous to me. Not worth the money. I wish the stores or online store sold the wrap around warmer. It wraps around any wipes container that you have and plugs in. It doesn't get too warm, but still manages to warm the wipes. AND it's half of the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb, dumb, dumb! Complete waste of money!","review":"Warmers stated \\"will not yellow the wipes\\". BULL! Not only do they turn yellow they dry out! I had my warmer plugged it for 1 month and through it out! Every mom thinks they NEED warm wipes. Use a conventional warm wash cloth. It's better for baby anyways. To much chemicals. Save your money ladies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all wipes fit!","review":"The container says that it fits all wipes, so we bought it. Our 2 week old screams when the cold wipe touches his bum. After putting it all together and plugging it in we realized that Pampers wipes do not fit in the warmer. It was a huge disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the wrap-around kind instead","review":"First of all, this thing dries out wipes, even if you do add the 1/4 cup of water you're supposed to add every couple of days! It also restricts you in the kind of wipes you can buy... forget getting Chubbs in its round container, for instance. The little storage area is a nice idea, but it's rather flimsy and not very supportive. Your best bet would be to get one of the wrap-around warmers, which have cute pastel designs on them and mold to the shape of the wipe tub. These take up far less room and are much easier to clean, too. This one? You'll be continuously wiping it down, when it hasn't fallen over, that is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wipes get cool before they get to baby's bottom","review":"I thought this would be a wonderful way to be nice to our baby with the warmer wipes but it seems like they feel good when I initially open the door and get the wipe but it seems like they are already cold again by the time I start using it on the baby. Also the bottom few wipes always seem to get dry and brown so we waste a few wipes with each refill. It's an OK product but if I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Wipe Warmer","review":"My daughter received the wipe warmer at her baby shower. Less than 2 weeks later, as I was changing my granddaughter, we noticed that the wipes were bone dry and they were starting to turn brown on the bottom as though they were beginning to burn. My daughter immediately unplugged the warmer and returned it to babies r us the very next day. As it was on her registry, they took it back and gave her a different one by another company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burnt Wipes- Terrible","review":"We bought this wipes warmer for our son's room and it was awful. The wipes were always hard and brown at the bottom. We wasted more money throwing ruined wipes away. We returned it and bought the Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer. We've had that one for 8 months now and never had a problem with burnt wipes. I should have paid the money and bought that one in the first place. Don't waste your money or time buying this wipes warmer- it is cheap and you will regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are probably better warmers out there","review":"This warmer is OK. It warms the wipes and has storage for diaper creams and diapers. It is not wise to put an entire pack of refills in it as they do dry out and the bottom ones will turn yellow and brown. My biggest problem was that it does not enable you to use the pop-up wipes. You can not pull the wipes out one-handed because it will not disperse the wipes one at a time. If I tried to pull out one wipe - ten would come out due to the way the wipe companies fold and interlock the wipes. Unfortunately all of the wipes we purchased are folded to work with a pop-up dispenser. I eventually just put this away and stopped using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Please don't waste your money. It dries out the wipes so bad.

I opened it randomly to the chapter about desires and was immediately engrossed.

Pass this one by.","review":"One, possibly two or three selections, sound a little bit like the originals, but, as Ms. Van Auken indicated, the rest are just plain awful re-makes. When I played \\"At The Hop\\", I almost gagged. The originals are out there; do some research and get them, instead.As I always say, it doesn't cost that much more to obtain the rights to the originals (for example, the real original \\"Sixty Minute Man\\" was done by Billy Ward & The Dominoes, in 1951), so why do people continue to make mostly garbage-filled turkeys (no offense to the real birds) like this?Worth 99 cents, but only if the shipping is free."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only redeeming factor","review":"The only reason to buy this is because there are two songs that are by \\"The Who\\" which you cannot find on any other Who CD. The rest is rubbish.

JLH has a beautiful voice, which was very refreshing. I'd give the album 5 stars, but there are 3 songs that aren't as good as the others, but are still enjoyable (except Avenue of Stars, listen to it and you'll know what I mean). If you're still not sure if you want to buy this album, look up You, Stand in Your Way, and First Time. Those are my 3 favorite songs and her voice is at it's best in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talented but.......","review":"She does have have a great voice but it's being put to such bad use. Nearly every song is just a knock-off on someone else's sound or some style - \\"Hey Everybody\\" and \\"Rock the Roll\\" are just two examples of trying to sound cool or hip something.She needs to let her unique style out or find her \\"voice\\" in the literay sense. I have not heard all of her material but \\"I Know You Will\\" comes closest on this album I think.I know she wants to be a song writer but she would do well to work with someone else here - read the lyrics for \\"Avenue of the Stars\\"? Ugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acts and Sings!","review":"I didn't know that Jennifer Love Hewitt sang until I was searching on here for one of her movies.

She's one of the few who can act AND sing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HIT AND MISSED","review":"After hearing the single, Barenaked, I was excited to buy the album. I usually don't like Pop music, but I did like Ms. Hewitt's single. Unlike most, I bought the album without having the skepticism that most people would have about buying an actress/singer's album. However, I listened (and have repeatedly listened just to make sure) to the album and was disappointed! The only song worth mentioning besides Barenaked is the No.2 track. Other than that, the rest of the album portrays Ms. Hewitt out of her element singing music that doesn't quite fit her persona or style. It seems as if she tried to make this \\"I'm trying to sound edgier and less Pop-ish\\" album, but alas, falls short and portrays this \\"Man's Girl-Next-Door-Fantasy\\"'s music as way too contrived. Throughout the whole album, it seems as if Ms. Hewitt was a square trying to fit into a circle! Either that, or she should get a new producer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Hewitt's Return","review":"After hearing, \\"How Do I Deal,\\" in 1998, I figured Jennifer had some promise. Yes, Jennifer Love does have promise but not as much as fellow label mates Britney Spears, Nick Carter, Justin Timberlake, and *NSYNC. \\"Barenaked,\\" wasn't a huge hit, it was embraced by certain radio and MTV didn't play it much. \\"Barenaked,\\" is probably the album's best song. Overall the album is average."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Voice - Average Music","review":"This CD really show what a great singer JLH can be. She has some real power in her high range and some soulful growl to her low range.About half of the songs on this CD are worth listening to, most notably First Time, Barenaked, and Where You Gonna Run To?. Others are quite poorly written with cheesy lyrics and mundane melodies.Overall it is definitely worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Good Comfort Music ;-)","review":"Jennifer did a wonderful job on this album. Her voice and her message are both examples of what I'd like to see more of in the music industry. Comfort music, is what I think of it as. I pop it in and it makes me feel good. Some of the songs lyrical content may be a little passé, rather stale... and sometimes hard to listen to when that guy is giving his little rap off on a few of the tracks... yeah, that, in particular, starts to become annoying. Music is also very solid on most tracks, although there are a few that rely to much on musical clichés to get them through to the ending. Overall, I really do enjoy the majority of this album and hope that, every once in a while, JLH keeps giving us some more of the same..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jennifer Love Hewitt is HOT!!!!!!!!!","review":"I think this cd was very good, she has an excellant voice and a face to back it up. I am very anxious to hear her next album or see her next movie. Good Luck Jennifer!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"When I listen to this CD I stick to two songs, #3 & #8. I find that out of all of the songs these are the only ones that give a glimpse of Hewitt's talent. I find that the rest of the songs are a product of bad production and poor writing. Ms. Hewitt can definitely sing, but what she really needs is a strong team to help make her tallent shine. I gave the CD 2 stars, one for each song I like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Success!","review":"Having all of Jennifer's cds, i must say that this one is the best of the four.

Her other albums didn't do very well but I think that this one could be the break that she has been looking for. Newly signed to Jive Records, home of Nick Carter, Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears, Jennifer has matured into the singer/songwriter that we have been waiting for.I am glad that her single is doing fairly well and hope that her album does the same. This album blends new sounds with songs and sounds that have been heard before. When people say that the music of today lacks some sort of substence then they can just lieten to this album. Filled with heart and soul, it should propel her to where she deserves to be, sitting alongside the other J. Lo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I think this is a terrible cd.

Instead I found myself reading about what a flop the whole thing turned out to be and how insensitive and greedy the Europeans were towards the proud, virtuous and vastly superior-from-a-cultural-standpoint Arabs who happened to be in the place where the ditch was dug. The author doesn't conceal his indifference for the engineering aspects of the canal and is far too eager to show off his knowledge of Middle Eastern culture, of which his relentlessly reverential view is just too PC for me!

Not only to the teacher this is patently clear, but especially students who read a chapter by Perkins and then go over the same topic by Brown, Guthrie, Witherington or Kümmel. The student will immediately find (s)he's been reading assumptions, positions and ideas that are not motivated, but simply based on traditional general pictures.

If you're hoping for dry journalism, don't look here. This book is an intimant and colorful read.I learned first hand what it might be like for me to be in Liberia, what I would see from my own US eyes.

This book is a compelling current events memoir about Liberia. Mr. Power's strives towards understanding not just contemporary Liberia, but West Africa as a whole. It's a fast-paced book that reads like a novel. For example, the book explores what having enough \\"really\\" means. The Liberians have too little. They lack food, water, shelter, and security; the things Westerners take for granted. The writing style holds interest and the subject, Liberia and Mr. Power's first-hand account of his experiences is captivating. For those visiting West Africa, this book is truly significant. Mr. Powers did the world justice by sharing his experiences.

That sounded interesting to me. People on the east coast are obsessed with the past and record collections. This band is part of the mod revival. It's about the fifth time they have revived that corpse. The A-Sides have played with some of my favorite bands like British Sea Power, Adam Green, and Enon. Every song is a quality tune here. The band's name sounds like a novelty. Let's hope that they stick around. Songs like \\"Everybody Knows The Way\\" are classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average but enjoyable","review":"As a fan of Philadelphia pop music I gave the a-sides a try. It is well produced....sonically, but lacks any particular distinction or direction. It sounds to me like a bunch of kids who listen to the Beatles way too often. Sometimes young bands will almost bypass the grueling process of finding their own voice and leap right into trying to make records they're clearly not ready for. The A-sides are a band of potential but need to look themselves in the mirror and figure out how they can use their talents in a NEW and unique way.

Unfortunately for this world, he probably had to suffer to make a long lasting impact. True greatness rarily comes to those of us who contribute daily to the ENHANCEMENT of life and young Dawid is proof of this. His sometimes yielding but never breaking spirit of joy and hopeful speculation makes him a true hero. While his tragic, and \\"all too early\\" death are sad, the important things left behind in his words are timeless. He reminds us all that no matter how (supposedly) bad things get in our (truly) rich lives, a thing such as maniacal tyranny and slavery can never be tolerated. The light at the end of Dawid's tunnel never came to him, but by his words and actions hopefully we will all see that inspiration and determination will also glow."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've seen her as a patient","review":"I can't comment on the DVD because I don't have it, but I have visited Dell-Marie in person. I'd been suffering from Knee and back issues and she's the only one who sorted out my knee. Yes, my knee. Given how important posture is for your limbs to have a strong base to work from, improving my posture improved my knee. I also do her exercises regularly because I sit a lot (Medical student) and I find if I don't do her exercises I get a sore lower back.The added burning calories is a bonus. Essentially humans are meant to move - continually. With all the sitting we do nowadays we don't even resist gravity anymore.

I am a big fan of Douglass' work, though. I read the first installment in the \\"Carrier\\" series in which an American spy ship is captured off the coast of North Korea. Needless to say, I was hooked. Sadly, \\"Battleground\\" is nowhere near as good as Carrier. The action scenes are boring and become quickly repetitive. None of the characters are particularly interesting either. I found the action derivative of the standard action movie cliche in which the bad guys can't shoot to save their lives but the good guys score a hit every time. I was sorely dissapointed in the book and am glad I got out of the library for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and emotional","review":"One of the best in the series. As a reader I enjoy the series very much as do all fans. This book has action as the SEALs try to defend the US holdings on Kenyan soil but what I thought was the most moving was the end.

Keith Douglass has gone from being an author I never heard of, to my favourite (that's right I am Canadian, so I did not make a spelling mistake)author! I am just praying he writes many more in the series. I am not going to give any of the book away, so all I will tell you is buy it!!!! It is a very exciting book!

There are alot of guessing work on how much water to use even though it came with a small cup to measure the water.

It is impossible to figure out the right amount of water to use because it is inconsistent from one time to the next. I will finally think I have it figured out and then the bottle will come out either too hot or too cold the next time. I bought this product to try to save time but it usually ends up taking even longer. Either the bottle comes out too cold and I have to warm it up longer (and constantly check it to make sure it doesn't get too hot)or it comes out too hot and I have to cool it down.

I purchased this warmer because I liked the idea of storing the bottles in my bedrrom opposed to having to go downstairs in the middle of the night to retrieve a bottle from the fridge, but the warmer is ineffective.The warmer is built to carry an ice pack and two bottles in its cooler. The idea is when the baby wakes in the middle of the night you can just go to the warmer, pull out a bottle from its cooler, add water to the warmer, and warm the bottle. The thing is, the bottle does not warm effectively. I was using the bottles with the bags. The bottles took so long to heat. Then the warmer would cut off and my bottle would still be cold. So I would have to run to the bathroom and place the bottle under the hot water faucet to continue heating."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This warmer heats the bottles well.

My wife and I have tried to experiment with it several times under exactly the same circumstances, with the bottle coming out at extrememly different temperatures each time. If the bottle is too hot, you have to cool it down (eliminating the time savings of having a bottle warmer), and if it doesn't heat it suffciently, the instructions state that you must wait 15 minutes to use the warmer again!

Also, the top to the little blue vial has broken off so we can store water in it. Finally, the bottom of the tray that the bottle sits in has completely broken off and I can't find any way to get a replacement for it.I have also let the bottle get too warm sometimes and have had to deal with my baby getting over a burnt mouth (i have tried cooling the bottle down but it takes forever and my son would much rather have a too warm bottle than wait).I do have one good comment.

I would preferr to warm the bottle in a pot than to put up with this thing. I thought maybe it's just me--my husband has a hard time as well,it's always too hot.

Each time we got a new warmer, the same thing happened. Twice, the little basket that holds the bottle burned and smelled up the room. Save yourself the trouble and don't use this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't like it","review":"There are two things I don't like about this bottle warmer. First, and most important, is the mechanism the warmer uses to determine how long the bottle will heat. You have to fill a tiny bottle with water. Once the water has been all steamed away, the warmer turns off. The problem is that by filing the water to the top of the little bottle you can heat an 8 ounce bottle (I assume. My son isn't eating that much yet). But if you need to warm less than 8 ounces, you have to guess at how much water to put in. If you don't put in enough and the milk is still cold, you're supposed to let the warmer cool 15 minutes before using it again Try telling that to a hungry baby! If you put in too much water, you then have to cool the milk which will be way too hot. The second thing I don't like about this bottle warmer is that the cooler compartment doesn't fit the Dr. Brown bottles we use (the bottles are too tall), so that is essentialy worthless to us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold milk every time!","review":"This product is overpriced for what it is suppose to do. I had to adjust the amount of water to use because it doesn't work as the directions state. I even tried warming up the bottle twice in a row. Still had cold milk. It did manage to heat up the outside of the bottle, but still having ice cold milk inside just wasted my time, especially when you have a screaming hungry baby!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't warm consistently","review":"This bottle warmer does not heat the bottles consistently. We always use the same bottles, always with 8 oz of formula, but sometimes the bottle heats to just the right temperature, while other times it is too cold or too hot. Also, the regular, 8-oz size Dr. Brown's bottles are too tall for the cooling unit. Although it works okay most of the time, don't waste your money on it. I am disappointed with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"Our experience was a combination of the other reviewers. We had to experiment with how much water to use, but we did figure it out easily. The auto shut off and night light were great, but eventually we found it easier to heat pre-made refrigerated bottles in the microwave, or make them fresh with powder and warm tap water (just shake and serve!). If you go the microwave route, experiment and you'll find the right time - ours was 22 seconds on 50% power (shake, test, and serve!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product but didnt use long","review":"The bottle warmer was one of the best things i received at the baby shower. I loved how it could keep the bottles cold during the night and then just pop it in the warmer and it warmed in just a couple of minutes.

The only bad thing is after two months when she stared sleeping through the night i never used it again but it was worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately it didn't work for me","review":"I am very happy with the cooler part, it is very convenient. As for the warmer part, I can't use it at all. Before I purchased it, I read some of the reviews (most of them were 4-5 stars) including manufacturer's review which said that you can warm any kind of bottle in this warmer. Well, \\"any\\" didn't work. I use Dr.Brown bottles (which are AWESOME by the way), and I can't warm them in this warmer. I tried all possible water adjustments, nothing worked. So I gave up trying, and went with \\"grandma's way\\" of putting bottle in a mug and under the running hot water. But I'll say it again, cooler is very useful, especially if you don't want to run downstairs in the middle of the night to get that bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!

The night light was a nice added feature, but we only wished it was brighter."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better options","review":"We tried every bottle warmer on the market and truth be told, they all worked inconsistently. We struggled night after night to get the bottles right until we figured out THE EASIEST way to do bottles of formula.We stopped using liquid formula, that needed to be chilled and then warmed, and instead went with powder. Here is what we did:- Measure out your powdered formula into a formula keeper.- Fill your bottles with the proper amount of water.- When the baby wakes up just open the bottle top, pour in the powder and stir it with a formula stir.Easy... Easy... Easy!!Bottles can be served room temperature and you never have to worry about burning the formula, burning your baby, waiting for formula to cool, formula spills, etc.It worked amazingly well for us and I wish we had done it from the beginning!!As for breastmilk, that's a different story but for formula feeders, this is the only way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good and bad points","review":"the good points: it is convenient for nighttime feedings with the cooler and water containers. saves you from trips to the kitchen.the bad points: 1) heating element was not always consistant. once, i feel asleep waiting for the bottle to warm (the baby had gone back to sleep) and the heating element did not turn off. and the bottle was boiling!). 2) it always made the bottles leak from the nipple, and then the milk would burn on the heating element and the smell was awful, especially early in the morning. and it was annoying to clean. 3) i wish the cooler would lock into the unit so that you would use the cooler handle to carry the whole item. i only used it for less than two months.all in all, i would not purchase this item again. i would recommend using a good bottle warmer and just use a cooler you already have to store bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy at all!!!","review":"The cooling unit does not keep two bottles cold enough for eight hours.

Also, the auto shut off feature is best I liked since I tend to forget things when I am half asleep. :-)Good buy - whether it is a gift or a buy - worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this item","review":"While I found having a bottle warmer in our 2nd floor nursery to be invaluable, this particular one is not the one to buy. We only used the heating component as we had a mini fridge (tabletop size) for bottles for our twins. THe problem is that it has no way to alter the amount of water depending on the amount of milk you want to heat up. As a result, it is very easy to overheat the milk and that is incredibly frustrating after you have been bouncing your baby while waiting to heat up the milk. The amount of water in the little container is only sufficient for an 8 oz bottle and my kids still don't drink 8 oz at one time at 5 months of age nor do they need bottles at night anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"cyndi's dance classic","review":"this is probably cyndi's best dance single till her new album comes out. what makes this a great dance cd is cyndi's great voice and freestyle/house/dance king producer tony moran does a fantastic job on tm all mix.Tonys mixers are alot better than junior vasquez which seem alittle slow.Hopefully on her new album ,with her maxi singles, she lets tony do some more superior mixes.If she does maybe she will win a grammy for best dance artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for moderate beginners","review":"I ordered this book after learning a few basic stiches and making a few moderately difficult projects with help from an instructor. I give this book a great rating because it has given me an abundance of ideas for various projects. However there are a few drawbacks: one is the illustrations of creating a stitch aren't quite clear (in any book for that matter) and a beginner may need someone to actually demonstrate a stitch in order to fully understand the descriptions and illustrations; secondly, some of the abbreviations do not seem universal to other pattern books I have, thus causing confusion. On the other hand though, some of the other explanations and illustrations are easy to understand. Overall, I think it's a great book; I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't remember why I bought this...","review":"But now I'm glad I did, I can be a little more creative in my rare knitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"NICE\\" selection!!!","review":"Am VERY pleased with the detailed color photos of the stitches and patterns!!! The thing that MOST impresses me is that each stitch patternshown GIVES the multiple. (Example: multiple of 9 + 5). More times then not, you rarely find this listed on patterns in books, magazines, web sites, etc. I find it extremely useful when listed, in the event you may want to lenghten, shorten, enlarge or make smaller. It just makes it soooo much easier to ADAPT a pattern instead of guessing - \\"how to?\\".Absolutely love the book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference for both experienced and inexperienced knitters","review":"Lots of great pattern stitches for knitters. My 16 year old daughter (moderate experience) and I (very experienced) have enjoyed using this book. The instructions are easy to follow, the illustrations are good. The only complaint I have is that I like to copy the instructions on my printer/scanner/copier to make working easier and the oversized book makes it hard to print some of the instructions on a single page. We've used some of the stitches to make afghans, placemats, and bags. Looking forward to getting some of the other books from this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive Compilation but...","review":"240 different uniform illustrations \\"a la\\" Osprey, very impressive and very well rendered but... only a handful of combat/fighting uniforms.so if you are looking for equipment references this will leave a sour taste in your mouth, considering the book go for $80 or so used nowadays...On the other hand 80 bucks for 240 color plates, definitely puts away the slim ospreys ( no comparison on the historical, references, thorough detailing, additional pictures and complete background though...)so if you're looking for fancy officers' parade uniforms, evening tuxedos, german red cross volunteers, nurses, female auxiliaries, youth and SA brown shirts, coal miners surveyers, railway police officers and other obscur female auxiliaries, this is the book for you.If you're looking for paratroopers' camouflage patterns and eastern front grenadiers' reversible snow jacket, then this is the wrong book, stick with osprey.book is tiny too. paperback is 5x7."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one up for now.","review":"The bulk of most self-published books, aka vanity press, end up being given away to friends, neighbors and, perhaps in this case, to potential clients. The book is simple, easy-to-read and well written, basically a primer. It is, however, a rather tedious rehash of the literature on asset allocation available free from various web sites.I've read most of the asset allocation books available from Amazon. This book pales in comparison to Bernstein, Swedroe and Gibson in both style and content. If you have unlimited funds and time, certainly add Frush to your collection. But before you do that, select any of the above mentioned well-known authors for more interesting in-depth coverage of asset allocation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere for an introduction to Asset Allocation","review":"Mr.Frush writes well and offers a cursory introduction to the fundamentals of asset allocation. A condensed version of these 243 pages might have lent itself nicely to a five-page article in one of the national monthly financial magazines.If you are really serious about asset allocation start with William Bernstein's \\"The Intelligent Asset Allocator\\" or his \\"The Four Pillars of Investing\\". Then, go on line and Google ASSET ALLOCATION for a host of wonderful free informative websites. Several present model portfolios illustrating weightings among all subclasses, i.e., large cap value, international small growth, midcap blend, etc. In my opinion, the weighting of the asset classes is the prime determinant of portfolio performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I would have found this book earlier !!!","review":"Many of us have heard of asset allocation and know that it is a good thing but very few of us know how to go about optimizing our portfolio.

The information is worthwhile, there just is not an abundance of it and it is more of a coffee-table book. The writing style is great, much like we would expect from WSJ. The personal notes are entertaining and not overdone, all the while being informative. I did not get a sense of the authors being snobs, as others have noted. I found it informative about the variety of wine types and good wineries to watch for. Enjoyable reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book to get started on wine with ...","review":"I saw John and Dorothy on Martha Stewart, and after watching them for 10 minutes decided to try their book.

It doesn't matter, my end result is the same. When I am finished, the paper stays put. (That was my main concern before trying this product.) I own two different sized Xyrons and keep them both busy.

Every time my baby drops them, they start to leak from the loosening caused by the often minor jolt (I removed the handles, but still have the same result). When he drinks out of them, they squirt water up his nose, he doesn't like this. They leak in the diaper bag from loosening when lightly jostled. I have sections of floor that have been damaged by huge puddles left by these cups when I didn't notice a slow leak after baby left them on the floor. A fine product in the upright position for babies who do not drop or throw things and who do not mind water squirted into eyes and up the nose.Just to clarify, the leaking is not at the sippy spout, it is at the point where the cup is screwed together, the spout works fine (I also have 6 of them, all of them leak). I have replaced all of my Avent sippy cups with Tommee Tippee and we really like those. I bought Avent because they are made in England and we liked their pacifiers, but this product is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"We both hate these cups","review":"My daughter has several different brands of sippy cups and these are her least favorite. She seems like she might have difficulty drinking from them, but I'm not sure. What I do know is that almost every time she takes a drink, liquid spits out the air vent hole and shoots her in the nose. It's a little funny at first, but she hates it.And I don't like the nipples/spouts. According to another review here, you can take off the rubbery valve for cleaning, but I haven't figure out how to do that, it just seemed like it would break. The only way I can get them to dry inside is to put something in there to prop the valve open. And the once white nipples are now stained orange by her carrots/sweet potatoes/peaches so they always look dirty.The cap was a nice feature, but it broke.Overall, we like some of her other cups much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"An amazing film.

I loved the first Total Recall and this having the benefit of the current CGI technology should have been awesome. It did have good special effects, but the story line and action scenes ended up getting really unbelievable and pretty absurd.

I couldn't have been more disappointed as the entire plot of the movie was changed. That being said... Even if this movie carried a completely different title the plot was so weak that it seemed like a bunch of pointless action tied together with bad dialogue.

Bryan Cranston played his char well but the rest of the actors didn't seem to have very good direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Transformers","review":"This was just awful, nothing but one long action scene with a plot that couldn't interest me or keep me awake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watching a Drunk Rape victim attack a guy","review":"would be a more emotional and entertaining than this movie. The original is SO much better. This film has a different story line and should have had a different title.

However, I was glad it wasn't a complete mimic of the original. However, sometimes it's better to leave one enough alone.

That being said, this film was more like a Philip K.

I'm not sure Jesus could have made it through that many close calls. And speaking of Jesus, why oh why, do writer's feel the need to break the fourth commandment every couple minutes?

Well, it may be just that but it's not different enough from a hundred other modern action films to make it entertaining enough. The cast doesn't measure up to the original - nor does the environment. Mars made the original a real sci-fi film whereas this could take place anywhere on Earth. Here, this could be any one of a hundred different films and you couldn't tell the difference. Sure the effects are better than the original but not enough to win an Oscar like the original did. It's sad to see how easily entertained people have become in the last 20 years. Farrell doesn't have anywhere near Arnold's presence, who was surprisingly good in the first one. Plus he had the physical build to make it much more believable that he could take on big opponents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony and UltraViolet horrible combination!!","review":"I like iTunes, everything in one place, nice and simple.

It definitely kept my interest. The problem was that I felt like I was walking down the hall in Jr. High. The main characters seemed to know only two words: the a-word and the s-word (okay 3--I think the F bomb was dropped). When the use of such words is redundant, it sounds like they have an IQ of a mosquito. These guys are supposed to be incredibly intelligent operatives. Their language made it unbelievable.

As much as I would have liked that, it simply was not meant to be.However, this film is highly entertaining (despite the cast, most of which I can't stand normally) and well acted, edited, directed, etc.I put a special emphasis on the special effects. They are highly interesting to look at, well done, and are almost a movie in themselves. I almost liked checking out the sci fibackgrounds as much as watching the onscreen action.

Both went dark after those displayed and nothing I tried would bring the movie up. My firmware on the player was up-to-date.

More power to her. And Farrell is well cast as the unwitting hero, he doesn't overdo it. Though the script calls for a few too many three-story falls where he just gets up, dusts off, and keeps running and rain-of-bullets-but -none-ever-hit-good-guys scenes it's still engaging and suspenseful.

It's hard to top Schwarzenegger in an action role, after all. But this one did it well. They updated the story line and actually made it a little less far-fetched which makes the plot more accessible. I was relieved that the modern, computer graphics did not become the star of the movie which all too often happens today. Not that it isn't entertaining but this story had some human soul to it and that would have been lost.All in all it's a grand attempt and well done. I enjoyed it although I still love the original, utterly far-fetched story line of the original. By the way, if you have seen the original, watch for scenes that are an homage to that flick.

Not sure why they bothered to do a remake -- it was all computerized action scenes that I find boring and hard to follow, with the characters taking and shaking off blows that should have killed them as if they were cartoon characters, a plot that made no sense (going through the core of the earth?

I place the blame about 60% on director and 40% on the writers. The first 1/2 of the movie is a senseless sequence of chase scenes and you don't even have to watch them because the pounding drums will start and irritate you until you have a 30 second break before the next chase scene. Then the writers cut some of the layers in the identity crisis Quad/Houser is facing in such a way that it makes you believe they have no understanding of the PK Dick Story. And finally, the city Quad/Houser wanders through is simply taken from Blade Runner. They didn't even change the endless rain or the oriental voice making announcements for the city. Poorly remade movie trying to seduce you with action when then content was the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"Wow...this movie was horrible. If you have seen the original with Arnold, odds are you're going to hate this one with a passion. For one, they never leave Earth...which totally destroys a major portion of the movie.

They do practically nothing to build the characters' personalities, and then the rest of the movie is them running and fighting. It's well shot, the acting isn't horrible, the faces/bodies are beautiful, and the special effects are spectacular. But because I didn't feel attached any of these characters, I was bored after the first ten minutes. It felt like a chore to finish it, but was hoping it would get better.

Someone asks me to describe this movie and I would say a whole lot of fight and chase scenes against a blizzard like backdrop of forgettable CGI scenery and eye candy amidst characters and a story I didn't care about for a second. Another glitzy remake with a screenplay written by a marketing matrix that would get a D from a community college freshman writing class.

Of course, I started being worried when I saw that Collin Farrel was starring in it, as he has an habit of acting in massive flops...Unfortunately, my gut feel got proven right. While I believe that anybody who has not seen the 90's version might find this movie entertaining, it remains very flat.Do not get me wrong, I am not one of these nostalgic people who simply believe that \\"it was better before\\", and I am sure the old movie has aged poorly, but I have to say that in this case, I can only miss the humour, the 2nd degree of the previous movie...This one is just a simple entertainment: no emotion, difficult to get attached to any character...

Action sequences, overdone CGI, and (at times) a screen so overloaded with visual effects you could almost get a headache, this version takes everything that brought emotional connection to the original and tosses it into the trash can - in favor of a plotline that somehow is both lame and ludicrous at the same time (seriously, Cohaagen's reason for doing what he's doing in this version could NOT be more of a yawn!). Really, really awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless Action, Very Little Story","review":"If you're looking for even as much plot as the original, forget it -- the movie moves from one action scene to another without enough (almost any) time devoted to the plot.

I guess they wanted to make the female characters stronger, and maximize screen time for the high-dollar female actors. And really? Colin Farrel as a super spy?

This means no watching via your AppleTV or Android/Other bases TV streaming device, unless you can get the Flixster app. This also requires a UltraViolet account, a Sony Pictures account, and a Flixster account. If you are like me and prefer digital copies, then AVOID this product and grab it on iTunes, Xbox, or PlayStore, etc. This was a very sad attempt at Sony for trying to make the consumer buy another copy of the movie.

Even though the pace was fast and the action non stop, I found myself wanting to fast forward this movie to potential scenes I was familiar with when I watched and enjoyed the first Total Recall back in 1990.

I really wasn't as impressed as I wanted to be, the acting really wasn't all that great, well that's not fair the acting from these actor's is always awesome but the screen play just wasn't what I thought it would be.

The exposition is complete and very clear, including a lot of optional material for the curious. A detailed introduction to Functional Analysis is also included. Those needing the infamous Radon-Nikodym theorem and theory of signed measures will need to skip around since this is presented in the very last chapter (not a big problem). Also, consult the authors' companion text Problems in Real Analysis, which could be very useful to those preparing for a qualifying exam in analysis at the PhD level. Overall, a highly recommend text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Coverage plus a wealth of problems","review":"Finished reading those undergraduate analysis books that made a study of metric spaces look like a tall order? Well then reading this book would be an excellent continuation of the hard work. The book is largely about the Lebesgue theory of integration, but includes a very thorough coverage of the theory of metric and topological spaces in the first two chapters. Chapters 3,4 and 5 are the heart of the book covering measure theory, the Lebesgue integral and some topics from introductory functional analysis like theory of operators and Banach spaces. Chapters 6 and 7, covering Hibert spaces, the Radon Nikodym theorem and the Riesz Representation Theorem among other things, are the most useful for someone like me who wants to master higher analysis in order to read financial mathematics. And what's more, there is a solutions book providing answers to all 609 problems (spread over 7 chapters!) and more. All in all, the authors have made a great contribution!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Mediocre Contents, Terrible Aesthetics","review":"I was very disappointed in this book and judging from the steady decline of the resale price here on amazon.com, I can see others agree.First of all the book looks like it was photocopied in someone's basement - the text is completely faded out and paper feels terrible. For almost $100, I expect a little more.The actual contents of the book are not much better. I found Royden (the required text for our class) to be very sparse and was hoping for something to fill in the details. This book did little to help. It covers integration in a rather idiosyncratic way, devotes little time to differentiation, and says nothing about convexity.If you are looking for a good anaysis book I recommend either \\"Lebesgue Integration on Euclidean Space\\" by Frank Jones or the slightly more abstract \\"Real and Functional Analysis\\" by Serge Lange"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great paint, easy to work with","review":"My fireplace doors needed some TLC, I was going to use a normal silver spray paint. Came across the black hi temp paint at the local DIY store, but they did not have the silver high temp.

Practice first the motions, press the nozzle outside the painted area and bring the running spray into the object, apply paint in steady motions, thin coats. The fireplace doors I was painting took 3 thin coats, ~2hours apart, although it dries quite fast (15 minutes) to touch. One coat would suffice. I used no primer, just washed the doors with the soap, dried and then lightly sanded the surfaces. One coat already hidden everything and the surfaces looked good.

I went to see him perform, and was blown away by the power of the piece. I think it's a fantastic study of human reaction to a tragic event, and of a town struggling to come to terms with the fact that it's identity will forever be formed by that event. I was amazed by the reflective nature of people's statements to the interviewers, and by the interviewers own thoughts interspersed throughout the project.Loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"thoroughly depressing ...","review":"This film, which is really just a series of re-enacted interviews, is a dismal portrayal of a community in agony. It's natural when someone you know dies to feel sad, miserable, angry and outraged. But the producers of this film dwell on the community's misery and suffering, and any opportunity to learn from this crime is lost in the raw emotions of the town's residents.This is, quite simply, a film with an agenda. It is intended to incite anger and promote hate crime legislation. Dwelling on this crime is not going to do anyone any good."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exploitative movie with an agenda","review":"To me, the worst thing that a movie can be is \\"exploitative.\\" This film is exploitative because it takes advantage of a sad, tragic situation and twists that situation to further the ultra-lefist agenda of the hollywood elite. The murder of Matthew Shepard was disgusting, despicable, and hateful. Rather than addressing the murder as such, this film compartmentalizes everyone involved as either \\"enlightened\\" (i.e. the New York people, the gays) or hateful \\"bumpkins\\" (i.e. the people of Wyoming, churchgoers) and this is very condescending! Polarizing films such as this do not teach lessons, succeed in changing closed minds, or provoke strong emotions from the viewers because it is too obsorbed in furthering the agenda of the filmmakers and actors while subverting the true message and power of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaching about tolerance","review":"This play created the perfect base for teaching tolerance and social justice at the high school level.

I recently viewed it for my Sociology class. It was very onesided, however I agreed with every aspect. I am not a homosexual but I am a supporter. I hope it opened up some people's minds. Basically it was about a group of people who went around interviewing people who were associated with Matthew Shephard. Their intentions were to make a play. It went through the whole story, and you learned about the people. However keep in mind that Laramie, Wyoming is depicted as a \\"hick\\" run down town.

In fact, it's really just a bunch of interviews. And interviews with actors portraying the original people that lived in this town. So, really, it's just a made-up documentary.That understood, it was well done. It looked real, the actors did a great job. I don't remember hearing about this true-life incident, so I wasn't swept up in the emotion, nor was I really interested in the event.I would have liked this movie a whole lot more if it was NOT a documentary, but a re-enactment of the whole incident, from the Shepard boy's life and home and at school, to the murder, to the aftermath. THEN, the interviews could have had some meaning.I watched it. I sat through the whole thing.

My further research found they come from the early to mid 70s. Perhaps completists will find this of interest, but those wanting the \\"Queen of Rock\\" will be disapointed. The tracks from Gloria Gaynor are more in line with what she is famous for. However, two key songs \\"I Will Survive\\" and \\"Never Can Say Goodbye\\" are heavily synthesized remakes, not even close to the originals' musical energy.

Unix Unleashed by Robin Burk has proven to be an indispensable guide to many of the different flavors of UNIX (I also use Linux, which is discussed here in great detail).My only complaint is that it doesn't refer directly to Mac OSX in any way... but this doesn't come as a surprise, since the OS is so new that there are no comprehensive books available for it. Despite this shortcoming, the book is well laid out, with references to networking, system administration, maintenance tasks, and just about everything else you could imagine (whew!).

I feel that even though the cups do leak out of the little hole in the top (\\" a vent?\\") of the green nipple and also out of the cap area, it is very little and only seems to be from lying down. My sons absolutely LOVES these \\"zippy cups\\". I can't say enough about the durability and comfort, as well as fun colors. Extremely well made, in my opinion, I have never felt that these cups are leaching plastic byproducts, even when left in the sun. Never makes what is inside smell bad due to the plastic. Despite the many parts, I have only had positive experiences with all of the Avent design cups. They wash up easily with an Avent brush, or in the dishwasher. The handles are great, and the different nipple designs are great for the maturing mouth. Definitely recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Valves are super tough to remove for cleaning!","review":"Great bottles when used with nipples, terrible design with the sippy cup attachment. Valves are super tough to remove for cleaning, and they always are being cleaned. I recommend the First Years Clean & Simple, valve free! sippy cups. They don't offer them on Babies R Us online but the do have them in the store. They have them in 3 sizes , with handles and they don't leak! EVER! When making the purchase do it right the first time. Not like me 4 sets later :o("},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah! He likes it!","review":"Finally. We bought just about every kind of sippy cup on the market. Hard tops, soft tops, short, tall, you name it, we've got it. And they are currently being stored. He loved this cup. Finally, I got him to drink out of a cup. Something about the flatness of the nipple and the fact that it is soft, but not too soft and longer than most. My little man drank out of it immediately. Hopefully, before too long, he'll be getting his juice himself! Ha Ha! We had a little problem with the Avent bottles leaking, but so far, we haven't had a problem with this cup leaking. I was a little cautious about that when I purchased this one. Because of the bottle leakage, I double check everything before I hand it over. I hate to clean and don't need any more cleaning jobs added. My advice, try this cup. It worked wonders for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I read all the Amazon reviews but still decided to go with the Avent sippy cup since I had relatively good experiences with the Avent bottles. Unfortunately, leaking is a real problem with these cups. Not only does the milk seem to pour out of the sides no matter how well I try to fasten the lid, but it does not flow easily for my son when he sips. He ends up with a mouth full of milk. So much for my efforts to get him to start using a cup. I orginally used Playtex and he liked that well enough. I only switched because the Playtex valve was hard to clean and easy to tear. Now, after wasting money on Avent, I'll go back to Playtex and hopefully my son will be willing to give sippy cups another try. I don't usually write Amazon reviews but I figured it was worth it in this case to save someone else the trouble. Unless you want milk EVERYWHERE, I would definitely avoid these cups."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't feel Magical when cleaning the leaks up..........","review":"I am so disappointed by another Avent product that is just no good. Short term or long term these cups are not worth anything since they leak. My son's cups have leaked on him, on the floor, in his diaper bag and in the car. I don't understand why anyone if they say they have leaked would give this product anything but 1 star. Mom's have enough too do---running around cleaning after leaky, unreliable products is not fun especially for the price of the Avent Magic Cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant Leaking","review":"I too thought that since we had such great luck with Avent bottles, that we would love their \\"magic\\" cups.

I'm sad to have to give Avent a bad rating, but don't waste your money on these cups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"These are great. They work as described and are easy to assemble, disassemble and clean. I highly recommend AVENT bottles, it is all we use.The only reason this did not receive a 5 star is because I was not given the option to select the color.

Not being able to pick the color, I was hoping that I would've received a gender neutral color."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by a few good reviews","review":"These are a waste of money. They leak after the baby removes the cup from the mouth and soaks the clothes they are wearing. They do not leak when inverted making you think all is well. It is only after it is removed from the mouth. I called customer service and they were rude. They claim the cup is designed to expel any leftover liquid in the spout the baby does not drink. Someone please tell me how to explain to my baby how it should drink every drop in the spout. Yeah, right. These cups are the worst and customer service sucks. No rebate or refundat all."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are the worst!","review":"Avent makes the best washable baby bottles around, so we felt that their sippy cups would be just as good. Well we were wrong. Of the five cups we had, all of them leaked and have since been thrown out. The cups are five different pieces vs other brands that use three pieces, which makes them harder to wash, harder to put together, and more pieces to lose. As far as sippy cups go, these are among the most expensive you can buy and worst that we used out five different brands. We have had great luck with Greber's and Playtex's. Please avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst sippy cup I have tried","review":"I have a 13 1/2 month old daughter, and so far I have loved every Avent baby product I have tried.These sippy cups, however, were very disappointing and I am upset I wasted my money.My daughter is a sippy cup pro (Nuby, Munchkin, Playtex, and Born Free cups all work for her) yet she has difficulty drinking out of this cup and has to tip it straight up into the air and suck hard just to get any fluid out whatsoever. Don't believe me? You try it! I certainly did. And the top part does LEAK. And yes, I have read the assembly instructions.There are superior products out there. Avent, you need a product redesign. Other parents, don't waste your money. I would recommend Nuby, Born Free or Munchkin instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Had A Leak!","review":"I will first admit that there are additional parts to these cups that need to be washed, but since we used Dr. Brown's bottles, I was used to a few pieces.The soft spout on these cups is great, and made transitioning to a cup SO easy for us. My son hasn't taken a bottle since his first birthday, and never missed them a bit. There are two levels of spouts, one harder one softer. I've tried other soft spout brands, but have had leaking from the collars. Avent cups NEVER leak as long as the valves are inserted correctly. Our little guy will use any brand or spout type, but these are his favorite and nice on sore gums.I really recommend these cups despite the extra valve pieces (which I simply pop in the dishwasher in a basket). You'll never have spills on your sofa or carpet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many pieces","review":"I bought this cup for my 7 month old son because the description says the child doesn't have to suck as hard for the water, juice etc. to come out. The first thing I didn't like was all the pieces - the cup, the handles, the ring, the spout, and two different disc inserts --- TOO MANY. Also he had a hard time drinking from it because the spout is so different from any other cups I'd given him. I let my 2 year old daughter try them and she didn't like the spout either. I guess if you first introduce this cup and nothing else then your child may do well. But if they are used to the other rounder kind they probably won't like this one. Not to mention all the pieces that can get lost!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leak Leak Leak Leak!!","review":"These leak all over the place. When looking at the top of the cup, I have noticed that ours leak from around the rubberized circle part that inserts into the hard plastic screw on lid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Cups","review":"I specifically bought these cups to use as a transition from bottle to sippy cup. Avent advertises them as such. The \\"sippy\\" piece is interchangeable with all Avent nipples. Great idea! Start with the nipple, switch to \\"sippy\\" when Baby gets the hang of it. Here's the trouble. The caps don't tighten enough with the nipple in place. This causes two problems. The handles spin, making it tough for little hands to control the cup, and liquid leaks from around the nipple and the base of the cap. Very disappointing.The cups may become more useful as Baby gets a little older."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky","review":"I love Avent bottles, so I just went with these sippy cups out of brand loyalty. Thank goodness we only got two. One good thing is I think they are easy to clean. Now the bad stuff: They leak, as many others have commented, all the time. I only put water in it at this point, but it is still irritating to have a wet diaper bag whether it is water or juice or milk. The lid to cover the sippy part is really hard to get off. Also, the hole, which is probably a valve to get air in the sippy cup, is faulty in some way. My son always has water that spits up at him through that little hole. And if he drops it, tons of liquid comes out. Every kid drops stuff off of their high chair, so to not account for that in a sippy cup design isn't good. What are other options that have worked for people?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Bottles","review":"These bottles were great for the first several (6 or so) months, until they started leaking. If you do not tighten them just right, milk pours out of the sides of the screw on lid. If you tighten it just right, milk still seeps out through the air vent on the top. So annoying and MESSY! I would NOT recommend these nor will I buy more. [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing magical about these cups","review":"These cups leak like crazy! I took pictures of them leaking. I will be uploading them into amazon's product picture page, we'll see if it's approved. There is a hole at the base of the nozzle, right where it meets the colored plastic. I don't know why the hole is there, but all of the cups have this design flaw. Don't waste your money on these cups. They are cute, but they leak and make a terrible mess.

Some young children find the spout easier than other sippies, and we used it as a transition sippy before switching over to the Playtex model.They will leak, but hardly in floods if our experience is any indication. The BIGGEST drawback is that they are a real *pain* to clean. Very difficult to clean by hand (take something else on vacation!) and not all that convenient even when you do have a dishwasher at hand. There are just so many parts!Plus the handle and the ring thingie don't fit into our bottle washing dishwasher basket.Two stars.

The author claims to have spent time with a group of tech entrepreuners in the Washington D.C. area during and after the internet bubble. There is some really rich material here, but the book is poorly written. There is no flow and there are abrupt transitions and it is not always clear when the incidents she is relating actually happen, because they are not always in chrononological order, unnecessarily confusing the reader.A terrible job of writing compounded by some very poor editing. If you are looking for insights on hwo these men made and lost fortunes, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rich Canvas, Sparse Drawing","review":"As a DC area resident, I was excited about reading this book. It does have a number of interesting stories and anecdotes, but the book as a whole lacks flow and detail.

Also, you'll find that there is little insight into the title--\\"how the masters of the internet universe rode the rise and fall of the greatest boom in history\\"--you'll learn little about what they did on the way up or on the way down. The book makes it clear that Ms. Henry was an observer and not a confidant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing we haven't seen before.","review":"I found this book limited; the author was handed opportunity for deep insight in an increasingly relevant topic and missed the opportunity entirely.

However upon further listening, this has become one of my favorite Townshend albums. With 3 songs originally recorded by The Who, redone in Townshend's personal style, many songs devoted to his guru and mentor, Meher Baba, which sets the motif for this album, are all well-written with highly in-depth lyrics and meanings, as well as a few songs that reflect Townshend's hard-to-catch humor, make this album a must for Who and Townshend listeners as well as those looking for songs with a homely feel as well as containing deep meaning. Recommended favorites: \\"Pure and Easy\\", \\"Let's See Action\\", \\"Sheraton Gibson\\", \\"Parvardigar\\", \\"The Seeker\\", \\"Sleeping Dog\\", and \\"The Love Man\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pete Climbs The Mountain","review":"The best Pete Townshend solo album. Gives some hints of the scope of the Lifehouse project. Pure and Easy is worth the price of admission alone. A very uplifting CD. Unfortunately, his later songwriting work after Who Are You or Empty Glass has not reached this caliber. This is a major work that gets lost among the other major Who albums of its time but matches up quite well with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Came First","review":"If you are a fan of the Who, you may agree that some of the original songs that appeared on the old vinyl LP are probably some of Pete Townshend's best material. According to interviews I've read, Pete was at a crossroads in his life, and spent some time with the late Mehr Baba.

My long, thick hair is dry in the first place, so typical shampoos yield a stripped/frayed/frizzed look and it takes a lot of compensating conditioners, etc., to overcome that.Thanks to the lack of sulfates in this product, my hair is much more tamed and soothed when I use this, and I require far fewer post-shampoo products to achieve a nice look.While I am beating up on sulfates, they also strip out hair color. This product is very kind to both hair and hair color.One final note: this particular shampoo seems to lather better than other sulfate-free formulas, including others by Avalon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might as well put baby oil on your head and call it clean","review":"I USED to like this product but hadn't used it in a year or two.

I expected that it wouldn't lather much, but it wasn't very easy to spread through my hair. I rinsed it really well until my hair \\"squeaked\\", but when it was dry YIKES it looked like it was mega dirty and lifeless. As though I hadn't washed it in days and it felt like it too. There was a greasy residue. I was SO disappointed I felt the need to rewash it to fix it and even after using another shampoo, it still wasn't 100% clean.

Also, don't buy it from eSavvy -- they shipped it to me in a padded envelope, and the top partly opened inside the package, dumping about two ounces of shampoo.

So Avalon's Lavender shampoo was the first thing I tried.For the first few days, it was wonderful. Smelled heavenly. My skin cleared right up! But by day 4, my hair had started looking dull, and two weeks in, I had a visible buildup on my brush as well as my hair.I had to do some amazing things to get the accumilated gunk off of my hair. And I had to switch to Giovanni's Non SLS products which immediately I noticed, do not leave a build up.So my two stars are for the beautiful scent and the fact that Avalon has other really fantastic products.

The documentaries abound in really touching moments, especially when the people involved in the projects describe how challenging it was, sometimes from a personal point of view (divorces, not seeing the kids grow,...) and how they were relieved when things worked according to expectations.

Women sewed these gloves together and the seam had to be 1/32 of an inch part from each other n order for them to function. That is amazing to see the precision needed for a single set of gloves.

We have tried so hard to conform behavior because that was the urged, in-my-face issue, but that wasn't the real issue. Tedd Tripp reminds us of the real issue: the heart. We must be constantly mindful that we are after their heart, especially their heart for God. Behavior is only a symptom of what is going on in the heart, yet so often we only change behavior, and the heart gets left in the same state.

I was so disgusted when I got to the spanking chapter, I do not buy into the claim that I am required by Scripture to spank my children. Of course Christ wants us to discipline our children and teach them to obey. However, this book just reinforced our belief in not hitting our children. We manage to discipline our children without fear, humiliation, and physical pain. And our children respect authority, boundaries, and are well-behaved children who want to obeyus and honor the Lord.

The reference to parenting teenagers was spot-on. Now, with regard to spanking, if you follow Dr. Tripp's process and spank out of consequence (not out of anger or emotional reaction), then it is relevant and appropriate. Spanking has become so controversial in our society, yet, it does require consideration as effective punishment. For some children, they naturally want to please, and spanking is not appropriate. For others, it takes spanking to bring them into alignment with what God wants in each of us, which is loving obedience.

There are many statements in the Bible especially the Old Testament that we could take literally, but for me, this is one that I will choose not to take literally. Just as I do not believe a man should hit his wife for doing wrong, I certainly don't believe we should hit our children for doing wrong in order to \\"teach\\" them something.

As a result diapers should be removed and children should be whipped on the bear bottom as soon as they do something you don't like, crying, exploring their enviroment etc. This is a dangerous book that encourages parents to distance themselves from their children, to ignore their inner voice and beat the tar out of their babies in the name of God!!! And to tell their children from infancy they're being beaten because God orders their parents to beat them. So much for a loving God.The author knows his actions are wrong and encourages parents to conduct these beating in private to avoid being arrested and put in prison for child abuse!!!

From beginning to end it is full of practical advice and very solid biblical backing.Those who fear the Rod clearly had their Spirits wounded and their wills left intact as children, but those who employ these biblical methods will break their child's will but not wound their spirit, leaving you with a child ready to be molded into God's best for him or her.

How parents can be a positive influence on a child's spiritual development.2. Balanced view of parental authority.3. Considering your parenting goals.4. Types of communication.5. Different stages of child development.6. Training procedures for different stages.7.

He talks about spanking his then 8-month old child for wanting to pull himself up on a bookshelf to stand after he was told not to. 8 MONTHS! I believe in spanking, when appropriate, but this is ridiculous. What kind of cruel SOB spanks an 8 month old???

I just think there is more of a balance in parenting. I wouldn't reccommend this book. There are better Christian approaches that are more loving without being too permissive. sure, we are responsible to God to train our kids to respect and obey Him, but I sure am not going to say that God wants me to discipline by spanking.

The \\"rod\\" in the Bible is meant like the staff of a shepherd, to lead and to guide, not to beat a baby! The rod is also a metaphor for the Word of God, i.e. the scriptures.He doesn't just casually mention spanking either, he goes on and on and on.

Or does it say that Solomon's parenting left a bit to be desired?This book is based primarily on one snippet from the Old Testament - spare the rod, spoil the child - and ignores all that we've learned about child development since Solomon's time.It's difficult to imagine in what setting Christ would support the author's demand that faithful parents must inflict physical pain on very young children (8 months is the number Mr Tripp mentions) Pass on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is Not True Christian Teachings","review":"The people that advocate hitting children in the name of our Lord seem to have forgotton there is a New Testament. We are supposed to discipline and correct our children, these are teaching methods...hitting is violence. Jesus came to teach us a kinder, gentler way and He would NEVER hit a child. The only reason people resort to hitting is because that's what they have been taught by uninformed, uneducated in the true way people or because they simply don't know what else to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly Biblical parenting book","review":"If you're looking for ways to simply make your child do what you want them to do, this book isn't for you. Unlike most results-oriented parenting books out there, SACH shows you how to parent in a way that honors God, and develops your thinking in a way that helps you apply Scriptural truths to your interactions with your kids. Is your goal to have children who behave outwardly, but are still sinners at heart, like the Pharisees? Or is your goal in parenting to be a spiritual leader who has the courage to parent the Biblical way, regardless of societies norms and values? If it's the latter, then I'd definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Parenting Advice with Christian Principles","review":"My wife and I have found this book to be very good.

I hold a Master's degree and have never been to therapy. I love my parents and respect and value their opinions. I have never doubted one day in my life that they loved me and wanted the very best for my life.Most of the one-star reviews seem to be from those who have been adamantly taught that spanking is out of the question. If they complaim about beng spanked as a child it is probably because there was not a love relationship in the discipline but rather anger expressed in fury. That is far from what Dr. Tripp is calling for in the book. Even Berkley did a study a few years ago that demonstrated that spakings did not harm children.I loved the book and I reccomend it to every parent I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"The book was in good condition.

I am a Christian who does believe in spanking, but only when all other forms of discipline have failed. The \\"rod\\" in the Bible does not necessarily mean \\"something to spank your child with.\\" I've always thought of it as another word for discipline or correction. Tripp advocates spanking an 8 month old baby. If you do this, all your child will know is that Mommy(or Daddy) hurts her. I agree with other reviewers that spanking for every offense is a lazy way to parent. I do not agree with their outrage over children being sinful from conception. That is clearly stated in the Bible a number of times. If you are looking for good ideas on correcting your children, I suggest you check out \\"Creative Correction\\" by Lisa Whelchel. She has a lot of good, non-violent, ways to shepherd your child's heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the answer","review":"I am a Christian Mom, who felt mislead by the title of this book.

I don't believe Jesus wanted parents to hit their babies!

Just call yourself \\"God's agent\\" and voila! Your sick desires are sanctified. You'll feel less guilt for abusing infants, after all they're only \\"fools\\" with \\"wicked attitudes\\". According to Tripp, babies are \\"wayward and sinful\\" even in the womb! At least he advocates waiting until they're born to start smacking them.Control-freaks will also love this book. It will help you get children to obey instantly like little Nazis to gratify your need for power.

I have started running a list of companies that do not ship to APO. Most are due to not supporting military, some are due to not knowing what it is. Target is right at the top of my list of knowing.

Reading the other reviews, I'm not sure if people were reviewing the starfish float or the flower float. Regardless, the \\"flower\\" part does not provide any shade and even in a light breeze flies backward, which was a nuisance and overall made the float a hazard. We ended up deflating that part of the float the first day, and then my husband cut the flower off entirely. My 6 month old could barely see above the sides of the float and was uncomfortable in it.

It has violence, sex, and bizarre plot turns that keep you interested, as well as a historical look at circuses, post Civil War America, and 1860's Europe, a continent on the brink of its own war (the Franco-Prussian War).Although not quite as rich historically as Aztec, the series is much longer and covers more territory, so it's my personal favorite.

The problem is in the basic design that this adapter will almost \\"pull apart\\" and not stay very solid at full extension. It almost feels like it will snap apart when fully extended and loaded with the bike on the hitch. I can't use it with my bike, but it does work with my kids bikes which are much smaller.

It's very easy to use and attach to the bike, and seems very solid structurally. It is an absolute must have if you have a bike with an other then standard top tube. And since so many mountain bikes these days do, it essentially becomes a must have if you have a mountain bike. As well, if your cables run along the bottom of your top tube, you avoid having them pushed up against your bike and scratching the frame, not to mention stretching and then not shifting right, which they would do if you hung it from the top tube. The red ends of the device are coated with a rubbery material so they don't scratch your bike. I use this device with the Yakima Swingdaddy Rack, and its a win-win combination. I would recommend both items to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but not ideal","review":"I bought this for my Trek step through bike and I don't like that the bike just sits on the bar. The bike was at an odd angle on the rack and front tire hung very low. I am going to try one of the spring loaded ones so the bike isn't at an angle and so I can mount it higher on the rack. It was also expensive for what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not safe for trunk mounted rack","review":"I used this in conjunction with the Yakima KingJoe. This adapter does the job of making a crossbeam for mounting purposes; however, it does not hold the bike enough to keep it from swaying.When this was used on my girlfriend's hybrid bike, the crossbeam was not at the right angle, making it the front tires 3 inches from the pavement when mounted on the KingJoe. When getting off my driveway, the tire would rub the driveway. I would assume all crossbeams will have this issue though.

I probably should have gotten a regular width. After wearing these to work after only a few weeks I started developing sharp pains in my heels. I switched out to an old pair of work sneakers and the pain went away. Went back to the Saucony and the pain started again.

I wanted an excellent walking shoe with the maximum in cushioning in the forefoot because I have neuromas. I was willing to order them on line because I've always loved Saucony shoes. These are terribly bulky -- which I would put up with -- and they cut in to my ankle bone -- which could be fixed. What's really bad about them is that the heel is wide and sloppy on the inside, while the heel base is soft and bouncy but not stabilizing. After wearing them for a long walk, I ended up with a hip joint injury. Of course, I can't be absolutely sure the injury resulted from the shoes. But it seems to me these aren't well designed and aren't up to Saucony standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this walker!","review":"I bought this shoe mainly because Consumer Reports rated it at the top of their ratings.

I am twelve years old, and I could not put the book down, and neither could my Mom. Just start reading it, and you will not stop! An excellent Christian book. This book tells about a young Christian lady that feels called to China to be a missionary. One of the most exciting parts of the book is when she is stuck in Russia and she has to find a way out or she will work in a machine factory all her life. Another exciting part is when her train stops in the middle of a battle field! Incredible is the part where she is running from Japaneese soldiers; also when they bombed her village. Wow!

Frank Snepp's \\"Decent Interval\\" and David Butler's \\"The Fall of Saigon\\" are both far superior to this almost fictional account. This book reminds me of a modern action movie. It is written for twelve-year olds who want to see lots of special effects, but no substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I had a lot of problems with the book. It looks like the writer did a bunch of interviews and then wrote the book and guessed at the spelling of Vietnamese names. Most of the book seems to be recreated conversations that we are suppose to believe were repeated word-for-word as they were spoken in 1975. Very tedious reading that including things such as what type of sandwich a Marine was eating when an alleged verbatim conversation is detailed, along with the color of the soda can and that a female State Department employee took one of the Marine's potato chips during the conversation. Most of it is like reading a screen play instead of what is supposed to be \\"The True Story of the US Marines Last Days in Vietnam.\\" With so many errors regarding the names, among other things, I developed doubts about the accuracy of everything in the book.

(Personally, I'd rather be fat than go without cookies for the rest of my life.)

I started to get the feeling that I was pointing out to her that she was in some way so different from everyone else. I felt like the book lost it's purpose in that it made differences seem so prominent instead of portraying that we are all the same but unique in our own ways.

I couldn't put it down. My favorite race are the elves. I was a wonderful mixture of real life and fantasy life. Or so I thought. There are many funny bits, most of them were in the beggining but there were still some funny bits during the whole book. It is about friendship, courage and a bad guy. You have to read it!

This delightful book written in rhyme teaches just that to younger children while they fall in love with Guido, the young rat who loves to guide his gondola for tourists. Students love books with rhyme and rhythm. I loved these books, bought them for my library and shared them with over 400 students! My primary students were thrilled with the books! Many of the children bought this book after hearing the charming story. The pictures are captivating. Kudos to Renee Riva and Steve Bjorkman. We also love her other book, Izzy the Lizzy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MY FAVORITE CHILDREN'S BOOK!!!","review":"OK, I must admit, I am a HUGE fan of this author's books. I have been following Ms. Riva's writings for some time now and \\"Guido's Gondola\\" is one of my favorites! The story is totally delightful. It's clever rhymed writing moves right along and you can't help but fall in love with Guido as you turn each page to see how this cute little rat is going to handle his little \\"problem\\".

Hall describes categories of communication which can be used to compare any two cultures. He discusses not only conversation but a number of non-verbal communication areas, with good illustrative scenarios, for the variety of attitudes toward personal space, use of time, interaction with authorities and the law, etc. His ideas seem congruent with Marshall McLuhan's famous concept of \\"the medium as the message.\\" For me, --as a very verbal person, an artist, and a world traveler-- this book provided new and useful insights about inter- and intracultural communication. It is clearly organized, well written, fascinating, and as relevant to today's global communication as when it was written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This book talks too much about past culture life. I was hoping it would have more on how to read body language.

Illustrations often end up separated from the text describing them, but far worse the grey box breakouts are almost unreadable!!! The scans of the text in the gray boxes are harder to read than the captcha phrases websites use to verify that you're human! On top of that the illustrations were scanned at a low enough resolution that they are rough to look at. They're generally functional, but way harder to read. If you're thinking about this book, I'd avoid the ebook version sadly.So far the content of the book has been like a college text book. Not great to read but does a decent enough job of getting the point across."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's full of nudity and sex, yet I was still bored","review":"Conversations were painfully dragged out.

My son thinks these things are the BEST and I have to use these as the incentive for taking other vitamins.:-)Glad to find these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Much Welcome Return!","review":"This book, the 3rd in the Wilderness series, was an extremely welcome return of both the characters and Donati's style and form showcased in the 1st book, but absent in the 2nd. In my opinion, of course. The characters are now back on US soil which makes for a better read. In Dawn on A Distant Shore, most of the story takes place on the high seas and in Scottland which had the characters out of their element. In, Lake in The Clouds, Donati returns readers to Paradise, NY, and many of the original secondary characters reappear. Much of this tale focuses on Hannah Bonner, her medical education, and her journey into womanhood. Hawkeye, Nathiel and Elizabeth Bonner play a major role in the plot surrounding Curiosity Freeman and her family. The pace is fast, filled with danger, villains, and intrigue. Although I was disappointed in the fate of a particular character, Liam Kirby, I was satisfied with the conclusion. This book is a must read for Donati/Wilderness fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-written, complex novel that held my interest","review":"Though I know this was the third in her series, it was the first one I've read, and I LOVED it. For me, it was accurate enough historically, regarding people's views of other people. I'm afraid I just could not become attatched to characters who looked down on others because of their ethnicity, etc. And if I don't care about the characters, the story won't interest me. It seemed to me that the \\"heroes\\" of this story tend to demonstrate many qualities to which we should all aspire; treating people fairly, whether we agree with their morals or not.I found the story itself to be extrememly interesting and diverting. It was so wonderfully complex I don't even have the words to describe it, although I have been known to compare it to the novels of Pat Conroy, another favorite author of mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little slower than Books 1 and 2 but still a good read.","review":"I loved the first two books in this series. I really dig a good historical fiction. (Finding Donati sent me to Gabaldon).Though I did enjoy this 3rd book in the series, I felt it was a little slower moving.This book deals more with Nathaniel and Elizabeth's daughter, Hannah, and her journey into womanhood. It covers her doctoring skills, her bravery in helping slaves find their way to freedom, and it leads us to her finding the love of her life.I have to say the ending was really good and that's why I ended up giving this book 4 stars. I'm now going to need to purchase the next book to see what happens in Hannah's new life and with the Bonner's at Lake in the Clouds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilderness seriies","review":"Order of a book completed and I am very pleased with item and with order amount , condition of book. , and promptness of order"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected Better","review":"I hope this isn't the last book in the series because it leaves way too many loose ends. I also felt kind of mislead by the book jacket and other reviews. A relationship that I thought would take center stage gets the short shrift and a character that I had no emotional investment in shows up in the last sixth of the book and is rushed into a romance which I felt was forced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great read","review":"This is the third in the series by Sara Donati. All three are excellant books and she follows the story line extremely well from the beginning of the series. Having lived and grown up in the area in which the story takes place, I am familiar with locales, etc. Very well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up","review":"I've tried to make myself like this series but I just can't continue. I find these books long-winded and boring...a bad combination. I never quit on a book but I'm not even half way through this one & I'm calling it quits. The story just isn't worth the time, no matter how you cut it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"As with all of the prevous books in the \\"Wilderness\\" series, I could hardly wait to read this book and had difficulty putting it down. I find myself thinking of the characters almost as family members by this time. Sara Donati is an outstanding author and I love the fact that I am learning so much actual history along with enjoying a great story. I am currently reading the last book in the series, \\"The Endless Forest\\" and already I'm dreading the fact that I won't be reading any more about the Bonner clan and all their adventures, challenges and loves. I highly recommend this entire series to all who enjoy a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lake in the Clouds","review":"The book arrived even before it was due in very good condition. This is a series of 6 books and this one my local library did not have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of 4.5 Stars","review":"Sara Donati has written a great sequel here to Into the Wilderness and On A Distant Shore, worthy of 4.5 stars. Her writing ability carries this book and is pleasure to read. There are no shocking events here, the story simply and beautifully advances the Bonner saga forward. The climax is nicely constructed as Hannah must make a decision on the direction her future heads. The love story for this strong and independent character is nicely developed and builds anticipation for the reader. The author has done a nice job of making us like the next generation that is to follow. Fans of historical romance like the Outlander series will thoroughly enjoy Donati's writing and her characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"I have really enjoyed the first two books in this series but I didn't like this one. I found myself feeling like I just wanted to get through it to the next one. I appreciate that these books have a pretty good authentic look at that time period but I just found all of it together depressing. I was also let down a bit by Hannah's story line. The situation with Liam felt like it didn't have enough closure and as much as I liked Strikes the Sky I felt like she should have been with Liam. I feel like any relationship she has will pale in comparison to what she could have had with him. This is probably just me, but that's how I felt. I also missed Nathanial and Elizabeth's in this book. I like the idea of getting to know new characters but I missed their presence. I will read the rest of the series and hope that they are a little more like the first two books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not as good as the first","review":"I did enjoy this book very much although I didn't find it as intriguing as the first. Still very complex and love the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Wonderful read!","review":"Sara Donati has a way with words, settings, and characters that will not let you go. This is one book you will not put down--and will reread many times. Historical fiction is a challenge, and Sara Donati has risen to it. Her dramatiazation of the problems of slavery, immigration, and poverty in the early 19th century is the way historical fiction is supposed to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lake in the Clouds","review":"Loved this one! It was good to have the Bonners back in America and to follow the steps of Hannah as she grows into womanhood. What a strong independent young woman she has turned out to be. Sara Donati is one of today's most brilliant historical fiction novelists."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great read!","review":"After waiting for so long for this new book in the Wilderness series to be published, I was very happy that Lake In The Clouds lived up to the standards of Donati's other books in this series. I was a little bit concerned at first that the book shifted so much away from Elizabeth and Nathaniel and onto Hannah, but by the end I could see that this was a great way for the author to go.I thought the time lapse of 8 years, from when Dawn on a Distant Shore ended to Lake In The Clouds beginning, was really good, because it let characters grow older, or pass on, and new characters be introduced.I also thought from a historical perspective that the main story of slaves being helped to escape to freedom, was good as it gave a feel to the sort of time these people were living in.All in all I thought this was an excellent third book and will read it again many times, while waiting for the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissenting opinion","review":"Although vivid, most of the essays in this book are far too short to address the complexities of each different personality. Beschloss's essay is the best; Morris', Caro's, and McCullough's good but inferior to their respective biographies of Reagan, Johnson and Truman. Goodwin's essay doesn't add much, and the editors get docked a star by choosing Benjamin Bradlee - of all people - to review Richard Nixon. A more impartial person and Nixon biographer (Stephen Ambrose? Tom Wicker?) would have been more appropriate. I think you are better off simply getting the biographies of Reagan, LBJ, Truman, and Clinton by Morris, Caro, McCullough, and Maraniss, respectively."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brief, but solid overview of the Presidency.....","review":"While most of the material in this thin volume will be familiar to history buffs and scholars of the Presidency, the contributions by the various authors make for a good read. The piece on Reagan by Edmund Morris was especially good, given that it attempts to penetrate the mystery of Reagan's charming, yet frustratingly aloof, personality. While it doesn't break any new ground, the book is worth reading to review material that might have fallen out of favor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent textbook for students and researchers","review":"A vast, detailed summary of the latest advances in tissue engineering."},{"rating":"1","title":"One sided","review":"The book is mistitled as 'Principles' since it does not really do justice to the foundations of the field.

This is one of the finest novels published as part of TSR's Ravenloft line, and Larissa Snowmane is one of the most memorable figures created for the setting.I liked Christie Golden's take on Souragne and Anton Misroi so much that when it came time for to rework the Ravenloft game setting for 'Domains of Dread' that I made sure the land was reshaped to be closer to the novel than it had been in previous presentation.If you have an interest in dark fantasy or the gothic horror genre, track down a copy of this book. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't believed I liked this book and feel like less of a man","review":"Call me sappy but I kind of liked this cajun-seasoned bodice ripper.

Overall, very pleased with this set!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Very Cheaply Made","review":"I wasn't expecting the highest quality set for the price, but I was excepting the pieces to at least fit into the box it came in. As soon as I opened the box, half the parts fell out (including the knife!) and most of them wouldn't lock into their placement in the box. Also, each of the pieces is very cheap and feels like they will break. And one thing they do not show you in the photos is the ridiculous packaging this set comes in. The box is almost humorous, like it's a joke set. I originally bought this as a gift and will be returning it instead because I am too embarrassed to give this to someone.

Highly recommend for early stage reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best children's book ever!","review":"We checked this out for my daughter when she was 15-18 months from the local library. Not only are the photos bright and easy to read, there are only one or two alphabet letters per page with a few items also beginning with the letter. The rhyme is rhythmic and fun to read. My daughter would point to the letter \\"R\\" which begins her name and say \\"rough and rocky R!\\" (a line from the rhyme)We purchase this book often as a gift for one year olds. It holds their attention, takes little time to read, and the last page is all the alphabet letters side-by-side. They broke the four lines up to follow the \\"a-b-c\\" song easily. This book is well thought out and worth every cent.I've only purchased the board book as I put this book in the hands of the earliest readers.

The first workout I did was the INTERVAL one and I was sorely disappointed. The workout is 20 minutes long and the first 10 minutes of the workout are all knee lifts. Nothing but knee lifts for about 10 minutes. Then when they introduced the first \\"interval\\" I barely noticed because my heart rate didn't even go up. It was more knee lifts which are very damaging to the tendons.Secondly, I did the other cardio workout on the DVD and it was stale, stale, stale kickboxing. You know, jab, hook, uppercut. Again my heart rate barely went up.I wish I could return this DVD and next time I see a SHAPE DVD I will rent it from the library and then consider buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"So disappointed in this video that I even contacted the company. This is a re-mix of a lot of other Shape exercise videos. The arm section for example is just a remix of Mari Winsor Pilates. The pictures on the back totally misrepresent the sections as there is no exerise that includes hand weights as the photo suggests. Dont waste your time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radical, but worth reading","review":"I read this book for an introductory Hawaiian Studies class, and my first thought was to try and find some of whatever the author was smoking. In general, Trask is much too radical for my tastes. But she makes lots of very good points. I was shocked to see her accusing Gawan Daws of racism. I checked the passage she referred to in Shoals of Time, and sure enough, I could see that the paragraph was definitely racially insensitive. This is a book that really makes you think about things you've lived with in Hawai\`i all your life and never really noticed. Trask may be a wingnut, but you should read her book anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Argument for Sovereignty","review":"Trask takes a racial point of view in this book, denouncing Western Civilization and the white \\"Haoles\\" who brought it to \\"her\\" island. Although pointing out legitimate claims of past oppression of the Hawaiian people, Trask fails to find any realistic conclusion, arguing for succession and violence. Her arguments utilizing western law and the UN are clumsy at best and are simply ridiculous to any political scholar. As far as I'm concerned this hateful book deserves the same shelf as \\"Birth of a Nation.\\" If you're looking for a well-reasoned argument for greater Hawaiian rights, this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good one after all","review":"I love classic guitar.So I tried this one.

It is also a fun way to demonstrate how humpbacks dive showing the underside of their fluke so they can be identified (each whale has a unique pattern of black and white).

The point that many scientists believe \\"Someone\\" created our faces is ignored."},{"rating":"2","title":"UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS...","review":"This is a thoroughly enjoyable work of historical fiction, based upon the Bellamy family featured in the seminal British television series, \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\". This well-researched book artfully details the story of the Bellamy family, who once lived at 165 Eaton Place in the tony Belgravia section of London.The story begins with Richard Bellamy, a young diplomat who, during the course of an assignment, meets the young and beautiful Lady Marjorie, and is smitten. He then embarks upon a course of conduct that effectively ends his diplomatic career but ultimately wins him the heart and hand of Lady Marjorie. The author details their lives, the lives of their children, James and Elizabeth, as well as that of their loyal servants, Hudson and Mrs. Bridges.This upstairs, downstairs story is a sweeping saga of a family that was so much a part of English history. Set against a backdrop of historical events, this book will appeal to those who enjoy well-written historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I have used it on a couple pedals and it has got the job done, no problems. I have used it with an ARION Stereo Flanger guitar pedal, the ZOOM 505 Guitar Multi Effects Processor, and the IBANEZ TS7 Tubescreamer with Tone-Lok. It works fine all of those, so it should work fine on all other 9 volt adapter requiring guitar pedals."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better places to start for serious beginners","review":"This book, while well-intentioned, is not the best guide for a new woodworker. Somehow the authors lost sight of their target audience (I mean, why call it \\"for serious beginners\\" if you're not going to present your material for that group?). A better book by far, whether you are a beginner or more experienced in woodworking, is The Complete Manual of Woodworking by Albert Jackson, et al. Jackson's book is twice as big, has many more illustrations, many more resources for virtually the same money. And it will always be there, with reference material and good solid guidance. This book has a few projects but really does not deliver on helping the beginner, serious or not, become more adept at woodworking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the experienced beginner","review":"This is a great source when one is concerned about choosing the right, necessary and useful equipment. It is easy to read and right to the fundamental information. Nonetheless, I find the book should do a better job regarding illustrations and photos. Another potential problem is that the projects in the second part of the book might be quite difficult even for serious beginners. Perhaps, the authors should have included a few inspirational (less demanding) projects besides those ones. Putting those few details aside, I thing I did well in buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful educational book","review":"This is a wonderful educational book, where the child can actually create his/her own coat of arms using the stencils in the back.

It covers several aspects of heraldry (history, battlefield, heralds, tournaments, rules, positioning, meaning of designs etc.) without being overwhelming for children. I have used this book with my art therapy students, and my sister has used it with her students with art class...all the students loved it. Even those who can't read can get alot from the book as illustrations are excellent. I highly recommend. Ages 6-adult...I have even used this book to design a shield for myself. For those interested in other sources...Heraldic Design by Hubert Allcock is also a great sourcebook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too basic and outdated","review":"When the description says \\"beginner\\", it means it.

I did not use the CD that came with it and followed the advice of temporarily connecting my router to adapter with an ethernet cable.

There is no firmware update available to make it so that it is compatible with WPA or WPA2 without completely removing its ability to work with the 360.So unless you are willing to switch your network to WEP encryption (a decision which depends on how paranoid you are for the most part), then you will have to purchase the one made by Microsoft or route your 360 through your laptop or PC (which is fairly easy to do)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Use for my Xbox 360.

Not exactly rocket science, people -- when Amazon pointed me to this item. It's been perfectly functional since I got it. The only hassle is:(1) I have to unplug the power cable when I want to turn it off, and(2) it only connects after I run the Test Connection utility after each power-up. (Settings panel > Network > Test XBox LIVE Connection) This may be because I've set my 360 with a static IP address locally, so I can forward the XBL ports to it on the router.But to get rid of the cable running down the hall to my PC, it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work with new wireless modems","review":"this product does support new security for wireless modems save your self the hasle and just order the new wireless addapter for xbox"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work with comcast cable","review":"I read reviews before purchasing this item so I did not load the software.

The threads do come together, again and again, in constructive ways to move the plot forward. I agree with the reviewer who mentioned unlikely coincidences; however, when cleverly woven, these incidents serve to surprise and enlighten the reader. There was only one plot line I had 100% figured out.I would give this novel 5 stars if Dibdin had provided less detail about Wm. Blake (OK, we got it the first or second time around) and had stopped introducing characters after the book was 7/8 finished. Dibdin exhibits intelligence and good character development, most obvious in the \\"Phil\\" perspective (first person).

This effort, however, is terrible. The main character is a naive dope who is totally unlikeable. You don't identify with him enough, or for that matter dislike him enough, to care about what happens to him. The plot is pedestrian and predictable. I wouldn't have finished it were it not such a short book.I'm truly surprised that this author, who has demonstrated the ability to write entertaining books, failed so completely this time around. This book regresses to the level of a first effort by an unskilled writer, simply imitating the conventions and plot devices of the genre...Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, terrible plot","review":"Dibdin is an excellent writer and his prose is even stronger in a genre (crime writing) not normally known for that quality. I'd almost recommend reading Dark Specter for that reason alone because there aren't any other reasons to read it.The plot, on the other hand, is contrived and more often than not predictable. Dibdin does a pathetic job convincing his reader of a number of unlikely coincidences that allow him to take an eery tale of cults in modern-day society and wrap everything up in a tidy Hollywood ending. Where the last line of the book should be one of the creepiest you've ever read, it's as unlikely and unbelievable as the rest of the novel because a number of key characters remain underdeveloped.Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've read a few Michael Dibdins lately because Ruth Rendell (aka Barbara Vine) recommends him.

And, of course, about every additional cliché ever done to death in women's fantasy. The connection between this story and the TNG crew is minimal; Picard and Co. are simply a pretext for introducing the premise, and beyond that Neason isn't interested in them.

I guess it was understandable because she was being abused but her loyalty to her abusive father was just sick! King almost gets her beaten to death and that is sooo UNFORGIVABLE in my eyes. I wish I never picked this book up! It made me cry because I was so angry and felt so sorry for Amelia. It wasn't a romance. It was a pity fest.

The members' voices gel very well together when they sing in chorus, and they can carry a tune like nobody's business. Some of the stuff on here is poppier and some is more ballad-like.

He too has a platform to stand on, but not for long he can almost touch bottom. My husband and I love it because its unique.

Now at almost 6 months he has figured out most of the buttons, using the radio the most. He pushed the buttons on the radio, immediately looks up and waits for someone to dance.The only drawback is thatit is not a walker. Now my son's legs are stronger he wants to stand all the time.

Ms. Rose will not let you down. I love how she sees Proust...and how others feel he \\"doesn't apply\\" and miss the point. How many times have we been told that some great writer is \\"passe\\" or \\"impossible\\" or just not trendy enough? (those who sneer may just feel unequal to the task of reading a particular author) Rose takes it slowly, she weaves Proust into her daily life. It is a brisk read, but I found myself stopping & sharing bits with others. I hope to re-tackle Proust soon! I have been inspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frank but not enlightening","review":"Having just read two wonderful Proust-haunted books (HOW PROUST CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE by Alan de Botton and DREAMS OF MY RUSSIAN SUMMERS by Andrei Makine), I thought to round off with Phyllis Rose's take on the magnetic author. What a disappointment! Where Proust convinces us of the ephemeral verities of life, Rose (a writer and critic here-to-fore admired) assures merely of the shallowness, the superficialities of a self-centered \\"literary\\" existence. Frank without being enlightening, quotidean to the point of banality, Rose shocks the reader by portraying in what seems an ungenerous if not viperous spirit all friends and loved ones but her mother, whose endurable qualities rise like cream to the top of the froth. Maybe what sets the teeth on edge are grammatical errors (I/me mistakes) in three early chapters and a late one. Still, one wonders why this author needed to publish, let alone write, a book so disadvantageous to herself and others."},{"rating":"1","title":"shallow, lazy and narcissistic memoir","review":"From Woolf to Dickens and Carlyle to a wonderful essay on Little Black Sambo's author to Josephine Baker, Phylis Rose's objects of consideration have always been profoundly significant. We used to read her books because they told us about the world. But now we learn only about Phyllis Rose's world, and it isn't the least bit appealing, or interesting or even revelatory. Rose has lost her way completely. Her early books expressed a kind of insight, albeit in a perpetually arrogant and smug tone, that is completely absent from this book. An author in search of a subject. Perhaps this is her last book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope!","review":"I have nothing to add to the other 1-star votes, other than the 1-star vote itself.The saving grace, I suppose, is that Rose herself provides a perfect example of the snobs Proust mocks repeatedly in ISOLT.

If so, it is not funny enough. (Learn from Proust!) If this really is an autobiography, it is surprising that an author would allow publication of something that makes her look so ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self indulgence masked by literary allusions","review":"I was so excited to purchase and read this book. I loved Rose's critical biography of Virginia Woolf and now her clarity and insights would be extended to her own life and to Proust. What a disappointment. Rose's candor is amazing, because it reveals a rather shallow and self-satisfied woman. Her use of Proust is quite minimal and superficial. I found no relationship between her life and writing and that of Proust's. Read Proust instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"you gotta be kidding","review":"What is the justification for this book?Look, I appreciate the fact that Phyllis Rose may come from a context where people who have negotiated the whole of Proust are scarce as hens' teeth, but that doesn't mean the rest of us do. Among my friends, at least, this achievement isn't so rare: none of us would have been so self-absorbed as to consider the feat book-worthy!Was Rose so taken with herself that this alone was reason for writing an entire book? Sheesh. At least Jacobs' chronicle of his supposedly reading the entire Britannica:The Know-It-All: One Man's Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the Worldwas memorably recorded, while Shea's muddling through the OEDReading the OED: One Man, One Year, 21,730 Pagesat least contained lots of amusement.

Lisiewski's magick isn't science.Lisiewski states that such a thing called \\"sling shot effect\\" occurs when one fails in evocation. Sling show effect is an effect where he claims that negative thing such as losing money and friendship occurs after receiving lumpsome of money from some source after a fail evocation took place. I personally do not know what kind of spirts he has been dealing with but such a thing as slingshot effect is bogus. The only reason negative thing occured to Lisieski is because of his own inherent balance of karma and the evocating the spirit was just a trigger to releasing his own karmic debt. So such a law as slingshot effect is not concrete.Lisewski also needs to be more flexible in his thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please pay attention to this review!","review":"I will start by saying that this book and his other books may have some merit (I bought all 3 of the practical books), but, why choose to inflate your book reviews by manipulating Amazon's system using \\"fake\\" customer profiles? If you read many of the reviews it is obvious. Would you trust a guy like that (regardless of whether or not the book is good)? Why would you need to do that if your \\"old system\\" of magic works? Also, the author provides instruction on magic to the tune of up to $1k plus per month. Be careful, he'll manipulate you in typical \\"guru\\" style. And, all the while draining you of your money.

However, on round two of studying his book, I decidedthat for what it is doing, which is advocating followinggrimoire methods and guidlines to the letter, to create aphysical evocation of an astral entity, it's really on themark. An open question, however, is what is meant in a logicalmanner, by physical evocation, as it relates to our humanessence. This would not be an open question if the great, and,for occult purposes, unknown tome by Kant called the Critique ofPure Reason was in the library of every occultist, becauseit answers and resolves this magickal debate completely.That being said, Ceremonial Magic, if followed as the authorhas written it, will lead the practicing occultist to fantasticand incredible experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much","review":"This book, in my opinion, does not have a lot to offer. Essentially it is an alleged 1655 edition of the Heptameron with detailed commentary on how to perform the ceremony.The chapters that come before contain a ridiculously stupid version of history leading up to the present time (which isn't surprising since most occult books have a ludicrous view of history); passioned and arrogant statements about how \\"Modern Era Magick\\" supposedly doesn't work because of the hippie mentality; lists of \\"axioms\\" the author deems to be true; the constant warning that the practitioner of magic needs to do everything EXACTLY as it appears in a magic grimore or it will fail/make the practioner sorry.Although some points Lisiewski points out I agree with, especially how lax modern practioners have become, there is so much other baggage in this book that it is difficult for me to recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power at a Price","review":"Does the \\"old style\\" magical system advocated by Lisiewski work? Yes, I can personally attest that it does. But is it worth it? I can also attest that it does not. This style of magical evocation requires pact-making, explicitly or implicitly, which rarely ends well for the magician. I suggest a much more spiritually balanced approach to evocation, such as that found in the work of Franz Bardon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Crazy Masterpiece","review":"This is yet another Chinese puzzle of a book with stories within stories within stories, reminiscent of Charles Maturin's Melmoth the Wanderer and just as crazy. A soldier who travels through a haunted land and spends the night romping with two lovely sisters and awakens with a rotting corpse on either side; Rosicrucians and the Wandering Jew and a whole spectrum of memorable characters and ghostly goings on--penned by a genius Polish Count and pioneering aeronaut who commited suicide with a silver bullet to the brain, this book is the mental equivalent of climbing rocks without a safety, or flipping 360's on a trail bike, or snow-boarding down a cliff--you've got to keep the mind sharp and keep balanced on the cusp of the page or you will wipe out badly!

It's not the prettiest thing in the world, but I actually get more skillet space out of the deal verses what I would get with traditional ranges that come with built-in wind blockers.

Very low heat (5,500 BTU max?) so things slowly stew/boil where I expect them to sizzle (in oil).2. Burners are too close to each other so I cannot use both burners simultaneously (unless I use small diameter pots).3. Things are a lot worse on a windy day - negligible heat (however the flames are not too weak in wind, thanks to a clever design).

Something akin to Mikhail Tal's My Life and Games.While its questionable that Jaan Ehlvest is a chess great, his book is a fascinating read. The narrative includes his various triumphs and some games but what is really engaging are personal anecdotes and the author's view on political climate, soviet chess schools etc.It was a revelation for example, about what really happens in those famed soviet youth camps.

I couldn't wait to see all of the Seasons 1 through 3. Although the end of Season 3 was extremely well done - (I cried, and I never cry!) it truly gutted the show.

In children raised with love, compassion, understanding and tolerance (something Plowman has neglected to consider), this gene does not express and children grow up with a greater sense of self, fairness and empathy.

Plowman's vicious teachings are about as far from the teachings of Jesus as you can possibly get. It goes without saying that she also rejects everything that modern science has discovered about the harmfulness of her methods, a rejection as ludicrious as dismissing what modern medicine has discovered about how to cure disease.

Having heard the magnificent Klaus Thunemann play Vivaldi's concertos with superior virtuosity, I'm inevitably going to compare him with Smith - and they don't compare. Smith's opening statement in the C major Concerto is vague and unconvincing. His intonation is variable and his technique is lacking in... well, technique. Baroque music demands a specific type of rhetoric and there is no evidence of his attention to this detail. It's disappointing, after reading the track list which promises to amuse, to be met by a type of playing that holds you at arms length. It appears that I am genuinely failing to recognise his appeal.

The bassoon is a magnificent solo instrument, and I strongly recommend the solo playing by Milan Turkovic, Otto Eifert, or Klaus Thunneman over that of Smith, if you are looking to learn more about the bassoon's solo repertoire.

It is a disgrace that there are so many GREAT players out there that don't make is because of POLITICS.

Utter rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few too many twists.....","review":"Having just read Tess Gerritsen's \\"Gravity\\", I picked up this book with a great deal of enthusiasm. The development of the characters in \\"Bloodstream\\" was very good, but the plot took a few too many turns at the end that made a good, plausible, fiction story a lttle too hard to beleive.Pass on this version of Tess Gerritsens's earlier efforts, and read her latest one: Gravity. That was superb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloodstream by Tess Gerritsen","review":"This book continues with the high appeal that the authors other books give. I am glued to the book until it is finished but the depressed to have it end. I have read all her books that kindle has. I wish there was more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining!","review":"Ms. Maxwell masterfully read this medical thriller/horror story. She read in such a way that it was easy to get caught up in the events of the story. The story was fast-paced. It moved along without ever bogging down. Tranquility Maine wasn't tranquil for long, that's for sure! A most satisfying story-well constructed and scary. This was my first book by Tess Gerritsen and I am looking forward to reading more of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teenage Angst in Maine...","review":"A doctor in a small town in Maine tries to figure out why all the teens are angry and violent, including her own son! All this, in the face of townspeople who don't like her. The answer lies not with youthful hormones but with a nasty heretofore unknown disease, that eats into the brain...OK if you've got nothing else to read on the plane, but the plot and writing style are very choppy, and the \\"detective\\" aspects either obvious or left as a total surprise at the end (and a surprise that is impossible to deduce from reading, much to my disappointment).Gravity was certainly better, as I've heard Harvest is as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written and fundamentally silly","review":"Familiar devices, cardboard characters and flat, insipid writing. Any reader with an ounce of sophistictaion is going to find this very tiresome fare indeed. These days, thank Heaven, you can find good thrillers (even the odd medical one) that are actually well written. This just isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mechanical, predictable & ultimately dull","review":"Ms Gerritsen just tries too hard. Nothing about this thriller really seems spontaneous or genuine. Everything is a device, a method. You feel you're being simply manipulated like a sap. Better writing and some sense of it all being real would help. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ban-gor, not Bang-er","review":"Anyone who has spent any time in Maine will quickly realize that the mispronunciation of Bangor is only one of the many ways that Bloodstream fails to accurately capture the essence of Maine. Combine that with the convoluted, highly unbelievable plot and subsequent resolution, and the unrealistic characters (Amelia, the 14-year-old girl from a dysfunctional family thinks and behaves like a well-adjusted adult) and this is one book I hope readers will skip. Maine deserves better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephen King must have insomnia.","review":"Found this book slow and have read better high school senior book reports. It was drawn out with a hurry up lets somehow end this book ending. Not my idea of aa all nighter. Went with Kings recommendation. He should stick to writing not reviewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started well, became incredible","review":"Sometimes writers create a very interesting scenario, but then are at a loss to explain it, so they conjure up all sorts of improbable explanations to try to tie ends up. Doesn't work. There are so may questionable aspects (SPOILER ALERT): first, unlikely the army will want a drug that only creates paranoia & mindless killing of people close to one! There are similar drugs that are hardly useful in combat situations. Trying to eradicate a worm!! Easier to take out a patent. And many other unsatisfactory explanations, even the writing becomes haphazard towards the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desperate","review":"Tess generally writes a goof story, this was as always well written but the underlying plot was so average maybe she should have let it pass. Admittedly Tess's style was good enough to finish the book. The ending was poor a good read that let you down.

I enjoyed it very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You're New To Tess Gerritsen...","review":"If you're new to Tess Gerritsen, as I am, (I usually read Robin Cook), don't make this one your first book of hers. I couldn't get through it myself. It is much too languidly paced, much too slow going. Every time I thought it was FINALLY going to start getting interesting and pick up steam, it slowed down again. I don't like real rollercoasters and I don't like figurative ones, either. (Ah, well. Not all of Robin Cook's books are winners, either. You can't hit a home run every time up.)Good thing, though, that I didn't give up on Tess because of BLOODSTREAM as I am now reading HARVEST which is a MUCH better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"RIVETTING, CATCHES THE READER OUT FREQUENTLTY.","review":"A MUST FOR TODAY'S TYPE OF GENERATION, FULL OF SUSPENSE AND SCARY DO YOU KNOW YOUR CHILDREN, WHERE THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE UP TO, THESE AND MANY ISSUES IN THIS BOOK ARE DRIVEN WITH MYSTERY AND SUSPENSE, THOUGHT PROVOKING AND CAPTURE THE ESSENCE OF THIS MAD WORLD WE ARE LIVING IN TODAY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too far out to believe","review":"Does not compare to the excellent Harvest. Although, I suppose, that it has medical credibility, the supposition that anything so far remotely possible as the \\"worm\\" infection that the story is based on in highly improbable. Bloodsteam reads like science fiction, although medical credence is given to the remote chance that such a thing could happen. Also it is very fragmented and scenes are not sequential adding to the confusion of the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloodstream: Fast, thrilling, and fun!","review":"I started reading medical thrillers a few years ago. I started with Michael Crichton, then onto Robin Cook and Michael Palmer. Tess Gerritsen has entered the rankings of a top medical thriller author. I love this book! The rural settings, the characters, and the plot come together for a riveting ride! I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't go in the water!","review":"Bloodstream is a stereotypical medical mystery with little suspense and facile plot solutions. The romance that develops between heroine MD Claire Elliot and the town's top cop is a shopworn plot device, and Claire has no trouble ignoring the inconvenience of his marriage. Claire's difficulties in establishing herself as the town's replacement for a beloved retired doctor, her own son's inevitable infection with the deadly parasite, and the ease with which only Claire identifies the real dangers threatening the town all combine to reduce any suspense that the story might have generated if presented less predictably. The conclusion is truly repulsive, unless you're a big fan of annelids, in which case, you'll love it!Tess Gerritsen has done much better - for a much more engrossing story, try The Surgeon, Vanish, or The Sinner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read her later books first","review":"This was the second book that I have read of the authors (after the readable Body Double) and I would strongly recommend that readers unfamiliar with Gerritsen (a talented writer) avoid this book and look at the later books.This novel centres around the events in a small Maine town where the local kids have started random acts of violence. The town doctor notices the acts and works out the correlation between the violence and the strange happenings at the local lake.I found that this was a poor mans Michael Crichton, made worse with the authors leaning towards adding the romance element into the book. It may be just me, but the book seemed written more like a movie script than a novel.A readable book if you can suspend disbelief."},{"rating":"2","title":"A PAGE TURNER","review":"This book was given to me by a big Tess Gerrtsen fan who said that I would really enjoy this book. Well I did. I had never read anything by this author and thought that I'd give it a try. I read the book between breaks at work and found myself really looking forward to getting back to it anytime that I had to put it down. I think most people would like the story. It is a story about teen-age kids going whacko in a small town and mysterious events that have happened similarily in the past. Its a page turner without a doubt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down, I've found a new author.","review":"I am a huge King, Koonze, Cook fan and she is a combination of all three with a new twist.

It is fast moving and keeps you guessing. I'm used to her Rezzolli and Isles series, which I love. This was a nice change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"I love books that are intelligent as well as exciting. This book is both. It is an exciting mystery with a scientific rather than a supernatural explanation."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of her better books","review":"While I myself have read several of her books, I now just got around to reading this one. It one of her best, the best still is(the surgeon) You should still read this one despite the tame love plot and the rushed ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves it and so do I","review":"I was skeptical to get her a walker but so glad that I purchased this. Not only is it a walker but also a great toy. She loves to put the objects through the slot that lights up and makes noise. There are also different shapes that you can put in the corresponding slots, but they don't trigger the same noise/lighting up which was kinda disappointing. My only other complaint is that the walker wheels do not swivel and I have to keep adjusting it so that she goes straight. Despite those 2 things, I still gave it 5 stars based on the value of the product. It's fairly cheap and has already amused her for hours and hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"This is a good product that consistently keeps my daughter entertained. Couple of issues though -1. It can be flipped over very easily. Not in a dangerous way though. It's light enough to not hurt the baby.2. There are some nice lights and sounds when a block is put into the round opening. But when a child puts say a triangle block into the correct shape (triangle) opening, there's no light/sound. There's less incentive to learn shape sorting. If chicco addresses this, it could be a GREAT product.My baby loves the front console so much, she pushes the walker in reverse sometimes, it's funny!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"This is the best! My son was 10 months when I got this. He was starting to stand alone. With this he began to walk. My son will soon be 2 in about 3 weeks and still likes to play with this. He likes how much noise it can make and I just love to watch him play.=] -Kim"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous for early walkers","review":"In my experience, children that are in the early stages of walking need something a little sturdier to hold onto. This doesn't offer enough traction (even with the \\"brakes\\" on) to make it a safe toy for getting comfortable on their feet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Option","review":"Not a bad walker but as a previous person mentioned, it tips forward very easily and the brakes don't do anything to stop the child. The activities in front are good, and my son likes playing with it that way but I don't really trust it as a walker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last long","review":"My daugther plays with this walker since she was able to sit (6 months) and she's now 1 1/2. The way she plays with it has changed and she finds new things to do with it. It was also very helful before she started walking because she would stroll with it all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulky and hard for baby to push around.","review":"My son barely used this toy.

The nano did not line up with the docking connector. I had to carve away the plastic guide on one side to get the item to work. The plastic cover does not slide over the nano well as a result (hinged only on one side). Everything else works great. The blue light on the transmitter looks cool at night.

After watching this DVD, I went out and bought her recipe book. The recipes she demonstrated were easy to follow and make. I put a small TV with a DVD player in the kitchen and followed along with her...pausing when I needed too. I have nothing but adulations for the recipes shown in the DVD as well as her book. They tasted great and have become part of my eating lifestyle. The DVD has helped me to come up with my own concotions as well making my being a raw foodist alot easier and fun. Her book has many other great tasting recipes which will expand your variety of eats. A great DVD to have, even if not going raw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top of the list","review":"I have purchased about 7 raw food DVDs. My top picks this one and Living on Live Food by Alissa Cohen. I like them equally well and would recommend both but I will tell you the differences between the two.1. This is great for 1 or 2 people2. These recipes are all very simple (the Alissa Cohen book has a few more gourmet recipes)3. This one speaks on traveling and staying raw4. This video is easier to use without the book than the Alissa Cohen oneOne thing I would say is that if you are starting off raw and do not want to or can not afford to invest in the high end juicer- wait. Go online to YouTube and find directions on using a high powered blender with a nut milk bag. Unfortunately neither of these videos demos that.The product description is very accurate and I do not think that you will be disappointed with this DVD. I re-watch it all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT investment into a better lifestyle","review":"This product is well worth it! I am at about 75-100% raw and use Jennifer's book, and DVD on a regular basis. It is easy, concise, and creates very delicious recipes- highly recommended. I have several raw cookbooks and this is probably my favorite. A must-have for anyone wanting to go raw, or just incorporate more raw, healthy food into your diet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent first book on raw foods","review":"This is an excellent introduction to a raw food diet. It is perfect for one or two people. This book contains clear and complete descriptions of equipment, staples, and how to shop. The recipes are easy to follow and are excellent.

Going to a dermatologist soon to see whats up. And in Jesus name I receive my clear face!! :DDJust saying though... everything ((except for the oil blotting clean and clear sheets-love that stuff)) from clean and clear doesn't work for me.

I usually use the clean&clear astringent for sensitive skin, but when I went to the store, they only had the deep-cleaning astringent. So I bought it, and when I put it on at night, I was horrified to find that it burned my skin. Not just a mild sting, but full-out, want-to-rip-my-face-off burn.

I have type 4 skin, with mixed complexion, and have had some form of acne since puberty. I find that it is most effective on my forehead, where the acne shows up mainly as clogged pores and whiteheads. Rather than a bumpy patch, my skin is now relatively smooth to the touch.I tried using it during the daytime, but now my use is only at night, before retiring to bed. As I have type 4 skin, there is no stinging sensation, just a cooling effect. It works; and I only wish that Johnson & Johnson had come out with this product when I was younger. It would have saved me, and many another person, much money and grief at the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful!","review":"Short of a couple of blackheads here and there, I don't get much acne.

Since there are several short stories, it gives the reader a good introduction to different styles of boy x boy relationships. I particularly like the first two, similar stories that the book is named for. Sure it sounds weird, but they're 17 and 23 after all!!And they are very attractively-drawn. The very last story in the book has a disturbing ending, however. Overall the sex in the book is spicy and will warm your heart and other parts but it's not overly-graphic."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Heart, Nothing grabs you.","review":"The art in this volume is nice, but the stories were short, disjointed and fairly unenjoyable. There was no build up, no tension. For instance the first story we enter is an on going relationship with the uke being the older (the teacher) and the 17 yr old is the aggressive semi. Frankly the entire story is filled with the useless uke whimpering and bemoaning his fate and whether or not he will be able to retain his lover. The sex scenes are good, but much is lost on the lack of any really good storyline for any of the shorts.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Food","review":"This cookbook is wonderful in that it uses fresh ingredients and it allows piees and parts of meals to be prepared ahead of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiant Indeed","review":"In her own inimitable SHIMMERING style, Margaret Drabble's Radiant Way, is radiant indeed. The novel opens with a grand New Year's party, and Drabble is one of the best at rendering the ebb and flow, highs and lows, of a party. You will not get bogged down in a confusion of characters because this author knows how to deftly create individuals swirling within group chaos. Social groups, whether they be society at large or a few close friends, are Drabble's forte. The reader is immersed in the ever-changing world of three women who share a life-long friendship. Join them as they make their way down the path of the radiant way."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"This is a novel which repays a slow and thoughtful reading.

First, Latino-Jewish collective Hip Hop Hoodios blew me away with their full length debut \\"Agua Pa' La Gente\\". Then Orishas came back with \\"El Kilo\\", which is a vast improvement over their 2nd album 'Emigrante' (though still not as good as their debut 'A Lo Cubano'). My fave track is the opener \\"Naci Orishas\\". I also really dig the last song, which features Miami superhero Pitbull rapping with Orishas.Between this and Hip Hop Hoodios' new album, I'm pretty content. I can't wait to see what the rest of 2005 brings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait","review":"\\"El Kilo\\" is an awesome CD. I gave it four stars instead of five only because I believe that \\"A Lo Cubano\\" set the bar so high and that they have yet to match it. But that is not to say that their last two CD's aren't good, they are. This CD is better than their last one. Ruzzo and el Guerrero are in top form as their raps are tight and they mix it up well with Roldan's singing. They return to their Cuban roots by incoporating more Cuban beats to their songs, something they got away from in \\"Emigrante\\". This album is off the hook and even though it has taken them three years since their last one, it was worth the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely obnoxious","review":"This is an awfull album.

The story is the same,only the names of the casinos changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I have ever read","review":"I was not able to put this book down. It is broken into two parts. Part one is the history of Vegas, part two focuses on a handfull of its residents over a year. While I was looking for a book on Vegas, I wanted to know more about personal experiences there, like what was in the second part of the book. I figured I wouldn't care for the history part, and would maybe skip it if it got boring. I was totally wrong. The history part was every bit as engaging. It's really a study in business more than history. It was thoroughly enjoyable, and part two was also. I like the way the author spends a year with these people (prostitiute, security guard, showgirl, etc.) and tells their story thoughout the book, instead of all in one chapter. Very well written. Also, very balanced in my opinion. At no point did I feel the author was judging anything, merely reporting it.I could go on and on. It's books like this that make fiction look so dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD LOOK INSIDE","review":"Being a \\"Vegas Buff\\" for almost 40 years, I think I have read just about every-thing written about this very American, very strange town in the desert.The author has done a wonderful job of explaing what really goes on behind the scenes, and brings the reader into a new world rarely seen,by most of us.His detailed reporting is excellent, and truly commend his efforts. Can't wait to see his next story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Casino","review":"Super Casino offers a fascinating look at \\"behind the scenes\\" Las Vegas. I bought the book with the intent of reading only the second half (a close look at the Luxor), however I began, out of curiosity, at the beginning of the book. I found this part(a history of the Circus Circus corporation) so interesting that I read the book in its entirety. This was one of those books that you hate to put down once you begin reading. It has renewed my desire to return to Las Vegas for a vacation, and to visit the Luxor, the subject of most of the book. I would strongly recomend Super Casino to anyone who has visited Las Vegas. Having been there certainly enhances the reader's understanding of much of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"speedo womne's lycra solid superpro suit","review":"I imagine this suit is fine for some.

The series is painfully realistic in it's depiction of how poverty fuels the devastating effects of infectious disease in a pre-antibiotic, pre-immunization world. Season 2 concentrates on the issues and conflicts which will eventually bring meaningful change to the practice of medicine.

I have enjoyed both the first and second series of Rayearth and the art is lovely indeed, but this 3 part movie doesn't come close. It looks like the plot was chopped to bits from a 26 part TV series to fit into 3 hours. In fact, it looks like the short version of Escaflowne that is available.

It's kept my coffee hot a good 12 hours, even with me going in from time to time to pour more. The cap as a cup is perfectly sized for as much as I'm going to pour at a time (before it gets cold). I work in a call center, and I find that a big cup cools off before I can finish it. It holds about three cups of coffee, which is perfect for me throughout my day, and small enough that it fits well into my work bag. My boyfriend has a larger version that would just be too huge for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleek and shiny, but not leak-proof","review":"The thermos is stylish and definitely keeps my coffee hot for a four or five hours. My problem? The top! I have so many problems getting the primary top to screw into the thermos properly. Invariably, it goes in crookedly and allows coffee to spill. I try and try...what's the trick?!?! Eventually, I give up and screw on the cup. Liquid won't leak out with both tops on, but when I arrive at work and take off the cup, coffee dribbles down the side from the improperly tightened lid. Definitely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid doesn't fit-LEAKY","review":"Wow, I am truly disappointed with this thermos. I got this item as a gift for my husband for Valentine's Day, and he was thrilled to have such a nice little thermos to take to work. Unfortunately the lid does not screw on properly. I don't know if we got a miss-threaded thermos, but it leaks, and doesn't seat properly in the bottle. With much effort, he can sometimes get it to close with just a little leakage. But no one wants hot coffee spilled on their lap. The thermos does keep hot coffee hot, especially if you pre-heat the thermos with hot water. But with a leaking, improperly seated lid, it doesn't serve well for travel. Very disappointed with this piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissappointed","review":"The problem is the boiling water goes cold after about an hour in the flask.

My husband had the larger version, and liked it. This smaller thermos does not insulate. Hot coffee is cold within an hour. At first, I thought that I was not tightening the lid sufficiently; not only did tightening the lid not solve the problem, but over-tightening the lid made the thermos impossible for me to open once I got to the office. I had to run hot water over the thermos in order to get the outside to expand sufficiently to allow me to get the lid to budget. I have quit using this thermos and am looking for a replacement thermos."},{"rating":"1","title":"17 oz. Thermocafe not as good?","review":"Like reviewer mommyofchristopher, I too bought the 17 oz. \\"Thermocafe\\" Thermos at Walmart. I have the Thermos/Nissan 34 oz. bottle, and it keeps things hot for the long periods other reviewers have found. The 17 oz. Thermocafe branded model is good for only 3 to 4 hours hot, then it gets noticeably cooler. A case of you get what you pay for?New development: after one week of hot coffee, the pliable plastic/rubber stopper ring now has a terrible smell/taste that transfers to the coffee. Yikes! A strange plastic - burnt taste. I've soaked it in a bicarbonate of soda solution that has helped some, but not enough. I stopped using the \\"Thermocafe\\" Thermos, until I figure this one out. Could it be the coffee type? Is the stopper ring made of crappy materials?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but weird taste sometimes.","review":"This thermos is great in that it keeps the coffee hot for pretty much as long as I could ever want it to. The downside is that is for some reason gives the coffee a watered down taste when it is in there for more than an hour or so. I can't figure out why but if I don't snug the lid down all the way tight it eliminates this problem. Beats me, but its still great in that everything stays warm enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.","review":"Before making the decision to buy it, I already read a lot of reviews.

Probably Glass Thermos bottles can hold temperature for 12 hours. Also the lid doesn't fit properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for individual use","review":"This item is fantastic! I got it as a gift for my mate. We tested it out by putting it in the freezer to chill and then placing ice cream in it as a treat for a long day of work. Six hours later the ice cream was still pretty well frozen! It can't be placed in the dishwasher and conventional scrub brushes won't fit. Best use a scrubber like the ones in Chem. class. Clean it right after use. Keep in mind that this size is best for an individual and not so much for group sharing. It's light weight and easily carried in a decent sized purse or bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"This little thermos rules. Just to experiment, I put hot tap water in it, 24 hours later, it was still hot. Not just warm, but hot enough for coffee or tea. It's great because it's small and leak proof. I can toss it in my bag, jump on the bus, go to the gym and when I get to work, my coffee is still super hot and it's hot throughout the whole day. I highly recommend it.Update: Yesterday morning I made coffee around 6:30. After I was at work I got busy and completely forgot about drinking my coffee.

And, truth is stranger than fiction"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential to all the catholics concerned with church's fate","review":"Even if I don't agree with all the points of view of the author,this book is essential to understand the reasons of the fall of traditional Catholic Church after the Second Vatican Council. We find a new religion and a new faith that is no more catholic but a sinchretism of freemasonic ideas with marxist ones mixed in an evil (literally) cocktail.We find, also, an hierarchy (by action) and a Pope (by omission) that are no more concerned with the traditional faith and teachings that Roman Catholic Church defended along the centuries.Malachi Martin, in a superb way, portrays that reality to everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riviting, compelling for Catholics and non-catholics alike","review":"Malachi Martin's book is like watching history in the making, as one is confronted with the fact that there are Cardinals who are satanists, homosexuals, anti-papists and other high level individuals that we never hear about who are dedicated to one world rule. Apparently the Pope is surrounded by men in clerical garb who are working hand in hand with financial institutions, educators, governments, foundations, and non-governmental organizations such as Masonry to bring the new world order into existence. It's a book written by a man who apparently grieves over the state of the church today. As a non-catholic I found the book compelling because the \\"updating\\" of dogma and the modernism taking place in the Catholic church is also taking place in non-Catholic seminaries and churches. It's a matter of concern for many who desire to be true to our Lord Jesus Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eerily Prophetic","review":"Whether this novel is fiction or non, or as some might say: 'faction', evolves clearer every day. The idea of satanic ritual being played out in a major place of worship and a satellite location is not only horrifying, but grows strangely realistic upon learning that the acts of satanic child abuse actually did occur, at the hands of the clergy, all over the world. One might say that there is no difference between the two. This book proves that Father Martin was not only a very caring and knowledgeable individual, but eerily prophetic as well. Read it, and read between the lines also; it is undoubtedly a very interesting translation of the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting fiction","review":"I'm a little troubled that the majority of the reviewers think this is a work of fact. If so it would not be labeled fiction. He states 85% is fact. Well there is really no way to check which 15% is not true or what is true, so we assume everything is dead on accurate. I thought this would be a great thriller myserty book based on the Vatican. Instead I got the uneasy feeling he was trying to turn the general public against Catholicism (there's a novel idea and one that hasn't been tried before) by presenting his fiction as a work of truth. It's easy to hate Catholics, and it sells so I'm not surprised this book is getting glowing reviews by those who have no idea what Catholics actually believe in, but remember the urban legends they heard growing up. I bet anyone could take this idea (pretend to be a factual book) and rip on a major religion with fiction and make a mint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Globalism from within the global Church - unique perspective","review":"The author's background of high service to the world's oldest and most global political empire, the Roman Catholic Church, provides for a much more clear picture of current geo-political trends than possible from any national press or politician.As someone very involved in politics I normally detest even the mention of buzz phrases such as the New World Order. Fr. Martin finally puts the correct face on the NWO: globalism in and of itself isn't what's bad and deserving of our opposition; it's the absence of a moral base accompanying the movement that is most dangerous.While a long and detailed read, Windswept House never fails to tell a story for even a moment. Mid-way, I was glad it was long so the story wouldn't end. By the end, I was wanting to add a hundred more pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The truth about the vatican\\"","review":"This story is true however the names are changed. This story is about the vatican and what happens when satan did come in the house of the lord. The book was written as a novel because names were changed to keep the guilty from sueing Malachi Martin. Evil and murder was covered up by the highest level of the church. A must read about evil that can come between certain people who some never drempt of. Melachi Martin was found dead after this book was written. He had been beat to death in the middle of broad daylight. The scary truth is the vatican covered up the murder and ruled Mr. martin fell and hit his head. However another doctor said, He would have had to jump from a building to complely crush his head like that\\" and no one saw anything on a buisy street in the middle of the day. A demon? Maybe?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life!","review":"I must admit that I approached this novel with a great deal of skepticism. As a Catholic priest trained in the rather liberal mid-west, I picked it up to read only out of boredom. What I read changed my life. I found Martin's content and style thought provoking to the point that I was often angry--with him! But my anger turned to self-reflection. While I disagree with many of the author's preconceptions, I was nonetheless moved by his story and his conclusions--to the point that I was forced to re-examine my own understanding of the Church and priesthood. I pay this novel the highest compliment in saying that it truly changed my life and moved me to further conversion of heart. I believe that I am a better Catholic and a better priest because I have read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterful blend of fact and fiction!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The picture the author portrays is mind-boggling but true except of course for the names of some of the characters. It is sad but true that I as a Catholic holding onto the remnants of Faith as handed down the centuries by the Church can immediately recognize the diabolical orientation the Catholic Church has undergone in the last 50 or so years as was so remarkably laid forth in this novel. A must read for anyone wanting behind the scenes knowledge of the present crisis in Western Civilization especially as embodied by the Roman Catholic Church and its priesthood."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's a sermon, not a story","review":"This reads more like a sermon than a story. The plot was as shallow and unbelievable as a hand puppet show.The author's thesis is also distorted and obviously wrong. He makes it sound like all changes in the Catholic Church since his childhood came because of Vatican II, and could have been prevented by strong popes. That ignores the reality that the changes in the Catholic Church were just one small part of the tidal wave of change from the counterculture of the 1960's."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE DON'T READ THIS BOOK","review":"I am an avid reader and couldn't wait to read this book. Then I couldn't wait to finish it, I didn't think I was ever going to get through it. The first 500 pages seemed to just drag on and on, too many words that just didn't really say anything. Too many characters. The last 162 pages finally had some action, but the ending was unsatisfying.As a Catholic I don't know weather to be outraged or just plain depressed. This novel has left me questioning many things about my church and the future of it. I know that my church is made up of humans so by it's very nature it will be sinful. But I can't believe that pure evil will be able to destroy the church that Jesus left for us here"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not just read the vampire novels.","review":"I kept on persevering through about two-thirds of this fantasy until it finally quenched the most dedicated reader. It passes belief that those who are rebelling against the medievality of the Roman Church should be caught up in an equally medieval concept of worship of Satan. The papal politics in the first part is incredibly boring, and the last part just gets sillier and sillier. It is difficult for me to believe that so many reviewers seem to take it seriously. I cannot see how it can possibly be compared to either Greeley's White Smoke or Morris West' s book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other than the cup, the rest of the items are extremly low quality","review":"I have several of Nissan travel mugs and cups, all high quality very durable.

They were so bad that I actually went out and purchased new knives just for our own use. I'm not a huge fan of serrated knives anyway, but I don't think that I've seen a cheaper set of knives in terms of construction. But, what's worse, is that these are actually very dangerous knives. They're weirdly balanced, the blades are too flexible and combined with their inherently dull edge, they cause a tendency to sort of waver or stick whenever you cut into anything with the least amount of resistance. This can lead to the knife going where you don't want it to, namely slicing into a hand or a finger.Yes, they're cheap but you'll throw them away or buy other knives anyway.

But if you were able to play Half-life 2 or the recent Counter-Strike: Source you should be up to par.

In particular, the Egyptians, the Ethiopians, the Nubians, other parts of Africa and most of the known world that accepted the African Philosophies.

When I first listened to this album (1980) I knew I loved it, then I discovered the velvet underground and finally understood it. This is music for music's sake; artistic and brutally honest.For the uninitiated, the Psych Furs are a volatile mix of Magazine, Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Sex Pistols. And Richard Butler is a singer that anyone would love in their band. A raspy voiced Bowie who can mesmerize with a monotonic drone and drive home the point with an ironic snarl. And all the while the band pounds out a shimmering veil of pulsating sound.\\"I'm in love with the BBC, I'm in love with your TV, and they are so in love with you and me\\"Paint the sky upon the ceiling, Richard.. and Rock On!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a debut!","review":"This is the best band to debut in the 80's.

As the title implies, the poems are in French on the left pages, and in English on the opposite sides.Honestly, even if you aren't enthralled by poetry, this is a practical way to familiarize yourself with some colloquial (albeit sometimes antiquated) French language.This is a cheap item ($7.00), and worthy of collection. The intro even has a brief lesson in metrical arrangement patterns.I think this book serves well to illustrate how beautiful the French langague can be, especially when artfully manipulated by such historical talents as Victor Hugo and Voltaire.4.1 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Enabler: When Helping Hurts the Ones You Love","review":"The Enabler was excellent.

It keeps your drink hot, and it reduces waste because it eliminates the need for a disposable sleeve. However, with a drink inside, it can get a bit top-heavy, particularly if you have a smaller drink in it. One more thing to note: I have two cup holders in my car, and this item is a bit too wide for one, and a bit too narrow for the other. That makes it precarious if my drink is full and I'm going over bumps on the road.

And if you like it, you should get the DVD of the well-done movie version as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb study of unintended consequences","review":"This book is a real gem. It is an excellent commentary on how idealists deny human nature and obsessively work to influence and shape social institutions \\"to make things right,\\" and how their good intentions almost always lead to disastrous unintended consequences. But do they learn from their mistakes? No, they just keep on trying...The Lathe of Heaven should be required reading in this time of political correctness, when so many people are obsessed with equality at all costs. This book shows how bleak such a reality would be.If you enjoy fiction that has strong social commentary (think Lord of the Flies, 1984, Brave New World), then this book is for you. Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low-key, but incredible","review":"This is truly one of Le Guin's best novels. A very grim story of a man whose dreams alter reality and the psychologist who manipulates his talents to improve his career and then the world itself, with mixed results to say the least. Much has been made of the socio-political points Le Guin was attempting to make with this novel, although I think such speculations on where this book, or Le Guin herself, stands on the political/ideological spectrum are rather pointless. Here Le Guin seems to be exploring a much deeper problem, i.e. the hubris of humans who think they are the masters of the earth, able to mold it as they will without consequences. On another level, \\"Lathe of Heaven\\" seems to simply be an elaboration of the old adage about being careful of what we wish for, because it just may come true."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing novel","review":"I had to get this book for English class, it is the kind of thing that I might not have read on my own... the title is interesting but the cover is a little abstract if you don't know the story. Having read it I can highly recommend it. It is an interesting book with a lot of meaning to it, the whole class had a lot of fun analyzing it, I even went so far as to find and watch the two television/movie adaptions that have been made - neither one does this book justice. If you like interesting, thought provoking speculative fiction look no further, for star-ships and space battles you might want to go elsewhere (even though this book does have a little of those). It isn't very long so a serious reader will probably only take an afternoon on this but do not confuse the size of the book with the size of the meaning that it contains, this is a very deep book."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT (non sci-fi fan)","review":"I'd like to start off by saying that I don't read sci-fi. I don't hate it, simply dislike it. This book really takes a different turn when it comes to sci-fi. I like how it doesn't incorporate all these future technologies, and bases it's story on a simple man who's dreams comes true. I would have wished this book was a bit longer, I hate when so many great books are less than 200 pages, however, the beautiful way in which this book was written makes up for the shortage of pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind-Blowing Exploration of Whether We Can Perfect Society","review":"When the main character dreams it, it becomes real. His psychiatrist decides to use this ability to make some small improvements in society. Imagine there's no disease, or war, or racism... but things keep going wrong. This is an off-beat love story, fascinating science fiction, and thought-provoking philosophy. I've loved this book ever since I read it in high school."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a kind and unique story","review":"This book was riveting. I read this book when I was much younger and I thought it was a bit too wierd from me back then. After seeing the made for TV movie and reading this book again help me apreciate the book alot better. The main character dreams and when he wakes up he find his whole world had changed. Not only does his world had change but his psychologist takes advantage of his abilty and empowers himself for his own personal gain. This book is still truely different from most books out there and its over 20 years old!! I believe this book outshines most books that are in current print today.

It was a frightening thought that even someone with good intensions could not save humans from themselves. Whenever one problem is solved another takes it's place. There is no such thing as a perfect world, we need to strugle to be happy. As strange as that may sound. Even God can't please all the people all the time and he created us.

I think I will have to read it again, it was that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worthwhile","review":"I was a little hesitant when I first picked up this book. Seeing that there aren't many other novels on dreams (or none that I've found) \\"The Lathe Of Heaven\\" was my only option for an english project. I was quickly drawn into it. The beginning was great - halfway through, although I was still somewhat interested - the plot got slightly dull and confusing. Too much stuff about aliens. However, it still made sense and I wasn't completely lost. Good ending; a very interesting perspective on reality. This was my first LeGuin read, and I'm sure there'll be more in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lathe of Heaven","review":"I have read and reread this book since 1982. It is one of the classic SF of all time and especially from the sixties era. However, as I read the enthusiastic reviews of other readers, I notice that that the one aspect of the book is often overlooked: the love story. All the madness, the crashing possibilities of dreaming new worlds, the aliens, the wonderful/awful imagery are secondary to the human emotions that cause the dreams. And the book says: go with your heart no matter what, never give up.PS: the scene with the hippie tea and the Beatles tune is a constatnt tearjerker."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is reality...?","review":"Is it fixed series of events, a string of cause and effect? Or can it be changed at a whim, changed by nothing but a dream of a sleeping man? George Orr is that man. For some of his dreams change the real world, because his dreams sometimes come true. But Mr. Orr does NOT want to change the world, he just wants to be a normal man with normal dreams.When George tries to take drugs to end his dreaming he is sent to Dr. Haber to be cured of his fears. But what happens when Dr. Haber also realizes Orr's gift/curse is not the product of an insane mind, but in fact is real and decides to use it for the 'good' of mankind?If you liked the book there are two movies available to watch. I prefer the older version made by WNET/THIRTEEN (PBS)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clever SF book based in Oregon","review":"I saw the movie based on the book, The Lathe of Heaven, back in the late 1970's. Filmed in Oregon it always stayed in my memory.A unique vision of the future about a guy whose dreams become reality, but with twists.The original film somehow got stored on an old medium that did not convert well to current video technology. DVDs of the original movie look damaged, but it is still a good flick to watch.I finally purchased the book a couple of years ago. The movie was not too far off. I have not read anything else by Ursula Le Guin, but the fellow Oregonian hit home with this book. Excellent SF reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lathe of Heaven - an excellent book!","review":"First of all, I have to admit that I don't read much - I don't really have time, so I have to choose the books I read with a lot of care. This book really struck my attention, and I've already read it twice. The main character, George Orr has the ability to make his dreams come true. His Psychiatrist (Pardon the spelling) Haber, can see the change. This book is basically about what happens to a person, George Orr, when he has the ability to change the future for everyone. Human Nature interferes, and that is all I'll give you. This really is an incredible book from a very talented writer, LeGuin. My Recommendation : Definatly pick up a copy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very thought provoking","review":"This story reflects the belief of many religous people.

I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what it's cracked up to be","review":"This was my first Ursula K. LeGuin novel, and my last. After reading this I have no clue why she's gotten so much acclaim over the years. It reads like a sorry attempt to be Philip K. Dick (a genuine genius). It's a good idea poorly executed. I had to force myself to finish it.Maybe I should have tried The Left Hand of Darkness instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo, boo, and more boos.","review":"It isn't always easy to follow the author's train of thought. Then you have to get past all of her pschoprattle and philosophical nonsense.

I wasted some time trying to make them work, and then fell back on my old adage - \\"If I can't make it work within two hours, it ain't designed right. Go back and buy something that is.\\" Of course, the literature that came with the devices said not all SD cards will work with them, but ALL technology says that. And, sure, Kingston could try to test every device and publish a list of compatible hardware, but there are probably way too many possible combinations to make that feasible. It is left up to us poor consumers to do the testing. Kind of like furniture and bicycle manufacturers relying on us consumers to do all their final assembly and quality control.

The case itself is a nice fit for the TomTom. I've read some of the previous comments and this case won't protect the contents if it's dropped or banged around alot. I carry it in my briefcase, carry-on bag or my purse and it suits very well for those. It'd never last if my teenage daughter carried it in her school backpack (with or without the books) which gets chucked into cars, lockers and onto the floor.

Otherwise well worth the download!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Conservative Protestant Theology","review":"In recent years there have been a variety of systematic theologies written by Evangelical authors. Wayne Grudem's work is probably the best example of a systematic theology written by a very conservative Protestant. The doctrinal lineup for this work is somewhat interesting: Reformed, charismatic, Baptist and premillennial (non dispensationalist).The only problem with this book is that it is focused principally on the Biblical material and provides minimal historical background to the topics addressed. To the extent that conflicting viewpoints are discussed, it's normally within the evangelical world. For example, there is no mention of Aquinas, much less Karl Rahner or Henri de Lubac.The reader approaching the study of Christian theology for the first time probably should supplement it with James Garrett's SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGY or Millard Erickson's CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.","review":"Recommended from my pastor.

Grudem's theology is very consistent and Bible-based and I appreciate how his theology is consistently tied back to the inerrancy of The Word. In addition, this book is truly written from a teacher's perspective. It is easy to read but has deep meaning. Finally one of the best parts in my opinion is the section at the end of each chapter that has application questions (they're all very good and really make you think back on what you've read and what it has to do with your walk), a memory verse, and a hymn. If you aren't reading through those sections you're really missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a Non-Seminary Twenty-Something Pastor","review":"So, I am a twenty-something Pastor.

He just made his claims/conclusions and ehn threw out a lot of quotes from the scripture without any analysis or explanation of why he made such conclusions.Since the author involved deeply in the charamatic movements, he put his charamatic view under the cover of reformer. It is well hidden in those chapters about miracles and baptism in and filling with holy spirit. Where he advocates readers to accept the charamatic view inside their churches in a very soft and hidden tones. That is, this book could be a slow poison for the reformed churches (non-Pentecostal churches).There are a lot of verbeage in this book. The author could present all his views/conclusions with less than 400 pages instead of over 1200 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"One sided and based on assumptions","review":"This book's chief problems as far as I can tell are its stereotyping of other christian denominations and its use of anecdotal evidence. The book is basically a manual for Reformed Theology in the contemporary world and as such, is very conservative. When this book does offer contrasting viewpoints to those held by the author, they are not well presented and are usually brushed off with single references to the Bible. Also, since it is systematic rather than process there are contradictions on every page that arise from the inexhaustible attempt to proven Reformed doctrines by biblical cherry picking. In addition, although this is symptomatic of the entire Evangelical community, all or most of these doctrines are backed up by Paul's letters and almost nothing is deduced from the Gospels themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"biased","review":"Grudem constantly misrepresents the positions that he disagrees with. I understand that the author wants to prove what he believes is Biblically true; however, Wayne Grudem does not even give the opposing side a chance. With Arminianism - he quotes Clark Pinnock as an Arminian (when Pinnock is a well known OPEN THEIST). This is just one example of the author's attempt to produce only his views and not give anyone who agrees with him a fair shot. A systematic theology book should at the very least clearly portray all major views on an issue and then proceed to show his opinion. The book is well written, however it is not for those who are interested in theology. If you wish to be told what to believe and you don't care what else may be out there even in the most trivial dispute - this book was written for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Systematic proof texting","review":"Wayne Grudem is often hailed as the common mans theologian. He has attempted to create and accessible and readable systematic theology. Grudems certainly achieves this, however, it is unfortunate that the book is simply bad. Its use of poor prose and systematic proof texting means that the books is an uncontrable waste of money. In Grudems attempts to render the book accessible he simply strings a long list of verses together with some rather flimsy, superficial exergesis. It has been and will continue to be a popular book within charasmatic circles due to Grudems stance on tongues, yet what ever you wish to believe about that and other controversial issues there are better books to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresents Catholic Teaching","review":"Grudem consistently misrepresents the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church in this book. I'm not criticizing his disagreement with those teachings, that's his right to disagree, but his statements of what Catholics believe is wrong on several counts, and where he's not completely wrong he interprets the teaching in the most uncharitable way possible.Other than that, his book barely qualifies as systematic theology. It's more like a catechism for consevative evangelicals."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed in the book.","review":"Grudem's Systematic Theology is current and mentions contemorary names such as Bill Clinton, John Wimber, etc. There are too many problems to list in a brief review such as this. My main concern is that he is anti-dispensational, believes in the special creation of the soul at conception, espouses a strong Calvinistic position and leans heavily into Charismaticism. There are many more problems, but these are my main concerns. For those looking for a good biblical theology, go through Grudem carefully with both eyes open."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious Bible study","review":"This is the next logical step for studying the Bible and to date, it has more than met my expectations.

Efforts to tighten the lid down further to reduce leakage result in stripped threads. Now the lid won't tighten at all! It leaks horribly. My poor white shirt stained by it!

Now it is very beat up and friends make fun of me, but it still keeps my morning coffee hot for hours. I don't know how many times it has fallen off the car roof as I drove away forgetful. And if you work in an environment where spills could mean disaster, the screw tight lid is the best. I was surprised to find this on Amazon, I have been looking for a replacement for quite some time. I bought two, just in case. I also bought two of the little sister, \\"Nissan 11-Ounce Stainless Steel Coffee and Tea Traveler\\".

They both leaked coffee all over my shirt and the mug. I've tried tightening it judiciously and firm, both ways they leaked. The lid doesn't seat evenly on the mug, so of course it's going to leak. It's cockeyed, which only leads me to believe it's a manufacturing error. Unfortunately for me I'm the recipient of two leaky mugs. OF COURSE I bought these for coffee...If I want to carry hot soup I'll buy a thermos. It's unacceptable for a mug of this price and supposed quality to ever leak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid leaks all over clothes","review":"The size on this is ok and it certainly keeps your coffee hot. Unfortuntely the screw top lid is not an actual screw but rather a partial screw, where 1/2 twist closes it and 3/4 twist pops the seal. It constantly leaks to the side of the lid, usually all over my clothes. I'm tossing it and regret the $20.00 lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't exist!","review":"I ordered the 20 oz mug, received the 16 oz version.

Works exactly as prescribed. Had it installed in about 10min. I left my dog alone for a few hours today and he didn't even try to knock the gate down (because he can't). It's very sturdy. As long as you follow the instructions and make sure the spindle rods are tight against the wall, it won't budge. It's pressure mounted so keep that in mind. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient gate","review":"This gate is so much more convenient to use versus the typical tension rod gates. We do take it down when we have guests because there is a bar under the gate that can cause people to trip if they do not notice it. not sure how that can be fixed..maybe the designer cld change that bar to be flat to the floor?...Otherwise it deserves a 5 rating for it's price and usefulness."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for gating small dogs","review":"Does not work if you have a small dog that you are trying to keep in behind the gate, can fit threw slates.

I never knew a 60 lb. dog could get through such a small opening!I like the way the company included extra side pieces to make the gate wider if necesary. Nice and sturdy, easy to get through, and the gate opening has an easy lock in case your dog figures out how to pop the latch! They really thought of everything!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Our large toddler fits through the pet door!","review":"We bought this walk thru gate to give our cat access to the basement while keeping our (very large for his age) toddler away from the stairs. Much to our amazement, he managed to squeeze through the pet gate. He's 13 months old, but very tall and heavy for his age (95th percentile). So I can't really give this more than 2 stars since it presents a significant safety risk for toddlers. We're going to keep it since at least it gives us a bit more time to chase our boy down while he's trying to make his way through the pet gate as opposed to having nothing, but overall we're disappointed with this product and can't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Gate, Bad Pet Door","review":"Overall I like this gate and would purchase it again. It was easy to set up by myself with only a quick glance at the manual. The gate opening itself is a little narrow but I've gotten used to it. Some people have complained it takes two hands to open-not so as long as you ignore the red safety latch.[ I don't have kids plus this gate it not meant to be used as a baby gate] Also some people complained that the pet door only swings one way but mine swings both ways you just have to REALLY push on it. The little pet door comes out too you just have to remove the spring from the top. [This takes two people to do] My two complaints are neither the pet door or the gate stay open by themselves and my 55lb. hound can fit through the little pet door."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gate, little wobbly when using extensions","review":"Got the baby gate super fast.

It has definitely served its purpose and for the price it is a very good solution. Our only issue is that, if you need to leave the small door on the bottom open, it sticks out and swings when you open the main gate door to go through. It would be five stars for me if there was some way to remove the small door or secure it in an open position so that it is flush to the main gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"One of my dogs likes to use my home office carpet as a piddle pad.

It seemed rather flimsy until I had it locked in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carlson gate is GREAT!!","review":"WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GATE TO OTHERS.

I have to keep the gate up since we feed our cats on the floor in the office and the dogs will eat it if they can get in. My cats are getting older and I have noticed them having difficulty jumping over our old gate, so this gate was eagerly welcomed into our home by them. They just walk right through it and it keeps the dogs out. Also constructed very well, easy to assemble, love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great gate...","review":"It's flemsy when you put the extensions on. I have a daycare and any time the kids bump it, it falls off. We took it down because it kept falling and that was more dangerous than not having one. It got to a point where it would fall even when you were opening the gate to go through. Also people kept tripping on the metal piece on the bottom every time they went through. I would not purchase this item again specially for how much they charge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unhappy Dog","review":"The cats and the human family all like it .... the dog not so much. It's a great concept with the pet door, but I don't think the solder joints are as nicely done on this Carlson gate as they are on the Regalo gates I have. Unfortunately, the latter doesn't offer the pet door option. What's more, the Carlson stays nicely anchored to the door jam without having to use the screw-in cups. It's also worth mentioning that although the description says the gate fits from 29\\" and up, I have installed it in a doorway that's just 28 3/4\\" wide, so it might help others to know that it will fit slightly under the 29\\". Both brands look so similar, even right down to the colors and the latch, that I think they may be manufactured by the same company but under different names."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah - Happy Day","review":"When I bought this gate and started to put it together I didn't think it would work. I have two little jumpers on my hands and they usually can and will scale any object that tries to contain them. They have not jumped the gate at all.

Thanks Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Just What We Needed","review":"I purchased this gate at a pet store (on sale!) and it is pretty much exactly what we needed to keep my 50# dog away from the cats. The cats easily learned to go through the cat door and the cat door IS too small for my shepherd-sheltie mix to get through. It really works exactly as I need it to. My only \\"complaint\\" is minimal...the handle to open and close the people-door is a bit awkward. But I'd buy the gate again and I'll recommend to anyone who needs this type of gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would recommend","review":"Got this gate to keep dogs out of room and allow cats to get to it. It does exactly that.Of course the dogs are too large to fit thru the opening, which is the perfect size for my fat cats.Had to use the extensions to fit the doorway.

It was easy to install, but I ran into a problem with my doorway. There is a trim detail on the wall, and that prevents the ends of the threaded spindle rods from sitting flat on the wall. I decided to give it a try anyway since I would be in the room w/ her. Before she came to visit, the cat and I gave it a test run, and he got the idea and went right through the first time. We were most surprised (and highly amused) when my \\"webble shaped\\" granddaughter followed him right through on her first visit.-YIKES. The gate only opens in one direction, so before you install make a choice. My 4 1/2 year old grandson can open the gate w/out any help, even if the \\"lock\\" tab is engaged, less getting up for grandma. As with all presure/open gates there is a bar on the bottom so you must be careful walking through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Gate Hole","review":"The gate I received has a defect. The smaller gate on this model, through which a cat can pass, cannot open. The sliding bolt that is pulled back to open the mini-gate won't open without my assertive use of pliers. That's because the hole into which the bolt passes to lock the gate is located lower than the bolt's level. I see three manufacturing issues in this:(1) Somebody on the assembly line did not drill the hole precisely where it should be located to receive the bolt smoothly and on the horizontal level;(2) Somebody later in the line forced in the bolt at a severe angle to make it fit, not caring about the impossibility of re-opening the mini-gate;(3) No quality control person at the end of the line checked to see if the mini-gate is workable.What appears to be a reasonably good product is in my unit malfunctioning--on the very part that is featured in this model, the small animal gate within the larger one. Be aware that this can happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for our needs","review":"We have 2 cats and a new puppy. The two cats live in the master bedroom and rarely came out before.

Easily install this gate and enjoy your home and your precious pets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Product","review":"The most important thing to know about this gate, compared to similar ones, is that it requires you to use anchors in your wall to secure the gripper cups for the tension rods. You simply cannot get the gate tight enough otherwise. Personally that is kind of irritating because we like to periodically move the gate to different areas of the house and this makes it more permanent. Also, as mentioned by other reviewers, the walk thru gate is very narrow. Otherwise it has been a great gate for keeping the big dogs in a particular room while allowing the older cats (who no longer jump) free access."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use and sturdy!","review":"Great product, easy to set up, easy to walk through- only downside is that our small dog can walk through the opening- I was hoping this would keep him out and let our cat through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, just needs a bit smaller pet door","review":"For keeping a puppy away from Cats this will need some slight modification.

The construction is good and believe from the mfgr's web-site, the painted steel is not lead based; as they have a care for those pets who it is designed.I have since ordered an additional gate.

I messed around with it for over 45min and there was still too much of a gap for the door to catch the latch.

If you follow the directions and leave the \\"Gap\\" in the latch, any dog, or kid can knock it down just by pushing or leaning on it. I was dumb enough to purchase 2 of these items just before Christmas and gave one to a friend - who didn't get to try it out until she returned from her vacation (which will be past my 30 day return mark....)

The small gate at the bottom when left open allows our kitty to go through to his bathroom while containing our puppies. I know I read how other very similar looking gates made by another manufacturer were cheaply made but the Carlson Gate is extremely well made. My husband bought one previously at a local pet store but when we decided to purchase a second one, I went to amazon.com and found the same gate at half the price.

It generally keeps our dogs out of the room our cats enjoy - only catch is our 42 lb dog can easily fit through the small pet door (nothing a little training couldn't solve). One thing to be concerned about is on the extensions. There is a 90 degree bend in the outside bar of the extension; this creates a small gap near the top. One day the small pet door was closed so one of our cats attempted to jump over the gate. He got his foot caught in that gap.....foot stayed, but the rest his body continued over the gate resulting in a broken foot. This was a bit of a fluke, but it can happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gate for the money","review":"This gate is the very best. Easy to install and easy to use.

Well my Jack Russell is about the size of that cat, and well she did not need the little door to get through because she fit between the door frame and the bars. The bars are spaced way to far apart to keep a smaller animal inside.....so I do not recommend this for a small animal because they will get out.

They are not easy to find. I have to have one that will keep the big dog out but let the cats get through. This gate is the best.

It was received quickly and in great shape!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed","review":"I had been told by an employee at Petsmart that this gate was the best. I was surprised about workmanship looked good. but it is kind of flimsy. My dog (shih tzu) can get through between the bars. Does not say it is not for small dogs. So now I have to put things in front of it to keep her in. It does not stay secure to the wall either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but could have some improvement","review":"This is a wonderful, very functional gate. The only problem is if you intend to purchase it to keep a dog out from the area with the kitty litter and cat food, don't expect it to work with a dog unless it is over 40 pounds. I expected my small beagle to make it through since it only weighs about 24 pounds, but the larger beagle mixes, one of which weighs over 40 pounds also manages to get through the small gate and a very chunky sheltie mix also gets through with no problem. If they made an option with a smaller secondary opening, then it might work. If you have a large dog this might be the solution unless it is a jumper, then it might not be tall enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purr-fect","review":"I ordered this gate to keep my dog out of cat territory.

However, once we put the gate up we realized how sturdy and convenient it is. I can't tell you how wonderful it is not to climb over the inexpensive gate we were using. And once our dog is big enough to not fit through the pet door, this will be great for the cats.

We used to have a regular child-gate up by our stairway, preventing the dog from getting upstairs, but that also didn't let the cat get downstairs.This gate solved the problem! We put it up by our guest bathroom. Now the cat and get in and our easily, getting to her food and litter box, but the dog can't get in.It was very easy to put up (< 2 minutes) and opens and closes easily.We highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gate for the price!","review":"We bought this gate to keep my one year old son out of the utility room, but allow the cats to go in and out to access their litter boxes. It works great. It opens for us to walk through and we leave the pet door open so the cat's can pass easily. We are very happy with this gate. It serves it's purpose well for my child, out cats, and us. It is sturdy and fits the door well. The price was great too. No complaints here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Pet Gate","review":"The misses and I have two dogs and one cat. Let's just say the relation between species mixes like oil and water. We needed a solution to separate the cat from the dogs. This gate served at least two purposes; placed at the bottom of the stairs, the cat was able to go through the little gate and the upstairs became her domain, dog free. In addition, her food and water is placed upstairs without the worry of the ever hungry dogs getting to it. The quality is as good or better than other gates costing far more. Installation was a breeze. One item to note; the little opening was too small for the dogs to get through so we didn't need the little gate door and I just removed the door. It made the entire gate more user friendly. The rod in the little gate is spring loaded so you just have to get a little flat tip screw driver to slide the rod down enough to release one end of the little gate door from the main gate. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"A+","review":"We use this gate to keep our dog out of the kitchen. The handle is very secure and also very easy to open and close the latch. You actually don't even have to push it all the way down to click it in and lock the red piece in place, you can just push it down as far as it goes and it still prevents the door from being opened and closed. You just pull the lever up and down,which makes easier access in and out. Of course, we click it in when we're sleeping or not home just in case, as our dog actually maneuvered the last gate open, god knows how because it was much harder to open and close than this gate and required two hands and a decent amount of strength.But this one is taller and it's longer than any of the gates we found in stores. And I'm sure the tiny door will be perfect for when I get my kittens. I give this gate an A+ Especially considering the price.PS - It arrived at my house in two days thanks to my free 1-month trial of Amazon Prime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good product","review":"First off if you are going to buy this you should know that the instructions say that this items is NOT for use with children but only for animals. That being said they are a very solid product and when mounted are very secure. I just upgraded the screws into studs and anchored into drywall. Quality control could be better. The little door on both I bought doesn't swing freely. It hits the frame when going back through. Just a little harder push gets it through. All in all I would purchase this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"pet gate needs to be smaller","review":"Works great except my 55lb border collie fits through the pet door. She can easily follow the cats through their door, wish they made the cat door just a tad bit smaller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as expected -- great for Scotties","review":"The gate is just what I was expecting and reasonably usable with one hand. The pet door is perfect for my Scottish Terriers after coaxing them through, but it swings around awkwardly if left open. It would be nice if it latched flush against the door. Unfortunately for my purposes, my 2.5 year old quickly mastered opening the gate. A taller version of this product would probably keep him in."},{"rating":"2","title":"does exactly as advertised","review":"We bought this gate to keep the dog out of what's known as \\"the cat's bathroom\\", since it also has his litter box. It does that. Although it says right on it that it isn't for babyproofing, it also deters our daughter from trying to get in there, which was a pleasant bonus. It's thin enough that we can still close the bathroom door when necessary, and by keeping the small gate's pin out, it is always open for the cat.As far as installation goes, it took me at most five minutes to put up(we have a toddler, though, so I might be at an advantage here). We have an average sized doorway, so we didn't need the extensions.I wish we had one approved for child safety so we wouldn't have to keep the cat on the ground floor of our house all day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good gate for the price","review":"I just bought this at our local PetSmart and came online to see if I could have gotten a better price (answer is YES - Amazon is $20 bucks less than at the store - but I needed it today). The gate comes with two extensions which make the gate wider - I did not use either on as the install is in a standard door. The gate installs with four pressure knobs on each of the corners and you will not be able to use the gate until pressure forces the gate together on the top. All in all, I think it took less than 5 minutes to get in in the door and operating and it seems high enough quality. My cat is using the door already and the gate is keeping my cocker out of the room, as intended. I would definitely recommend this unit, especially at the lower online price!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great gate for animal owners.","review":"I purchased this gate thinking my really young kittens wouldn't get over it so easily to get them use to the new house though of course being kittens this simple gate won't stop from going over. So of course this gate didn't really serve the purpose I had in mind for it. Though with that being said I still think this gate is a great gate for animal owners as it really is a sturdy gate that isn't easily going to be toppled over with a nudge or light push. If you own a dog and cat this will give the cat easy access to all rooms in the house while making sure the dog doesn't go into other areas or as well as keeping young babies/small children from accessing parts of the house as well.The door latch is really easy to use and with plenty of \\"walk-Thru\\" room to go through the gate and close behind you with an easy snap. This is a really good gate to have and HIGHLY recommend it for those that have a need for a gate in their house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with my purchase","review":"We have a 10 pound Chihuahua that isn't allowed to go upstairs. In the past I've used a cheap tension gate that has to be moved or stepped over to get past and that's not the best scenario for a staircase. I needed a gate that she couldn't get through that would fit the top of our staircase. This one is perfect, with the included extensions it fits great. I was able to install it myself without problems. I was a little worried that the bars would be wide enough for our dog to slip through but they aren't. I saw somewhere that it wasn't recommended for installation at the top of stairs and I assume that's because a small child could, in theory, push against it, knock it down, and fall down the steps. I have a 10 and 11 year old and they are old enough to know not to push against it. The walk through opening isn't very wide. That's not an issue for us, but a large person would have trouble getting through it. I'm very happy with the gate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extra-Wide Doorway Block - Smallish Gate","review":"Gate goes up quickly and easily.We haven't installed the wall mount rings - because we are loath to put any more holes than absolutely necessary in our home. As a result, I have to adjust the gate every few days or so. If using in an area with children - don't skip this step, the gate will move if leaned on, run into, etc.The walk through area is just enough for one adult to pass through unencumbered. If you are carrying anything, etc. - you will need to lift it over. This usually wouldn't be an issue, except that we have it at the top of the stairs. We're getting used to it.Once adjusted to the doorway, it opens/closes with relative ease.We generally don't click the release all the way down. The safety release is a bit less intuitive than the rest. However, if you have children, that feature would be a great thing to have!Overall, we like it.

The small gate is so large that the 45 pound dog fits through without any problems. When the small gate is closed she can easily push it open and exit the gated area.The gate only opens one way, all other gates we have open both ways so very poorly designed.The gate takes two hands to open - one to push the release and keep it open and then one hand to lift the plastic locking mechanism - very poorly designed.The weilding seems are not all covered with the white so they show up as a darker area and look unsightly.I would not recommend this gate to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"not made well","review":"We received the gate promptly and it was packed well.

My dog can squeeze herself through the cat door. She's 45 pounds, and when I first put the gate up, she managed to get through the cat opening. It deters her because it's a challenge, but she can definitely still get into the bedroom if she wants to.2. The door is difficult to open. You have to slide a tab and then lift the handle to open the door. I don't love that..it takes two hands.I kept it because I had already set it up and didn't want to bother taking it down to return. It also isn't life-or-death to keep the dog out of the bedroom, just more of a preference.However, if you have a medium size dog and it's imperative to keep the dog out, this is not your door."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Dobies and cats","review":"Got this for my 3 month old Dobie so that she would stay out of the cat food.

I can open the gate to walk in and out of my home office, the small pet door is left open for the cats to walk in and out of the room to reach their litter box and food areas, while it is tall enough and secure enough with the pressure mounted arms to keep the large dogs out! Great value, great solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"One size does not fit all","review":"I have to say that I love the idea behind this gate. It's well built, easy to use, sturdy. However, the pet gate is only effective if you have large dogs. I currently have a 4 month old corgi puppy who can fit through no problem, but even once she's full grown, I don't think she'll have much issue. We'll keep our fingers crossed.

Yes, I would enjoy reading an unabridged book about the Black Sea area. The current book is just too abridged for me. I sure did learn many things I did not know and found the author's travels mildly amusing, but the lack of more detailed maps of the regions around the Black Sea were lacking. I had to go to my Turkey Travel Guide (Insight Guide@)to locate some places mentioned or the general area of the referent. I do take some issue with the authors use of Scythians-different groups of, as opposed to a progression from Scythian, Saka, Sarmatian, Sauromatiaion, Thracian, Ossetian, Alans, and so on.

And it seems that almost no one's ancestors have always been in the country where they think they came from. The middle section spends a surpring amount of time on the Polish people who dominated Odessa and the Crimea after 1800.

Although he was a star at an early age, this was the album that put Michael into Iconic status. \\"Billie Jean\\" ranks as one of the most popular singles ever, and is still played in various radio stations. \\"Beat It\\" was another one of his mega-hits, and is one of the most recognizable songs in the past few decades. This was one of the first albums I ever purchased (some 20+ years ago), and is still one that I play once in a while. The underplayed hit, \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", a duet with Paul McCartney, remains a fun song to listen to... and \\"The Lady Of My Life\\" is a smooth ballad that shows the more balladry side of Michael. I'm guessing anyone that is looking to purchase an album has already purchased this one, or has burned copies of this album... but, if you're looking to add this one because you haven't already...

When doing A/B switching between my regular CD and this SACD (both in 2 channel), I could hear subtle nuances that were clearer than the old CD... nothing ground breaking just a bit clearer.

The fact that people still fall for it just goes to show no one goes broke underestimating the taste of the American public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad for a homosexual pedophile, oh!!","review":"Of course Billie Jean isn't his lover, but her younger brother Bobby... that's just an unproven allegation of a different color. Wacko Jacko sings with so much tension that he sounds like he's going to pop an inseam. In fact after recording he needed a two week long milk and cookie snuggle sleepover with some special \\"friends\\" just to take the edge off. While the songs aren't bad, the music on Thriller could be thought of more as soundtracks to the videos than as stand alone works. Because MTV played the videos so much they've been permanently burned into my retinas and consciousness. Does anybody think of anything personal when they hear these songs, or do they just replay the videos in their heads? I thought so."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"I never received the cd - I purchased the day b4 his death and the seller canceled the orderand I noticed he relisted it at double the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best cd ever just got better","review":"WOW! when i brought this cd i took it home and i listened to it and the first 9 tracks are on the origanal album. but the next tracks are interviews and 3 songs the first one someone in the dark is a melodic balad like childhood. the second is billie jean michaels demo recording with new words and the other is carosel which is also good. i recomend to everyone to buy this CD it is great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thriller is just as good as when it first hit the airwaves","review":"I use to have the album \\"Thriller\\" but after a house party it developed legs and walked.

This 25 edition has the album, has some nice bonus tracks and has the DVD with the videos of \`Billie Jean', \`Beat it' and \`Thriller', along with the famous clip from the \\"Motown 25\\" broadcast.

I can easily name a dozen albums that I think are far superior to \\"THRILLER.\\" I couldn't help but laugh at the song \\"Human Nature,\\" that almost sounded like a song from the 2000s, trying to make fun of the 80s. The singing on \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something\\" was unintelligible, other than the title. \\"The Girl is Mine\\" was embarrassingly corny. \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"The Lady in My Life\\" are insipid and base. Altogether, the album was one of the most massive disappointments I have ever heard.

It was particulary impressive because I was backstage and observed the Motown 25 Year Celebration and was standing close to Michael prior to his performance.

The additions are not much of an attraction, however : 2 previously unreleased session songs and one home demo (\\"Billie Jean\\") that are interesting but don't shake the rafters. The rest are interviews (try listening to those twice) and the \\"missing\\" second verse of the \\"Thriller\\" rap by Vincent Price. Booklet does have some nice new notes, but if you have the original \\"Thriller\\" CD there really isn't much here to make this an essential purchase, just a luxury."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thriller - Revisisted","review":"THRILLER became the most successful album in history, selling over 50 million worldwide. And its easy to see why. Michael Jackson is simply good at what he does. The music is irresistible, you can't help but dance or sing along. The music is original, like no other music out there. He paved the way for many artists, and its easy to see why people call him a legend, because he is. THRILLER is one of his shining moments in his career, and it proved to be a huge success for him. The \\"Thriller\\" short film became famous for its screenplay and film work, and rightfully so, the choreography was excellent and like nothing else. Other big hits from this album include \\"Beat It\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"The Girl Is Mine\\" (with Paul McCartney), \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something\\", and more. This version comes with bonus tracks, demo versions, and a lot of interviews with Quincy Jones and Rod Temperton. This is a must have, if you don't have it or want to revisit the magic, this one's a good one to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Chance!!!!","review":"The 2 Stars are not for the album,(I Love Thriller), they're for the LAME bonus disc. I just see this release as a huge wasted chance to finally release the rest of the great unreleased tracks from the Thriller sessions. What happened to songs like \\"Hot Street\\", \\"Trouble\\" and \\"NightLine\\". Those songs are excellent and are a worthy addition to a Thriller 25th year collection. I couldn't care less about a bunch of remixes. I never listen to them. The Black Eyed Peas don't belong on a release of Thriller. Michael could've and should've done much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid remastered CD's","review":"Let me say that I love the Thriller album, even if it seems a tad dated now. If you have the original CD of Thriller, hang onto it. It has better sound and more dynamic range than the 2001 or 2008 remastered CD's. Don't be fooled thinking remastered is better. All they do is turn everything up so it sounds louder, which in effect distorts and you lose the important dynamic range. Don't believe me? Have another listen to your remastered CD and notice how blaringly loud it is, and how much detail is lost. Also have a look at this interesting YOUTUBE discussion on Thriller remastered.

But.... I cant help but wonder why The Legendary Michael Jackson would choose such terrible artists to be on his 25th anniversary of Thriller. I mean Fergie? Akon? Will.i.am? Why did't Michael choose artists like Usher, Omarion, Marques Houston, and Chris Brown. There great song and dance men like himself, pluse there more pleaserable to listen to. I think the album is the best of all time, but I wish Mike would have thought through his bonus tracks better."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you not give this a 5?","review":"I had to inquire about who in his right mind would give this a \\"1.\\" It was obvious that one reviewer alone, who clearly never liked MJ, gave Thriller a poor rating four times using the term \\"hype\\" to clearly identify him/herself. The others who gave Thriller 1s were annoyed with the sound quality of the CD. Fact is, few albums can top this off: Dark Side of the Moon comes to mind, which says a lot about how perfect Thriller is. MJ may be a weirdo, but he sure made history here. I recently heard \\"The Lady in My Life\\" on the radio. I completely froze from its beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"not multi-channel audio","review":"This is not a review of the music itself, but just a comment on the SACD version of the album. I had this album on analog cassette tape way back when, and always wanted a CD version. When I saw that there was now an SACD encoded version, I immediated added it to my cart, thinking that it may have been re-mixed as multi-channel audio (like Dark Side of the Moon and Brothers in Arms had been). I guess I should have done my homework, since it wasn't. This album is in SACD format, but only as 2-channel stereo.

They took a million carat diamond and turned it into a cubic zirconia. Perfection never should have been messed with. Their visions for and performance of the songs just did not work...at all.

Human Nature. I am telling you, this is a pretty good price, I am super super happy that I own it! On the dvd they have two of his music videos Billie Jean and then Thriller.

Michael was not just a singer, not just a dancer, but also a composer. He is a multi-talented genius. And Thriller is his opus.Between Michael and uber-producer Quincy Jones, Thriller is the epitome of a great album. The musical variety of the songs made for countless #1 hits. Compare the chanting of \\"Wanna Be Starting Something\\" with the light pop duet of \\"The Girl Is Mine\\" with Paul McCartney. Each song is vastly different, yet each brilliant in its own way. Then there is the title track, the opus of the opus, with a superb extensive addicting danceable song and a Vincent Price narration.My favorite MJ song is \\"Rock With You,\\" part of the nearly-Thriller-good Off The Wall album. But, if you want to hear Michael at his best--Thriller is the album to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"Is there any question why this is the biggest selling album of all time?

It's like nothing but singles. Technically it's only half singles, but you know what I mean. One of the truly flawless albums front-to-back in music history. Quincy Jones did a perfect job producing. Great track sequencing too. I mean 5 seconds into the album you've just got to move. If I made a cd of best dancefloor songs of all-time it would begin with \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something\\".

It is 2 channel, which is how it was recorded and thus sounds more alive and natural than the CD layer sound.

This series affected me almost as strongly as \\"Kanon\\", but the ending with its intertwining of love and loss, duty, honor, respect, nobility, and sacrifice left me with a feeling of almost unendurable poignancy, a powerful emotional confliction and tension that was almost as physical as it was emotional and unique in my experience. (Except in very rare instances I watch all anime in Japanese with subtitles because as anyone who's read any of my other anime reviews knows, I immensely appreciate the skill with which the voice actors/actresses bring their characters to life. Because of this I can't comment on the quality of the dub.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Honeymoon","review":"I'm not buying these and judging by reviews, you aren't either.

Look at the regular episodoes DVD (All 39 episodoes) the price is fair and it has 39 episodoes on it. Now could they not had done the same to the lost episodoes? Thank about it!!!

Not only did I see my own difficult child's behavior in this book, I saw friends and other family children's behaviors in this book too.It discusses relationships as well as how parents carry the burden of raising strong willed children.

I don't think it truly provides solutions to parents that will help them deal with difficult children. The author's approach is very behaviouristic and authoritarian. Most parents would find it hard to do some of the things Turecki suggests. He uses alot of negative labels for children's behaviour; he seems to be stigmatizing these children. It's a very simplistic approach. There are better methods available for helping parents cope with high energy children.

Doubtless Scott would reject me and my concerns as just another difference-denying feminist who wants all women to look alike. I'd expect nothing less from a writer whose characterization of feminists rarely rises above the level of caricature or straw(wo)men whose contours never resemble the actual feminists themselves. Nuance and subtlety apparently have no place in the author's repertoire.

This was definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY Impressive Heat Capacity!","review":"Wow! BOILING hot water first, then poured in as much steaming tea as I could... Stayed hot all day at work, and even into the night once I got home. We are talking a period of over twelve hours. Color me absolutely impressed, floored even. Amazing thermos.Note that this thing is about a foot tall, so don't expect it to tuck into the side of your hiking pack... but should fit into the main compartment of most 24 hour packs just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four Month Failure -- It Worked Until It Didn't","review":"I purchased this product in August 2012, and it worked very well for a time. Hot beverages stayed piping hot for hours and hours. It does seem to seal quite well, and never leaked to the OUTSIDE.Then yesterday, I realized that the outside of the container was hot immediately after I poured in morning tea, and then was cool by the afternoon. Somewhere inside, the vacuum seal has been breached, and the whole thing is shot.Pretty pricey tool just for four months of hot tea, and I would not purchase this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Thermos Ever!","review":"My husband can make coffee in the morning and still open the thermos in the late afternoon an the coffee is still hot!

This is a great buy if you like products that are what they say they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Thermos!","review":"This Thermos is just what I was looking for. It's big enough for me to enjoy four good sized cups of tea (not necessarily the measuring-cup size, maybe bigger), yet small enough not to be bulky or attention-catching. Today I poured piping hot tea at 7:30 a.m. and now at 5:40 pm I am sitting down and enjoying the last cup of tea, which is still very hot! This is a great thermos for people on-the-go who don't have time throughout the day to keep making whatever they're going to be storing in the themos, be it hot tea, coffee or cold drinks. I am very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect thermos","review":"That's it. in 30 yr of using thermoses this is the best one I've ever had.

This thermos is perfect for my purposes!Pros:It keeps iced tea cold or hot tea hot for like 4 or 5 hours.34 ounces is the perfect amount of tea for a session.The cup on top keeps your hands warm if your office/home is cold because the steel heats up really fast with hot liquids.The base is small enough to fit in many cup holders.There aren't really any cons about this thermos. I would recommend not putting anything in it that may stick to the sides because the mouth isn't very wide and cleaning could be difficult.I brew yerba mate in a french press and can drink it all day long with this thermos! :)5/5 for sure! Very good build quality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vacuum insulation failed after six months","review":"I used this thermos to bring my coffee with to work with me. Then it stopped insulating.I'll admit that it worked very well for six months, and I used it every work day. My coffee stayed very hot. Unfortunately, it now won't keep my coffee warm for more that an hour or two.I never dropped it, or slammed it against anything. It has no dents in it, and the stopper still works fine. One day it kept my coffee hot, the next day it didn't. The insulation just stopped insulating.It only worked for six months, that's not acceptable.

I've never tried anything cold, but I'm sure the results would be comparable. I've made morning coffee, filled the thermos, and forgot it at home while I went to work. The next morning out of necessity I had a cup. Still plenty warm to drink when there's nothing else.The only issue I have with it is the shape, which I can't complain about because I saw the picture before I bought it. It's very smooth and will roll away if it tips over on the floor. It's a little difficult to hang onto if your hands are full, so you might consider a Nissan thermos with a handle if you're carrying a lot of things to school or work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product, don't buy!","review":"After 3 months- Leaking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!- Coffee(or tea)gets cold quickly!- bad quality of stainless steel - can't get it clean inside"},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable","review":"MADE IN CHINA.The plastic had an unpleasant odor, so I returned all four that I ordered.

Contrary to the wonderfully lengthy name, it functions rather poorly as a briefcase. Not only did I have to crush my papers to fit inside the narrow opening, but when I poured coffee into the thermos IT SOAKED INTO MY CAREFULLY COMPILED REPORT ON THE JOHNSON ACCOUNT. Weeks of careful case work gone in an instant. Please take my advice and purchase a traditional briefcase instead, and possibly a coffee pot that you can keep at your desk. I know I've learned my lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are these seconds?","review":"Bought my 2 nissan's after the item said in stock and then received notice that it was 1 1/2 month delay. Actually had about 25 day delay. A bit surprising that they came in a plain white box and one had a noticiable ding in the cup. I don't think this happened in shipping based on the good packaging. The other I did not examine before giving as a Christmas gift. Happy enough that I didn't bother with a return."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a FABULOUS thermos!","review":"I'm a law student and I bike to school 3 miles each day. I pretty much can't function without my coffee. Every morning I can brew a pot, dump most of it in this thermos, and screw it shut. I can put it in my backpack (next to my laptop and books) without a single worry that it will leak. And I can ride my bike to school and have piping hot coffee for an entire day.It's hard to find things that work. This thing works as advertised. I would pay $50 for it. It's a steal at $20."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps the heat in","review":"This is a fantastic little thermos! As long as you preheat it, you will have hot coffee for 24hrs +. It's very wellbuilt, and not too big, it will easily fit into most briefcases or shoulder bag. I would highly recommend buying it, if you are in the market for a good vacuum thermos."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so great!","review":"After a month of daily use, I have zero complaints. I fill the thermos with french-pressed coffee, brewed with 200 degree water, every morning and it lasts all day. Even at 2 or 3 PM the coffee still steams when poured, and is sometimes still a bit too hot to drink!The stainless is truly stainless and is well constructed. Right now I work in a metal fabrication shop and my hands are always greasy and dirty. At the end of the day I wipe it down with a shop rag and then wash it well when I get home - still looks brand new!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent thermos","review":"I bought this thermos so I would have something that would keep my tea hot while I drank it at work. This thing is amazing. I had made my tea and put it in the container (priming it with hot water first for about 15 seconds before putting the tea in) and brought it to work. I was so busy at work that I forgot about it and towards the end of my day, I pulled it out expecting maybe lukewarm tea, but it was still steaming hot about 20 hours later. Excellent product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing product","review":"I was a bit skeptical of their temperature preservation claims but I just needed something to keep my coffee drinkable through my first break at work. Much to my surprise the coffee came out steaming hot several hours after I sealed it in there. For my coffee to still be disfiguringly hot after so much time had passed was amazing. Definitely get this thermos over any others."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"Ordered this awhile back. Was thrilled with it. Nice and sleek. No glass. Perfect. In the 90's yesterday and no air so wanted cold cold water. Stuck it in the fridge with just a little water. Took forever for that little bit of water to cool. Finally cool so added my other water already in the fridge. Perfect. Stayed cold. Marvelous. Drank the water in a couple of hours. Luckily I already put the second one in the fridge so it was ready. Put my cold water in it. Thought to myself, I'm going to want to know how much this holds so I better mark it. Turned the thermos upside down. LEAKED ALL OVER. Recapped it and same thing. Tried the first one, and it too leaked. Funny that 2 would leak. Left the one out and didn't stay cold for 24 hours as promised but stayed cold for only a couple of hours. Would not recommend this unless you won't tip it and will use the contents up within a couple of hours. So disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted my money","review":"I had a similar experience as one of the other reviewers. I bought this thermos about a year ago. For months it kept my coffee hot for hours. I hadn't used the thermos for a while, used it yesterday for the first time in months and realized the outside of the thermos felt hot after I put coffee in it. 2 hours later I drink my coffee and BLECH!! it was cold!! What the heck? For the amount of money I paid for this and the name THERMOS, who I thought meant quality, I am very disappointed. Now I don't know what to do with this thing and I have to buy a new one but it will NOT be a Thermos brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange taste of petroleum","review":"Very disappointed. I've previously owned a thermos and have no issue with the taste. This one tasted of petroleum and after soap and water cleaning I noticed the water droplets lining the walls inside seem to stick to it and does not dry up even after 12 hours. It looks like there is an oily film inside. The water tasted metallic and I almost choked from the first mouthful. It's so bad I can feel my throat getting rough from tasting. Do not buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps my coffee hot for hours","review":"I drink plenty of coffee in the office, throughout the morning. This thermos is awesome! It keeps my coffee hot and its easy to clean- just buy a bottle scrubber from Target. No leaks or anything. Looks very nice too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my best Amazon buys!","review":"I bought this for my husband over 2 years ago and it still keeps his coffee steaming hot!There have been days he hasn't had a chance to drink his coffee and when I opened it up the next day the coffee has still been hot! He's a truck driver and this has been dropped many, many times. The cap is so dented up I'm surprised it still screws onto the top. A friend of his gave him a new thermos last Christmas (a different name brand) that costs close to double what I paid for this one. The new one didn't keep things as hot or even last a year. The only thing that would make this better would be adding a handle, but that still is no big deal. This is an excellent buy. The only reason I'm back on this page is I was checking to make sure this is the same one my daughter bought for her boyfriends birthday, he works nights and hot coffee is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with it","review":"GREAT thermos. My tea stays absolutely hot for at least 24 hours - probably longer, I just drink it first.

My wife has a Stanley 1.1 qt, thermos, but she needed it a couple of days a week and it leaks a little so I decided to get my own. This one keeps my coffee warmer, longer than the Stanley did and it doesn't leak. I do wish it had a handle though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product!","review":"I bought this thermos about 3 years ago. It's had on/off duty as an every day thermos during that time and its still holding up like a champ.

I'm actually in the market for another now (larger thermos) and I won't even look at anything that isn't \\"Thermos\\" brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"well made thermos","review":"I use my thermos for only coffee. It doesn't leak and it keeps my coffee hot the whole day. I was originally afraid that it would not hold enough coffee to get me through the day, but I fill my travel mug in the morning and put the rest of the pot in the thermos and it is plenty. I use the thermos on my days off too. Right after my brewer is done brewing, I pour the coffee in my thermos to keep it hot. I never drink coffee that tastes burnt or bitter from being on a burner too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Product","review":"I have been using this for about 3-4 weeks now. I use it to hold dairy. It keeps it cool the whole work day which is more than I was expecting. I have tried some other store bought brands, but Nissan just gets it right. Capacity is perfect, the cup/lid works great and secures easily. My only gripe if any would be the plug, it seals so tight that sometimes I have to use my shirt to get it started (it's hard to get a grip on the plug, they could have put more tread on it). I still give it five because the thing will not leak once it's sealed, that is worth hassling with the plug."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this bottle!","review":"I was looking for a way to carry my coffee with me all day, and this has worked beautifully for me. I brew a 50 ounce pot in the morning, fill my travel mug, and put the balance in the bottle. Throughout the day, I'm able to easily refill my travel mug from the bottle.The features that were important to me were size, heat retention, reliable seal, ease of pouring (often done at stop lights), drip-free pouring, and ease of cleaning. On all accounts, this bottle has been a huge success. I'm even using it in the evening for my tea--I just throw a bag into the bottle, fill with boiling water, and sip all evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps coffee hot all day long","review":"I bought this thermos to save coffee expenses during long trips.

I bought one in the 90's, and took it to work everyday. Living in America's premier Banana Republic had made me wary of crooks, and though I worked for the Federal Government, I kept it under lock and key when not in use. I noticed an ex-cop I worked with, had formed an attachment to my thermos, and years passed as I flaunted it when he was around. To make a long story short, one day I was very busy, and thought he couldn't possibly know it was unprotected that one day. I was wrong. He did. He gloated for years to privately torment me. Now I have one thermos for the price of two. My brother's theory of soaking his shiny new tools in salt water, saying shiny things drive thieves crazy, proved true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does't work after half year","review":"It is very bad quality.

It's true that it won't keep things hot for near as long as some of the mirror flasks out there, but it also doesn't shatter into a mess of broken glass and scalding liquid if you set it down too hard (having that happen once was enough). Keeps coffee piping hot for 8 hours- that's all I need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best","review":"I got one because my husband had one and raved about it. I had an iced drink in it that i left over the weekend at work. No ice on Monday, but it was still cold. Right now i'm using it for iced drinks and it keeps ice chunks in it all day.

It works so well and is the perfect size for a pot of tea to take with you. I also have aThermos Nissan 61 Ounce Stainless Steel Bottle w/ Folding Handlethat is just too big for everyday use. This is perfect and keeps drinks warm (or cold) or hours. It also looks as pretty as the day I bought it after months of use. It won't scratch or get dings in it, even if you drop it. It also is very safe to put in your bag and carry. No leaks whatsoever. I really can't recommend this enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome thermos","review":"So I bought this thermos hoping my coffee would stay warm through a long day of studying. It seems well constructed, stainless steel so I'm not too worried about anything happening to it, or it getting dinged up if I chuck it out my window.I thought I would run a little experiment and test it out how long my coffee would stay warm. I brewed some coffee last night at 9pm, and it's 9am now and its still warm- it's not steaming too heavily but it's warm enough to drink, which is all I need.You have to make sure the screw on cap is on tight, and put the lid back on top. I forgot to put the lid back on top the other day and the coffee was cold after about 5/6 hours.Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the company claims 24hrs. While this has not been experimentally confirmed, I doubt it would stay warm that long. Still, it's good enough to serve my purpose!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing!","review":"This is the best thermos! I make my coffee at 6am and at 3pm it is still hot!

I certainly expected an upgrade. While the bottle seals well and performs well, my only complaint is the cover. I typically use the cover as the \\"cup\\" for the beverage I'm toting. The black plastic inside the cover apparently isn't meant for hot liquids because a toxic plastic-like smell is produced when hot liquids are poured into the cover. Because this changes how I use the bottle, I'm disappointed.If you typically carry cold liquids or aren't interested in using the cover as a cup, then I think you would be very happy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Thermos - 25 bucks down the drain.","review":"I originally wrote a great review for this but after a month it no longer keeps my coffee warm for more than an hour - I am unable to exchange it since the exchange date expired while I was on vacation - I returned and it will no longer do its job - what a waste of funds.

I ride my bicycle to work year round and never had found a truly spill-proof solution so i didnt get coffee in my bag. Well, not i have. This thing has such an air tight seal.

The other 2 has lasted for 3+ years without issue. This one has a stopper that broke in just a very short time. There is a silicone/TPR seal at the bottom of the stopper, and a very thin piece of plastic supporting the silicone/TPR seal in place. As a result, a chunk of the support plastic has broken off. Worse, it broke off into 2 thin, sharp pointed pieces that ended up inside the Thermos. And when I ended up making a drink for my young toddler, these pieces went into his milk. He could have easily choked on them! Bad design!! Not fail safe.Called Thermos customer service and they offered to SELL me a replacement stopper. Will not buy another Thermos product.

However, if you've heard of trafficking in human organs, then this work on skims the surface.I really like Lisa Ling. What a pretty young lady! Still, it's hard for me to take her seriously after seeing her on \\"The View.\\" At least her performance here wasn't as silly as in \\"China's Lost Girls.\\"I hate when docs brush over issues of inequality and I applaud this doc for not doing that. The work emphasizes that rich individuals are benefiting from the body parts of the poor. Those in the First World are getting over on those in the Third.The work ends on a positive note, mentioning that microchips may be made in the future that can do what body parts can no longer do. They show a woman who is about to get a transplant and she could have been my aunt, grandmother, or other black lady down the street.If folk have given a lot of attention to \\"blood diamonds,\\" then they should really work to address this tragedy too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective, poor craftsmanship","review":"Cute lunch bag, but very disappointed in the quality.

Personally, as much as I admire much of Warhol's art, I found his films and his entourage to be a little disconcerting. Sleeze. Narcotics. Hopelessness and boredom. Trashy. Brigid Berlin, as it turns out, was set apart from classic Warhol-like apathy. She was a more purposeful part of the group, and a legitimate artist on her own. This film gives us nice insight into a privileged but troubled childhood, a supreme eating disorder which (I bet) a lot more of us can recognize than not, and an ongoing struggle to walk, to maintain balance on a narrow rail from which either side threatens chaos or despair. Ms. Berlin still has a few things to say. Most interesting of all, this is not a tragedy. This is a story of what happens when the young ultra-hip grow up. (The scene that turns out to be a parody of Warhol's Chelsea Girls is really top-notch comedy.) A wonderful, flawless, brilliant documentary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"That's it?","review":"I picked this book up for $2.00 at a used bookstore this afternoon and just finished reading it. I really feel like I wasted my two dollars as well as several hours of my life. I felt sure that I'd missed something, so I came onto Amazon and hoped that someone could show me what.The sad thing is, I don't think I did. Another reviewer described this book as \\"blasphemous\\" in some parts, and I tend to agree. Here is just a dumbed down Christianity. Take away all the rough edges, and make it mostly about a floating around \\"free spirit\\" just discovering his own personal journey, mannnn. To be honest, Mr Blue reminded me of Barefoot Ted's portrayal in \\"Born to Run,\\" just not as insightful. I finished this book and was offended, mostly because I felt like I'd been cheated out of time I could have spent reading the Gospels and focusing on the ACTUAL message of Jesus, instead of... well, whatever this is..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic not to be missed","review":"I first read \\"Blue\\" in high school; then again right after college and finally, three years ago when I retired (Sr. Citizen). It's impact is as enormous as it was when I read it as a teenager; in fact, depite its being a little dated, I find more more to think about and, yes, even emulate in my later years. I volunteer at a high security prison now and this is my gift to anyone who graduates with a GED/Associates degree, college undergrad diploma/is confirmed in his church/whatever he accomplishes.

He is not afraid to fly kites, sleep on roof tops, and write letters to heaven. He is a poet, and artist, an idealist, and a noble soul. I have never been touched so deeply by any character before I met blue. Read this book, and look at life a whole new way. I laughed and then I cried my heart out. This is a book for the soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopefully, we're all a little Blue","review":"It becomes easy to have empathy for Connolly's main character, because his ever-so-simple-lifestyle holds an attraction for those of us who lead complex, complicated, technology-laden 21st century lives. At first, we find Blue to be eccentric, but gradually come to realize that WE are the eccentric ones, and it is Blue who recognizes and lives a spirituality of simplicity, grounded in gratitude.

Unfortunately, quite a few developments have occurred since it was written - for example, the new AES encryption standard is not covered. And some of the coverage of legal and political issues is now obsolete - a lot has happened in this area in the past few years. It's still a very good book, but it needs an update."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves all five stars!","review":"As a layman to crypto, I found this book fascinating. It offers great insight to the technologies, and specifically analyzes several algorithms.This is widely considered the de facto text on the subject. I can see why - the text is comprehensive, and the format is very readable. It takes the reader from layman to technical - you can read this at any level and still get great value from it.Using this book, I've been able to solidify my understanding of the different technologies. Schneier's analysis of numerous algorithms has proven invaluable - both in selecting an algorithm, as well as assessing the security of commercial systems.I've had my copy for a couple of years, and it's been a constant reference. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bible of the Crypto-world","review":"For anyone working or studying the crypto-world (IT Security, Cryptographer, Cryptologists, PKI/PGP/SecureID Technologists, etc.) this is a must read.For the fascinating world of Cryptography (the practical application of Cryptology) this is an essential textbook that any graduate course of digital security and cryptology should include. It is inteded as a reference book as well as a practical book to have handy for the working professional.It's no wonder the NSA had asked the author not to publish this book. It leaves the Crypto-world naked to the average viewer/reader!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Excellent, highly technical. Need Math Background.","review":"A very good book that describes every possible aspect of cryptography from square one to Russian ciphers. Very clear and technical, a plus o me but a minnus to others. Be sure you are intrested in this topic and have a good mathematical/computer background before buying this book. If so, this is one of the greatest books you'll ever buy. It's in my top 10 in my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"The foundations outlined in the first three parts of the book are strengthened with a practical language and I sum up. I received the book few days ago and it impressed me the form in which arrives to the reader, in the personal thing the knowledge of the book they will help me to strengthen my knowledge in cryptography. Maybe with images of digital certificates the book would have bigger back, although for the year of edition it is understandable."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE source for information on cryptography.","review":"If you are interested in understanding cryptography, this book should be at your side. Mr. Schneier has produced a book that speaks to beginners as well as experts. This volume includes source code for popular algorithms and is highly recommended for those who wish to be informed on the most widely used algorithms.Only gets 4 stars because much recent information is not in the book. Hopefully the author is working on an update that will include the latest advances.(I would have given it 4.5 stars if it was possible)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introductory to crypto!!!","review":"Are you scared reading those CRYPTO, EUROCRYPT, ESORICS... papers?

It does not go into mathematical proofs. I read the first version from cover to cover, however this edition, the second, is too large. It has become more of a reference book, although still very readable in parts. My only disappointment is the lack of good coverage of extremely high-speed cryptography like SEAL or MISTY or in depth explanations of secure computer network protocols like Novell's NetWare 4 RSA/GQ key exchange or Microsoft's NT hash-oriented key exchange. Also a more complete coverage of smart card technology would be nice. Basically this will get a competent engineer up to speed with 5 year old cryptography. This is still better than most alternatives like mathematics books or high-level overview books that are vague on details"},{"rating":"2","title":"The all-time best crypto reference ever","review":"Sometimes you must choose either clarity (for the newbies) or in-depth obscure explanations (for the experts). Bruce Schneier has done the great job of joining the two aspects together. He explains things clearly and even playfully. He enjoys teaching, he enjoys cryptography and you can tell it from his style. But he does not stop there: he explains things in depth whenever possible and useful, and tries to explain how a cryptosystem is evaluated, how to choose between algorithms, and how to correctly implement cryptography in your works. This book is an absolute must have for everyone interested in cryptography, and can substitute very well even an academic course on the matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding tour de force","review":"This is an astounding book. It's technically very detailed but not *too* mathematical for us mere mortals.

Repetitious, drawn-out, painful explanation of terms. Nothing serious, nothing in-depth. Sounds professional but hollow.

Man oh man, is there a lot of talk--yak yak yak. All technical issues are detoured, inviting the reader to check out the references listed at the end of the book (all I have to buy is 1,643 references--gee, thanks). I find it disheartening that a 700 page book on cryptography doesn't give out a lick of information on the actual subject. If you like a bunch of talk and some hand waving explanations, then this book is definitely for you. Engineers and computer programmers may not be satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"No CD","review":"I feel totally ripped off. What idiot would publish code these days with no CD or download.

He makes no bones about his life and loves. I think if David were a teen idol in the 90s, it would be so different. He was an idol in the 70s, when it was cool to be young & hip. Now, people can take him and his career more seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"AS AUTOBIOGRAPHIES GO...","review":"David Cassidy and The Partridge Family were a gigantic part of my youth -- nobody could have loved them more than I did growing up. It is not the stripping away of the myth and the magic of the Partridge factory that I dislike so intensely about this book -- it is the badly written prose, and self-involved wallowing that turned me off. You would think that if David chose to use a real author to help him put his incredibly compelling (and it is) story down on paper, it would read like a real BOOK. This reads like the teenage diary of someone who definitely needs a lot more therapy - and should learn how to punctuate sentences at that. Have no fear, I will always love you David, but a book writer you are not. Maybe one day someone will do you justice in a much-less-subjective biography, one that does not take itself quite as seriously as you and your friend Chip do here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected!!","review":"I was a bit disappointed in this book. Althoughthis did have some insightfull moments into ateen idol's feelings and frustrations, it turned into a brag book of sexual encounters!! The book does not help Mr. Cassidy gain the respect he so desperately wants, precisely because he sounds like a bragging teen, trying to show he is not a virgin!! Certain revelations are really tasteless such as bragging about penis size, and his re- jection of Susan Dey's sexual advances!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"His True Hollywood Story","review":"I never heard about this book when it came out, but after I saw E's True Hollywood Story I sought it out on an online auction. I was fortunate enough to be the high bidder among many many bidders. I couldn't put the book down and read it from cover to cover with fascination and a renewed respect for David Cassidy.

Every David Cassidy fan should read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading, insightful, funny, sad, and naughty!!!!","review":"I read this book after seeing David in Las Vegas. I really enjoyed this book. Yes, he had alot of sex. Some of the stories are hilarious! (Barbara the Butter Queen) David didn't try to sugar coat his life.

I admire this man and I find myself to now be a true fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"New Book is Better","review":"If you are interested in the constant whining of this guy, who is now a lounge lizard in Vegas and would be selling shoes in Fresno if not for the Partridge Family, try his more recent autobiography, published in England, \\"COULD IT BE FOREVER.\\" It's more forthcoming and a little less self-serving than this title, and it updates his father's death and his relationship with his half-brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a true David Cassidy fan....","review":"...then you have to buy this book. It tells you about the REAL David Cassidy, not the made up image portrayed on the Partridge family.

He has laid bare all his flaws including drugs, sex and alcohol while portraying the likable Keith on \\"The Partridge Family\\". It proves once and for all that what you see on TV and on the big screen is all an act. We sometimes get so involved that we expect our actors to be the characters they portray.

It kept your head out of water but the lower part wet to keep cool in 103 degree heat.After floating into the side of the pool and pushing off gently with a foot, the right side of the seat tore away from the inflated side/back piece rendering the Lounge useless and the user very wet. The very small repair kit that is included with the item wouldn't begin to handle the repair job that was required so it was returned for a refund.I think the fault is in the actual design of the float - the seat part is basically heat glued/attached to the smooth side of the back and arm piece and not sewn or heat seal-incorporated into any kind of seam that would make it stronger and more durable.We're really disappointed that it failed because it had such promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the non-durability!","review":"Love Love Love this floatie!

There is no plot to these books, just an endless series of events. The characters are introduced at a mind numbing pace and seem to be brough in only to maintain the supply of corpses. Each death is more bizzare and pointless than the last. Sexual encounters are equally random and pointless. One character loses the love of his life and manages to overcome his grief only through a sadomastochistic threeway with an Empress and her lackey. The only reason I gave this book two stars instead of one is the detailed descriptions of circus life in the 19th century. A non-fiction book would have made better use of Jenning's legendary research. In fact, you could go through this with a pair of scissors and cut out the \\"story\\" and probably end up with a reasonable facimile of the author's notebook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Resolved--Buy It, Show It To Your Kids","review":"This documentary is fun, educational, and provides great inspiration for any kid.

He says that he will pay them $300 a month and will give them 3 months in advance. For one job? I guess the director was lettign us know he is rich. Anyways, one of the guys can REALLY kick and I think that I recognize him as Fong Yeh's son from 10 Magnificent Killers. Sadly he only has about 5 minutes of fighting time.

Some of his work is quoted directly, but not much. Swedenborg himself is easy to understand, and there is no need for the condescending paraphrases of the author. His introduction, which takes up a good 20 percent of the book, is not needed for an understanding of Swedenborg and does nothing to provide a context for Swedenborg's work, which is highly original both historically and theologically speaking.

And I've read many--but most are simple rehashes of the handful of original ideas found in the rest. Barbara Geraghty's Visionary Selling stands out and is a nice addition to any sales library. Uniquely, author Geraghty provides a step by step formula for getting in synch with your C-level prospect's vision. If you've successfully sold to CEOs (and I have) you'll know that they don't really care about the details of your product's features and benefits - so forget boning up on product knowledge. What they do care about is realizing their personal or corporate vision. If you can prove to a chief executive (or any other C- or Chief- level executive) that your product or service will help them do that, you're in. This book shows you, in detail, how to demonstrate you \\"grok\\" their vision, so at least you have a chance.I'd rate this book a definite \\"worth reading.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Do It For Me","review":"Visionary Selling didn't strike me as particularly visionary.
