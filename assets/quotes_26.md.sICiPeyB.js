No \\"5 star\\" album should have tracks that you automatically skip, like 'teachers', 'rollin and scratchin' and 'oh yeah'.

Much more catchy tracks on Discovery. Discovery just took this album and shot it multiple times.

Just go here: http://www.amazon.com/Discovery-Daft-Punk/dp/B000059MEKThank you and DO NOT buy this album.

It seems Daft Punk really improved with subsequent albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"a master piece","review":"I gotta say that I was very surprised when I read the reviews already existing because I didn't find them very helpful at all.To me, homework is certainly one of the best house music cds ever, and by far. For people that like hard house, rollin'& scratchin' is for you, it is just perfect! I don't know how people can like this cd but don't like this track, it s just awesome. It is a very eclectic cd, which takes you from the crowded beginning of the night with \\"around the world\\", and brings you to other places with \\"Rollin' & Scratchin'\\" passing by \\"Burnin'\\". All those tracks will make you dance all by yourself in your room, and will make you have the time of your life! Don't miss it, definitely a master piece.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good house","review":"I bought this because most of these songs were in the clubs in Europe while I was living there.

Although not every track is a gem,(be wary of \\"Oh Yeah\\", \\"Rock N roll\\" and Rollin N Scratchin[unless u like german hardcore techno!]), the cd is a virtual built in rave! Stand-out traks for most bumpage are \\"indo silver club\\", \\"revolution 909\\", my personal fave- \\"hi-fidelity\\" and of course \\"da funk\\".

While being 12 years of age back then it was just the age to critically follow music. It was the year \\"Unfinished Sympathy\\" was released in Holland, and became a massive hit, being at the number 1 spot for several weeks. The voice of Shara Nelson and the beats made this track unforgettable. And I still didn't forgot it.Now, 12 years later, I'm in the position to explore music better than ever. I thought let's listen to \\"Blue Lines\\" with that hitsong on it. I must say that I was thrilled by the music. The strong \\"Safe from Harm\\" is a track worthy of a begin of an album. The second track, \\"One Love\\" was a little disappointing in my ears, but it was fully compensated by the rest of the tracks, with \\"Be Thankful for What You've Got\\", \\"Five Man Army\\", of course \\"Unfinished Sympathy\\" and the brilliant ending \\"Hymn of the Big Wheel\\". This album is worth while listening to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better as historical artifact than as music","review":"While it's obvious to hear this and think \\"Oh, so THIS is where Portishead came from...\\" (not to mention band alumnus Tricky) it's not in and of itself all that wonderful musically. The backing tracks are fairly decent and probably more interesting than the singing/rapping...and definitely moreso than the vocals.The three best songs here are \\"Safe from Harm\\",their cover of 70s hit \\"Be Thankful for What You've Got\\", and closer \\"Hymn of the Big Wheel\\".I can't compare this to their later albums, but I do know that I've found Tricky's solo work more compelling than what's here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introducing","review":"It's interesting to view this album through the lens of history. Whether aware of it or not, most music fans are quite familiar with Massive and the long shadow they've cast over pop music. But 11 years ago, the mix of musical styles that would later come to be termed (somewhat simplistically) trip-hop was new and invigorating. Listening to it in 2002, \\"Blue Lines\\" has the effect of taking you back to the year of your choice: 1975 (\\"Be Thankful For What You've Got\\"), 1988 (\\"Daydreaming\\"); 1991 (\\"Lately\\"). Yet, this album is no retro piece. Instant classics like \\"Safe From Harm\\", \\"Unfinished Sympathy\\", and \\"Five Man Army\\" herald new approaches to hip-hop and dance music in particular, and pop music in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good CD, except for one song...","review":"I could listen to \\"Unfinished Sympathy\\" and \\"Hymn of the Big Wheel\\" for hours before I switched tracks. They are gooood songs. The only real qualm I have about this CD is one other song. Just one song... \\"Blue Lines\\". I don't know why I don't like it. I just don't. Why did they entitle their CD \\"Blue Lines\\"? I thought, since they named this CD, which graced the world with \\"Unfinished Sympathy\\", with that song, it would be a gooood song. Maybe the reason why I dislike Blue Lines so much is mainly due to disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry_for_my_eng_MA_/\\"admirer","review":"--is it important to make a right step not falling down?

It's that simple. Mezzanine is a superb album full of scary tunes with good rhythm, whereas Blue Lines is a somewhat disjointed album full of mostly rap songs.

These two alone can't carry the whole album over the line seperating average from good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish was instrumental","review":"Just saw \\"The Insider\\" directed by Michael Mann.

Don't get me wrong, it's a good album (Unfinished Sympathy is amazing), but it's just a pale shadow of Mezzanine. It must have been amazing when it was first released but it just doesn't hold up when you know where MA has gone since. The music for Mezzanine is so much more complex and scary (it really affects you when you listen to it late at night or while you're writing a story) than Blue Lines' and 3D's voice on this earlier album doesn't even compare to his menacing rapping on Mezzanine. Blue Lines is a great debut but listen to Mezzanine to truly hear a band that is top five best in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad,sad,sad","review":"After listening to \\" Protection\\" i believed all the hype about this one.Apart from the first song and a couple more,I find this album generally boring"},{"rating":"2","title":"very different but enjoyable","review":"mezzanine got me started with the m.a. crew; this is a VERY different sound, but impressive. shara wilson's soulful voice on \\"safe from harm\\" and \\"unfinished sympathy\\" and \\"lately\\" are the gems.compared to the dark lumberings of mezzanine, this stuff is bright, optimistic and very catchy. it's hard to imagine that this was produced 8 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very avant garde...","review":"This album is must-have for any one who listens to this genre... the soul of this album has been stolen from repeatedly since its release in 1991 but what is it that they say about leaders and their sheep?

But just as impressive is how Massive Attack uses their genre-inventing sound to frame and mix a variety of established musical styles, including hip-hop, reggae and soul. They mix these elements seamlessly and the musical alchemy reaps intoxicating rewards. Much of Blue Lines' success is due to the sublime performances from the album's three vocalists: rapper Tricky, reggae artist Horace Andy and R&B crooner Shara Nelson. Everything comes together so smoothly on Blue Lines that the casual listener might not even notice how groundbreaking it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"The birth of a sound...","review":"Massive's characteristic low haunting bass lines overlayed with heartfelt yet sleepy lyrics gave birth to an entire genre. This album is undoubtedly the influence behind many similar bands that would come later and fall under the genre of \\"trip hop\\". ie/portishead, morcheeba, tricky (obviously!), sneaker pimps, etc.This album is the womb of trip hop and is a joy to listen to, minus one or two dull moments.

No regrets!The only issue that I would bring up has nothing to do with the TV, it is more an issue with the status of the cable industry. HD television looks amazing on the TV, but standard definition always leaves something to be desired.

After being informed by multiple Toshiba reps that I was in the window to receive assistance I was informed NOTHING would be covered and I was responsible for the cost of the part and repairs. What a joke for a higher end flat panel. One year and almost $4000.00 down the old crapper. Such a shame since I really liked that tv."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seeing red with motion blur","review":"Everything I read stated the Toshiba REGZA was a good purchase. It only took a few minutes of viewing to realize that either my set was bad or the TV was over-rated. An obvious problem with red bleeding through light colors, especially white, was impossible to remedy. I tinkered with all settings and was not able to keep the red out. If watching a show with a white wall in the background, huge areas of red pixels would flicker. Anything white had the same effect, a shirt, text, forehead..it was beyond annoying. Also, I really purchased the TV for sports. After 1 hockey game, I was ready to return the set. The players moved too quickly and the 60 Hz refresh rate would make the players lag or show ghosts or look fuzzy, even in HD. If you plan on watching sports or fast moving object, you must get a TV with a refresh rate of 120 Hz. I found this out the hard way. i recently purchased a Samsung 52\\" with a 120 Hz and it is like night and day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screen defect appeared two months later","review":"I purched this tv two months ago.

Everytime when it is a light colored a picture, you can see it -- looks just like an airplane coming over from a distance. I actually don't think it is a scratch mark. I think the screen somehow did it by itself. I want to return it. But it's already more than two months. Hopefully Amazon would still let me return it, even if that means I need to pay a fee.There are two other things I don't like about this tv.1. The black frame. It makes the pictures appear to be darker. The silver frame tvs look much better. Wish I noticed that difference before my purchase. But Toshiba got such a good rating.

In my experience I can hear the shredder working with less effort immediately after inserting one of these sheets into the shredder.They are half the size of what they're supposed to be, so I obviously can't give this a five star rating. If you're concerned about the smaller than advertised size, use two sheets for good measure. It won't harm the shredder and it'll work much better.

Human sacrifice has never been proven and fabricated by the white Spaniards in order to justify rape and genocide the same way the Jews were demonized. THAT'S the truth. We had a very strict penal code, which explains the display of skulls, but no more than the American customs of today. If you come across some bones, automatically it's ''sacrifice.''

The only reason I gave it two stars was I can't possibly think that any book would deserve just one. Ms. Kalogridis attempts to mimic Stoker's style (the fact the book is written diary-like) but it would have been just as well to write in third person. Stoker's was believable, this one is just boring. The only excitement occurs in the last chapter and it's really a dismal attempt to \\"shock\\" the reader. It fails. The book helped kill time, but so would reading an encyclopedia.

My only complaint, and the reason I gave it four stars vs. five, was that it was very very short, and I felt the three books should have been one masterpiece of a novel. There really was new vampire material here, very interesting background, and something to sink your teeth into! I've read two of Laurell Hamilton's Anita Blake books, and this book was better.

You can't compare the two and you shouldn't because they are two very different albums. If you need to make a comparison, it is more Stardust \\"Music Sounds Better\\" than Daft Punk's \\"Homework\\". If you like upbeat, housey, disco beats with vocoder samples (by Daft Punk and New Jersey's own Romanthony AND Todd Edwards!!)I urge you to buy this CD--you won't be sorry!

But Daft Punk is less soulful and more electronically sterile. Still, the variation in the songs is remarkably high - my compliment for that.Songs like 'Veridis Quo' and 'One More Time' do possess a certain charm.

The French aren't known for their music, but I was very impressed.When this came out I hoped it would offer more of the same: A few cheese tracks, but a few great ones thrown in. Apparently not. These guys must have had a change of taste in music. This album is one of the worst things I've ever heard.The first time I heard 'one more time' I thought it must not be the same band.

Sure, maybe the music is purely electronic...but this album belongs in the R & B or popular sections of music stores. Musically, Discovery doesn't impress me very much. The video for One More Time is interesting, but the song by itself isn't anything to get excited about. Most of the album chugs along at a slow pace, and I like my electronic music fast and intelligent. If you want some real techno, check out artists like Astral Projection, Man With No Name, and even Evil's Toy or Funker Vogt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disco is Disco, Trance is Trance","review":"I probably should have listened to this album before actually purchasing it, but I guessed that my admiration for the past work of the Daft Punk duo would suffice as a recommendation. I guessed wrong. Apparently they decided to mix disco into trance and come up with an amazing compilation. What they ended up with was a list of candy-coated nothing. None of the great anthemic house/trance/techno stlyes are here, with the exception of a few light beats near the end of the CD. Everything else features trite vocals and slap-base. Don't get me wrong, I like disco music, and I like trance music. But \\"Discovery\\" attempts to intertwine the two without sucess. Pass this one up unless a project with Kool and the Gang, Ford, and Diana Ross sounds attractive to you. This is the first Daft Punk album that I felt embarrased to have running when waiting at stop lights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoyingly Stessful","review":"Only good song is Harder Better Faster Stronger.

I loved \\"Homework\\" when it came out, but when I first heard some of the tracks from this new album I could barely beleive what I was hearing. Many of the tracks on \\"Discovery\\" sound like an embarrassing parody of their old stuff. I bought the album anyway after reading the reviews, and on the first play I enjoyed it, but then I played it again and realised that there is very little origninal material on this new album. On top of that, many of these track just won't get played in a club because of the embarrassing 80-style production, obnoxious and cheesy vocals, and breakdowns left, right and centre. There are about three good tracks here, the rest contain some great daft punk sampling techniques but they need to be completely remixed. The raw, underground sound of \\"Homework\\" is gone aswell.

The songs are all different and all have a beat you can dance to.

I don't think this was meant to be taken seriously, it has no pretensions, it's just to enjoy. Daft Punk really know how to give apparently simple music an X-factor of pleasure.

This album is not like \\"Homework,\\" but in its own respect, do we really want it to be? The great thing about music is that it allows the artists to experiement and try new things. I would rather have an album of new and different music instead of an album full of re-hashed beats that I had already heard three years ago. For pleasentries sake, check out \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger,\\" as well as \\"Aerodynamic\\" and \\"Digital Love.\\" All are great tracks with playful beats and great synths.

It's near impossible to listen to songs like, \\"One More Time\\", or \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger,\\" and not dance. All the songs will have some entrancing effect. Honestly, Daft Punk is underrated, in my opinion. They're one of those artists, that I think few people know about, but truly deserve to be more renowned. \\"Discovery\\" has a good collection of Dance music, perfect for a party, and has soft, flowing sounds to settle down to. (Night Vision comes to mind...) Overall, give it a try, you'll probably find at least one song you will like.

When Daft Punk shows up on the covers of ten of the best-circulated dance music magazines in existence in a six-week period, I start to worry. I buy the disc, and discover it's (1) really repetitive, (2) cheesy in an ironic but ultimately not engaging way, and (3) being touted as the new new thing in dance music. This stinks, man.

But it is a great album and it's one of Daft Punk's best albums. There isn't any music in this album that I don't like.The album cover that comes with this includes some background on each track: lyrics, who sung, etc. And on the opposite side of the album cover there is a poster of Daft Punk.

All of the tracks are tight, with more of a house tempo than Homework. To describe this album in 1 word, I would have to say Funky. Really Funky. There are a few tracks on Homework i didn't care too much for, but Discovery is right on. Most of the tracks are under 4 minutes, which means they don't drag on. The long wait for this album ..., but you gotta pick it up. It's easily going to be a classic right next to Homework. .... Go buy the album already."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best 'disco' house cd of all time...","review":"Homework. Alive. All those were cool, esp. homework which I highly recommend. But NONE of them have the impact of discovery. People have criticized this for not being modern enough as far as electronica as a genre--but some people just don't know what they're buying or listening too. Being a fan of both disco and vocal house this was all love for me; all admirers of the genre: do not miss this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD rocks!","review":"This is one of my favorite CDs. It's original, upbeat, kind of house, kind of mainstream. What can I say, if you like Dance, and House, you'll definitely like this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"One More Time","review":"One More Time has been my favourite song for a long time, so when they released the album Discovery I had to buy it. Discovery is full of great new tracks like the forthcoming track Aerodynamic , and other great songs like Night Vision, Voyager and High Life. This album is different to Homework which I think is great as they have progressed like most groups should. Excellent album!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Man, is this repetitive","review":"I'm not a big dance music fan, so maybe others won't mind. But I guess this CD is made for dancing, not for listening to, because boy does each song go on for way too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rock fan salutes this dance and disco album","review":"I've been a rock fan my whole life so far. And I've got to say, for being a dance music kind of group, this stuff is pretty darn good. Daft Punk has some of the best vocals that I've ever heard.The synthesized music is great too. So, I'm begging those merciful rock fans out there, give this album achance. You might like it. I recomend this CD to Dance music veterans and new comers too."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment...","review":"This album is a total disappointment... The CD features two good songs, the rest you can throw away... You'd think they could come up with something pretty awesome after a three year break but don't bother with buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"what was going on in the heads of these people when they made this cd? i unfortunately bought discovery after hearing one more time, under the belief that all the songs were that good. wow. i was so disappointed cause the rest of the album was unbeleivably bad. i learned my lesson - i will never again buy a cd without listening to all the songs on it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have downloaded the MP3 of \\"One More Time\\" instead...","review":"That was really the only worthwhile track on the CD. This purchase confirmed my sneaking suspicion (obtained via several vain attempts to have a good time clubbing in France) -- i.e., the French do not rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"wha??","review":"Snoooooooooooooooooooooooooze. Party album? I'd hate to be atTHAT party then. Boring album considering why I purchased it. There'sa couple great parts, but usually ended by something slow. For DaftPunk, I'm disappointed...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought it... sold it - Same sound repeated over and over","review":"I bought this album out of curiosity, after I had heard the opening track, \\"One More Time.\\" That ONE track was awesome, but I was dissapointed to find out that the rest of the album is very, very similar in sound. I think they're beeing overrated. Sorry... I know I might be offending some of their fans, but I really didn't like this work. As I said in the title of the review, I sold it. I give it 2.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Overrated","review":"I've never understood the appeal of Daft Punk. \\"Around the World\\" is probably the only track by them that I like. Everyone raved about this album the week it was released and the catchy, \\"One More Time\\" hit the airways chronically.Of course I bought it that week also, and probably thought a little (but not by much) more strongly about it at the time. Listening to this album today on the other hand, truly unmasks how aweful it really is. Daft Punk may know how to create a few tracks that will make it into the pop top 40, but these guys have very little talent when it comes to quality electronica.2/5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best cd ever!!!","review":"I think that Discovery is a great cd, except that only the first 5 songs are good. One more time has great music, and great words, but is kinda repetative. I still like it. Digital Love is ok, but it is kind of silly in the begining. Aerodynamic is an AMAZING song. with the mix of techno guitar, techno percussion, and sfx, its the secound best song on the whole cd. Harder, better, faster, stronger is the all time best song i have ever heard. Between the music, the techno voice, and sfx, i love it. I especcially like the part after the chorus (work it harder, make it better, do it faster makes us stronger, holin never power faster, hour work is never over), and the part after that, where they morf the voice with a guitar. Crecendolls is very good, and it has the 2nd best music on the cd (Aerodynamic gets 1st place), but the words are a little strange. I give it 4 stars, only because only the 1st 5 songs are good. But it still is a great cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not all great but really darn good","review":"The album first four, or five counting Crescendolls if you don't mind the repetitiveness (a bit much) are very solid, can keep you feet or mind from moving tracks. Somewhere after that though it falls into subpar tracks, just too much tricking out on one not-so good groove or beat until you get to Face to Face which, despite what some reviewers said, isn't all that bad. The vocals, both male and female work, the song works. So six, maybe seven tracks work, the other are okay as background music. So, you're thinking, \\"he gave it four stars when he only liked half the disc?\\" Exactly, because those six or seven tracks that do succeed, especially four of them, are worth the price of the album. Heck, the breakdown on Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger with the pitch keys is worth the album, great tune. Buy it, try it, you'll like (most) of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent new music!","review":"What a find! I came across this artist on the radio one day and couldn't wait to run out and buy their cd. Each track is fun to listen to, very upbeat and infectious. Dance, exercise, drive or just relax to the sound. You will enjoy this music whether or not you are a fan of new music and it will be one you'll keep on hand in your disk changer for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique","review":"I kinda bought this album on a whim, which i dont normally do, and am glad I did so. Discovery turned out to be exactly what my CD collection needed, something a little different, fun, up-beat, and unique. My favorites are \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\" for its free-for-all funk, and \\"Something about Us\\" because of it's smooth R&B groove, and \\"Face to Face\\" with a little 80's retro funk. Daft Punk's style seems to be an ingenious blend of disco, house, funk and electronica. It can always put me in a good mood! I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And I thought it couldn't get any better","review":"I've owned this album on CD and MP3 formats for many years, and it is among my top favorites. I have DJ'ed many places and songs from this album always end up in my playlists and are always a hit, no matter the crowd.Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, I decided to purchase this album in Vinyl. It changed the way I look at the album. Definitely one of the best, and even better in the purest format known to man.If you haven't heard this album, you must, and if you can, hear it on Vinyl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daft Punk Takes On... Disco!","review":"This was the album that launched Daft Punk into the mainstream. Runaway success hits like \\"One More Time\\", \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\", and \\"Digital Love\\" appealed to the music lovers who weren't even fond of their debut. Make no mistake, this is Daft Punk for the mainstream audience. Its here on Discovery that you hear them deviate away from their signature style of pounding house beats coupled with catchy grooves and replaces it with melodic synths and emotional vocoder-treated verse/chorus lyrics. Fortunately, that doesn't matter too much because at its core, its still good music. Its the first time that you could say Daft Punk's music almost sounds... how should we put it?... Cute... like a robot puppy dog. For those who favor Homework, there's still something to love here. \\"Superheroes\\" is a powerful track with a catchy repeating vocal sample (\\"Somethings in the air\\") that will have you recalling the energy that Homework had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best daft punk album.","review":"Discovery is better than homework and human after all. It is one of my all time favorite albums.1. One More Time - 10/10 - Great song. Its a classic.2. Aerodynamic - 10/10 - One of my favorite daft punk songs. Very good.3. Digital Love - 10/10 - Another amazing song.4. Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger - 10/10 - Best song the the album, and probably my favorite daft punk songs.5. Crescendolls - 2/10 - A pretty annoying song.6. Night Vision - 9/10 - Short and peaceful song.7. Superheroes - 9/10 - Repetitive, but good.8. High Life - 8/10 - Repetitive, but good.9. Something About Us - 7/10 - Slow paced song.10. Voyager - 10/10 - Great song.11. Veridis Quo - 6/10 - Its alright.12. Short Circuit - 9/10 - Nice song.13. Face To Face - 10/10 - VERY good song. Single worthly.14. Too Long - 8/10 - Decent song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intoxicating!","review":"\\"Discovery\\" is probably one of the best albums in the techno gene that i have bought in a long time. It mixes 70's and 80's grooves with hard hitting dance tracks as well. This album will put you in such a good mood, all the songs are so curious and high energy. I bought the album after hearing \\"Digital Love\\" on the ad from GAP. I expected that it would be the only song that I liked, but boy was I wrong, every song on this album is great! A few of them have lyrics, but most don't; either way, they are fun to listen to. Don't miss out on this album, its definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"THANK YOU FRANCE=====>Daft Punk","review":"NOW....THIS IS WHAT I CAN CALL DANCE MUSIC ..IT IS M MIXTURE OF POP,ELECTRONIC,TECHNO,DISCO AND A LITTLE BIT OF JAZZ.....IT'S..ONE OF A KIND . ...AND THIS ALBUM IS GREAT! IN THIS LATEST ALBUM BY THEM,YOU CAN FIND WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY ...AND WHAT TOUCHES YOUR SOUL..IT IS SIMPLE ..CLEAR ..DIFFERENT AND NO ONE EXTREMELY CAN HANDLE IT. IT'S ALSO DIFFICULT TO DECIDE YOUR FAVOURITE TRACK WHEN YOU LISTEN TO IT.

What were they thinking? Trying to sell more records? Make more money? Homework is the album. Discovery is just bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Played out Techno-Pop","review":"This album pales in comparison to Daft Punk's quality first release. It's full of played out pop hooks. This is not Techno music, it is... The fact that the title track is now featured on a GAP clothing commercial is testament to the fact that this record if full of mindless pop fodder for the MTV masses. Do yourself a favor and burn your $$$ instead. It'll be more interesting than listening to this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened!? Hardcore Dance to boy band?","review":"Homework devestates this album. Why is daft punk singing and about love none the less? Its total TRL pop crap. The songs that are instrumental just don't have the same rythmic driving beats homework had. They almost remind me of cheesy video game music. Save your money...i wish i did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total cheese hell...","review":"I really can't believe why so many people actually gave this piece of cheesy (stuff) 5 stars! It looks like most people can't tell good music from a hole in the ground. Compared to their earlier release \\"Homework\\" (and most other electronic dance albums) this album just plain (stinks). All the songs are badly written and covered with tons of sticky, slimy, gooey cheese. Don't bother buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT DAFT PUNK","review":"ok here is the deal. if you like danceable house music like the kind that jumped off of homework, you get \\"one more time\\". And that is the last time you'll hear a good house track on the album. The rest of the album is trying to move out of dance music and more into moby style electronica. Music to listen to, not to dance to with a mesh of different styles of music and lots of vocals. To me, this was a disappointment because I think these guys have the talent to really make people move. If that feeling you got when you first popped in homework is what you think your gonna get, dont even listen to the cd. It will break your heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, horrible no-good, very-bad album.","review":"I'm sorry, but after reading the posted reviews claiming that anyone who liked \\"Homework\\" will like this one I felt obligated to state my opinion: This album is awful. I am a house DJ who absolutly LOVED Daft Punk's \\"Homework\\". I believe it to be some of the best house music ever writen, with phat beats, awesome basslines, and very original composition. All that is gone in \\"Discovery\\". Instead, it's plagued with whimpy beats, cheesy synths, and lyrics so trite they literally make me cringe. I can barely believe this album came from the same two guys that hooked it up so well in 1997. If you loved \\"Homework\\" for any of the reasons I mentioned above, be warned: this is not even close to the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"This CD is a good one but not one of my absolute favorites. I really like what they've done with certain songs like \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\" which makes me think of a turning machine and \\"Something About Us\\" is kind of romantic. You could listen to it on repeat for a while but that doesn't mean you'll keep going after the fifth time around or that you haven't tuned it out by then. I'd try and describe it as some calm techno but Daft Punk doesn't really fit well into a music category at the moment. If you like \\"One More Time\\" and \\"Aerodynamic,\\" I'd say this is a good investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"okay fun","review":"A lot was expected of Daft Punk, despite the fact their track record was brief. \\"Discovery\\" shows them moving on, which is something to be grateful for, but it still doesn't live up to all the hype. Appropriating 70s influences doesn't necessarily guarantee quality tunes, especially when they're Supertramp (!!), but DP at least does it with wit and style. In short, a great sounding record with some great and some average hooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chill...","review":"I'm a little surprised some people seem so disappointed in this effort. I'm not quite sure what people expected, but I think this album is a lot of fun. At times soulful, at other times just plain silly, I appreciate the fact these guys love music, but have a sense of humor at the same time. Seems to me a lot of electronic artists are taking themselves just way too seriously these days, so I appreciate artists who can take a step back and remind us that it's OK for dance music to be fun, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"a daft punk album for daft punk fans","review":"Daft Punk are really in tune with what goes on in the scene. I mean, they're DJ's as well as producers, so they do sets and they have all the latest white-label releases. The main statement this album makes is that the 80's are definitely back. This album covers the early 80's period of sound, through the death of disco and the birth of breakdancing, with Daft Punk's pretty French house stylings and those quirky yet catchy Yamaha x series synth sounds. It's nice to hear the current trends through Daft Punk's music because they remain Daft Punk while adopting the current trends. Tres cool mes amis."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is not homework ... but","review":"The best nights of my life have involved boogying to this album in a state of sheer intoxication. Purist raw beats have no place on this album - this one is for fun. I brought this album for a weekend away and we ended up fighting over space on the table to dance to these funky disco beats. Two favourite tracks are by far \\"Harder Better Faster Stronger\\" wand \\"aerodynamic\\" which are the ultimate party starter tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"You're missing out if you don't have Discovery.","review":"What an awesome album. Up-beat tempo and loads of fun. Keeps you on your toes! This is a great album to dance to or exercise to. It changes your mood and fills you with energy and fun. The best song on the album is \\"harder, better, faster, stronger\\" i listen to it always, and never get sick of it. This album is a mix of techno, house, and electro sound. If you don't have this album, your cd collection is not complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Discovery' a favorite among aliens and robots","review":"That dynamic duo Daft Punk is back with full force. Discovery shimmers like a shiny new space helmet and beeps and scratches like its nobody's business. \\"One More Time\\" is one of those sticky dance tunes that are just inescapable. The DJs disguised as robots mix funk with disco, rock, and glossy french house with a radio-ready pop finish. Discovery may get more airplay than 1997's Homework, with \\"One More Time\\", the sappy \\"Digital Love\\", and \\"Aerodynamic\\". The album does seem to lose steam toward the end, however, but theres so many standouts, its well worth a spin. One of my top picks for 2001. Youre a loser if you miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT I THINK ABOUT DAFT PUNK","review":"well i think this is a good cd if you like to dance. my fav track is #4 harder baetter faster stronger. that was a good track cause its really hyper and it gives you a vive you know? well like i said buy this only if you want to throw partys and dance your thoughts away. and i think that coming from me its good cause im picky when it comes to danceing music well i give it a 4.5 and its pretty good. peace out"},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick, poignant introduction to Kerouac","review":"Great photos, nice text. This isn't the book for the hardcore fan of Kerouac or the Beats, but for someone like me, who really enjoys spending a few hours with those boys now and then.

Nope. Not this one. When you die you get to travel to the future. That's it. That's your explanation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stylized mess","review":"Style over substance. Filled with cliches and jarring imagery, the movie drags on through Jack Starks' time travelling adventure. Like many reviewers pointed out, Jack's wartime past apparently has no connection to the story except for the amnesia causing injury (May be it made him subconcisuly cynical, your guess is as good as mine). How a morgue drawer helps Jack timetravel to the future, I have no clue... Another absurdity is how Jack learns about that Babak kid from Jennifer Leigh (of the future) and repeats to the Jennifer Leigh (in the present). Excuse me, but where is this knowledge oriniating from? Even B movies on sci-fi channel handle time traveling condundrums better. Do yourself a favour and take a pass.

The acting is very solid from Adrien Brody and Keira Knightley (yes guys...she does show some skin). Hopefully that statement alone will get some more people to see this film, because it won't stay in theaters too long. It moves at a slow yet interesting pace and for a film based on time-travel & insanity it makes a lot of sense when it's over.

I saw this before it was released at the Sundance film festival and knew that it would be a hard one to sell to people not because it wasn't good but because it didn't fit in to a usual Hollywood classification. Sure enough, I was right. They made it look like a horror movie and it is definitely not that. I'd call it a thriller with sci fi overtones. Sort of a Twilight Zone episode if you had to label it.Great performances by a strong cast plus an interesting plot propel this over most movies that come out in the theatres these days. In some respects it's even better than The Butterfly Effect (which had a simular plot) especially because it has a strong lead where as B.E did not.Given a chance with different marketing this could have been big.

It's page-turningly exciting.The twists. I couldn't predict what was coming next, though they did make sense.The characters. Both Noel and Jason were very believable and reacted consistently with their characters as drawn.The Bad:The science.

Ever since she'd arrived in Britain, she'd been plunged into chaos, pursued by assasins. And her guardian angel was a seasoned veteran of murder....and a man who claimed to be her husband.Had Noel once shared lovers' caresses with the dark, dangerous Jason Zacharias? Or was the straining sensuality between them just an illusion? The answer was locked in the best of all hiding places - her mind. A mind that now scrambled fantasy and memory.Noel's only way out of the maelstorm was to trust her heart - and her life - to a man who pretended to be a protector but who looked every inch a predator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding the Balkans","review":"This should have been a must read for all those who, 20 years ago, thought they understood what was happening in the Balkan States.

All these cuts were recorded from 1966-71. Their other guitarist was the late Fred 'Sonic' Smith, who sings lead on the pleasant-sounding \\"Shaking Street\\". I sincerely hope that my copy doesn't wear out 'cause I tend to play it quite often. Simply love the TOTALLY ripping uncensored \\"Kick Out The Jams....Mutha.......\\". Vocalist Rob Tyner sounds like he's having the time of his life. Also enjoyed the wailing guitar line on \\"Gold\\" and not to mention their moving cover of Van Morrison's \\"I Can Only Give You Everything\\". The final two songs are the best this CD has to offer,\\"I Just Don't Know\\" and \\"Looking At You\\" are early numbers the band played when they FIRST formed. Only down side is that since Smith is gone and Tyner has passed on as well means that there can never be a true MC 5 reunion.

I expect that they cannot comprehend anything that doesn't adhere to the normalcy of pop music. I'm sure they are equally unable to appreciate Berloiz or Zappa.But The Alloy Orchestra is able to mold melody, style, disonnace and rhythm, and the universe of instrumental sounds to convey the story line, the emotion and the appropriate background sounds of these films simultaneously.

And the list of suggestions on \\"how to watch TV news\\" is obvious and uninspiring, and doesn't offer any profound methods for \\"defending yourself\\".Instead of this book, read _Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television_ by Jerry Mander, and _Manufacturing Consent_ by Herman and Chomsky. _Consent_ will open your eyes to the essential reality of how the mainstream media works, and _Four Arguments_ will give you many more than four reasons why you should turn off your television!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're looking for a few great ideas","review":"I bought this book for its baby shower projects and not as an overall book on entertaining.

Miss Mapp is one of those ladies who put social status above everything else. She is incredibly engaging with all the people she meets and inserts herself in everything she thinks may be a source of news for her friends, although she doesn't consider herself to be a busy-body in any way. She peeks out her front window, which is perfectly situated to allow her to do so without being seen, every morning keeping track of who is going where and why. She especially likes to keep tabs on a gentleman who lives near her. The story is full of charming character interaction, written with wit and love...it gave me more than a few chuckles.If you are in the mood for a wonderfully written book about a group of people living through middle-age in a small town and who are wrapped up in each other's lives by years of friendship, by all means give this book a read.

I enjoyed reading about the mechanics behind the original series and the tribulations endured to make it all happen, but my advice is to check this out from your library before you shell-out hard-earned bucks for a copy.These new prequel series and patchwork history books (by Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson) are entertaining as filler leading up to Dune at best, but are destined to be forgotten, and unfortunately detract from the brilliant worlds that Frank Herbert originally imagined.I'm resigned to keep reading, but I think we all should expect better quality from the continuation of this epic series..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure trove!","review":"A treasure trove!

Frank Herbert's son Brian apparently found a locked treasure chest in an attic filled with unpublished writings from the late great author that he shares with us, including actual correspondence from the publishing companies that Frank received when he originally submitted Dune for publication. Very interesting reading indeed. The book publishing companies thought the original Dune was too long and asked Frank to delete several scenes, about 100 pages of which are included in The Road to Dune. There is even an alternate ending to Dune Messiah.

Unfortunately, Brian Herbert & Kevin Anderson don't have the same flair for language that Frank Herbert did. Their writing is flat, sort of like comparing a comic strip to a modern animation. I was really bored by their attempt to flesh out F. Herbert's early attempt at Dune. Frank Herbert's Dune series was literature, not so with young Herbert & Anderson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kevin J Anderson shouldn't be let near the Dune series","review":"Kevin J Anderson is, at best, a mediocre pulp science fiction author.

Nope--it's a novel, and not a very well-written one. Characters aren't developed fully, story isn't developed fully but told in a general way. Not until I finished the book completely (thinking to myself, wow, this book wasn't very informative) did I finally notice that it was a work of fiction.

This show does everything in perfect taste and I hope it continues on for 10 seasons. Purschase this DVD along with all the other seasons.

This show is a mockery of the \\"family unit\\" and Reba fans justify this by stating that even though the family is dysfunctional all is well and dandy with a bow on top. So Divorce is not a dirty word, teen pregnancy can be advocated and adultery is par for the course in today's society. Have at it folks...if it feels good, do it! You're gonna be supported in every way. Enough with the \\"Leave it to Beaver\\", \\"Waltons\\" \\"Little House\\" and \\"Brady Bunch\\" ideals. Get with the program.

It may not be the fault of the actors and to single-handedly blame McEntire for the shoddiness of the program is not fair. All of Warner Bros. programming is the same. This sitcom is no different than the rest. Its a harmless show but I for one will NOT be buying Season Three. Why? Because I Season One and Two were bad enough. I have no reason to think Season Three will be an improvement and from what I have seen on Friday nights, on the rare occasion I happen to be channel flipping, the show has not grown finer with age."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS PROGRAM MISSES THE MARK ALL THE WAY!","review":"The only reason this program is so popular is because Reba has a huge fan base.

It might have been the gun I carried or my particular pants, but I think most people are buying this for an LCP-type gun and I wear very normal pants/shorts. I carried a Ruger LCP in it for about two months. The only two things I can say I liked about this is that the holster completely covered the trigger guard and the holster looks to be of sufficent quality as to not fall apart immediately. The gun was not easy to pull out of my pocket, and more often than not, the holster came out with the gun. Not to mention, I basically lost the use of my strong side pocket while carrying. I've since switched to a cheap IWB holster and it's significantly nicer to carry (less noticeable, more comfortable, easier access, and I still have use of my pocket). I'll keep the Uncle Mike's pocket holster for use in coat pockets and such, but it's unlikely to see use again in my pants pockets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly designed holster","review":"As with most uncle mikes products I've seen, the quality of materials is passable, but the design is terrible.I tried this holster with both a Ruger LCP and a Bodyguard 380.Both guns sit so far down in the holster and are virtually impossible to draw smoothly and quickly.Yes, it can be drawn. And if you only half sit it in the holster, you can get the time ok, but if you put it down in the holster as intended, You can't get that full hand grip as the holster covers where your first finger needs to go.The Desantis nemesis is a far superior holster for $10 more.If you're looking to buy this holster, don't.

If you're gonna buy, buy a size larger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great holster","review":"I got the #4 holster in the winter time when I purchased my Ruger LCP. I love the holster when I was carrying it in my jacket pocket. It grabs the pocket well and the gun comes out of it easily. I have zero complaints when carrying it in my jacket. But know its summer time and the #4 holster I think is just too large for my jean pocket. I have tried the #2 with the Lasermax laser and did not like the tight fit of the laser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made, priced right","review":"This unit doesn't stay in my pocket consistantly when I draw.

Some of you skinnier guys with tighter pockets will probably find it works perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does its job...","review":"Bought to pocket carry a Ruger LCR. After much research -- despite the product description -- I opted for the size #4. Discussion forums commonly stated that the #3 was too small on the trigger guard for a LCR. Some didn't mind, but I would NOT want any bit of trigger exposed with a loaded revolver in my pocket. For those that worry the holster is too large, it is not. With the LCR (Hogue boot grip) seated all the way in, the trigger was completely covered -- yet did not restrict my ability to gain a full grip-hold easily. I can easily draw with my normal grip. No adjustments are needed pre-draw or while presenting the revolver. The anti-slip strip works well & with tests using various jackets, pants, shorts, etc. I have not had the holster come out. I would use this holster with pants, baggy jeans & any type of shorts (including board shorts). I highly recommend, especially for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of consistency","review":"I had a well used Uncle Mike's holster of the same type and it worked well.

The author focuses on her own pregnancy, while putting a little too much emphasis on her opinion that almost all twin pregnancies result in preterm labor and time spent in the NICU for the babies. Though there is a greater risk of preterm issues, they shouldn't be the focus. I just recommend other twin books and there are GREAT ones out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"precisions BBs","review":"These are high quality BBs and work well with my CA M15-14 AEG.

I highly recommend his school as well. It will cahnge your life, not to mention your Vision"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring book that I will remember forever...","review":"This book was given to me by a woman that was in a botany class I was taking. She had a feeling that I would like it, and I have never forgotten it! Though it is very simply written (it quickly becomes apparent that Mr. Brown is not a professional writer), the message of the book is outstanding! He describes some of the most important lessons he has learned in life and his Vision, which was quite profoundly similar to one I've had myself. One story, the Fisherman, struck me so deeply that I have incorporated its teaching into my life every day. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is keen to Earth and her health. You'll never regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Moving","review":"I had read Tracker several years ago and was very impressed then. But in this book, it is the first time I have run across a Native American (and I have read numerous Native American shaman/medicine men/healers) who consciously attempted to transcend his (while deep & profound) cultural spiritual beliefs in search an \\"ultimate or unified\\" meaning for all people. The intensity and constancy of his pursuit of this spiritual ultimate to the point of death (several times) was as worthy as any Eastern yogi when the Tibetans talk about \\"like your hair was on fire\\", that to achieve this is far more that a couple of sweatlodges or Vision Quests. And while the \\"non-dualist\\" will argue \\"there is nothing to achieve, nothing to do, nowhere to go\\", its's always the paradox that you seldom realize this until you've done all this \\"doing\\". It certainly gave me a strong & rededicated boost to why trying to achieve or realize the same is truly the important goal in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the way to do do business","review":"I am thrilled with how fast the book arrived and the excellent condition it is in.

Who can forget that the 2008 Formula One World's Driver Championship was not decided until the last corner of the last lap of the last race of the season - and in the rain at that.

Another viewer noted the same trouble I experienced and called it \\"panning artifacts.\\" Namely, when the camera follows the cars moving quickly, there is a pronounced blurring/stuttering effect. It is very distracting and takes away from the race and commentary. I actually stopped watching about five races in because of it. Why can't these guys get it right? Be warned - this DVD is for you only if you are a hardcore fan and MUST have each year's review. Otherwise, those looking for a neat and effective wrap-up of last season will come away disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Official Review of the 2008 FIA Formula One Championship","review":"The DVD has a spot on it where there is poor quality throughout the entire DVD.

I am very surprised that Formula 1 did not catch this problem during production."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am a Mama's Boy...sort of","review":"This is a great movie, filled with good humor, a great cast, and smooth writing. John Heder perfects the role of being a overbearing Mama's Boy who just won't quit. Jeff Daniels is in his element reminiscent of his role in Dumb and Dumber, he pulls this off with expertise. Diane Keaton is excellent she seems to be in every simple but offbeat comedies that truly capture her bubbly personality. Along with the quirky Ana Farris who is more angry in this role than others before it. She is the final touch to a simple yet hilarious romp. This idea has been done before but this is a very well written comedy that doesn't disappoint. Don't listen to reviewers who just nick pick about everything. Rent or purchase it is really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh so funny","review":"Our son is 22, and we have been married forever, but it was pretty much the same thing.

He attempts to categorise multiagent systems, but many of his key terms are vague. Theaccumulation of distinctions without overall purpose becomesirritating. Despite all the classification, there is no clear overall taxonomy and no hard code. Organisation is poor. A clear taxonomy and a detailed study of an implementation for each category plus code would have made a much better book. There is useful stuff here, but finding it is like looking for matching socks in a laundry bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"I used the ideas from this book in my own program","review":"I read some other reviews about this book saying that it is confusing, etc. I was not confused.

Ultimately, I used ideas from this book combined with the ideas from generative programming to solve a programming problem quite successfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horrible Translation","review":"This book was originally written in French, and whoever translated it was not paying attention when they did so. Horrible grammar and word usage mistakes detract from what would already be only a fair book.

Maybe I owe it to my relative ignorance of differenial geometric concepts, but I found this book practically worthless to my understanding of dynamical systems. I tend to agree with David Griffiths when he states that mathematics is a tool to the physicist; this text makes it the sole focus."},{"rating":"2","title":"English edition never arrived","review":"I remember the film from years ago when it was on television.

Don't be fooled. Basically when you buy a Magellan you get the unit, a mounting cradle, and a mounting arm. The mounting arm attaches to your windshield with a suction cup. The mounting cradle then semi permanently mounts to that mounting arm. This cradle allows for easy insertion and removal of the Magellan unit. If you buy this all you are getting is the cradle. Without an arm this is a worthless piece of plastic.

True to form, Bill Robe and James Donnellan have produced another exquisite work. The music ranges in style from lyrical to energetic, with gorgeous melodies and interestingly complex layers of sounds. And as in the first CD, the music reflects many of the planet's geographic regions. The recording quality is top notch once again. The packaging is beautiful, and the accompanying booklet is filled with information about the endangered plants of the earth. This is first-class work. Perfect as a gift(if you can bear to give it away)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title is misleading and the writing is obtuse","review":"The description of the book made me believe that I would learn more about how children develop morals. The greatest revelation of the psychiatrist author is that character is the foundation of behavior. There are few novel thoughts stuck somewhere in the lengthy descriptions of his meetings. I felt at times he focused too much on creating a mood or setting that is best left to fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect to see any real solution in this book.","review":"I bought the book, expecting to know the solution on how to raise my kids so that they become good members of the society. But what I got was just a guideline that I should teach my children well during their early years. It's all too simple to hear from such an expert. There is nothing new on how to raise a moral child compared with what I can get from a good how-to-raise-a-child book. The quality of contents in this book is no way near Emotional Intelligence"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE WAS THE EDITOR?","review":"That Robert Coles' heart is in the right place and that his experience working with children is extensive, no one can dispute. But his writing is characterized by wordiness - even chattiness - and it undermines the serious nature of his topic. Perhaps the loose writing style is an attempt to make the book appeal to \\"every parent,\\" - and not just educators - but instead it renders the whole work laborious and permeated with a condescending, patronizing tone. In the current political culture, a book on the moral life of children written by an educator of Coles' calibre would be expected to nail a spot on the N.Y. Times bestseller list for weeks, if not years. The fact that less than two years after publication I picked up a hard cover copy at a book clearance for 75% off is a testimony to lazy editorship more than anything else. What a huge loss for our society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never receive this item, we contacted company, they said will refund $10 for the shipping but nothing came","review":"The item never came, we contacted owner, he said will refund $10 shipping fee and will ship again on the 16th of July, but nothing came, we called him and left message, he never return the call."},{"rating":"2","title":"bright,nice quality.but need to drill holes in front sight....","review":"I received these thinking this sight set would be just a drop in upgrade.The front sight blade was a perfect fit but the new sight blade DOES NOT have holes for the roll pins.You must drill them and it is almost certain that a drill press is necessary or risk ruining the guns sight ramp/slide.

The four musicians - Ronnie Gluck, Joyce Gluck, Walter Raim and Ethel Raim - played and sang in the same school of music as the Weavers, Pete Seeger and Peter, Paul and Mary but with a special NY flavor all their own. They are truly unsung American folk music heros and deserve a wider audience.If you are lucky, you can still occasionally catch Ron Gluck perform in Brooklyn, Putnam County (at the Hudson Valley Folk Guild), and other locales.Also, a few years back, he put out a new CD - Wanderin'/Ron Pics On Ron with fellow musician Ron Meissner.

I am a New Zealander and have had kids at New Zealand schools through the nineties and they are currently still in New Zealand schools. New Zealand has never had a voucher system. New Zealand schools have never had complete operational autonomy and most schools had attendance zones. A minority of schools had \`bulk funding', ie they were funded a set amount per child, depending on the number of children on their role, on a given day in the year. The authors may have confused this with a voucher system but a voucher system is very different to bulk funding, and most schools were not bulk funded.

I found the author's writing style to be very relaxed, very calming. She speaks from, what I assume to be, the heart. She tells her story, what she knows from how she grew up, what her family and her community taught her- not just about religion, but about working with the earth and feeling it's natural rhythms- and isn't that what most pagans are after, anyway?If you ask me, it isn't for me to say that because she doesn't acknowledge -my- traditions or customs that she isn't serious.I think, no matter how \\"real\\" it is or not, this is a wonderful read that is definitely worth your time.

I tracked it from Texas to Va and anticipated delivery to WV within a day or two. Imagine my dismay when I saw it two days later back in Texas!! This was a customer service nightmare. Amazon blamed UPS, UPS blamed Amazon. No one was really sympathetic to my plight. It was like \\"Oh well, it'll get there sooner or later.\\" Once it did, the box was in pieces and like I said, it was the antithesis of cheerful plaid.

As a parent it was of no help at all. I gave it to one of my son's teachers. Maybe they can get some information from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Resource","review":"As a former gifted student and now a talented and gifted teacher myself, this is one of the best gifted education books I have ever come across. The first time I read it, I just found myself inadvertently nodding my head, \\"yes.\\" Whether you are a parent of a gifted child or a fellow educator this is a must-own text. For educators it provides simple, research based responses to colleagues who insist, \\"oh, he's gifted - he'll be fine!\\"Soon your copy will be like mine: a weakening spine, dog-eared pages, and notes in the margins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for travel","review":"I prefer yoga CD's to videos. I travel a lot with work, and CD's are easier to practice with. I also don't like trying to watch a TV screen, and get in and out of poses. I find with CD's I listen better, and feel more centered. Of all the CD's I've done, this is the easiest to follow. The pace is good, instructions are clear, and the included chart is very thorough. Now that is not to say the class is easy. Some of the tracks are quite challenging. There is a guide that instructs you on which tracks to skip, if you are just starting out. I like this, because as you improve, you can do more of the CD. All in all, this is a very skillfully put together CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This is a very nice CD for yoga practice.As all the previous reviews by other viewers. The only thing I want to add is,I wish that the last track # 6 is longer, because it is a relaxtation pose and it is too short..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BEAUTIFUL MOVIE","review":"This is a very poetic, thoughtful, human, often funny, and altogether well-done movie. I highly recommend it. There is hardly any violence in it, and still it is about violence and discrimination in Louisiana in the 70s. Also, it is a good adaptation of Gaines' novel, A GATHERING OF OLD MEN. I haven't the faintest idea why another reviewer compared this movie with Ed Wood stuff - incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Movie","review":"This movie is great Iv'e watched this move before it came on DVD when it was shown on TV it has all the best actors and I recomend it to anyone, this is a great choice for buying you want be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book vs. Movie","review":"I really enjoyed the book but as usual the movie cannot capture the feelings and thoughts of the characters. Otherwise the movie was fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was unfocused on its topic.","review":"I bought the book hoping to gain some added insight on how to preserve the game I love, but Joe would meander off on topics comparing The Big Red Machine to the Yankees and letting us know things he thought managers did wrong in last year's post season.50% of the book was a good read, but it wasn't why I bought it. Consequently I was disappointed in what Joe did with such an important topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"So soft and cuddley","review":"This is such a soft and cuddley soft blanket!

It's an absolutely great album. I even enjoyed his version of My Heart Will Go on. i was tired of Celine's version. His How deep is your love, Have I told you lately and I believe I can fly are really wonderful, so full of emotion. the thing with Michael is that he doesn't only have a great voice but while he's singing you can feel it. Loved it and I might say that it was worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this one!","review":"Michael Ball, he of the powerful voice, beautiful enunciation, and \\"acting\\" as he sings, covers songs from movies, and does not disappoint! There are changes in tempo and style, and I even enjoyed \\"Wind Beneath My Wings\\" and \\"My Heart will go On\\", both of which I had grown SO tired of! And his rendition of \\"Hot Stuff\\" from \\"The Full Monty\\" is the highlight of this recording. You'll listen to this one again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could listen to him sing forever!!!!","review":"I think I have listened to this cd so much that I wore it out but I will keep listening because he has such a wonderful voice. I love his rendition of Love On The Rocks. I plan to buy more of Michael's cd's. I am looking for one in paticular and it always seems sold out. Oh well I'll keep trying. Keep them coming Michael I wish your music was more available here in the states. You can sing to me anytime!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad","review":"Michael Ball used to be full of such potential, but I don't know what happened to him. His taste in material is atrocious, he's developed a weird, lounge-lizard style of singing and he oversings practically everything he touches these days. This album is no exception, with absolutely horrible versions of \\"Hot Stuff\\" and \\"Wind Beneath My Wings\\" being the worst offenders. The production is also unimaginative, sounding as if the whole album was thrown together in one day. Stay away from this disc!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I was reluctant to buy this album after the travesty of \\"The Musicals.\\" But I did. And I wish I hadn't. Michael Ball's first albums were fabulous, but not even the seediest lounges in Vegas would take him based on his latest albums. His singing technique has declined abysmally and his song selection is nothing short of pandering. A case in point: I am one of the few people who is not entirely sick of \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" (I don't listen to radio very often). Unlike most of the other songs, this version measures up to the original. In fact, it's probably the best track on the CD. BUT THE SONG IS LESS THAN A YEAR OLD! Covering a song that is, basically, still in the top forty is bad form and makes the cover artist look pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh? not truly awful I guess","review":"This perenianl discount dollar bin disc has one great song \\"Thank for the Angst\\" which rocks, but the title is as clever as the lyrics get. The rest of the album is in no way memorable, not memorable good or memorably awful. You can listen to this album and 5 minutes later, recall none of the songs except for \\"Thanks\\". I remember seeing this in the discount bin and dollar stores for years before I broke down and wasted a dollar on this too late for the hair metal party, wanna be posers. I guess the band still plays in L.A. from time to time, surely not with all original members. When will we see the 20th anniversary edition...distributed in the dollar bin of course?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful movie","review":"If I could give this 0 stars, I would.

I began reading them to her at night, then she would take off on them w/o me, and I'd have to catch up, b/c I wanted to know what happened.

There is nothing worse than trying to watch a show that includes fake laughter at almost every sentence, funny or not. I honestly couldn't tell you if the show will make it because after listening to five solid min of fake laughter I had to delete the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Poor show","review":"Hi,This show is not up to par today, it focuses on extreme stereotypical, I have never met a \\"nerd/geek\\" who can't talk to girls. In today's society everyone is treated equal. This is basically taking the movie \\"Revenge of the nerds\\" into extended tv format, this is not the eighties.The premise for the show was just plain outdated and horrible, nothing wrong with the cast, but they could do something better. I do not look forward to watch this show."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor show","review":"probably won't last till Thanksgiving. Sick, very unfunny jokes, with laugh tracks to boot.

This was my first try at buying a used DVD- my husband said \\"They are not subject to wear in use, so it should be fine.\\"The First Season set is three discs- the first two discs would show us most of the first episodes, then freeze or jump back to the menu. We only saw one or two episodes to the end. The third disc would not \\"Load\\" properly and displayed only error messages. Disc 1 had some visible marks, so we tried to clean it, but it did not help.Through Amazon, I sent an e-mail to the seller \\"The Hills\\" on July 28, explaining the problems and asking for a refund. That was 10 days ago, with no reply from the seller.I am upset with the seller and will probably never buy used DVD's again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Show","review":"I was baffled by how many people like this show. It is TERRIBLE. The comedy is so obvious, and all the actors are horrible. Please for the love of God tell me why this show is funny. How I Met Your Mother is pretty good, as is Rules of Engagement, but this show is almost unwatchable.Is there something I'm not getting? Has Everybody Loves Raymond and Two and a Half Men warped your brains to find unfunny situations funny? I'll watch Two and a Half Men, which in my opinion, is about on par with this show, and I will stare, baffled at how obvious the jokes are. It's as if the laugh tracks have created some Pavlovian response mechanism for the mentally challenged, forcing you to laugh every two seconds at banal dialogue.Please, I am asking you to perform a service and tell me why this show is funny. Tell me why you laugh at this show. I just don't get it, and I feel like the minority considering 28 other people gave this 4 or 5 stars. It boggles the mind. Please, help me out..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic, lame and very, very dumb","review":"I can not comprehend the rave reviews for this series. It is one of the worst I've seen. The characters are NOT multi-dimensional or interesting -- they are the most one dimensional gag puppets bad sitcoms have ever produced. That is especially true of the much praised Simon -- a ridiculous, thoroughly unconvincing cartoon character, whose only motivation is to look goofy and odd.Gilligan's Island and My Mother The Car look like great, intellectual works of art compared to The Big Bang Theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"the big bang theory","review":"it was great.And i enjoy it watch it ever time i get time to see it.let ask you a question do you have season 5&6 i would love to that as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great program","review":"This is the best sitcom I have seen in a long time.

Very funny and handy for summer viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing comedy","review":"it's nice to see a network like cbs take a chance by releasing a pilot of a show online to see how people like it. i have to say that this show is going to be a good one. can't wait to watch the premiere again this week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and smart","review":"I found this show very smart and entertaining.

He loves this show and I will be buying other seasons for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG, so happy i bought this!!!","review":"OMG!!! My husband and I started watching this series on TV during the third season. We immediately became HOOKED! So, for Christmas I bought him the first season so we could go back and watch what we had missed. What a GREAT purchase!!! We were both under the weather over Christmas so this was perfect. Once our 8 month old went down for a nap, after opening and playing with presents, we hopped on the couch and laughed until it hurt. This was so funny that we would put it in and watch over and over. These guys are hillarious and if you haven't seen it from the beginning, it is a riot to go back and see how it all started. We totally recommend this!!!! Since we finished Season 1 off the day after Christmas, I looked up season 2 on Amazon and it will be delivered today. Can't wait to watch it over New Year's break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent portrayal of nerdom.","review":"Love the show and love the DVD. Wish there were more out takes on the DVD, but the commentary by the actors is excellent. When I was growing up there was a difference between a geek and a nerd. Both were mostly socially unacceptable, but the nerd was smart and the geek was not. These days they are pretty much interchangeable. These characters are truly the nerds of nerds. Yet, even these alpha nerds have other nerds that they look up to. I always thought it interesting that nerds were mostly avoided in High School, but they were sought out in College. And like the show, the nerd got the pretty and smart girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, disappointing DVD","review":"I LOVE this show! It's the most hilarious thing I've seen on TV in ages. I've been waiting for it to come out on DVD for months, so I could get my boyfriend caught up before the new season begins.I did run right out and get it yesterday...but I was disappointed. There is a surprising lack of bonus features on these disks! In the world of today's shows, it's not uncommon to find an entire disk of extra features, so I was expecting good things - outtakes and commentaries that I'm sure would have been hilarious. However, not a single commentary appears, and while there is a behind the scenes feature, I can't help but feel that they could have done SO much more.That being said, the show in itself is still amazing! All of the actors, especially Jim Parsons, are absolutely perfect in their roles. I highly recommend this series, but am giving the product only four stars because of the lack of bonus features."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't have cable...","review":"I don't have cable, but caught a free episode on XBOX Live. Great writing. There's no way this show will last because it's too smart, so I'll definitely have to own it on DVD. Good on 'em. I'm a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"The show is great, its just not the style of show I like. I'm sure that other probably like it and there is a lot of wit.

Videos would suddenly stop and restart at a different place. I could not find it for free which would have been preferable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beter on DVD","review":"I love the Big Bang Theory, but seldom get a chance to watch it or tape the show. This was the first time I purchased a complete season of a television show...it was great, no commercials and I was able to get a handle on the characters as they developed. Looking forward to season 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love everything about this show.","review":"I love this show! I hardly ever watch network sitcoms anymore but this show has won me over. I downloaded all the season one episodes from iTunes so I can watch them on my iPod.Jim Parsons's character \\"Sheldon\\" is quickly climbing the ladder to be among my favorite TV sitcom characters of all time. He has a way to go to pass Frank Bonner's \\"Herb Tarlek, Jr\\" from \\"WKRP in Cincinnati\\", but he's getting close.The 2008 Emmy nominations have been announced and Parsons' name is nowhere to be seen, and that is just a CRIME! What gives?! Mediocre shows like \\"Two and a Half Men\\" get accolades and recognition but this show doesn't?! We live in an unfair world, folks.Buy this DVD set. Hopefully the show's writers can milk the concept for a few more seasons and still keep it fresh and funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's so funny I can't stop watching!","review":"As title says, I can't stop watching. I watched all episodes at once and went straight to season 2 and I'm not stopping there either.This show is extremely funny and also very heartwarming. Actors are very good, great characters, extremely well written, and all in all a must see if you ask me.A lot of people I know don't watch this because it is as they say: \\"A bunch of nerds talking about nerdy stuff\\". That is true, but it is done in a very humorous and intelligent way. I believe the characters, and I understand the world they are living in to the fullest. Just to clearify, you won't need to read up on physics or science to understand the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheldon Cooper is crazy!!!!!","review":"I know he says his mount her had him tested, but he is.

Decided to watch the pilot to see what the fuss was all about and I will say even the pilot is absolutely hilarious. I am now on season 5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Sheldon Cooper","review":"I had a co-worker talk about this show all the time so I had to watch and wouldn't you know it, I became a huge fan and Bazinga became apart of my vernacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"see how it all began","review":"I'm a fan of the show, so of course I'm going to like this. However, I didn't discover it until season three. Season One is just as good, and unlike Seinfeld or Friends, this show hits the ground running. Smart and witty, this is a damn good show. It answers the question of what happens when a cute girl moves in next door to a bunch of dorks. But you don't have to be a nerd to appreciate it (says the nerd writing this review), my wife is quite hip and is able to enjoy the universal humor. Try it. You'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Great","review":"This series is so great I am sending it to some friends who really don't watch TV per se. It is intelligent on many levels and sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"RPSLS...Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock","review":"Great show, great attention to detail, nothing like it on television. Saw 4 episodes of the current season, bought the 3 previous seasons and definitely a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"This is probably one of the funniest shows out there. Every episode has at least one joke or event that will make you burst out in laughter. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap laughs!","review":"The season DVD arrived quickly and ready to watch. Big Bang Theory is one of the best comedies on tv right now and I'm really happy that they are making the seasons affordable. Can't pick my favorite shows, so I need them all! For anyone who wants a really good laugh, you can't get much better than this! This ensemble is perfection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So funny, you'll cry","review":"I got hooked on this show at about the 3rd episode. I hardly ever watch TV but I can't not watch this. It is so funny and brilliant. Sheldon is so anal its hilarious and Leonard is just so sweet that you can't help but love him. The other characters are so well matched and believable that you can truly enjoy the relationships. The banter is never forced and is really tear-producing funny. Now, we never miss an episode. This DVD kept us from jonesing too much over the summer for the show. The DVD is great with the extras they put on it. Really puts everything in perspective like having a real physicist as a consultant so all their geek-speak is right. It's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the show, but so tired of receiving scratched discs!!","review":"Big Bang Theory, wonderful and funny. Quality of the blu ray however, terrible! I opened it up and put the first disc on, first of all, it was covered in smudges. I wiped clean, and it skipped through out 3 of the episodes. Total bummer. Just such a PAIN to return :("},{"rating":"1","title":"streaming is hit or miss.","review":"I was forced to watch half of the episodes in poor quality SD. This is not fault of my internet provider as I receive around 20mbps at all times.

There is definitely something wrong with the Amazon Instant PS3 interface.Aside from that, the show is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show","review":"Very funny and smart.

My family and I can watch it over and over again and we still end up laughing so hard we cry every time...in fact, knowing what's coming up makes it even funnier. We are constantly quoting from this show...it's pure genious.I wish they would have included a blooper reel, although the jacket says it includes a \\"behind the scenes look\\". I haven't watched this, yet, so I couldn't say if this is a blooper reel or not.If you've never seen the show, buy this set, sit down, and prepare to laugh outloud and hard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"This is some of the smartest comedy I've seen in a long time. The show is excelent and even though the first season only ran for half a season due to the writers strike, the publisher did its best to add in enough special features to justify the cost. My only complaint is that the packaging was slightly damaged on the inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Big Bang Theory ROCKS!!!","review":"I saw clips of it on the internet and I wanted to see the whole season, and I thought it was hilarious.

I'll be the first to admit this show is guilty of an embarrassment of stereotypes and blatant misogyny. But it makes me laugh -- and I'm female. What can I say. I wasn't thrilled with the pilot, but I gave the second episode a chance and I was sold. \\"This isn't a home. This is a swirling vortex of entropy.\\" That's the line that did it.I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I'll admit it is uneven. Some episodes go too far with the stereotypes -- but the ones that are good are hilarious. And I have a soft spot for a sit com where smart is cool -- even if it's in the guise of nerdiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Labored through 3 episodes","review":"After recommendations from several trusted friends, I forced myself to watch more than the first episode. First: fake laugh tracks are a real turn off. Being told when to laugh (especially when the situation is not funny) is pathetic. Second: this show is a predictable collection of worn-out stereotypes with no character depth whatsoever. A hot blond bimbo and nerdy scientists? Please! How about a hot blond scientist and nerdy waiter folks? That would be more interesting. Waste of money if you like stimulating shows like Weeds or Breaking Bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am extremely jealous of anyone who likes this show...","review":"I wish I could like this show -- I mean, my life would be so much better if my standards were that low. I'd be able to watch the Late Show with Jimmy Fallon without flinching; I'd be able to enjoy Ben Affleck's nuanced performance in Gigli; I might even be able to listen to the chorus of a John Mayer song without chundering (wait a minutes, now I'm going overboard). The possibilities are endless.Unfortunately for The Big Bang Theory, I retain a capacity to discern quality from crap. This show feels written by non-geeks who sent a couple of PA's to the comic book store to bring back a few superhero comics, and felt empowered after reading them to write geek dialogue.The producers are more concerned about seeing how many outfits they can get Kaley Cuoco into per episode than writing plausible characters. It gets one star because she's hot but otherwise...no, thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freezes","review":"Now he tells me! Apparently the disc freezes.

Whatever it is, from social anxiety to plaid plants, it's here in spades. Add on to that that the writers misuse of technical terms to create a patter of supposed geeky \\"repartee\\", and it's clear that they are simply making fun of geeks rather than celebrating them. There's no reason for any geek to watch this other than to see himself being made fun of. And poorly at that. On the other hand, I did actually laugh three times through the episode (I forget at what now), so it does fare marginally better than most sitcoms, though those three funny moments were atypical of the quality of the show, not merely crossing the threshold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ha. Why isn't this free streaming.","review":"And you wonder why netflix is winning. I will never pay for crap like this. You are insane and greedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had me smiling once","review":"I only (briefly) smiled once while watching the show.First of all the characters are hardly believable and even if you accept that they have been exaggerated for the sake of the show, the nerds/geeks jokes have all been seen/heard before.Oh, and as everybody said before, the laugh track is just terrible and makes it even more difficult to watch this show through the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined by laugh track","review":"The comedy was ruined by the laugh track. Several times a minute, absurdly fake laughter and applause would be clumsily mixed in, then abrubtly faded out. The comedy might have had some interesting scenes without it; with it, the show is just annoying.Does anyone know what would possess a producer or director intentionally to ruin his own work like this? Even if they did like laugh tracks (does anyone?) this was one was incompetent to the point of parody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Face for Nerds","review":"This show is really like black face for nerds. It is as insulting to real nerds as black face was to African-Americans. There's a one of every nerd-type! And then a hot girl who makes fun of their social ineptitude? Wow! Who would have thought that up? Oooooh, man! They have catch-phrases? Sign me up!Last, a thought on canned laughter. It is insulting to the viewer. It says, \\"You're too stupid to know when it's funny, so we'll let you know when to laugh.\\" Researchers found out a long time ago that laughter is a social experience and that people are more likely to laugh when they see or hear others laughing, so they make use of fake laughter to elicit laughs when something is not actually funny.You want a show that treats nerds with some heart? Watch Community. It doesn't default to lazy writing and canned laughter. Also, it's actually good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Get It","review":"The only \\"bang\\" in this series for me was the sound of my remote hitting the television screen in disgust. My bad, I bought into all the rave reviews for this abysmal, Erkel-ized comedy.Throw glasses onto Johnny Galecki and it STILL doesn't make him funny. (His casting as the weirdo, brooding idiot on Roseanne I always found strange, too.) Are people finding this \\"cute\\"? \\"Smart\\"? All I can say if I am over 50% similar to you, do yourself a favor and find some quality TV sitcom reruns to scratch your comedy itch. This will having you banging your head against the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big bang or big fizzle!","review":"The sitcom version of \\"Beauty and the Geek\\", this will be gone faster than you can split an atom. Kaley Cuoco might be easy on the eyes, but the two geeks plus their friends have dialogue that's way over the heads of the intended audience (think \\"Numb3rs\\" without the explination). It's hard to concieve how the writers could evolve this past the second or third episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupidity on a cosmic scale.","review":"This was almost painful to watch. I kept thinking \\"This has to get better. It can't get any worse.\\" I was wrong. The acting was horrible. The plot was ridiculous.

There I found myself, transfixed with the clever, humorous dialogue that wasn't afraid of using language that may be over some people's heads while remaining outrageously funny. In no time, I was laughing so hard that I had soup coming out of my nose.The show has improved over time, its characters have developed distinct personalities, and is the only TV show that I look forward to (or watch) during the week.

Four brilliant but socially challenged individuals trying to relate to and interact with one another and with a free spirited girl next door from Nebraska. Throw in a born-again plain spoken mother from Texas, a couple of socially challenged females and the laughs come fast and furious. The Big Bang Theory is a sure cure for a bad day at the office. At times I've laughed so hard it worried my dogs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hilarious show","review":"This show is hilarious, I started to watch it because I like Kaley Cuoco from 8 simple rules. Raj has to be my favorite nerd."},{"rating":"1","title":"laugh track ruined it for me","review":"I can't remember the last show I watched with a laugh track - they're intrusive, annoying, and detract from the show. I made it about 15 minutes into the show before I had to turn it off.The show itself has some potential. The casting, acting, and set are all good. The writing leaves something to be desired, but there were some good moments. As another reviewer pointed out, it seems like some hack writer took random \\"geek\\" words and used them slightly wrong - instead of being written by a true geek, it comes across written by someone who is trying to imagine him/herself as a geek.Overall, I think it'd grow on me if they took out the laugh track. Here's hoping the network reads these reviews before broadcasting the pilot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good. Gets old quick","review":"From the trailers I thought the concept for this show would be good, but even if you have a science/engineering/math background and get the jokes, they still are not very funny. I watched this show for 22 minutes and that was about as much as I could take. I can't see how this show will last past a few episodes. About the only laughs you will get from this show are the ones you hear coming from the awful laugh track.I hope this is not indicative of the new shows being released this fall... if it is were all doomed."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT BLU RAY!!!!

But it's very disappointing to watch the show in HDTV, and then find out that the DVD is only being offered in standard definition. Why no Blu-ray? The DVD should provide a better watching experience than watching it on broadcast network, and in this case it doesn't.Please, Warner, bring out your high-def television shows on high-def DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a smart very funny sitcom.","review":"It's been way too long since a sitcom made me laugh at every episode.

Sadly, I found it halfway through Season 1, so when it came out on dvd I was beyond thrilled to have gotten it for Christmas.This show is, in my opinion, the funniest comedy to come around in a long time. I have never seen an episode that hasn't made me burst into tears from fits of laughter. And now that I've got the first season on dvd, I can watch my favorite moments any time I want, as many times as I want (and I admit there are some scenes I can't get enough of)---and I still fall off the couch laughing.The characters are perfectly cast, and are both annoying and lovable at the same time.The only negative thing I can think of about this show is that the episodes are only a half hour.I recomend this show to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Big Bang Theory: The first season","review":"I am not hooked on many TV shows, but I love this sitcom.

It is important to note that it is not a great reference for MPI, but it does a good job introducing the basic MPI functions and how to implement parallel programs using them.If you are looking for a good parallel programming primer, this book is a good start. If you are looking for an MPI reference guide, or a detailed discussion of more advanced MPI use, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pond Puckster","review":"Pond Puckster was a very good and exciting book. It was a very exciting book to read. It also has an interesting plotline, of a rich boy having to move to a rugged town in Maine for a Winter, with no indoor hockey rink within 50 miles.One more reason I liked it was because I am about the same age as the kid and I could kind of relate with him. Overall, I think that Pond Puckster was a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pond Puckster","review":"Great book even for the non-hockey fan.

Money well spent!","review":"I have read the Unfair Advantage from cover to cover several times. More importantly, I have experienced results, based on the lessons you will learn in this book, that have been amazing. If you want great literature, don't buy the Unfair Advantage, consider War and Peace. If you want great results in your interpersonal skills and feel that a higher closing ratio sounds like something you want to read about, get the Unfair Advantage.This is my first review to Amazon.com. I have read several books that flirt with making NLP a concrete and usable sales tool. This is the first book that I have found worthy enough for me to share an opinion on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After skipping through this book, I decided to return the copy I ordered. I could not find in it anything new or extraordinary that other NLP books don't cover, and its exercises don't seem to be able to enhance my NLP/rapport building/selling skills. Maybe someone new to NLP can find it helpful, but still this books is way more expensive than most other NLP books. So I decided to cut loss and return it. Thanks to Amazon's generous return policy, I only have to lose a few dollars on return postages."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing new here","review":"I bought this book recently but after reading the first few pages I realized that there is nothing new in this book. The same old stuff from \\"the structure of magic (1975)\\" by Richard Bandler rehashed.I have lost courage to read it until the end but so far my impression is that this book will not benifit a web marketer because the whole methods rely on constant interactive input from your customers.In all not much fun, but I'm still giving it two stars because the page formatting and printing is superior than most other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Simplistic","review":"I found the information in this book to be really basic, and of limited value. According to the author, you should notice the types of words people use and mirror them to get them to relate to you. That's hardly an unfair advantage. It seemed like a subject more appropriate to a blog posting of 2-3 paragraphs than worthy of $25 for a book. I think the author is the one who gained an unfair advantage over those who wasted their money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"...to help you decide to read \\" The Unfair Advantage\\"","review":"Effective Communication is essential.

Most I have read give you great theoretical information on the practice of NLP, but this is the first book I have read that actually provides excercises for practicing the techniques. This book is not an in depth review of NLP but it is a practical workbook that will improve your skill in specific areas. I would recomend this book to anyone who needs to be more pursuasive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knowledgeable","review":"This book is very interesting to read both for fun and for professional purpose. The author gives us a neat description about psychological techniques to influence a person without him realizing it.One thing I would request the author is to reduce repetition of advices. The book is sometimes a drag to read as the same points are advised over and over again. Otherwise, this is a fantastic book! Don't read it just once. Refer the book whenever necessary. Cheers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please grow up.","review":"The most offensive thing about this book is to state that Cary Grant was gay or even bi. I have gay friends that were bothered by it because it makes gays look desparate to be excepted. Cary Grant was an incredible man who cared much for the world. Him being gay would not be offensive but lying about him to make money is offensive to anyone, gay or not. I'm sure most men, gay or not would agree. I at least hope so."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pack of lies","review":"Cary Grant was not gay and in fact married and fathered as child.This book is typical of those that slander the dead because they cannot defend themselves.Do not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"More lies from Hollywood's most infamous fabricator","review":"Really, why do people buy Boze Hadleigh's trash anymore?

First of all why would any of them admit to something so private to this man? For the sake of argument, let's say Cary Grant was gay, why would he hide the truth from friends, and his family and the world, but admit it to Boze Hadleigh?The conversations come across as made up. I can't explain the feeling, it's something you'll have to see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Randolph Scott and Cary Grant were Friends nothing more","review":"The photo you are talking about is a movie promo picture. It's from the movie My Favorite Wife.

This book is utter crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiot's Delight","review":"This is one of the most ridiculous books that has ever been passed off as \\"nonfiction\\". Supposedingly, these veteran stars all couldn't wait to tell all to some minor writer. You might notice that there isn't a single picture of the author with any of the stars, yet he amazingly has detailed conversations with them, including someone like Randolph Scott who never gave any interviews the last thirty plus years of his life!! Also note how unbelievable the dialogue is and how each star's \\"voice\\" sounds much like the other, all are vagueish about their own sex life but can't wait to dish about everybody else. Possibly all of the people profiled (I can't bring myself to say interviewed) were gay or bisexual but if you believe these \\"interviews\\" I have a Brooklyn Bridge I would like to sell you at a nice price."},{"rating":"1","title":"AUTHOR WRITES AS IF HE IS GOD'S GIFT TO MEN","review":"This book is more about the author, Boze Hadleigh, than the so-called interviews. We get to read about when he was born and his parents, how he got his name, his religion, and ALL about his beliefs. He keeps interrupting his (snicker) interviews to preach about intolerence to gays. I am gay and I was insulted at his pompous attitude. I thought I was getting a book on the history of gay celebrities not a term paper by the author on gays. However, the most unbelievable part of this whole book is the way he has practically every star coming on to him. PUH-LEASE! Look at his picture on the jacket and it is evident that this could not possibly be the case. Just because he is gay does not mean every gay star wants to jump into bed with him. It is absurd and a diservice to gay men to suggest that all gays want to have sex with a any man like this character. What a joke!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood Hogwash","review":"Boze Hadleigh strikes again with another slew of over-heated tete-a-tetes that tax credulity. Where is there ANY corroborating evidence--a snippet of a tape recording, a photo, a breathing body who was on the scene--that these cozy confessionals actually took place? Not in this book, which would have you believe that every closeted superstar over the past forty years couldn't wait to babble into Hadleigh's ever-present microphone. Only in his dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a Newton Fan! It is a great cd, and I enjoy it daily.","review":"I have always been a Wayne Newton fan since I was a teen ager.

During the night it rained and the tent became so water logged, I could not carry it down the mountain on my back. I left it with other hikers to use as a shoe matt during the night. The tent went from 3lbs., which was a strong selling point to at least 12lbs. of a water logged waste. The rain fly covered the back of the tent, which you then expect the front and entrance to be water proof...do not expect that with this tent. I guess the there is truth to old saying, \\"You get what you pay for\\". The 1 star is for being only 3lbs."},{"rating":"1","title":"peice of garbage","review":"this tent doesen't work.

When it arrived I was disappointed, a cheap looking Shelter if there ever was one. I took it anyways, paying the price later when it rained heavily. All though I had a good sleeping bag, the Shelter tore instantly in cold wind, the stakes snapped and rips were everywhere. By day 5 it was just a ripped up tarp and I had to sleep in my good sleeping bag during the cold rain storm. Invest in a good three-season tent for $200 - $500."},{"rating":"2","title":"you could get wet","review":"I used this tent for 10 days on a 13 day bicycle camping trip. Its called a two person tent but it will only comfortably accomodate one. I had plenty of room for all of my gear and I could stretch out completely inside. It effectively kept the bugs out as well. Two people could use it but you'd have to be very close.It rained really hard several nights I was out and I'm certain that without the tarp I brought along, I would have been very wet. I used the fabric seam sealer and waterproofing silicone spray but I feel I still could have gotten wet. Bring a tarp if you plan on braving the elements.This tent is super duper light and portable. I used my own stuff sack that kept the thing the size of a football. I strapped the sturdy fiberglass stakes to my top bar.Overall, I'd say this is a wonderful tent for the money. I stayed dry, I easily lugged it over 990 miles on my bicycle, nothing broke, and it kept the bugs out. All that for under 40 bucks. Nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke the first time I used it.","review":"This was basically a one-use item for me, since the flexible rod which supports the smaller end of the tent split like green wood the first time I used it. I may get one more use out of it, but with the rod split, it was a little wobbly."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Ideas...The other reviewers must be friends of the authors! I wish half a star was an option.","review":"This book offers no marketing tactics. It stresses honesty and friends. THANKS GUYS...That helps. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY!

Of course I was very excited when I heard about it being continued. I was anxiously awaiting the sequel and ordered it the day it came out.Well, I was in for a disappointment. While the beginning of the book is pretty good, it's rather another Hawk & Fisher book and doesn't have much to do with \\"Blue Moon Rising\\". And from the point the plot leaves Haven, things are going downslope. The remaining 3/4 of the book is plain mediocre. While it was certainly not boring and it was mostly enjoyable read, it never lives up to its promise to deliver a worthy sequel to \\"Blue Moon Rising\\".If you're a big fan of Simon R. Green and/or \\"Blue Moon Rising\\" (like I am), get this book. Else, it might not be worth the hassle.While \\"Beyond the Blue Moon\\" is certainly better than the overstretched Deathstalker series, it's way behind all other fantasy books Mr. Green wrote this far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blergh...","review":"The heading says it all really... I have read and reread blue moon rising more times than i can count, and would easily call it one of my favourite novels. Naturally, i was excited when i heard of the coming sequel, and rushed to read it when it came out. I was bitterly disappointed. It was like a rushed effort to get all the characters together for a badly thought out adventure that ends like a bad scooby doo movie. Properly done, this could have been a great novel and it had some great ideas. As it is, i almost felt like weeping from disappointment when it was over. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll never please everyone","review":"But in this case, the only thing that did not please me about \\"Beyond the Blue Moon\\" was that it ended. I've heard a lot of praise for \\"Blue moon Rising\\", the prequel to the Hawk and Fisher series, but I came upon that book only shortly before \\"Beyond the Blue Moon\\". My Hawk and Fisher were in Haven and this seemed like a truly worthy send up of the two dealiest individuals in fantasy writing. My only regret is that Green isn't filling in a few more blanks in the lives of Hawk and Fisher in Haven. I honestly can't get enough of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROTTERS RULE!","review":"Don't kid yourself with the latest Blink 182 or Fenix TX.

I would give the book 5 stars. Unfortunately, the Kindle edition is a terrible version. It is full of errors; punctuation, spelling, grammatical. It was very, very distracting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Brooks masterpiece","review":"Druid ranks among my favorite books in the series. Getting a look into Walker's unhappy past added great depth to his character, and often I identified with some of his resentment and unhappiness. Morgan Leah also develops wonderfully in this book and is fast becoming one of my favorite shannara characters. Kudos for creating a fascinating villain in Pe Ell, the asassin. Curiously, i noted some similarities between him and Artemis Entreri, the trademark villain created by RA salvatore (a Brooks protege). Hopefully Tanequil will continue where Druid left off in the exploration of the relatively unknown Northland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most","review":"When I read the book I almost needed tissues as one of the reviewers said. The story was great and the characters were even better. Leah family has been my favourite through the whole series and Morgan was deffinitively fabulous. Pe Ell was great- a sick killer who is intellgient! The only thing I didn't like about the book was the fact that the characters are not very developed(in the sence that some of their actions are not fully explained). For example, we know that Quickening is in love with Morgan and her love is all wraped up in a veil of secret but we have no idea why she likes him so much when she is an elemental, a supreme being. It is not very logical and I had the feeling that Terry put this inside the story just to make some sensitive souls(like myself) cry and I don't like being manipulated like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uhl Belk Rocks!","review":"This is the 2nd book in the \\"Heritage\\" series, and it follows Walker Boh, Morgan Leah, and Quickening in their journey to recover the black elfstone and restore Paranor to the Four Lands. Quickening is sent by the king of the Silver River. She is an elemental with wonderous powers. During her journey, she encounters Pe Ell; an assassin sent by Rimmer Dal to kill her. They break Morgan Leah out of prison, join with Walker Boh, and journey to Eldwist in search of the black elfstone. Eldwist is the home of Uhl Belk, the stone king, who is in possession of the elfstone. There are other creatures, such as the Rake, which patrol Eldwist. Morgan becomes very close to Quickening and falls in love with her. This is perhaps the best book in the \\"Heritage\\" series. Brooks fans will enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, can't put it down","review":"Come on people the book is incredible. it leaves just enough to your imagination to captivate you and make it hard to stop reading. the storyline is great, twists and turns many. albeit predictable sometimes but not always. He's constructed a written world in which the characters of the story are not the only players - the world goes on outside the focus of the story and you see it happening as you go along. certain people that enter and leave the story before you realize they were probably a very complex being. overall i think the book had great depth and i think some have underrated it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing reading.

This is by far, the worst e-book I have read. The scan used to create the books is fully of typos - often more than one per \\"page\\", including errors with main character names and letter combinations that are not even words. I found the problems very disturbing and annoying. E-books are cheaper for a reason - they should not lack the basic proof-reading that you would expect from a 7th grader."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Heritage","review":"I found this book to be the best of the Heritage series, followed by Elfstones.

I wish the Shannara story would never end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another future classic from Terry Brooks.","review":"Northwest author Terry Brooks throws another strike with the second installment in his Heritage of Shannara series. Characters were deep and emotional, and I especially enjoyed Brooks' ability to constantly take the reader into the mind of each of them to give him/her a first-hand perspective of how each of the characters thinks and feels. I think that Brooks is the first truly great fantasy author of our time, and his books are a must read for anyone interested in the fantasy genre. I also liked how Brooks did not limit himself to what he saw on the map in the front of the book. The one problem I had with the book was the slight lack of plot turns. Having read all of Brooks' previous titles, I found the way the storyline moved to be a little too much like some of his previous work. I would reccomend this book to anyone interested in a fast-paced, fun adventure book"},{"rating":"2","title":"The half-mark of an amazing history","review":"This books gives depth to the lurky areas of the Four Land's past, down to the beginnning of time itself. I for one, enjoyed it thoroughly. It is defiantly a good continuation book and keeps you constantly thinking of when the dark Pe Ell is going to do, what will happen to Quickening, and how it is going to all end. You will find yourself feeling the heart break or sorrow of a character to the hope of another. But most of all, it leaves you thinking: \\"Now what?\\" at the end. You also will feel somewhat prideful of the heros but you have to read the Talismans of Shannara to find out how it all ends"},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointing, mediocre, recycled junk from Terry Brooks","review":"Terry Brooks should win the RECYCLING award, should such prize be invented.

Barger and Olsson need to consider explaining themselves more clearly, especially when dealing with advanced mathematical topics. Simply stating \\"this is a tensor\\" does not adequately explain the concept. An appendix of mathematical concepts is *needed*.

I have read around 10 books on fulltiming. This is far and away the worst one I have read. The author who is 67 years old, not even close to 50, describes her and her husbands little adventure traveling around the USA and Canada. If you want to know where the best chiropractors are or how meditation gets her through life then by all means buy this book. There is very little on how to retire in your 50's and go full timing. They started out in a 25ft trailer(way to small) and after about a month bought a brand new 42ft motorhome. One thing you will learn is the name of every friend she has, because they visted every single one of them and they were mentioned in her book. This is one book that once you put it down you won't be able to pick it back up.

But still pretty exciting if overlong and too ambitious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Terrible Stuff","review":"Lawton's debut novel is a dud. The writing style is stilted, dry, and forced. The characters are two-dimensional, and the plot is boring and tainted with anti-American sentiment.

It starts with a gushing, cloyingly sweet description of life in the 50's, and then follows the lives of her many, interesting characters into the 90's without ever fully developing them. I still don't see the point of this book, except as an exercise in over-romanticized nostalgia for an America that never was. It completely overlooks the civil rights era.

Flagg does a wonderful job creating these charcters and it is one of those books that makes you sad when you finally read the last page. It was a true joy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair... just fair","review":"I usually love Fannie Flagg's works with her rich characters and plot twists. But \\"Rainbow\\" was lagging a bit in both departments. Beginning in the 40's, the book spans over 40 years of life in small town Missouri... or does it? Flagg seems to get lost in an overabundance of characters and plot lines. I wanted to know more about Betty Rae's relationship with her husband's mistress, or how Doc and Dorothy's children really did in the world. I wanted more of life on the gospel road with the Oatman's, and more about Jimmy and the Blind Songbird.... but alas, all the characters got muddled toward the end, and it felt like Flagg was on a deadline to finish the manuscript and just tied some neat little bows on the plot without real resolution.The audio book was a great way to pass time on the road, but I felt very disappointed at the end... I wanted more and it just wasn't there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome read","review":"I wonderful book, hard to put down. I did not want the stories to end.I highly recommend the uplifting pages to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"ordered large print and got small print. bought it for 85 year old mom who requires large print and was not able to give it to her for christmas. waste of money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God for Fannie Flagg!","review":"This novel was funny, touching, and poignant. Flagg manages to capture an American era, spending the most time writing about the 40's and 50's. As the novel progresses, the reader becomes more attached to the people of Elmwood Springs. The last few chapters had me in tears. This was a wonderful novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total YAWNER","review":"This doesn't even come close to Fried Green Tomatoes. Nothing happened and I kept waiting for something to happen. But by the time something did sort of happen you didn't care. It was the same thing chapter after chapter. I chose this clunker for book club and had to eat plate fulls of crow and humble pie since no one liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"sentimental view of post WWII America","review":"You'd hardly know this is the same author who wrote \\"Daisy Fay and the Miracle Man\\". As much as that book was smart and spirited and fun, \\"Standing in the Rainbow\\" is mawkish without a gripping story or good characterization. There seems to be no real point to the book other than to say over and over, Wasn't life great back then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth finishing.","review":"I have enjoyed Fannie Flagg's other novels in the past, but after nearly 200 pages I looked for reviews to tell me whether a plot would ever actualize in this one. Apparently, not. This book was annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"True history.","review":"I've been looking forward to this book because I was born in Birch Tree, MO. I've lived in Missouri all my life and do know some of the history. Right away on page 27 a huge mistake! Doc and Bobby go to St.Louis to see the Cardinals play the St.Louis Browns in the World Series. Bobby had his picture taken under the \\"big steel Gateway Arch\\". I don't think so! The Arch wasn't built until the early '60's. This spoiled the book for me right away. Why do some authors not research history and make their novels realistic even though they are a work of fiction?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty awful","review":"I found that the characters personalities were all the same. It seemed that Fannie was looking back through rose colored cataracts. If this was her first novel, she would have had trouble getting it published. There are so many good books out there, this just isn't one of them"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"I know Ms. Flagg is a good writer; let's hope this is her worst work. The characters are one-dimensional and stereotypical, the story lines are all over the place, and it's just a dull read. I don't like books that *try* to pull at your heartstrings. This one's worse--she tries, and fails miserably. A book club pick that was the biggest dud ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standing in the Rainbow","review":"This is a thoroughly enjoyable read. The only thing that disappointed me about this book, was finishing it. I only have time to read for a few minutes in the evenings and every evening I looked forward to the few moments before bedtime that I could spend with the characters in this story.It's so refreshing to read a story that's all about the characters and their stories. It's not about the cussing, or how many sex scenes and 3 dollar words can be packed between the covers by arrogant authors whose thesaureses lay open next to their computers. It's just a pleasant read packed full of humor and justice for all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"This is one of my favorite novels by Flagg. A must-read for anyone who loves witty humor and lovable characters. Flagg is a wonderful southern author and knows how to tell a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel Good Novel","review":"Standing in the Rainbow (Ballantine Reader's Circle)I was introduced to this book and this author through the book club I attend. This novel was a great find! I thoroughly enjoyed entering the world of Elmwood Springs, Missouri in circa 1940. Neighbor Dorothy and her friends have become cherished acquaintances. I loved this book so much that when I found a follow-up \\"Can't Wait to Get to Heaven\\" in my local library I grabbed that up and read it as well. Enjoyed it every bit as much as the first one. I highly recommend this book to anyone who would enjoy a feel good read and don't be surprised if you find yourself smiling or even laughing out loud frequently as you read about the folks of Elmwood Springs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Echoes of a Simpler Life!","review":"This is a warm, sprawling novel that will appeal to many,because of its sympathetic portrayal of marriage and small-town life, and its evoking of a simpler time when people of character seemed to do what was right.The novel centers on a daily half-hour radio program during which Dorothy Smith exchanges cooking tips and recipes, talks about her family's doings, and invites her listeners to stop by for a cup of coffee. The program is like a friendly visit for her listeners, lonely farmwives in the rural Midwest.Flagg's book depicts good moral people,and the characters are left feeling nostalgia for the past, with echoes of Lake Wobegon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Ever read a book that just made you feel good? Where you became so attached to the main character that you wished she were part of your family? Such is the case with Dorothy, Fannie Flagg's protagonist in Standing in the Rainbow.Neighbor Dorothy has a daily radio broadcast from her living room, and very faithful listeners who tune in religiously to jot down recipes, buy the books she recommends, enjoy her regular guests as well as the new ones.A full cast of characters surrounds Dorothy, from her husband and children, to their friends, neighbors, and a few gospel singers.Flagg delves into the lives of each one of these interesting people throughout the novel. The pace of the writing is slow, which helps bring to life the small town of Elmwood Springs, Missouri of the forties. The novel spans the decades up to the nineties, bringing laughter, happiness, sadness, and a little bit of mystery to the reader. You won't want to miss a word!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Honoring Community","review":"The ability of the characters in this book to get up every day and with good humor and grace live their lives in the best way they can is a model for us all. The book shines with the value placed on family and friendship. The characters are able to adapt to situations and move on. If you want to connect to real people from the heartland, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and warm","review":"Even though Fannie Flagg places this novel in Missouri, I recognized a lot of the places as being from AL where Flagg grew up. I grew up in the same area, and went to Cascade Plunge in the summer and shopped at Morgan Department store, etc. I also recognized some of the Missouri areas, also. It was fun to see how she blended the areas together.This book was a really good read for me. I loved the characters and how the lives of each of them developed. It left me with a real warm feeling and a sense of how fleeting the years are.It took me a few chapters to really get into the book, but then it grabbed me and I couldn't put it down until I finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in my first Fannie Flagg read","review":"I was overall disappointed in my first read by Fannie Flagg. I heard many people rave about Standing in the Rainbow. However, I was left somewhat bored by the story. I was able to draw out the theme of trying to find life and to stand in your own rainbow but was truly disappointed, as the story never seemed to go anywhere. There was no true plot, no climax build up and really no overall story. Perhaps if I wasn't in my 20's but rather in my 60's or 70's, I might have enjoyed the story more. To me it was a book I would have been better off giving to my Grandmother to enjoy. I haven't given up hope on Flagg, I would like to read Fried Green Tomatoes (have seen the movie) as this novel seemed to have been Flagg's signature piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading to Feel Good","review":"This book is a wonderful read to just enjoy -- feeling like you are sitting down with a friend over a cup of coffee and discussing what's happening in your community. And, if you have any ties to small town America (I've lived in a town of 500 people as well as towns of 2 million) -- you will recognize some people in this book!It's not great literature, but it's fun and reminds us what the basics of America are! This is one of many types of books that should be included among an assorment of reading material where \\"variety is the spice of life\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Voice and Character","review":"This novel spans the 40's to the 90's in a small Missouri town. The beginning of the novel is a bit slow but as I got into the book I realized that was due in part to the depth of the characters the author was creating.The voices that Fannie Flagg creates in this novel are so much fun to read. You become their friends and want to see where they are going to end up. There are some fun twists and just enough humor to keep you entertained throughout.This is the perfect book to read in short spurts. There are wonderful short chapters. I used it as a great lunchtime read.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like this one at all","review":"I've read all of Fannie Flagg's books & I did not like this one at all. In this book, the characters are good, and I enjoyed the connection to \\"Welcome to the World...\\". However, I was unable to develop enough of an interest in any of the characters to want to learn more about them or even care what happened to them. As I got closer to the end of the book, I found myself skimming the pages just to get it over with."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you need to fall asleep this will help","review":"Had to read this for book club, BORING. Will never read a Fannie Flag book again. Only one person in our book club liked this book. Most people did not even finish it. The most boring and unbelievable book I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor research","review":"I was very disappointed that Ms. Flagg did not research well before writing this novel. She writes that Bobby got his picture taken under the Gateway Arch while on a trip to the World Series in the late 40's. The Arch was built in 1965."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANNIE FLAGG","review":"I RETURNED THE BOOK BECAUSE I ALREADY HAD IT AND REORDED IT BY MISTAKE.

SET IN THE SMALL TOWN OF ELMWOOD SPRINGS, MISSOURI STARTING IN THE 1930'S, SHE WEAVES A TALE AROUND THE SMITH FAMILY, INCLUDING EXPERTLY INCLUDING NEIGHBOR DOROTHY FROM WELCOME TO THE WORLD, BABY GIRL. THERE IS ALSO A VARIETY OF OTHER COLORFUL CHARACTERS THAT SHE MAKES US GROW TO FEEL LIKE FAMILY.THE ONLY PART OF THIS BOOK I HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE BELIEVING, ALTHOUGH IT IS FICTION, WAS THE GOVERNORSHIP OF HAMM AND BETTE RAE SPARKS. SHE NEVER REALLY SHOWED US HOW BETTE RAE GREW FROM A SHY \\"VEGETABLE GIRL\\" TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI. I FEEL LIKE THAT PORTION WAS A BIT OVER THE TOP.ALL IN ALL THOUGH, THIS IS AN EXCELLENT READ.

But at the same time, a subtle commentary on the Cultural Revolution. It's entirely possible to miss the connection and still thoroughly enjoy this novel. It gets rather difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction, which is how writing should be. The author is a master of language and of characterization. This is another author who I'm gonna hunt down, and another book I'll reread. I almost never reread anything. It's the highest compliment I can pay a book, because my attention span is horrendously short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fannie Flagg books","review":"The story is read entertainingly by the author Fannie Flagg. If you enjoy listening to the details of everyday small town life in the past generation, this is enjoyable. However, I did not find depth of meaning or character development."},{"rating":"2","title":"A PIECE OF THE PAST","review":"This book is so wonderfully written. I have read \\"Welcome to the World Baby Girl\\" and \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" and although this book was different, it was just as good. Even though the majority of the book takes place before I was born, it made me feel as if I had been there and wanted to go back. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a piece of the past in todays fast and sometimes scarey times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glorious!","review":"A hot summer weekend, the front porch swing, and this wonderful book!! Life doesn't get much better, unless you're in Elmwood Springs. I slowed down towards the end of this book, because I did not want it to end. I wanted to step through the pages of this book, and live in Elmwood Springs with all the wonderful people already there. This terrific story is a cross between \\"Our Town\\", The \\"Mitford Series\\" and \\"Steel Magnolias\\". (With more than a pinch of \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" added for flavor. ) Don't hesitate. You will love this book, love the people in it, and think about them long after you're finished. Please, please, let there be a sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We're all standing in a rainbow . . .","review":"What an uplifting book. I didn't want the story to end. I want to know more about what happens to the very real characters who live in this book. The author is telling the reader to take notice! We create our world and our rainbow. The most special and magical moments are happening to us right now in the most everyday ways possible. Accept today for the joy it brings and choose to \\"stand in the rainbow\\" rather than the rain! I hope to read more about Bobby's life as a teacher, Linda and Buttons, Betty Raye's grandchildren, and all the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small Town Splendor","review":"This is the first book of Fannie Flagg's that I have read and I found it to be a charmingly written love letter to small town life. The characters and situations deriving from events that occur over decades is charmingly written with characters that are wonderfully fleshed out.Towards the end of the story, when Miss Flagg begins to relate what happened to each of the characters, you find yourself wishing her to stop, as you don't want to say goodbye to these fun people.Miss Flagg takes the time to incorporate history into her characters as she relates their stories and thereby weaves magic into the folks from Elmwood Springs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not as great as \\"Daisy Fay and the Miracle Man\\"","review":"I've read all of Fannie Flagg's books and this one was really good, although it didn't quite resonate with me the way \\"Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe\\" did or hold my attention the way that \\"Daisy Fay and the Miracle Man\\" did. Over all, though, its a book worth reading. You'll love the characters, except for Hamm Sparks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but not practical - handle gets hot","review":"This tea kettle is very pretty but unfortunately I am returning it as I just tested it for the first time and the handle is extremely hot; so hot in fact that I am unable to pick it up.

It looks so nice sitting on the stove. I use med. heat (on a gas range) and the water heats up very quickly. I leave the handle straight up and it never gets too hot to pick up with bare hands. I don't know what people are doing that the handle gets hot, maybe leaving it lay on the side of the pot? Love the pot and love the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"gripping book","review":"It's been a few years since I've read this book, but I still remember it as one of the most interesting nonfiction books I've read. A biography of a famous lawyer written by his daughter. When Clarrence Darrow (of the infamous \\"Scopes Trial\\" about teaching evolution in schools) himself needed a lawyer, Earl Rogers was who he chose. And Rogers was that good (I guess the modern-day equivalent is Gerry Spence). The book follows a few of his trials and it's a really gripping read. Although it may be a little hard tracking it down, you won't regret doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very good, so why has no one given a review yet?","review":"Watched this many years ago when it first came out on tape. It's been in the collection since, and I think much underrated. Probably the title, as many don't think of this as \\"The Prince and the Pauper.\\" Great cast, script, scenes, everything is absolutely topnotch in this effort to create cinema on Mark Twain's first attempt at a fictional \\"historical novel.\\" You'll enjoy it if you've not yet seen it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best version of Prince and the Pauper","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I would recommend it for adults because the vocabulary and content may be too difficult for younger viewers. Very true to book adaptation of Twain's novel - Mark Lester was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crossed","review":"I bought this because of the stellar cast of actors and actresses in the various supporting roles. They performed as expected, and the movie is quite good for its type. There are two problems. One is just impossible to avoid, in that anyone young enough to play the two lead roles is going to be too inexperienced to really do them justice, especially if they attempt distinct accents. The other was the sound. If I could have muted out the overly loud an annoying music, I'd have rated it a point higher. Still, recommended, and I find myself inspired to watch the 1974 version of the Three Musketeers again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Control review","review":"I like the chapters for Fear, Concentration, and Attitude. I am amazed about the things about life I learn in these chapters, especially in a bike book.It will be good if the book include topics like, street riding at night, riding in the rain, riding in the rain at night, riding in strong wind, tips for short riders like me (160cm).I ride CBR600 F3.Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical Exercises","review":"I really like using this book because Parks outlines several practical exercises to improve riding skills. My cornering skills have improved using these exercises.This is not the a first book for the new motorcyclist, Proficient Motorcycling by Hough fills that spot.However, I am not trying to suggest that Parks' book for the novice. Practicing the riding exercises from Total Control is a useful next step beyond the Experienced Riders Course, a riding class offered in the U.S.Greater skills for me equals greater safety. Hough's and Parks' books are an excellent starting points."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good info","review":"There's a lot of good information in this book.

I have read Park's, Total Control and Hough's More proficient motorcycle riding. Park's book is more geared to the proper mechanics of riding. Hough's book addresses the crap to look out for on the road.The BIG difference is the examples he uses to further explain the process. They are with out a doubt some of the best examples I have seen for teaching a sports related process.He goes into proper bike set up. He adresses saftey gear, Suspension set up, traction,steering, and probably the biggest gorilla Fear. Let's face it Motorcycling is about the thrill of carving a turn. Managing that so it remains a thrill and not down right scary is the goal for me. Mr Park's really hit a homerun with his Mental Dynamics section.Enjoy your copy cause I'm not loaning mine out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative for an experienced rider without formal training.","review":"If you can't learn anything from this book then you are a very informed motorcyclist. I really had very little interest in about half of the book and the subjects covered. But the other half contained either things I didn't know or things I need to remind myself of on a regular basis. This is a book I'll keep and reread the highlighted parts once a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for beginners, boring for advance","review":"This book may be a good read for someone that is new to riding a sport bike, with only a very basic idea of how to ride. It does go into some good fundemental tips and techniques, he also reviews some riding gear, and setting up your ergo's. So, if this is the first motorcycle book you have ever purchased, and you have only been riding for a little while, and dont plan on being a hard-core knee dragger, then sure buy this book.However, if you are an experienced rider, this book is flat out boring. I even caught myself shaking my head in disbelief at some of this guys points of view and advice.

I improved my comfort in turns literally 15 minutes after I sat down with the book. I'm serious. I was out on the deck BBQing and reading the book, realized I needed to drop by the supermarket to pick up some more foodstuff. Tried using only the inside arm to turn and relaxing the outside arm - and what do you know, I turned far better than before.I have to admit, some of the content in the book felt out of place. No I do not need a chapter on attitude or alcohol, or meditation - those felt out of place in a book about riding technique. Just the same, the clear illustrations of what to do and what not to do are priceless and extremely helpful and just those alone are worth 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consider this book as a low cost safety gear.","review":"After a 40 year layoff I decided to buy another motorcycle. I was a safe rider and feel like a beginner. This book contains a well presented how-to for safe and relaxed riding. Even an old dog like me can and did learn new tricks. Many of the steering and control techniques I learned by trial and error are very well explained and illustrated. Chapters are short, to-the-point and well thought out. Highly recommended to young and old alike. Lee Parks knows his stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book - Another Must Read","review":"I first read \\"A Twist of the Wrist 2: The Basics of High-Performance Motorcycle Riding\\", then I read this book. I greatly appreciated Twist of the Wrist for providing the geeky details and well-written descriptions of what was happening to the bike and rider when everything is working correctly (or not), but this book was able to add some more pictures that helped to clarify things which weren't clear to me from Twist of the Wrist.There were some descriptions in Total Control that resonated better with me than what was in Twist of the Wrist, and vice versa. The same thing can be said for the drawings and pictures.My recommendation: buy both books. If you don't like reading very much and want better step-by-step pictures, then Total Control is probably the better book for you. Once again, I strongly recommend buying both books - Total Control and Twist of the Wrist 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking book","review":"I have been riding street, dirt, DS and performance bikes for 40 years, this book gave me some things to slow down and think about.

The answer in this case, sadly, is NO! This DVD issue of \\"To Catch a Thief\\" has NOT been restored, and is in no better than the washed out VHS version.This is particularly regretable here, as this lightweight but irresitibly sweet and charming Hitchcock romp (which was awarded an Academy Award for best cinephotography,) relies heavily for its appeal on breathtaking visuals; ie., the spectacular aerial shots of the famous coastline of the French Riviera, the fire-works scene, the opulent costume ball, etc..My one star rating then is for the poor quality of the DVD, not of course for this much-loved film, which represents the highest possible level of light entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cary at his best with the princess","review":"Cary Grant and Grace Kelly set new measures for a top quality thriller.

It's just that there's a lot more double entendre, humor, and romance than one usually associates with most of his films. Then, of course, teaming Grace Kelly with Cary Grant on the French Riviera pretty much screamed romance, and on top of this there's the luscious, academy-award-winning cinematography of Robert Burk. The dialogue in this marvelously witty, romp is also magically delicious. Grant is dashing, ascerbic, and charming, and Kelly is simply dazzling in Edith Head's beautiful gowns. The chemistry between the two stars hardly needed actual fireworks, and one can only imagine Hitchcock smiling hugely as the night sky outside the hotel window erupts with overkill behind them as they kiss. TO CATCH A THIEF is a must for any serious film-lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Catch a Thief (Special Collector's Edition)","review":"To Catch A ThiefAlfred Hitchcock's To Catch A Thief is a light hearted romp on the French Rivera. The French Rivera was one of Hitchcock's favorite locales and setting this movie there was like coming home.Of course, you have the suave Cary Grant, aging but still on top of his game, and the beautiful Grace Kelly. The world lost a great actress when she found her Prince Charming and left the film world forever.With car chases along cliffs and a mysterious thief depriving the rich women of their precious jewels, you have a great film filled with humor and suspense. The ending is a bit of Hitchcock's mischief.Edith Head's costumes are in the grand European tradition. She was nominated for an Oscar. Roger Burks's beautiful cinematography won the only Oscar.The DVD quality is excellent as a number of reviewers have stated. This is a great film in the old tradition of comedy and suspense with a tidy mystery tossed in for good measure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful People","review":"This film has the royalty of Hollywood in it. Cary Grant(did he ever appear in a bad movie?), Grace Kelly at her most beautiful, and Alfred Hitchcock(ok, he appears for a few seconds and he is not beautiful) appear in one of the most famous films in history. To say you eill like this movie is an underststement-you will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful old movie","review":"This movie was great to watch and see areas in Europe that we had been to in the past, as well as following the mystery the two stars were trying to solve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant version discards 22% of the picture","review":"This great movie was filmed with VistaVision, having a 1:85:1 aspect ratio. If you get this movie over Instant Video, it's cropped to fit a standard 16:9 television. This means that you don't see the movie as Alfred Hitchcock filmed it, because 22% of the picture has been discarded to make it fit your TV.There's nothing in the description to warn you of this, and no digital option for a letterbox version. If you don't care about getting the entire picture (a lot of people won't), then it's ok to rent it digitally. However, if you want to see this classic movie as it was originally filmed, you should get the Blu-Ray version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu-ray Picture Quality","review":"It's like watching an original print on the Big Screen in a movie theater - it's equal to the Blu-ray quality of \\"The Searchers\\"; i.e. *cannot* be any better.

What I had been most anticipating was viewing the delicious technicolor cinematography which garnered an Academy Award for Robert Burks. What a disappointment! The picture quality is grainy and the colors are somewhat washed out. This I could see on the late, late movie on my local T.V. station. So, if you just want to enjoy the story and the entertaining performances by Grant and Kelly, go ahead and buy it. However, if you were looking forward to the beautiful visuals, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart and classy","review":"Hitchcock and Cary Grant bring their customary magic to this stylish and frothy thriller-cum-romance. While this film may certainly be more to the taste of the female half of the population than the male, Grant's debonair ease and the suspense involved in cat-and-mouse game between police, suspect, and real thief is enough to keep anyone interested, and the snappy dialogue between the main leads anchors this well-made film. There's neither deep passionate romance nor spine-tingling suspense, making the film lack that quality of being truly great, but it succeeds very well at what it attempts - to be a light and very fun theft/romance film with a touch of Hitchcockian darkness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Princess exits 'Gracefully'","review":"This is the third and final of Hitchcock's romantic suspense entities featuring the pulchritudinous Grace Kelly and the ever so suave and urbane Cary Grant. It has a perfect mix of suspense and romance along with the buena vista of Monaco. A fine addition to anyones collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"great flick","review":"This is a fun movie. I turn the closed caption on because there is some French spoken in it, and I can read it better than I can comprehend it spoken.

This movie proves his sense of humor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classics","review":"Good acting, fun plot, suspenseful, great scenery , they just don't have acting like this anymore.

All else is gravy.A tanned and much older Cary Grant is a bit tight - reformed thief on the run from cops does not play well into this strengths.Nice Cote-d-Azur backdrop."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Chemistry Between the Stars","review":"Perhaps it's Cary Grant's robot like charm. Or perhaps it's Grace Kelly's utter lack of it, but somehow these two never looked like their romantic radars were on the same wavelength. Grace Kelly is beautiful in a classic, albeit unexotic way, but her acting is nonexistent, as is the chemistry she generates with Cary Grant.As for Mr. Grant, Grace Kelly seems to be the last thing he is interested in. It's a wonder things work out he way they do. Cary Grant banked on his remarkable charming screen presence, while Grace Kelly serves as window dressing with no personality. It would have been nicer had she lost that fak-o English accent. It's really too much.Kudos to the beautiful setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Frightening","review":"Intentional or not, the scariest part of this film is the very beginning. Maybe I'm just twisted but the opening shot of the ugly lady in curlers and cold cream screaming \\"my jewels, my jewels, Help!!police!\\" is particularly jarring and turned me off immediately. No kidding, this one brief scene gave me nightmares. I love Hitchcock but I NEVER want to watch this film again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caught this movie again on DVD (recommended)","review":"This is one of Hitchcock's most treasured romantic suspense stories. Nearly everyone is out to catch a thief. This includes the French police, Cary Grant, some beautiful women, and Lloyds of London. Most involved assume they are all looking for the same individual. Only one knows differently. Everyone on this breathtaking Paris hunt has his or her own plans for the captured Cat burglar -- whether it be to shoot, protect, question, imprison, or love. TO CATCH A THIEF launches a charming race for all possible outcomes.Discovering the ending is only garnish on the main course that is certain to be enjoyed multiple times. I eventually replaced the well-used VHS with a more durable DVD. Grace Kelly plays a seductive game of cat and mouse. This is one of my all-time favorites.Movie quote: \\"A child?

The scene where he is in the office of the restaurant with his friend got on my nerves and I quit watching it shortly after. In the scene the friend is standing up at his desk. Leans over towards a drawer and grabs a box. He says to Grant, \\"here I have something for you\\". And he puts a box on the table. But when he said \\"here I have something for you\\" his lips never moved. He didn't say anything!

I felt sorry for the author and did not, as I never do--and most especially with the Times--take the review to be anything close to definitive. When the book came out in paperback I decided to take a look. Well, there are millions of people in this country reading bodice-ripper romances so I imagine there's litle enough harm in one more intellectual poser having his or her say: it gives the downtown crowd and academics something to talk about, the usual \\"cutting-edge\\" crowd can mythologise one more of their own, and everyone is happy. ...

People, animals, machines, etc. are all described in abstract terms that relate the parts to the functions. Neither parts nor functions are familiar, and words are substituted in such a way as to impart only the fuzziest notion of what is being discussed. A recurring gimmick involves using proper names to denote inanimate objects. For instance, \\"the Ben Marcus\\" is apparently some kind of parchment that can be hung from a pole. The writing is really very imaginative, and by the end of the book a kind of sketch of the novel's universe emerges. The whole thing reads like Mad Libs, but not in a bad way."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extraordinary act of imagination.","review":"This one goes straight into the \\"not like any other book\\" category--it's difficult reading, but completely entrancing and thought-provoking.

Before purchasing this book I read reviews praising Marcus' style and non-linear story telling but I fail to see any story being told at any point in this book. I'm sure Marcus has a solid grasp of the English language as his constant use of interlocking wordplay indicates, but he could use it to such greater degrees and actually accomplish some form of a goal with his work.This work has served me one purpose which is why I did not rate it one star.

However, there is one more musical problem; the missing music in \\"Springtime for Steele.\\" The credits open with the character Rocky Sullivan singing the words of \\"Hooray for Hollywood,\\" but that's not the music. Although the show had the music for \\"Hooray for Hollywood\\" even in syndication, it's been replaced on the DVD with a horrible tune with the wrong tempo that actually fights against Rocky's singing. It's painful to listen to it!This is a terrific DVD set. The only reasons I can't give it five stars are the lack of extras, the missing Tony Bennett song, and the missing \\"Hooray for Hollywood\\" music. I wish they'd been as successful in getting all the music rights as were the producers of the \\"Moonlighting\\" DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"replaced MUSIC","review":"I love Remington Steele, and was very upset to find they'd left out the original Tony Bennett songs in the episode of \\"Steele Trying\\". That's the San Francisco episode. I also read that some of the music in other episodes has changed, but I didn't notice it myself. Steele Trying was incredible in its original airing and the A&E reruns, expressions all timed to match the music, now its nothing special and occasionally the expressions seem stupid as they are out of context. All of this said, I would still have bought these DVD's as it is still Remington Steele and many of the episodes are still great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly, this book was just OK","review":"It wasn't a great book. But it wasn't terrible either. This book goes back and forth from the past to the present and that was a bit annoying. Also, the main character was a bit annoying too. That's not something you'd like your main character to be. I think I liked the other characters better. However, I was glad by the end of the book that she (main character) finally accepted herself for who she was.Unlike the other reviewer, I don't think living in LA will probably make you care or appreciate this book. I live in LA. I lived in Watts, Compton, South LA, and now I'm in East LA-Alhambra area.I wouldn't recommend this book though, sorry. To be really honest, it was predictable.

Clearly the author had as much love and respect for her readers as she had for her characters.I got the sensation that this book was intended to be sold for movie rights (or television rights, perhaps HBO could really profit from the violence and the lesbian sex scenes) instead of as a stand-alone book.(cue Reading Rainbow theme song)If you are interested in reading a book where a bunch of terrible things happen to not necessarily likeable characters, I highly recommendSuite Francaise, by Irene N��mirovsky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let it go out of print","review":"Although it was meant for a one-year course, this text lacks much basic material. There is no set theory, no second-order logic, and almost nothing on recursion. Many basic concepts are given cursory mention.

It has the usual twisting and looping of plot and charactor you would expect from a Power's novel but it is much deeper and darker in tone and content. There are those who don't like this book, simply because it is not as easy and light in tone as past novels he has written (Drawing of the Dark,Anubis Gates) but if you have read his other works, it is nice to see that he isn't willing to settle into a rut. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have patience!","review":"If you've never read a Tim Powers book before, stick with this story early. All his books are impenetrable in the early going, but if you just let yourself go with the flow, you wind up getting swept along by the sheer force of the plot. The pattern applies with this book, and it all gets pretty neatly tied up in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leftovers","review":"This work appears to have been assembled from notes for other books. There is no coherent narrative, really, and the various plot threads are not so much woven together as tangled.

Sorry Tim - didn't like this one at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"I absolutely adored Anubis Gates, and thought Last Call was OK, but this book really left me flat. I actually had trouble finishing it, and got the sense Tim did as well when he wrote it; it has a plodding feel to it towards the end.I never managed to fully suspend disbelief, and had a hard time getting over the silliness of much of the plot. For the real out-there, wacko stuff, he should stick with more fantastic settings, and not post-riot LA."},{"rating":"2","title":"The essence of this book is longing.","review":"This book is a beautiful exploration of the fantastic that, while not as good as the classic Anubis Gates or the masterful Last Call, isn't far behind them. The phenomenon of 'Bar Time' alone is a fascinating detail (one of literally _hundreds_ that dot this story) and one that brings to mind recent physics experiments in 'synchronicity' that used photons to demonstrate connections across vast space.Powers goes one better; he demonstrates connections across the gulf of death. From the exodus of Edison/Kootie across a nightmarish LA to the arrangment of tv antennas and electrical wiring to allow a dead man to maintain his hold on his body undisturbed by those that would literally 'consume' him, to the cost of ghost-eating as a habit, this book flinches very rarely. Powers is one of the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call this one Premature Expiration Date","review":"To quote Dorothy Parker, \\"this is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly, it should be thrown with great force.\\" About a third of the way through this one it got assigned to the used book store stack. Sure, the plot was convoluted, but I expected that from Powers. My problem with this book was the lack of reward in reading it. By the time I gave up none of the characters meant anything to me. In short, Powers had not given me any reason to keep reading, other than (possibly) figuring out what was going on. I'm sorry, but I require more from a novel. I was quite dissapointed, since I consider Annubis Gates one of the best books of any genre. Expiration Date was DOA at my house, and I probably won't be buying anymore of Powers' work."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are a sister...you must read this book","review":"For anyone who has a sister, or knows sisters, this book offers every possible scenario. If your mother or your best friend is a sister, you will better understand her sister bond once you've read Susan Shapiro Barash's interviews with sisters and the voices of experts in the field of family relationships. The sisters in SISTERS : DEVOTED OR DIVIDED are all ages and walks of life, and ethnically diverse. Yet their feelings about their sisters, whether they are jealous or competitive, or supportive or exclusive, are similar. Barash finds some amazing tales, including sisters who steal their sisters' husband or boyfriend, to sisters who carry their infertile sister's baby. What an important book for me, having struggled with my own sister at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute but disappointing...","review":"I was so excited to put this train set together.

This time I will test it out in private so I can avoid upsetting a toddler who still thinks I should be able to make even a piece of junk work properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! It's totally frustrating!","review":"The only good things I can say is I got this free at Toys R Us when I bought a train table, and my kids love it (when they're able to play with it). It takes an incredibly long and frustrating time to figure out how to put it together, then it falls apart at the slightest touch. The parts where the tracks connect are too loose. I decided to glue them together, and they lasted for a couple days that way, then fell apart again. I do not recommend this train set at all!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No younger kid can put this together.","review":"Part of the fun for a younger kid is putting the tracks together, pulling apart, putting back together. This is difficult to piece together and even more harder to keep it that way. No younger kid will be able to make it work and no older kid will want to play with this train toy line. Sorry imaginarium!"},{"rating":"1","title":"To frustrating for young children","review":"I bought this for my son's 4th birthday. Thankfully I set it up to test it out before the big day. The track does not lock in tightly into the risers. The spiral is to tight. You have a very hard time pushing the trains around without knocking the whole thing over. I have already boxed this up for return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great set, just don't touch it.","review":"Great wood quality, but it's so flimsy it's hard to enjoy. One wrong touch to the track that's part of the spiral, and it creates a domino effect; all of the track comes apart. Hardly fun for my 5 and 2 year olds, they continually need me to come over and fix the track. In addition, the spaces they leave for your hand to actually push the train THROUGH the spiral is VERY small. Even the littlest of hands get stuck, and knock everything down.Save your money and buy one that only has short bridges, and where most of the track is flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who doesn't love pop-tarts?","review":"Can't go wrong with pop-tarts, especially with the discount that was being offered at the time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"high calorie treats","review":"These are pretty good junk food for those times you need a pastry, though I was surprised at the calorie count.

Once you actually get to the workout part (there is a lot of bonus material on the DVD, including battle footage)the lead guy says, \\"look, I'm not Richard Simmons, I'm not gonna take you through an 8-count routine.\\" Instead, they go through a variety of moves about twice or three times and then tell you to learn them all on your own and repeat each one twelve times or so. I thought this was disappointing because I don't have the patience or time to go through and figure all that out on my own.

Daredevil has always been a cool character that no one (besides Miller) ever really seemed to \\"get\\" (and the lackluster movie won't help). But Mr. Golden really gave it to him. This is book is constantly exciting and tense. I would have liked to have more with the Kingpin, but he isn't a main point of the book. The Gladiator sub-plot feels useless, as there is no real meaning to it and the reasoning behind it is weak. But, this book DOES have Bullseye (one of the coolest characters EVER), and that always means it'll be interesting. Here are my rankings:1) Daredevil: Predator's Smile2) Hulk: What Savage Beast3) Fantastic Four: To Free Atlantis4) Iron Man: Armor Trap (forgot about this one last time, sorry)5) Ultimate Spider-Man6) Spider-Man: Carnage in New York7) all the other ...ones"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bullseye is THE VILLIAN","review":"Bullseye just plain rocks.

The Prologue will have you hooked in mere minutes and you will remain hooked until you have finished it. A Daredevil classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daredevil shines in this new story.","review":"This saga of Daredevil is very gripping in the terms of its realsim and portrayal of the main characters.

It is objective and reasonable and quite possibly the best book on the subject I have read. Keep an open mind and understand the scientists who wrote this book just want a chance for a scientific study of the evidence, but the current climate at NASA is denying them the opportunity. How many other marvelous discoveries have been lost to us because of other people's closed minds? Why is it so impossible for people to believe there may have been an ancient civilization on Mars? We have them on Earth! They came from somewhere! Let them have their objective investigation, but don't close the door on the means to find out the truth, one way or the other.

The plot seemed appealing when I read the synopsis on the back cover, but my goodness!Ms. Butler's style of writing is better suited for a high school creative writing class, not adult fiction.She does not have the narrative skill to keep her in the running as a promising writer.

The story then whirlwinds into Nina's vow to herself to never allow a man to control her......and then she falls in love with Maurice, who's handsome and on his way to becoming a professional athelete. Maurice is everything a woman would want......or is he?While Nina struggles to keep up with the pace of Maurices' new found stardom, she slowly but surely falls victim to that old phrase \\"hopelessly in love\\" and finds herself caught in the middle of true love versus that of reality.Guaranteed to keep you going, Hand Me Down Heartache is a sure winner and a must read for all who thought that love is all one needs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"I loved this book. After so many drama, sex filled books which seem to be written for a younger audience, this was so refreshing. I'm a little late with reading this author but the two books I have read by Ms. Butler were both great. She writes and incrediable story the leaves the reader wanting more. I can't believe I slept on this one. I'm searching for all of her other books, that I've let slip by. This story touched so many things in me.

I had hoped to see how these issues were being handled by others.Forget it. This is an unmanaged MFC book with 3 paragraphs about managed extensions for C++ tossed in. Seriously. 3 paragraphs.

The editor of this book must have found it as hard to read as I did for they did a very poor job. That can not be blamed on Taylor but I am afraid that the rest of this mess is his fault.Taylor makes an attempt to write about both history and ghosts and in that attempt he falls short on both counts. His history is poorly researched and in some cases has no basis in fact. He spends so much time on the history of the haunted location that the ghosts themsleves get very little attention. To finish off any hope this work might have had Taylor writes in the same dry style of the people who brought us the high school history books that have led so many people to hate history.Anyone who buys this book to read about history will be so thrown off by the historical errors that they will be able to give the ghost stories little credit.

His style is dry and pedantic, and insists on making Holmes and Watson do things completely out of character. In fact, Mr Millett commits the most unpardonable of all mystery writer sins. He introduces a character in the last part of the book & \\"pins the rap\\" on him.

Few have come close to the originals, but that's okay. Those men and women were not Doyle, so one must take what they get. But this novel was so very tedious. I think it should be noted that in the four Holmes novels by Doyle, Holmes himself was only in about half the story. Now we know why. Too much of even Sherlock Holmes can be a trial.

As noted by earlier reviewer, there were far fewer pages than any in the original series and the storyboard frames were far larger and fewer in each page. In all, the number of illustrations might have made up but a third of any other Tintin's adventures. The artist used a watercolour wash for much of the many frame's background instead of the very detailed pen and ink method of the original, thus giving the whole book a less-than-ideal muddy and dull quality. Since much of the enjoyment from the Tintin series were of taking in many of the details of the illustrations, I find myself not being able to be drawn into this poor knock-off as I have been with all the other Herge's creations!

For starters, the art is not his creator, Herge's but a poor copy.

The boy, girl and dog featured don't contribute anything to the story that couldn't have been done more effectively by Captain Haddock, Professor Calculus or the Thompsons.About that story: While Tintin and Company do find themselves with a mystery to solve it's all done too quickly and easily, reading more like competent fanfiction than a professional attempt. The boy reporter himself just isn't given the chance to display the resourcefulness and inventiveness that made him famous.

Granted the cinematography is good, and there's excitement, but if you film a pig flying and have good cinematography and story, you'd get the same 'excitement'. I also am in Army aviation, and it's disappointing to have such a deviation from the truth filmed. Many movies make some adjustments that border on reality and some go outside that boundary.

The caption reads, \\"Lovers. Shunga, shown here partially masked. About 1790. Ronin Gallery, New York.\\" I find it difficult to trust the judgement of someone who advocates studying an art form \\"partially masked\\".

Third, The GM mode is the worst \\"GM\\" type mode that I have ever seen. You try to control matches to get better ratings. Sounds fun, really it's not.This game is an embarrassment to the video game industry as well as to the WWE. My only question is Why can't we go back to making them games exactly like World Tour, Wrestlemania 2000, and No Mercy?

Sadly, while I believe the author had good intentions, it reads like he sent some preliminary research notes to the publisher as a rough idea for a book and, lo and behold, the publisher went ahead and printed it as received. Clearly, little if any editing was done, and the book is a rather disorganized mess, containing far more questions than answers.

I've put this book that hell in the past year so I found it surprising that the book's cover is still in tact and the pages are holding. The book has rounded corners, a stictched binding, and an extra thick cover for a reason!I continue to be surprised at how much useful information Mr. Stanek pours into every page. I read something somewhere, might have been a review, that said its like Mr. Stanek starts with one of those heavy duty doorstop books, you know a 1200 page monster, then takes out all the useless filler, fluff, etc to get the book down to a healthy 500 pages.

The book could have benefited from a good editor that would hopefully cut out the all too frequent Christian rhetoric and caught problems such as the duplicate lenghty C.S. Lewis quote that appeared in two sections of the book.The book was at it's best when the authors were quoting secular authors from throughout history, which thankfully was a large part of the book, but not enough large enough to salvage it.The book was at it's worst when original writing and dogma by the authors appeared."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully entertaining!","review":"Ms. Bieber's talent shines through in her latest book, IN NAME ONLY.

This is only his debut and it is a masterpiece so don't even know what to expect from Ashton Allen in the future. Enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comparing to Smith","review":"The first time I heard this album, I was struck by how much Ashton Allen reminds me of a lighter version of Elliot Smith. Of course, maybe that is not a good thing for Ashton Allen since Elliot Smith fans crave the melodic heaviness that Smith could bring to a song. Ashton Allen's songs may seem immature, not fully developed, or at least lacking something because of that comparison, which is very hard to avoid making. However, without that comparison, Ashton Allen's music is quite enjoyable, and I would definately recommend buying this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten Stars!!!!","review":"This is a great album!

It has great leverage and can handle snow that is not too heavy (the aluminum construction is light and cannot handle heavy snow). The problem is that the handle is attached to the shovel with a cheap sheet metal screw - which lasts about 15 minutes. I have since bought a larger screw and it lasted another 3 minutes. So, if you buy this shovel, be prepared to drill a proper hole through the other end of the handle and attach the shovel to the handle with a bolt, lock nut and washer. Then you're all set. But Ames could have spent another 35 cents on the shovel and saved you the hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ames True Temper Arctic Blast Shovel","review":"Buyers should be aware that this shovel is a very soft aluminum, and consequently, if you have any ice or hard packed snow to shovel, this shovel will bend quite easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blade held on by one sheet metal screw! Wobbly!","review":"Although the shovel looks ruggedly made, it is only as strong as it's weakest link: one sheet metal screw. The actual blade of the shovel is riveted to the bracket using 6 rivets but the bracket on the backside of the blade is held to the handle with only ONE sheet metal screw. This screw always loosens up making the shovel wobbly. Why didn't the manufacturer use several screws rather than just one? Is this shovel manufactured in Florida where they have no experience with snow? Nothing is more frustrating than shoveling and having the snow slide sideways off the end of the shovel because the blade has loosened one again. I now carry a screwdriver with me when I use this shovel. Eventually I'll drill some holes and install a few more screws. But why wasen't this done in the first place?"},{"rating":"1","title":"PURE JUNK!!!","review":"I purchased this shovel at a local hardware store for $32. I \\"THOUGHT\\" I had made a very good purchase.That is,until I used it for the first time,last week.We got a decent sized storm here,well over ten inches of very wet/heavy snow.I wanted something sturdy and reliable.Something,that wouldn't be a total piece of garbage.Well,needless to say,this is NOT a reliable/sturdy shovel.This thing is a VERY VERY thin/flimsy piece of sheet metal,barely tacked onto the shaft.The blade is very flat,with a slight curve.It has NO side scoop whatsoever.So,when you attempt to lift the snow,it falls right off.Hence,creating that much more work and strain.I used this thing for all of two minutes,before I got so disgusted and gave up.I have NO CLUE what this \\"thing\\" is possibly good for.But,it certainly is NOT good for SNOW!!! Anyone in the market for a \\"very gently used\\" piece of junk?!?!?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I must be unlucky but this shovel is junk. The shank is mounted crooked into the blade and the plastic handle at the top is not screwed on so it comes off.Maybe it was a Monday after a holiday when this was assembled.Update: Amazon kindly replaced this shovel but the replacement was little better. It seems the problem is that the assemblers use small screws that are installed with a power drive causing them to strip the threads making them loose.Replacing them with heavier screws and drilling two additional holes to add two more screws makes the shovels serviceable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Purchase","review":"Great Shovel...high quality How ironic that during the biggest snowfall in Spokane History, the only place to find a snow shovel was Florida!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"A dead man's will directs that Mr. Hardy, Frank and Joe deliver a valuable Aztec warrior object to its rightful owner, a direct descendant of an Aztec warrior.

Do you like to be bored? Do you like to read books that make you wish that you had never started them? If so, then \\"The Mystery Of The Aztec Warrior\\" is just for you! It has NO ACTION!

This DVD is essentially what they broadcast with additional bonus features. Esther's method has worked wonderfully for me. Her explanations about the anatomical and cultural root causes of many of our pains (such as back, knee, etc.) are easy to understand and they makes a lot of sense. Her method for regaining proper posture and thereby stretching our spine, strengthening the muscles and distributing weight properly are presented very clearly and are easy to follow. They become a natural part of your daily life (how to sit, lie down, walk, etc.)Esther has a very friendly demeanor, explains things very well, and her demonstrations clarify things. The testimonials of people are also very helpful.I strongly recommend using this DVD, and also her book \\"8 Steps to a Pain-Free Back\\" (also on Amazon).

For this price, I would have hoped that it would have had the ability to focus which is in virtually all quality flashlights.UPDATED INFORMATION - My second light bulb failed (because I dropped the flashlight). I had no idea how difficult it was to find the bulbs and at what cost. The bulb is a 15.6 volt 0.7 amp xenon bulb. Panasonic parts sells the bulb for $7.31 plus shipping, which is ridiculous.

Because of the height, you may slide down the pillow thus disrupting the support of your lower back. The height made me feel like I was in an unnatural position and thus could not fall asleep.

It showcases the boys' raw energy and enthusiasm, highlighting the energy they generate.Along with their own unique take on what traditional Celtic music could be, this time Bun' Ber E have given back to the genre, with Hughie's very cheeky \\"Heart's With You\\". Plenty of energy, humor and reaking of good times, with Unplugged Bun' Ber E have done it again.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A tad disappointed","review":"The buyer had \\"Good\\" as the product description with no mention of stains, and it arrived with a coffee cup stain right smack dab in the middle of the cover.

Yeast, Soda, Dry Milk and Buttermilk powder, some dried fruits and nuts, cornmeal, rye and white and whole wheat flour , margarine, cinnamon, oil, eggs and others. Start with the smallest loaf. I had trouble getting several loaves out of the pan and I took the tops of several loaves when I raise the lid.Be sure everything is at room temperature and warmed water.

I no longer bake in my bread machine, but use the dough cycle and bake in the oven - you can do that with any of these recipes as well, of course.This book isn't one of those beautiful bread making volumes you see out there, but I highly recommend starting with this book if you are just beginning and want to use your bread machine. Once you feel more comfortable with the entire process, you may want to try some of the other, fancier books out there, but I use this little book more than any of the dozen or so other bread making books I own. I also have German's other books in this series, but use this one the most.

Recipes sound terrific, however, I have to say the two loaves I made in my new Oster machine did not come out very good at all. Up to this point I did have terrific success with all the recipes I tried from the cookbook that came with my Oster bread machine. That is why I wanted a bread machine cookbook to expand my choices of breads to make.I plan to try changing some of the ingredient proportions to get better results, but if you are looking for an easy bread machine cookbook, I personally don't think this is it.

It is an excellent peek into the daily workings of the Nixon White House. It's amazing to read this very large volume and realize how much time was wasted by Nixon trying to analyze and manage personalities on his staff, particularly the feud between Kissinger and Rogers. Perhaps every White House staff is like this. We won't know because no one since has put out this type of detailed record. In the Watergate era I considered Haldeman, along with Erlichman, to be some of the most repulsive characters in American politics. My opinion of Haldeman hasn't changed; he's still a man I'd rather not meet. His defense that he was Nixon's mouthpiece doesn't hold water any more than military men who insist they were \\"following orders\\". My impression upon finishing the book is relief that I've never had to work in such an awful atmosphere. Great historical record, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Haldeman Diaries: Only what I want you to know","review":"I bought this book looking for more insight into the Watergate affair from a man that was on the front lines.

He is nothing but a ghost of his former self. Direction stinks, production quality stinks, plot stinks. I'm sad he can't get a film done in the US anymore, with a major studio. Where have all our action actors gone? They are all retired or making third rate direct to DVD trash like this. I'm finished. I can't take it anymore.

But this film is one of the worst films I've seen in the last ten years. Excepting for a chance to look at Jacqueline Lord (a Catherine Zeta Jones look, act, and dress alike) for a little while, and her acting wasn't very good most of the time, there are no redeeming aspects to this film.For a film in the action genre, it consists of ALL bad elements. The plot actually had potential, except the dialog is on the level of a bad High School film. Segal is so over-weight that you can tell he's struggling to do even the most basic martial arts sequences. Unless he can lose weight and get into shape, this is the last film of his I'll spend any time watching.Unfortunately, the sets, the action, the dialog, the acting, the directing, and so forth, are all between the D+ to C levels of quality.I'd rather have seen a corny Kung Fu movie.

There are some really eerie scenes, including the ghostly Jefferson Institute where comatosed bodies dangle from wires.

If you don't know the truth about this wonderful man, this documentary can only cause you to come to the wrong conclusion about him. I found it disheartening to listen to the emotionally driven, untrue commentary about Reagan and his presidency, all set to dismal, depressing, and gloomy music seemingly chosen to convey the feeling of a funeral or a holocaust movie.Reagan was a good man. Reagan was a great American. Everyone who knew him liked him. He never talked down to anybody. He was an humble human being who acted in the best interest of this nation. He deserves better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Done Rememberance","review":"Instead of just presenting well-researched and balanced facts and allowing the viewer to form their own conclusions, the DVD producers spent a great deal of time giving their own opinions of what Reagan was thinking, why he was doing it and what his \\"conservative agenda\\" was for.

I found this program disturbingly slanted. It takes several cheapshots at Reagan's personal life. You never see PBS take on the Kennedys (to name an example) in the same way. I give it one star because it never captures the essence of Reagan as a great leader. You see brief snippets of him talking (finally, the Great Communicator in his glory!) only to be interrupted by the mindless patter of people with some sort of political agenda or ax to grind. If you're really curious, why not tape this instead (PBS is bound to re-broadcast it a couple of dozen times). If you have fond memories of Reagan skip this tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Star In Space Sucks!","review":"Jody Stephens thought Ken Stringfellow and Jon Aur would be good for a Big Star reunion. Bad idea! The two guys from The Posies make Big Star sound like fluff. Big Star In Space ruins the reputation and legend of Alex Chilton and Jody Stephens. There are better choices for musicians to become part of a Big Star reunion. Alex and Jody should give the two posies the boot and start from scratch. There is still a masterpiece Big Star album waiting to be written, recorded and released. In Space is an embarrassment compared to the songs and musicianship of # 1 Record and Radio City. Save your money and order vinyl copies of Big Stars early albums from Acoustic Sounds. I got Radio City and # 1 Record on vinyl and they sound incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than I expected","review":"Reunion albums are often so disappointing, I didn't expect it to sound anything like the Big Star I knew. But it's remarkable how they managed to keep the essence of the Big Star power-pop sound alive with just half the members. Is it another #1 Record/Radio City/Third? Of course not. But I still would have recognized this as a Big Star album just by listening to it. And what's the point in a group making another one of their old albums? Groups that put out the same thing over and over again get stale fast. Big Star's albums and Alex Chilton's albums are all considerably different from each other, and that's how they always managed to stay fresh. If you want to hear the same albums over and over again, that's what the old albums are there for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratutious and Graphic","review":"Eileen Goudge evidentally loves the fictional town and characters she has created and Carson Springs does sound like a heavenly place.

No leaks.The water valves are ball type and the large valve handles are very easy to control. The major considerations to make before buying this is to ask yourself if you are going to keep removing and reattaching hoses and also if there is any chance of rough handling (ie hard tugging at fully extended hoses, etc..). If the answer is yes to any of the above then I'd recommend a brass or aluminum set.

In that book things were written more clearly although in the present book several of his theories are largely ignored, as for example, the 37 year cycle he had discovered. (Why ?). The cycle, for example is nonsense.The book says years terminated in 5 are bull years and years in 0 are bear years.

While apparently comprehensive relative to the subject, the material is not well organized and, at times, has a stream of consciousness flavor to it. It drones on and on with qualitative comments intermingled with quantitative; the graphics are one-dimensional and exclusively black and white. The whole text has a very dated feel, which may be reflective of its 1995 copyright. In general, I found this text to be difficult to read for any length of time. Conversely, I have been exposed to other texts that engage the reader and pique your curiosity to go further. Reed doesn't do that, in fact, I found myself becoming less interested in ceramics than before I began the class!If you are using it for a class, there is not much you can do, but if you have a choice, this isn't the ceramics text to chose."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Tantra","review":"A pretty disgusting reading, unlike any other book on Tantra I've seen.

Yes it plays your ipod, but there are other radios in the market for a fraction of the cost that will play your ipod too and do a real good job at it! The sound is just ok, the control does not turn the device off or on and sometimes works stopping lowering and switching track on the ipod, put not always. The only advantage that I see to this radio its portability in an emergency maybe (that I have not tried, cause I haven't had an emergency yet); and even then there are smaller, cheaper radios you can use for that. So unless you just want a radio, an expensive one, you'd be very disappointed with this purchase. Maybe the YiYi is better integrated (reason why I bought this radio was to play it with my ipod, in my room)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The sound was incredibly thin for a $330 product, and worst of all, it's a poor excuse for a clock radio because the time is not visible during the middle of the night unless you press a button.

You knew the brother was going to be prey to bad influences in the sequel Return From Witch Mountain ($19.99 each; Disney) because he was wearing a horrible turtleneck and in general the very modest magic had gone. But you can never go wrong with a story where kids feel special and misunderstood.

Oh man, when Ben is telling Kevin's daughter that he's her real father....."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You \\"Get\\" Kevin Smith, Than Get the Book","review":"\\"Silent Bob Speaks\\" is a book that any Kevin Smith fan will appreciate. Like his movies, you have to \\"get\\" Keven Smith to appreciate \\"Silent Bob Speaks.\\" Smith is the first to know that Silent Bob's humor doesn't speak to everyone, so he doesn't try to change his ways to appease the masses. Smith is happy conveying his special brand of humor uncensored for those who like it the way it comes out. I highly recommend \\"Silent Bob Speaks\\" to fans of Smith's movies. I also recommend \\"A Long Way Down\\" and \\"My Fractured Life.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting But Mostly For Core Smith Fans","review":"Kevin Smith is a brillant and interesting writer. If you agree with that statement then you will likely enjoy this book. If not then it likely won't change your opinion. Thats not to say its bad, but the book, (which is composed of largely recycled Smith writings regarding the production of his films as well as some random musings that appeard in his magazine columns), is not likely to facinate those who are not already Smith fans.There are some gossipy bits featuring the likes of Ben Afleck, J-Lo, and Reese Witherspoon that may intrugue the lay-person, and as one might expect Smith's writing is full of his trademark humor. On the whole though it's all likely not enough to make this book worthwhile If you Don't love Kevin Smith. If (like myself) you are a fan of his work however then you should buy it read it and love it and then place it on the shelf with the askewniverse films, as we are clearly who this book was complied for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"I am a Kevin Smith fan. I love most of his work and by that I mean I wasn't big on the sequel to \\"An Evening With Kevin Smith\\" and I wasn't big on \\"Chasing Amy\\" or the animated series of Clerks. The rest of his movies I liked a lot or loved. Never read his comics though.I was expecting a lot from this book. And I didn't get it. This book takes place basically telling the story kind of like production journals of him working on \\"Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back\\". But while he is doing that he goes off on stories about other topics. Don't get me wrong, I typically enjoy that stuff from him a lot. But this book hasn't made me laugh once and I am a tad over 100 pages into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like his movies, mostly hits and few bad jokes...","review":"This not a serious book and Smith himself makes no bones about that. It is filled with the same kind lol jokes that his films are--some dumb--but mostly hilarious. The pieces cover much of his career the last 8 years or so. They are from various sources. With the except of his piece defending Star Wars and his final piece on ComicCon, the book is a great look at Smith. I happen to be big fan of all of his work (even liked Jersey Girl) and the man himself. He is humble, self-effacing, and just damned happy to be where he is. His take on Cruise and Affleck is rare in this media age--he loves these guys and tells us why. He is still a fan. He is also a husband and a father--some of the best stuff in here is about that. And, his essay on New Jersey and his friend Walt was just awesome. No need to nitpick over the few things don't work--the book is great for any big KS fan. Even one like me, who doesn't read comics."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD GOOD 4.5 READ!","review":"VICKIE STRINGER FINDS A WAY OF TAKING YOUR IMAGINATION AND PLACING YOU VIVIDLY IN HER SCENES.

Season 4 does NOT have this problem, and there are all 16 episodes in that package. However, I've played that season so many times I thought it was then time to watch a different season.

The illustrations are primarily screenshots of the software.Given the content on the book I think more attention could have been paid to organization. The embedding of hundreds of URLs makes the text hard to read.

This would be confusing, if you were not familiar with the area.Other than that...Fantastic product! Gets satellite acquisition quickly, so easy a technophobe (me) can use it.

I have noticed that it does have problems some times but I find it to be accurate over 95% of the time. I drive a lot through Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, D.C., & North Carolina just to name a few. I do print a paper map just incase I lose satellite reception (this has only happened once during a terrible hailstorm) & to check if I think there might be a better way. I find most people who have a problem find it quickly resolved once they set their preferences correctly... You can choose to avoid Toll Roads or Main Highways, You can opt for Construction Detours or set it for the Fastest or Quickest Route... These settings make a huge difference on the route the Garmin will take you.

The unit itself works fine and does a lot of good things but there is one thing it does not do well: plot routes. I don't know what it is about this unit but it seems to take the strangest routes. In the city it will take me through all kinds of small side streets when there is a major street right next to it that goes directly to my destination. And then to make it even more weird it does not always take the same route. I can start from the same location and going to the same destination and this unit will take me on two different routes.So maybe the newer Garmins are decent but I definitely cannot recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great GPS","review":"Garmin Streetpilot c550 3.5-Inch Portable GPS NavigatorScreen is readable in bright sunlight and all functions are easy to understand and use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this unit 99.9% of the time.

The maps are clear, the voice system announcing the upcoming roads are clear & precise, and it gets me to places quickly and accurately.I have two small issues with the device.1) It sometimes takes several minutes to find satellites. Seems like an eternity when you need directions quickly.2) It isn't always 100% accurate. The Garmin got confused in downtown Seattle and was giving me wrong street directions & information. It also got confused in North Carolina. I had to reboot the unit (turn off, then on) to allow it to find itself.I also love the feature which allow you to find local stores, places to eat, Starbucks, shops, etc... Very cool.This technology rocks and it will be a DRY day in Seattle before I'll give up my unit. Well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin c550 refurb","review":"This was a GREAT deal!

We have been using it for a few weeks now with very good results. It really is simple to setup and begin to use. The screen navigation is intuitive. The voice is relatively easy to understand. The screen size, which i was initially concerned with was plenty big enough. Some reviews had mentioned concerns with the windshield mount. We have found the mount to be excellent and sturdy. We have only had one issue with the GPS not giving corrent directions to a location. This location was not newly developed, which was surprising. While we do drive in some heavy traffic areas, we have not found the traffic feature all that useful. Overall, this is a great product and we would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect!","review":"The Garmin c550 is very easy to use right out of the box. Just turn it on and go. It quickly finds satellites and is extremely fast in calculations and accurate. The only complaint I have is with the age of the built in mapping. Several roads which have been around for over 7-8 years are still not in the database and restaurants which closed down over 5 years ago still are. The Bluetooth functionality works great although I would recommend buying the external microphone unless you're driving a car which is very quite inside. Overall I definitely recommend this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, when it doesn't die on you","review":"I've gone through two of these.

The first one died around when the temp was getting into the 100s, so I thought \\"Ok, maybe the heat did it\\". The second died overnight when the temp was around 60. Just won't turn on anymore.I've read other reviews indicating a similar problem. Hopefully Garmin can send me a non-defective unit.

Transfer of routes & trails to the GPS was the #1 reason I purchased this GPS and the Garmin Mapsource software.

To our disappointment, it only lasted three months before losing all sound.Second complaint, it sends us driving in circles at times because the satellite can't catch up to the direction of the car soon enough.There has got to be better out there.

However the power cable came with the garmin and I have this extra cable for what reason I do not know. Amazon told me I bought the cable from another company and should return it to them. This involved shipping charges plus a restocking fee. Hardly worth while. After three E Mails I never did get an explanation of why the purchase was better with the extra cable.

After this deplorable customer service, I would recommend that Amazon customers consider alternative GPS systems. TomTom or Magellan specifically.

I chose the English accent, but you can go with many different dialects and/or languages.- I was attracted to this unit because it also offers hands-free (bluetooth) phone calling. The microphone and speaker are crystal clear and the unit does not use any voice prompts while you are in a phone call.

It's not about a revelation of retailing - it's a story that tries to justify the Quixtar model of business. As such, its about 80% anecdotes and fluff, with very little meat or factual foundation.Of course, passions about MLM marketing, and Amway in particular, run high on both sides of the debate. I won't get into this debate here (although I notice a lot of the five star reviews for this book mimic the mindless \\"Ambot\\" mantras they use to prevent skeptical thinking towards Amway.)For anyone seriously considering the merits of this book, I'd just say do a google search on \\"Quixtar\\" and see what you come up with.

Like everything in it was very morbid. it just didnt seem right. it didnt do the books justice. Some of the things i loved most about the book were changed. I mean, Mandy did a great job, but the movie just wasnt good. Everything was really rushed, ans they only added the main parts, the sad ones, which made it a really bad movie.

The reason I find it offensive, it is aimed at teenage girls and really provides them with a distorted view of men. Each male character in this movie is presented as a jerk, a wimp, a loser, etc, etc. Don't believe it, there are decent guys in the world.On top of all that, the movie has no real narrative center. The main character (Mandy Moore) basically reacts to everyone else around her. We never get a feel for who she is, or why we should relate to her in any way. The side characters, while more interesting, are presented so haphazardly that they aren't well-developed either.I'd give it one star, but Mandy Moore is cute and fun to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"too bad there is no zero rating","review":"Mandy this was the worst script you could have ever picked.

It seemed like it was trying to be a good angsty teen film with morals. It ended up being a sappy, boring mess.The divorce and teen pregnancy were pretty good topics to cover, but it would have been better without the boyfriend dying...it was over the top. They did do a pretty good job with showing the pressures of sex though. But the whole love story thing was too syrupy!!! The \\"when you fall, I'll catch you\\" crap is too lovey and mushy and overly romantic. They're only in high school!!! I'm not even gonna mention the fact that Trent and Mandy had like no chemistry!!!In the end, Mandy and the girl who played her friend did a good job.

Between Halley and her sister, Halley and her mother and Halley and her father this totally comes to life. Anyhow, I'm a big fan of her voice as a singer but she makes for a decent actress too. She makes her character come to life. From smiling while in the bed at night, alone thinking about her crush unexpectedly to going the extra mile to bring doubt to situations at hand. I think many people can watch this movie and it's definitely recommended to any teenagers that like lovey dovey movies. Okay, so it's not *that* bad but it is based on love.

The so-called romance between Halle (Moore) and Macon leaves little to the imagination. I actually didn't even want these two to even hook up!

The reason is simple. Everytime you think it's going to rise above melodrama, it just proves that it is in fact just that. On a good note Mandy performs well and there are some nice supporting characters like Halley's mother and pot smoking grandmother. To bad the script is mediocre.

I think it was wonderfully directed, and magnificently cast. =)It's based on the books \\"One Summer\\", and \\"Keeping the Moon\\" by an amazing young author named Sarah Dessen... If you have not read the books-- they're highly recommended.Mandy Moore plays Halley Martin, who is a typical high school girl... Scorned by the painful divorce her parents went through, annoyed by an overly perfect sister who is entirely too caught up in planning her wedding, and a best friend who is \\"in love\\" and just lost her virginity.Halley seems lost in all this mess until a tragedy brings her Macon (Trent Ford). Macon changes how Halley feels about love, and shows her that there is something amazing to it.Halley experiences so much in this movie.

The transitions of the story as well as the emotions of the characters flip-flop at the drop of the hat. The worst of it is the fact that many of the performances were really strong and the story had great potential. In the end, the editing and dialogue destroyed anything valuable in this film. Mandy Moore put in a surprisingly strong performance, but it really was the best friend Scarlet who stole the show with a luminous presence.

I didn't like this movie. I couldn't empathize with any of the characters, and thought Halley's parents needed to be less selfish and spend time actually PARENTING and less time pursuing ther own selfish interests. Both Halley and her sister were shockingly immature, and her sister was far too young to get married and act responsibly. Their relationships seemed doomed for failure.Instead of feeling 'inspired' and impressed with the 'plucky' female characters in this movie, I ended up feeling depressed at the decline of the American family.Two stars for a boring, and banal teen-flick"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with one book next time","review":"I read Some Like You and totally loved it.

Within the first few minutes I realized it was directly quoting my fave book and got my book to make sure iwasnt crazy. I was so excited! Then it turned for the worse. Both books were great but trying to squeeze all the stuff in one movie was horrible. One thing i loved about someone like you was the close relationship that the two friends had and in the movie i think they showed her friend like 3 times.

Parents get a divorce, a friend passes away unexpectedly, another friend becomes pregnant, her sister's about to get married and her father gets remarried. I'm forgetting something... oh yeah, there's a guy named Macon (Trent Ford), rhymes with bacon trying to get with Halley. There's not too much chemistry and \\"A Walk to Remember\\" fans will be disappointed. If anything, this movie has extremely funny moments. Like when, Macon tried to throw leaves at Halley, but she blew it back in his face with a leaf blower. What a genius. Then the grandma who liked the other kind of leaves...

It's an inexpensive little book, a quick read, and was probably useful 10 or 15 years ago. We found the advice outdated - the business people we dealt with were much more casual in dress and manner than the book described. The advice not to wear red, white, or black clothing was ludicrous -- I saw 100's of Taiwanese wearing these colors, alone, or in combination. I don't know if there is a better book out there, but take any advice in this book with a very large grain of salt. We were very over dressed. The young people dress in same variety as Americans -- shorts on older people (like me - 40 something) are common - just not super short.

Once this edge starts to fray there is going to be nothing to stop it from running down the whole blanket. The colors are nice, the size is perfect and it washes up nicely.

He uses sarcasam to tell you what went on after he left, everything about how each camper (in his tent) got there, how to avoid the wildlife, and what not to say to the campers. There are also quizzes, which are hilarious, but the highlight of the book is definately the appendix-type thing in the back, which explains why each camper was there, and they're laugh-out loud funny.I recommend this book if you liked the book or movie Holes, you won't be disappointed, the only thing is, dont read it in public, because you will laugh out loud!Overall grade: A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"review for mrs.johnsons class","review":"The book that i read was called stanley yelnats survival guide to camp green lake.In the beginning of the book stanley talks about how you shouldn't complain at camp green lake.

It even has a chapter on how to win friends and influence people.This book is hilarious, and a must-have for anyone who has ever read HOLES. Sachar has created an exciting world for readers to delve into.

While I was glad that there wasn't excessive recappage, mostly everything found in this book could have either been inferred from Holes, or was directly out of the book. There are some really neat extra tidbits that are worth reading, but it's not worth paying the $4.99 just for those, when I'm sure they could be found online. I just feel like this was written to ride the wave of Holes hysteria after the movie came out. No surprise, they were released the same year. It's like someone's saying, \\"hey, don't wanna read through the big thick book? Read this condensed version instead!\\", which is, quite frankly, frustrating. On the other hand, I would have loved to read Pendanski's book, much more so than Small Steps, which was what came after.Rating: 1.5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Piece of Art","review":"All I can say is wonderful,wonderful, & wonderful!

He not only looks the part, he acted the part of Lloyd to perfection. Derek Richardson as Harry wasn't as convincing, but Olson picked up the slack nicely.The problem could be traced to the plot, there wasn't one.

I found myself looking around in the theater at others who seemed relieved that the lights were so low their identities were hidden.I mean, the forced laughter at the skits, the same old jokes, the same dumb tricks - it reminds me of my boys only when they were in sixth grade. I am not sure which actor did worst (or best, depending on your point of view). They were annoying in the extreme - even in the \\"funny\\" parts.

Not even the presence of Eugene Levy, Cheri O'Teri, Bob Saget (who's character gives us the ONLY funny 45 seconds of the movie) or Mimi Rogers can elevate this out of the dank depths of movie mire.In short, spare yourself the waste of $... and, more importantly, the waste of 90 minutes of your life.

Got sidetracked and decided to read some of the reviews of Dumb and Dumberer first...and it wasn't until I started reading the 4 and 5 star reviews of this film that I got my first good laugh. Those who think this movie is funny must have been on something when they watched it. There is absolutely nothing funny about this film. Nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE MOVIE SUCKS!","review":"I was looking forward to seein this movie,the movie was stupid and NOT funny at all.Infact it was very boring.

The plot isnt the greatest, but there are many funny moments. The first time you see this movie is the best, and it probably gets old after awhile, so those are the only reasons I wouldent reccomend buying this. But remember, its funny and great for anyone with a sense of humor. At least rent it. Now I will probably go off and see the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The biggest dissapointment in Movie History","review":"It has been 9 years since the first 'Dumb and Dumber, which will forever remain a classic.

I hope so, because that will be the only time that you laugh during this exercise in cinematic torture. The characters are unfunny, the plot sucks, Eugene Levy and Cheri Oteri's talents are wasted, and the film seems like the longest 90 minutes of your life (if it was even that long). I cannot stress how terrible this movie is, and that fact that is carries the \\"Dumb and Dumber\\" name makes me sick. It's not like anyone expected it to be as good as the original, but this is pathetic.

It's not funny, it's not interesting, and especially, it's not worth 6 bucks and 1 1/2 hours of anybodies time. Fans of the first movie will be deeply disapointed, it dosn't come close. The movie tries to be so stupid it really hurts. The jokes are poorly written and the the frequent attempts at comedy get old really fast. Save yourself.The absense of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels made the only similarity between the two films the names of the characters. The new actors try as they can, but no one can fill the shoes of Carrey and Daniels.I'll admit, I laughed once (an scene with chocolate in the bathroom), but the rest of the movie insulted my intelligence, and pushed the limits on what you can call comedy. Please, stop the franchise or get Jim and Jeff back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dumb for an 8 year old!","review":"My son rented this movie. He is 8 years old and he did not like it.

They tried making a movie based on one of the funniest movies and it was a total flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer and Bummerer","review":"This high-caliber stinker is bound to go down in the history of movie-making as one of the worst movies of the century. The storyline is random, the laughs are tired, and the ending is utterly predictable. The cast really tried to squeeze something funny or even watchable out of the paper-thin script but to no avail. It had \\"turkey\\" written all over it from the first few scenes but I unfortunately persevered to the end. This movie stinks so much that it leaves you with a bad aftertaste. You almost feel angry you've spent time and money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total letdown","review":"This sorry movie is an insult to the original Dumb and Dumber. The gags are weak, the plot is too simplistic and the characters are not believable. This show is reminiscent of the Ernest films and probably could have been called 'Ernest and Vern Go to School', but since the quality of this movie is even lower than an Ernest film, that really wouldn't have worked either.If you want a good laugh, watch the original -- If you want to cry, watch this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Crappy Met Film...","review":"My God... I have seen some terrible movies in my day but this one could very well be the worst of all. Poor Jim Carrey must have torn every hair follicle from his scalp one by one when he saw this disgraceful prequel to the classic \\"Dumb and Dumber.\\" It truly is a shame when it seems that people make movies simply based on the success of the first one but don't put in the same effort. I didn't laugh once... in fact there wasn't so much as a grin from my mouth. I tried and tried to look for some half decent humor but alas... my search was in vain. Do yourself a favor, if your going to buy this movie regardless of what my review may say... be prepared to throw away $30 on something you'd be better off flushing down the toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bob Saget saves it","review":"Yes it's stupid and terrible but Come on when Saget opens his bathroom and finds choclate stains everwhere that's funny. I'm sorry but the slurpee scene was pointless but the lesbian kiss make up for it. Now the slurpee worker was funny especially the revenge he gets on Harry and lloyd. This was a unneccassary sequel that has a terrible script but has 4 good laughs and lesbians. Will be remebered with the great sequels like high noon 2 and critters 4. By the way the opening scene with his jaintor father is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"What can I say ... ?","review":"Sequels have to be well thought out before they are made (or so you would think), this one wasn't. It was crappy and there was no comparison to the original. Don't waste your time with it.

STAY AWAY!! STAY VERY FAR AWAY FROM THIS(and I use the term loosely)MOVIE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ain't no joke","review":"This for me was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long long time. Where do I start, the jokes were not funny, the acting was bad, the plot was rubbish. They tried to rehash pieces from the first movie which just looked embarrassing for everyone. I pity anyone associated with this movie. It is not my job to look for redeeming qualities in these movies. I paid my money under the pretext I was going to get a few laughs and what I got was something like a police academy movie/sequel, that's fine if police academy is your thing but Dumb and Dumber is nothing like that.This is a disaster movie for everyone; the only thing it succeeded in doing was reaffirming the Farrelly brother's status as one of the great comedy teams operating today"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a patch on the original","review":"This movie was a real let down. The original in my opinion is the best movie ever made (you might not agree) and this film should not have been made. As all sequels do apart from Terminator 2 it fell way short of being as good as the original. And will all the people who say the original is just stupid please open their eyes -- DUMB AND DUMBER -- kinda gives you a clue that the film is'nt going to be about rocket science. This film is nothing on the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please NO","review":"Sweet mother of God!

The casting it very good. The actors really seem like the original films' younger. Although somet things are a bit cliche and expected, it is still enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"True To Its Name - The Dumbest Movie I've Seen","review":"I cannot believe I even watched \\"Dumb and Dumberer.\\" This ranks as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The only redeeming moment in the entire film is seeing Bob Saget flip out-always good for a laugh. This is not a movie for those who loved the original film. It does not help one understand the original (as one reviewer commented). It is a waste of time.Olsen and Richardson do a fair job at imitating Carrey and Stern, but they are more annoying, far too dumb, and have no motivation for most of their actions. I agree with the reviewer who comments that they simply play kids who are mentally retarded and cash in at the expense of those who actually are challenged.I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumberer Than Dumb","review":"My friend and I have 2 hours to kill, so we decide to watch this movie, in hopes of some cheap entertainment. After all, the original was really good. As it turns out, I would have better spent my time staring at my own shoe tops. At least I would have saved my $10. Dumb and Dumber was funny in a stupid and charming kind of way. This movie was stupid in an unfunny and stupid kind of way. The movie has no real plot, it just follows the 2 pimple-faced numb-skulls around high school. The 2 actor playing our beloved Harry and Lloyd (whose names I can't even remember) are light-years away from even being comparable to Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. The emphasis on gross-out and dumb humor become repetitive and, quite frankly, not humorous. Such a shame, considering the marketing and advertisments were perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Dumb!","review":"This was by far the dumbest movie I have ever seen. I have to agree with one reviewer that you have to be on some serious drugs to actually enjoy sitting through this movie for even the first 30 minutes. I was willing to give this movie a chance since it was not well recieved in the theaters. This is one of those rare occasions in which the majority was right. I don't blame Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels for not signing onto to this movie. They must've read the script and said forget it. The script was simply horrible the characters too stupid and incompotent to be believed. It got to a point where it just became annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"If you liked Dumb and Dumber like I did, then you may be thinking you should give this a shot. Don't. I'm just glad that I saw this for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"A HILARIOUS PREQUEL!!!","review":"To me, this is a very funny prequel to 'Dumb and Dumber' It shows how they meet. It actually shows that they were dumber in high school than they were in the original. Their dialogue and shenanigans are hilarious! I remember getting this movie for Christmas back in 2003. There was one part me and my friend talk about is when they see the \\"short bus\\" and they think it's for them because they are cool and the cool kids sit in the back of the bus, and every seat was in the back. Another part I love is when Harry goes to Jessica's house and everything he does is very funny! If you love comedy or Harry and Lloyd, then you'll love DUMB AND DUMBERER: WHEN HARRY MET LLOYD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen...Litteraly","review":"Were do I start. This movie is nothing like Dumb & Dumber. It is so immature and stupid that I couldn't even finish it. Everything related to the first one, just in a more bizzare and odd way. For instance, the things that they say aren't even funny! If you like good comedy movies then I would recommend Dodgeball, Ruthless People, All National lampoons, Throw Momma from the Train, Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo, and Starsky and Hutch"},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking???","review":"Man, this movie ruined itself from the start. The humor is trying way too hard and it fails ever so miserably. You cannot make a prequel to a comedy classic, you just can't, there is no way to meet the standards already set. This is a disgrace to the original, and should never have been made!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie stinks!!","review":"This movie is just utterly boring and unfunny. Don't fall for this even if you're a die hard fan of the 1994 original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not even worth renting...","review":"This was a pitiful attempt to capitalize on a good property without putting much money into it except in procuring the name.The Story of \\"how Harry met Lloyd\\" is only funny in very few spots, most notably the \\"Icee/slurpee scene.\\" Actually, that's the ONLY part of the entire movie that I laughed at, while Dumb and Dumber is a work of grotesque comedy genuis on par with \\"The Jerk,\\" or even something like \\"Caddyshack\\" or even \\"Animal House\\" (though it would be all of those movies, meeting the Farrelly Brothers, who brought such \\"tasteful\\" flicks as \\"Kingpen,\\" \\"There's Something About Mary,\\" and \\"Me, Myself and Irene\\").This movie lacks the comedic genius of the the Farrelly brothers AND the comedy duo of Jim Carrey and Jeff Bridges, and it shows. The movie is slow and generally just not funny. Try watching just about anything else instead, and if you're looking for a great comedy, check out any of the above-mentioned movies, as they're ALL MUCH better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumberer than Dumb","review":"This is, by far, the worst movie I have seen in the past year. If you HAVE to see it, rent it. This DVD is better marketed as a $20 beer coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST PLAIN DUMB.","review":"Making a sequel to one of the funniest movies ever without the 2 guys that made it funny? Whoever thought this up should be fired immediately, it was that stupid an idea. I was excited when I first heard of this movie because I loved the original movie so much and I thought nobody would be stupid enough to make a sequel to the original without Carrey and Daniels, look how wrong you can be. I had the flu when I first watched Dumb and Dumber and still laughed hysterically at it, it was that funny. This movie only made me feel like I was sick. No Carrey and no Daniels=no laughs. Fans of the laugh filled original should avoid this at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS THE 1ST!!","review":"I went to see dumb and dumberer when it was released on the 13th and sure it had its funny parts but it does not compare to the 1st one that jim carrey and jeff daniels made. i just wanna know where...did they get those...p actors for the second one. i just wish the farrelly brothers would have made the sequal themselves with jim and jeff in it and not when they were in highschool. this 2nd movie ruined the 1st one. maybe jim and jeff will see that and hopefully make another themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"It doesn't even compare with dumb and dumber.

There were only 3 funny parts, but the rest played out like american pie or a bad national lampoon movie. skip this, it's a disgrace to the original, and I just pretend this doesn't qualify as a sequel or a prequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Words cannot describe how bad this movie is","review":"Derek Richardson and Eric Christian Olsen are the replacement morons for Harry and Lloyd in this awful attempt to cash in on the popularity of the original. Neither actor is funny and the entire script could have been written in an hour. Basically, it involves Harry and Lloyd bumbling their way into solving a scam where the school principal rips off the public for one hundred thousand dollars. Sounds like what the movie creators are trying to do to us.This is not a review as much as it is a warning to anyone considering seeing this movie. I wasn't expecting much to begin with, but this movie is not funny on any level. I enjoyed the stupid humor of the original, but this movie is just stupid, period. Considering it was made on a shoestring budget, they might even make money if they get a few customers. Don't be one of them. You'll thank me later.One of the worst movies I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs!","review":"I'm going to get right to the point -- this movie is terrible. As a big fan of Dumb and Dumber, I decided to rent this prequel. I didn't expect it to be that great, but I didn't think it would be this bad. The whole thing is like an immature, stupid gag that's supposed to be funny. After watching it, you think, \\"I can't believe I spent an hour and a half watching that nonsense.\\" I saw this movie with two other people and they felt the same way.The only redeeming quality about Dumb and Dumberer is Eric Christian Olsen's dead-on impersonation of Jim Carrey. Everything he did in Dumb and Dumber, Eric perfected in the prequel. He did a great job of playing a young Lloyd Christmas, but even that does not make this movie worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"APTLY NAMED, GIVEN ITS CRAPSHOOT SCHTICK","review":"Kudos to the lanky Olsen for rising to the daunting task of mirroring Jim Carrey - he does it with such conviction that I almost overlooked the tragic lack of logic in the film's schemes or the frequent dry spells in humor. It's the best Jim Carrey impersonation I have ever seen! But it's the script around him, the premise, and the film (in every way, down to the costuming) that makes a mess of his Jim Clone 101 act. While there may be a handful of minute comical moments that salvage D&D-er from the scrap heap, it is ultimately nothing more than a scorching bore. Perhaps folks between the ages of 10 to 15 may find this a tolerable rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nevermind how stupid the jokes were....","review":"this movie was racist! Ching Chong??? WTF???

I urge you to please save your money and buy the first one. This movie should be erased from cinema and the director and producers should be fired. The laughs were funny if you are 4. In part one it was smart comedy. I bet the Farrely brothers are embarresed. 110% horrible"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible , horrible and again horrible","review":"This movie is incomparable with the first dumb and dumber. I guess Jim carry is very disappointed with this movie too because everything about this movie sucks!!!The acting, the jokes, even the scenario sucks. As a result my suggestion to you; if you want to spend some money for a DVD and if you want it to be funny then go and spend it for the dumb and dumber 1 with the Jim carry on (of course if you don't already have it).Don't buy this movie, even don't rent it because it won't be just waste of money, it will also be a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"You cant get into it.","review":"This is a poor atempt at plageurism really everybody knows that dumb and dumber is a classic in the ways of slapstick comedy which is near impossible to imitate, i have to admit i maybe only laughed once in the whole film it's not that i have a dry sense of humour it's the fact that you cant get into this film if you've seen the original it's not right with the absence of Jim Carrey. I would advise you go see Carreys new film, released at the same time as this instead as it is one of the best comedys to come out in a while, good effort from them and they might have promising futures you just dont make mistakes like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sleeper hit!...","review":"I think this prequel was well-done... considering what footsteps it had to follow in (Dumb and Dumber). The original was a pure comedy that still is hilarious after the 6th time watching it- i think the more you watch this prequal, the funnier it'll seem. Going into this prequal, your mind will probably be disapointed knowing jim carey and jeff daniels isnt in it, but after watching it for 10 mins...you adjust and dont even notice the difference. This movie was funny and dumb, and if you enjoyed the first...you'll like the second."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 and a half stars","review":"ok, I am a HUGE fan of the original, but this prequel was lacking. It had a few semi-humorous moments, but other parts as well where it really dragged on and I was asking myself \\"what is this leading to?\\" or \\"when are they going to go to the next scene?\\", particuarly when they're drinking the slurpees. The story line was a bit stupid. I did, however, enjoy Cheri Oteri in this movie. The funniest scene was probably Bob Saget reacting to the chocolate in the bathroom.Anyway, wait for it to be shown on tv. I don't think it's worht paying 8 bucks for."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dumb Idea","review":"Only Jeff Daniels is Harry.Only Jim Carrey is Lloyd.This sequel is a terrible move, especially when it succeeds a memorable 90's comedy. The actors that take over the roles for Harry and Lloyd are just plain bad at acting, and they are more annoying than funny. The story line makes no sense at all. It's just a copy-paste hack job passed off as a script, and it severely lacks focus, something you can truly remember, and passion.The only redeeming character in this movie is Bob Saget, in which he plays a borderline-coprophobic father, and he has done much better in the past (i.e. his cameo appearance in \\"Half-Baked\\"). The scenes involving Bob Saget were the only parts I could remember, and when a cameo actor makes a more memorable and interesting role than the lead characters, it's going to flop. That's just what this movie did.Forget this movie existed. Don't buy it used, and don't even download it illegally.

The novel churns with the inevitability of his (more famous) Eighth Day Of the Week and the pessimism of Killing The Second Dog (also set in Israel), but unfortunately in many places the dialogue seems to have eaten this novel. Consequently, it reads like a screenplay.But some people like reading screenplays, just as some people don't mind a pinch of pretension mixed in with their authentic, hard-won wisdom. Hlasko clearly had the latter in abundance: working as a pimp, being an exile, etc. This novel-- and Hlasko's work in general-- is important because it represents a unique crossroads of many disparate currents of 20th century literature. Only Hlasko examines the soul-killing effects of life under Communism, while capturing the nihilistic swoon of the Beats, the grit of hard-boiled crime fiction, and the openess and sense of urgency of existentialism.

Verlaine and Lloyd, despite their differences (or maybe because of), are great foils for each other and each are magnificent guitar players, and backed by the rhythm section of Ficca (drums) and Smith (bass) have the ability to let loose their creativity.

It contains walking, side steps, knee lifts, and kicks. I did like that Leslie seemed extra focused in this video; sometimes, I have a hard time figuring out what she is laughing at in her other videos. She seems to get off track when she is being silly. She talks about the benefits of exercise while timing the workout to the countdown clock. Her exercise clocks seem to make the workouts go faster. This is an intermediate workout, good for days when you don't want a super strenuous workout. It is a good low impact workout and doesn't jar the bones, great for people with arthritis.Start!

The only problem I had was the CD stops and takes about 4 seconds to continue. This happen when I received the CD brand new I have purchased several walking CD's and they all seem to have this problem. Leslie needs to get some new music. I do not like her choice of music and all her tapes have the same songs. Leslie is a little annoying she forgets she is exercising and her mouth will continue.

Now with this DVD, after two weeks I've lost 4% body fat - from 26%-22%. It's a big step up (energy wise) from the two-mile workout. It's also 45 minutes of your time. My wife and I have been doing it five times a week - and it's giving me a lot of energy and I think I've even lost an inch on my waistline too! Leslie makes it fun, and the first and third miles go pretty fast - the second mile (for some reason) is the tough one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best one","review":"I enjoyed Leslie and the walk was much the same as her others in terms of moves. However, the music is awful. Several of the exercisers are doing so much posturing and performing for the camera that they become an irritation.

It is simple, but is a great workout. She is encouraging without being annoying.

When I go into exercise mode and am told to do twelve or sixteen reps, I usually stop looking at the video, close my eyes and focus on how my muscles are working in tempo to the music. Here, the people doing the workout were always a bit ahead of the slow droning tempo of the boring music.I am used to working my upper body already, and my abs, but even upping the advised poundage on my dumbbells and using nice slow reps, or adding ankle weights for the lower abs reps, I did not find this challenging enough to make me want to ever exercise to this tape again, unless I am under the weather and need a lower intensity workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to follow upper body workout","review":"Kathy Smith does a nice job of explaining each exercise and it's very easy to follow.

I prefer the tap dancing to ballroom, but that's just my personal tastes. The famous dancing duo are great with any style. I like Walter Brennan, so it's nice to see him in this film and it also was nice to see Edna May Oliver play a nice character, for a change.The only complaint was the ending was so predictable.

Xenophon never intended to write a biography of Cyrus. He was writing an idealized portrait of a long dead Persian ruler. He combined what he knew about Persia, a few facts about the historical Cyrus and a fictional vision of a what he thought was the ideal ruler. The original is much closer to Maciavelli's the Prince in purpose than it is to Plutarch's \\"Lives\\". So when credit is being given for the wisdom in the book, it must be given directly to Xenophon, not Cyrus. You learn very little about Cyrus and Persians in the original and a lot about Xenophon and Greeks (particularly Sparta, Xenophon's real life ideal.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what you may think...","review":"My apologies to Xenophon, those who liked this book, and those who were intrigued by a book written about Cyrus the Great just 150 years after his reign, but I considered the book a waste and difficult to read as well. Beware, the book is more of a historical fiction than a historical document, like Herodotus or Thucydides. I distinctly felt as if Xenophon was distorting reality and trying to portray Cyrus in idealistic Greek terms, educated, compassionate, balanced, egalitarian, etc, almost as if Xenophon was trying to rehabilitate the Persian Empire's reputation following its defeat at the hands of the Greeks one hundred years earlier. If you like homilies this is the book for you, but if you want to learn more about a great ruler who rapidly and with great skill and talent created a vast empire, there are probably better books to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential, derailed","review":"From Dennis Cooper's \\"Little House on the Bowery\\" series comes this first novel from Travis Jeppesen. Loosely chronicling the last days of a religious cult called the Overcomers, the novel is composed of fragments of the stories of Tanya, who joins the cult as a pregnant teenager, and of Herbert, her son who leaves the cult before its end. Various other characters appear, including two of Herbert's friends and the man who fathered Herbert, as well as the cult leader Martin Jones. Jeppesen's stark style is quirky and noteworthy, but the story threads unravel as the novel progresses, and by the end, the surreal quality of the fragmentary episodes overtakes the book and dilutes whatever meaning readers are supposed to take from it. Despite my problems with this book, Travis Jeppesen is definitely an author with a future."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sum of Its Parts","review":"So what do you get when you buy a book published by a has-been rock performer, edited by an absurdly overrated cult novelist, and written by a young American trendoid with more pretensions than talent who lives in what is ponderously described as an \\"undisclosed Eastern European country\\"?

Nothing really stood out and struck me aside the head and made me take attention. It's good straight ahead rock, but it left me wanting something more.Also, Tom Morello sounds horribly out of place solo'ing on a lot of the songs. This album now sounds like it is truly Chris Cornell's band, not really Rage meets Chris Cornell.Many people may like Audioslave and I can understand why, but for me, this was just alright. 2.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster Performance","review":"Im all for bands changing their style but honestly this kinda detracts from the audioslave people came to know.at least for me this album puts me to sleep with those slow soul or bluesy songs. But then it kicks back with some awesome guitars and vocals on songs like Number One Zero....even the lead single is another take on Like A Stone.sometims they sound like Guns n Roses pulling the blues thing (The Curse) and other times they sound like STP (The Worm). The only song that stood out for me is YESTERDAY TO TOMORROW. Simply because of the emotion and guitars incorporated.I suppose they want to break from any comparisons to their previous bands and im all for bands changing their style and with this they lose or win new fans. However this album is not as energetic as their debut. At times it felt i was in a gospel choir. Tnis one suffers the sophomore curse.

Pretty much every song is great on that cd. This cd though, sounds like they are trying too hard to come up with their own sound. It comes off as too polished and radio friendly, while their first cd was a bare knuckle hard rock masterpiece. Half of this cd is just not good at all.

More than just a fad, I hope these guys continue to make music together for a long time. Songs on this disc are a little milder and have less of an edge than the debut. They show the progression of a group that has a lot of talent. Chris Cornell continues to reinforce the notion that his name has to be put in to disscussion whenever rocks top vocalists are mentioned. Tom Morello is so easy to identify with just a few notes that I'm surprised he is not copied more. Saw them in concert last month. Great show. Acoustic Black Hole Sun and Spoonman with that Rage guitar were the highlights. Hearing Cornell singing \\"Killing In The Name Of\\"and not Zach is still a little wierd. If Zach was smart he would tell the guys from Limp Bizkit to dump Fred, and they could start their own supergroup."},{"rating":"2","title":"But this album","review":"I got the cd the day it came out.

These guys were talented and original - now they churn out radio-friendly fluff. I knew Tom Morello was on his way out since the Rage albums got progressively worse, but I really had hope for Cornell.

Now they release their sophomore album OUT OF EXILE. The first single Be Yourself is a slow moving but great song. Meanwhile the rest of the album falls flat for the most part.It opens with the rocker Your time is come which reminds one of the first single from Audioslave's first album. The 2nd track, out of exile, which the album is named after is a pretty good song, but after the 3 aforementioned songs the album is just not that good. There isn't enough originality only the continuation of the same sound throughout. It just lacks any really great songs and if Audioslave continues to release albums (which means they need to release something better than this), this one could be the one overlooked and least listened to by most fans.

Weirdly enough, when I first heard Audioslave (1st album) I had this terrible feeling that it was the end of an era. I will never say \\"shame\\", just money thrown out of the window. Messrs.

Everything about this new effort is crap. Perhaps the chemistry they had on the first album was just a fluke. The musical compositions sound nearly the same as the first album. The beginning riff on \\"Your time has come\\" sounds very close to cochise. The lyrics are trite, self absorbed and meandering(kinda like soundgardens last effort). Morello took us down the same ole same ole noise road with his guitar solos. The most annoying quality of this album is the sound, it's flat and lifeless, the mixes are blase, muddy and totally lacking in edge.I don't see anything redeeming about this album.

The sound doesn't even slightly resemble that of the previous album. Hits like \\"show me how to live\\", \\"like a stone\\", and \\"shadow on the sun\\" had soul in them. Almost like Chris and gang were pouring their very souls out in each and every song. This new album has no soul. I thought it might just be one of those albums you just have to listen to awhile to like it, but believe me that is not the case. Fortunately I also purchased the new Seether cd and it is freakin awesome and would definately recommend. Hope this helps"},{"rating":"1","title":"...BAH!","review":"To the point! I liked the 1st Audio Slave Album a lot! But this album is garbage! It has a couple decent songs but the rest sucks!To me... this music has no roots of either RAGE or Sound Garden!

It's just bad!Right out the car window with this one!VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"The material on this record is just flat out weak. At least the last album had a couple of promising songs, but would it kill Tom Morello to use the dirty channel on his amp once in a while?

Audioslave doesnt remind me of anything creative or original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I've been listening to this cd on repeat most of the day, in hopes it would be one of those classics that grows on you. It's not.I won't get overly detailed on the individual tracks. It has a couple (maybe 4, or 5 if you want to stretch it) of good songs with some catchy riffing, and the occasional mind-skewering Morello solo, but it's a bit weak overall.The new single \\"Be Yourself\\" is terrible. Don't even compare it to \\"I am the Highway.\\"Don't expect the same semi-Rage stylings from their debut cd.

But once again this sounds like a cheap imitation of Led Zepplin. I like albums with diversity and don't need the constant banging and thrashing but once again they have put out an uninspired and unoriginal album. I am not sure of their goal with this album but it will sit nicely next to your 3 Doors Down album and you will probably hear an Audioslave song following a 3DD song on crappy modern rock radio. This is definitely NOT metal and is more adult contemporary/power pop. Don't get me wrong there are a couple of songs on here that I really like but I wish I would have downloaded them instead of buying the whole album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album rocks, mmmkay!!!","review":"I was listening to this album in the counseling office trying to help Cartman with his eating disorder, and I couldn't help but listen to this album while he was spilling his emotions, mmmkay.

The first album gets you off your feet with your hands pumping in the air...this one makes you sit down. Not in a bad way, but this is not fist pounding. And don't take that as something negative because I do like it...it's just different. Some reviewers hypothisized that the first album was RATM being RATM and Chris Cornell being Soundgarden, but I disagree with that. It's kind of like the difference between Led Zeppelin 2 and Led Zeppelin 3. Ah. I wonder how many of you will understand that?Overall, it's a great rock album. I mean, what else are you going to buy, Sum 41?while you're at it, check out a band called CKY...especially if you thought this was a bit too mellow."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Audioslave?","review":"I will probably still buy the next Audioslave CD, if there is one, in hopes that the third disc will match the hard hitting R&R of the first one.

What happened?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but a notch down from their debut","review":"AudioSlave's self-titled debut is the best rock album of the decade so far. So to say that 2nd CD \\"Out of Exile\\" doesn't live up to it isn't the usual \\"sophomore slump.\\" Out of Exile is still fantasic and maybe after a few more weeks it will grow on me.Chris Cornell still rocks the vocals and Tom Morello's guitar work is every bit as his best with Rage Against the Machine. But if I have a complaint with this CD is that there's less variety from tune to tune, it's a little more monotone, and I'd say a little less edgy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Send this Album into Exile","review":"Since I heard that Audioslave was coming out with a new album considering how excellent the first one is, but then I heard \\"Out of Exile\\". For some reason the album lacks something, although the Tim C and Tom Morello are awesome musicians, but they weren't represented well with this album. However, the new Audioslave lacks the soul the original did, it sorta sounds like they went through the motions of playing; Or perhaps it was the more limited involvement that Rick Ruben had in the production of the album. The album is disappointing considering who the band members are, some of the songs are almost unlistenable. Although I still consider the group a super group, in my opinion they just put out a sub-par album. Hopefully, they just fell to the old sophmore jinx as most bands do; guess we'll see with the 3rd album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best rock albums of all time!","review":"I keep going back and listening to this album over and over again...it just doesn't get old.

Thus if you are a size 9 in womens you should purchase a 7 1/2 in mens. I have never seen any other brand do this, but that was the sizing chart directly on the box said.

Close range is a yes with this, dont try sniping with this(who would). The other thing is after about 4 months of having this gun it broke. The grip fell off and doesnt go back on or anything.

The history is full of cliches (bad ones - some times there good cliches to use in a film - but unfortunately that didn't happen here)and, worst than this, a lot of unbeliavable impossible situations. Examples:1) The new singer audition for the band (Steel Dragon) in front of the old singer, that simply does not know he is being fired!!2) The singer (Walhberg) and the guitarrist of his cover band start arguing in the middle of a show, talking normally as if the volume was turned to zero!3)The singer (Wahlberg) quit upon being a rocker and decide to go \\"zen\\", playing accoustic gigs in clubs with twenty people as audience.Well, enough.

Shame, then, that Rock Star, is such a dud. Nothing wrong with Mark Wahlberg��s acting or the talented but hopelessly miscast Jennifer Anniston. The problem lies with the cheesy, cynical, unconvincing way the hard rock genre is portrayed. The conflict situations are ridiculously hammy (the rival bands face-off in the car park is particularly cringeworthy). All the way through the movie I got the uncomfortable feeling I was watching a film intended for 7 year-olds. Lovers of rock movies be warned. The only redeeming feature is Timothy Spall as charismatic road manager, the rest of the cast make very unconvincing rock stars and very unconvincing actors. If you haven't seen Almost Famous famous, I would recommend that movie instead.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minor League","review":"It would have gotten a 3 except for the ending.

Thrilled at the idea of becoming the lead singer of his favorite band, Chris packs his bags and goes back-stage to find his dream band to be something different than he expected. The hard touring life soon takes a toll on him and his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston)and he has to make tough choices.This is a fun comedy/satire of rock'n'roll fame in the glam rock scene of the big hair '80s. The film is comical but has some touching themes as well which makes it well thought out and very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"rock on","review":"the premise of this movie is good.

It's not like either of those, in fact, it's most like \\"Boogie Nights,\\" and not just because of Mark Wahlberg. It's actually pretty good, about a guy who gets to live his dream of being the singer for his favorite band, and then finds out that they are just as warty and uncool as the rest of us, at least some of the time. I suppose that the perpetually hip won't like the ending, but the decisions made by Wahlberg's sweet character ring true for the way he plays the guy throughout the film.

A rock musician discovers fame overnight, and we witness his descent into a life of overindulgence and no morals.He loses sight of what's important in the pursuit of the rock star's lifestyle. He actually loses a lot more than that.Wahlberg was amazingly convincing. I had a hard time believing it was him throughout the film. Aniston was also great in her role - complex but not overdramatic. Just simply complex - holding on to her own values in the end, she sets a really great example.I have to say the last few minutes made the whole movie worth watching - it was like getting a tooth ache and finally having the thing extracted. The end made up for all the agony in the middle of the movie.If you like rock and roll, and you like to see good guys win in the end (even if the enemies are their own stupidities), then watch this one, but not with the kids!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intensely Written","review":"Personally, I don't like heavy metal but this movie got me thinking twice about my likes and dislikes.

For starters it was a very slow paced film, the plot was not planned out very well, but the main thing that really was depressing was the fact that it had two real great actors for such a rotten film"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done","review":"This movie was very well done in every way. I just watched it for the first time and was not expecting much from it. The end result was a good story, awsome acting and even fun with the twist and real life band comparisions. The story is based on for the most part Judas Priest. Judas Priest lost their original vocalist and found their replacement frrom a cover band. Anyway see this movie and you will not be disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissatisfying film","review":"I find Rock Star to be disappointing. It centers around the '80s hard rock music scene. Chris Cole--played by Mark Wahlberg--has a day job that consists of fixing photocopiers. At night, he is a vocalist for a tribute band, Blood Pollution, that performs songs by the popular group Steel Dragon. Subsequently, he is contacted by Steel Dragon, does the audition, and becomes their new singer. The first hour of Rock Star shows promise but becomes tedious afterwards. The flaws are a thin plot and cardboard cutout characters. While the acting from the cast is not bad, the problem lies with their characters not being fleshed out enough. The facets I like are the music, cinematography, and concert scenes. Even though Rock Star sports good aspects, it is not a solid movie. Rock Star is 106 minutes. I actually give it 2.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupidest Movie I've Ever Seen","review":"This was the most trite piece of garbage that I have ever watched.

In this movie, it's clear the director, the producers, the actors, everybody involved didn't give a damn about rock and roll or heavy metal. Mark Walhberg is as bad as ever. If the movie was intended to be a parody or comedy, it could have been tolerated. But it is not! It was meant to be \\"serious\\", h��!, with all that cliches, songs from other bands being credited to Steel Dragon, even Zakk Wylde's participation is terribly dumb...The movie is so shallow it made me puke.

It's utterly bad. It has produced damage to the already prejudiced image of rock. Wahlberg's acting is lame; the options for the soundtrack is absurd: the so-called band STEEL DRAGON is supposedly a killer band, witht hei own great original material. But the songs that STEEL DRAGON play in the movie, as if it was of their authory, are not!! It has one song from RAINBOW, another from DEF LEPPARD, it's absurd!Even as joke it did not work, because it was not conceived as a joke!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Entertaining","review":"I've watch this movie many times before on VCD and HBO, and now I finally have it on DVD thanks to Amazon.com.

In this case, becoming a rockstar of your favorite rock band.

It is unlike anything else that you would see in the movie theater or video store. The film tells the story of a wannabe fan who is suddenly facing the harsh world of stardom. The film has some good themes that will leave you thinking about what you want to do with the rest of your life, and if it is the right thing to do.

It is a really entertaining film that is both really funny and dramatic. I thought Mark Wahlberg did some of his best work here. After making the dull film \\"Planet of the Apes\\", it was nice to see him really doing some great acting and really use his skills to make a film that doesn't leave you disappointed and will put a smile on your face and make you feel good. I thought Jennifer Aniston did a good job too. She pulls her role off really well as Wahlberg's girlfriend/manager and she looks great in this film, as usual. Also, I thought the film had a good story to it and it wasn't just thrown together with a lot of heavy metal in between a bunch of dialogue. It really has a point. Even though \\"Rock Star\\" may not be a totally original film, it still is great entertainment. So in conclusion, go see this film because it really is a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow your dreams to a new beginning!!","review":"Wow! What a great movie!\\"Rock Star\\" is an excellent examination of life with its many layers. Most of which never go examined by many, perhaps because of a fear that success is just around the corner; and some, as quiet as it is kept are indeed afraid of success. Afterall, with great rewards, come great responsibility.As one who fully accepts that you are what you desire and act upon, this movie hit the spot. Not only is it about more than music, as alluded to above, it is about life itself. Life in the sense that we all have that secret, and sometimes not so secret, dream that we hold within. More often than not, such a dream goes unrealized.Perhaps this will be lost on some, then again maybe not, but \\"live\\" your life and you will feel me!

It gives no justice to the rock and roll lifestyle. At the end of the movie, they make it seem that alternative/grunge is the music of the future (ugh!).For god's sake, it has Marky mark in it!!The only cool thing about this movie is the Cameo appearances by many musicians, including Zakk Wylde.

I'd rather stand naked in a hot shower shaving with a razor. As far as the shave goes, it was pretty close, not as close as a razor but acceptably close.

You have to repeatedly go over and over the same skin in order to get all the stubble, whereas an \\"old-fashioned\\" disposable, multi-blade shaver that is used with shaving cream usually requires only one, maybe two passes.The other limitation of this shaver is that it does poorly with anything other than short stubble. If the hair is an eighth of an inch or longer, you have to cut it down to size with the attached trimmer, then go back to it with the shaver. You have to use the same process with a hair that is lying flat against the neck.In conclusion, I would NOT buy this style of shaver again.

When using the #1775, it reminds me of a lawnmower when it goes through very thick grass. It makes a loud noise and the motor even bogs down. After 4 weeks, I still can't get a close shave.

No matter how many times I go over the same area, it invariably misses random hairs. Every time a hair is missed, the probability that it will be missed again rises exponentially. No matter how slowly or long I shave, I end up with 5mm hairs in random places. Since the trimmer has stopped working properly, it is even difficult to use that to chop down the stalks.Unlike other reviewers, I know that Braun can do better.

The only area the shaver seems to have problems is the back of the jaw just below the ear. Knowing that I can compensate. Easy to clean. Battery has lasted weeks. Fit in either hand is very comfortable. Overall a great little shaver for price. Tip for blade users, try using shave soap and a brush in place of stuff in a can.

The closeness of the shave is comparable to the other Braun foil shavers I've used. I have a medium beard and shave daily. The battery life on this shaver is far better than on the previous shavers.

Do not recommend this model to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply the worst shave I have ever had","review":"You might think that my title was hyperbole - if anything, it was an understatement. I never got a shave nearly as smooth as with a blade. This shaver consistently missed hairs, and shaving anything other than my cheeks and mustache was plain impossible. If I went more than a day without shaving, I had to clean the blades multiple times during a single shave. There were several times that I ran the shaver over a particular area multiple times, only to have that part of my face appear untouched.I bought this shaver because of the reviews, and because I have sensitive skin that is often irritated when I use a blade. While this shaver was very gentle on my skin, most likely that is because it simply did not shave. I have never had a more frustrated shaving experience than I did with this shaver."},{"rating":"2","title":"It twerks","review":"Have been using this product for the best part of a year now and find it to be hard to find a razor that works and does its job well at the price.

I give it 4 stars for the weakness below, and would consider a rotary shaver if I were to buy an electric razor again.Strengths: only need to change the foil every 18 months, can get many shaves out of a single charge, slick lookWeakness: will work poorly if you have not shaved in two days, or even in a single day, if you grow a lot of thick facial hair! It frequently requires going over a \\"shaved\\" area with a razor, which is like shaving twice. I have found that shaving twice a day (morning and evening) lets me get away without using a razor the next day.On Amazon it says it will be shipped in 4-6 weeks. I just walked into a Walmart and picked one up the same day. The price, even with tax, is comparable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foil distintegrated after 3 months of use - disappointing","review":"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 78-year-old father, who hadn't used an electric razor in over 25 years.

We're hoping it was just a bad lot and will try to get a replacement, but I'm very disappointed to have this hassle to deal with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean, Fun Shave!","review":"Greatt! It's an awesome smooth shave. I never thought it would be, considering all the bad press about razors vs electric. Maybe I was bad at regular shaving, but my skin feels smoother than ever. Also, the shaver looks super sleek. I love having it sit, and looking cool.The only drawback is that my skin feels slightly irritated/itchy after I shave. Maybe it's because my skin isn't used to it or I'm not great with the razor yet.OVERALL: GREAT BUY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Idea","review":"Best feature is the tap water clean up.

Pop off the head and run it under water or brush it out.....takes about 10 seconds to clean and your good to go!! The unit also charges fast and has a lot of life with a charge. I charge it occasionally because I figure it's about due, but in reality it hasn't slowed down after a weeks worth of shaves. I've bought a lot of stuff using Amazon and I've never been let down!

I've tried other Braun models costing up to 5 times the price of the Free Control and none of them shaves as close. I think the secret is that is uses just one large cutting block which is heavier and closer cutting than those 2 headed models. Also, the floating foil head is MUCH THINNER than the more expensive Braun models. It floats up and down on your face, and the foil itself is very flexible so it compresses onto the cutter and you barely have to press the shaver to your face.

Don't waste your money on anything more expensive, they don't get any closer than this!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"Have mostly used rotary shavers in the past; bought this one based on price and brand name.

It literally shaved zero of my facial hairs. Tried going with and against the grain (always perpendicular to the surface as per manual) but that made very little difference.

I don't like to spend that much time in front of the mirror. And I never nick myself with a shaver. Shavers are like underwear, can't try 'em on and if you don't like 'em, can't take 'em back. Only underwear is cheap so you can try then buy more, shavers, usually not cheap. Mine works well.

Oh - and those never-stop-bleeding razor cuts. - and you're always running out of something. If it isn't razors, it's shaving cream.Bottom line. Great product, good value. I used to \\"not see\\" how people used these things. Now I \\"don't see\\" why people still use manual blade shaving. I really can't see myself ever going back to a manual blade - ever. I'm a complete convert due to this Braun model. Of course, as always, your mileage may vary. You need to give your face about a month to get used to an electric.

When I will ware this one out I will probably try a more expensive Braun (only to see if it gets better)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing. Repeated passes required for close shave","review":"I'm surprised at all the positive reviews here. I bought this razor mainly based on the reviews, and I must say that I'm disappointed. My previous electric razor was a low-end Remington that I bought from a discount retailer. But the Remington shaver actually worked much better, and I shouldn't have thrown it away when the foil broke.The problem with this Braun shaver is that you have to keep shaving the same spot -- over and over and over again -- in order to get a close shave. If you do a quick, two-minute shave (which actually worked pretty well with my Remington), you'll end up with about as much beard as you had before the shave.I don't recommend this shaver."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SO GREAT!","review":"I found that I could not get a close shave, if I was working I would have to shave later in the day to get by. Luckily I am retired so no problem. I also cannot cut some of the beard on the lower part of my neck and have to use the trimmer to cut any long hairs. Not as good as my old Norelco.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Todd Parr Rules!","review":"Every book Todd Parr has done should be on a must-read list for parents and kids.

First of all, the book is SO politically correct that it steps over itself and forgets to be interesting or fun.

Uhura on the original Star Trek series. This book details her early life up through Star Trek to her life at the time of the writing. Not having known much about her I found it quite interesting what she had to say about her experiences. She was one of the few African American actors performing on television at the time of the Civil Rights movement. She was seen as a role model for African Americans and even though she was seen that way, it doesn't appear she really wanted the responsibility of being the standard bearing for the movement. For myself I was more interested in the portions about the series and this is a must for anyone also interested in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty entertaining","review":"Nichelle Nichols led a pretty interesting life. All her accounts of the racism she's dealt with are particularly involving. The book has an eye-rolling movie star tendency toward self flattery, but she has reason to be proud of her accomplishments (and I'm sorry, but contrary to what's been previously written, she never comes close to claiming that everyone in her family is a genius or that every man she met fell in love with her). She also offers some STAR TREK anecdotes that I for one never saw before, and I've read a lot of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uhura rocks","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Nichelle Nichols' story. Courageous woman, inspiring life story. Star Trek fans will enjoy this ST rendition. Happpy reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groovy Baby!","review":"So I buy this CD on a whim - and it's not bad! Kinda like a 60's jetsetter's soundtrack. A few standout tracks from this are \\"Jerko\\" - which has a nice beat to it and will make you want to groove a bit and \\"Mannix\\".I would reccomend this to anyone who just wants to sit back, grab a mai tai and relax. The music is fun, bouncy, caribbean infused pop. This album doesn't have anything profound to say about the world, but then again it doesn't have to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Bunny Ears","review":"These are the cutest bunny ears I could ever purchasing and are so affordable.

It was produced in Germany by PILZ Compact Disc in DDD format. The sound is crystal clear, and I must admit that even though the orchestras are not American, they do a great job on these Gershwin pieces (the performers are the Vienna Symphonic Roch Orchestra conducted by Simon Gale, and the Philharmonia Slavonica conducted by Henry Adolph). Gershwin's music is loved all over the world, and here are three of his most famous works: CD 1 contains selections from West Side Story, and from Porgy and Bess. CD2 contains both full-length versions of An American in Paris, and the beloved Rhapsody in Blue. The second CD also includes 5 little Sinfoniettas of Leos Janacek, which last a bit over 21 minutes of total time. We found these pieces to be delightful also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the right audience","review":"This book does an excellent job of introducing the reader to the concept of applying Statistical Process Control. Through a great number of mini case studies it shows a number of possible applications. Probably more importantly it amply demonstrates the when to be concerned and when to continue monitoring the situation before reacting.This is NOT a technical book. The few formulae that are presented are relegated to a small appendix and are virtually unusable. This makes the book more suitable for administrators than for quants.People actually conducting the studies will not find what they need in terms of formulae. They will find what they need to understand which type of chart is appropriate and how to interpret the results.Ideally the authors should have included software to actually do the calculations. This would have allowed the non-technical people to actually do their own studies rather than just interpet what others have done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthcare Quality","review":"This is a good book to introduce health care workers to statistical use of health related data using control charts and basic principles of statistic analysis. Good because it is not the usual text based on manufacturing.

The depth of his characters and the intriguing, complex plots are a refreshing change from cookie-cutter crime novelists who seem to only deal in serial killers and hard-bitten cops. Odds Against has more twists and turns than a mountain road and will keep you guessing until the very end. If you love a good mystery, you will love Sid Halley and his adventures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Popularity must mean terrible","review":"This book was a nightmare to complete. It is not that it's fully predictable as much as that it presents life as a muddle. While the writer knows his craft, he likes prosaic topics and meaningless, utilitarian scenes. His characters are deader than any murder victim. They slog through, and so do we his poor benighted readers, until the point where the conclusion becomes obvious, and then we skim the rest. Your average television show has more grace than this book. I don't know why this sells so many copies, as it is without any meaning in the context of a normal life and it doesn't add anything. It might be popular for the same reason bad music is, in that it doesn't require a brain and passes the time. If all you want is a distraction from thinking about your imminent death for a couple hours, maybe Dick Francis is the way to go. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much, too fast","review":"As a beginner, I found the first ten pages of this book interesting and helpful, but after that it gets complex fast. The enclosed CD is pointless, except for the tuning, and even then you have to wait a few minutes while the artists in the studio get some foolishness out of the way. There are 7 or 8 songs that follow, but no connection with the book or guidance on how to play. I'll get back to it in about a year, but this is no value for absolute beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for Aussies","review":"This book was okay if you live in Australia.

They have practices of making engraved pottery items which can to the casual observer seem like magic charms or something of the like, but the Mandaean faith explicitly forbids the practice of anything involving the occult.

It was advertised as listen and learn. I am going on a trip to Italy and I wanted to become familiar with the language. I have a 45-minute drive to work each day and wanted something to listen to on the way that would familiarize me with the language. This CD requires constant interaction with the book, which doesn't work well driving to work.

I wish I had covers that would fit all of my pet (and human) cans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cover canned cat food really well!","review":"These can covers will fit standard cans in two sizes. The larger size is perfect for fitting over 6-oz Natural Balance cat food cans. These are around the same diameter as a canned soup can (not Campbell's, something like Progresso). The smaller size would likely fit over a standard condensed soup can or similar size.The material these are made of is flexible and durable, and I'm sure it will last through many uses. I don't have a dishwasher, though these seem like they should withstand a good dishwashing. They grip well without too much effort to fit them on.

In this particular book,for example, historical details are wrong and/or misinterpeted,and the German dialog is grammatically and/or idiomatically incorrect.* Excessive reliance on \\"deus ex machina\\" plot devices.Summary: If you like the type of suspense Ludlum writes,you'd be better off reading someone like Trevanian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Conspiracy writes a melodrama","review":"This is the third book by Robert Ludlum that I have endured. Ludlum finds a conspiracy in everything, apparently, and this book is no exception. The dialogue reminds me of conversation one can hear on the late late show from '30's and '40's movies. Some of it is so bad it's funny. See the villain threaten the flawed hero (otherwise known as the \\"field accountant\\"). See the heroine mistreated by the villain. See the villain go over to the other side, become powerful and vindictive and murderous, without any motivation at all!

Very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This is my first Ludlum book and it is sure to be my last. The plot is preposterous because of Ludlum's limited understanding of economics and history. Once you realize that, all interest in the story falls away. It starts off plausible enough...and the blurbs on the jacket imply some \\"weapon\\" more powerful than a mere 270 million dollars! Hitler gained power because of the alignment of a number of situations that made the ground fertile for his brand of megalomania. Some spoiled, rich American brat and his fortune would hardly make a difference to the currents of history. I know that this is only supposed to be a work of fiction, and it is all in good fun, but the plot-concept needs to be much more believable to hold my interest. If you don't need logic in your fiction, it's interesting enough as a cloak and dagger story, but it falls far short in the historical (and economic) fiction department."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Ludlum's Best","review":"The Scarlatti Inheritence reads slowly and is somewhat uninteresting for Ludlum fans.

It takes a long time to get going. The background necessary for the action ending to work is nearly two thirds of the novel. I got the feeling that Ludlum had to do it that way, as though he was saying, \\"I had to tell you all that in order to tell you this little story.\\" On that level, it is not one of Ludlum's best, in my opinion.However, it will not keep me from buying his work and eventually reading all of his novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz of Mythical Quality","review":"Imagine lounging in a comfortable chair with your favorite drink looking at a perfect view; this recording would round out that picture very nicely, because it's all about beautiful melodies and wonderful improvisations and compelling rhythms.

A major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"You need a physics degree to follow this one","review":"And I don't have that degree. Fortunately I do have advanced math and some engineering physics under my metaphorical belt, otherwise I would've been completely lost when reading this book. As it was I was only lost about half of the time.All the elements of a good story are here, a mystery, interesting characters and conflict, but the author just doesn't seem to know how to pull it all together successfully. For every step the plot or character development advances, you're slapped with a load of technobabble. A little science is good, too much and you're writing a technical manual, not a sci-fi novel.I really was intrigued by this mysterious artifact and what it ended up containing, and by the character conflicts, but overall it was just impossible to focus on any of that when trying to wade through yet *another* round of math/chemistry/physics lectures.Give this one a miss, unless of course reading textbooks is your idea of a good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book is a (a)Theoretical Physics (b)Spy-Thriller (c)Adventure book.

The first half of the book (200 pages) basically has the very forgettable characters doing not much of anything. When the \\"action\\" finally starts, the menacing artifact is about as scary as a ham sandwich. I have to be honest, I didn't even finish the book.

Clearly this novel is a low point in Benford's career. I really wanted to enjoy this book but I couldn't get past the filler. All the \\"intrigue\\" and running around by our heroes got on my nerves and did little for me in the entertainment department, in fact it prevented me from finishing the book. I simply didn't care about these characters enough to follow all their exploits and \\"sneaking\\" around in order to wrest the artifact from the clutches of whats-his-face (Kontos). I have read a great deal regarding \\"alternate theories\\" about the origins of man, so I was looking forward to reading a novelized version of those theories from a trusted author like Benford.

I certainly tried to like it.However, the characters were one-dimensional, and seemingly defined entirely by one flaw, tic or trait. For example: the female lead smokes, but we're never told how she feels about herself smoking, why she smokes, what it feels like, why she's lighting up at that particular moment, simply that she does, in fact smoke. Not all that interesting when there's no context.Worse: the underlying \\"big concept\\", which is primarily why I like to read science fiction, was just not that interesting. Macro-sized quantum particles could be fascinating, but his implementation of the idea was simply ho-hum.In short, one idea, one dimensional characters, no genuine dramatic tension, no page-turning momentum, and rather a waste of money.Buy it only if you plan to use it as a sleep aid."},{"rating":"1","title":"[Weak]","review":"I found the science vaguely interesting (particle erotique); but the main premise of an adventure -- which this novel pretends to be -- is likeable characters; and it is here that the book fails.

Finally: the heroine's Bostonian mother must have been some ingenuous Baroque music buff to listen to a piece for harpsichord by Vivaldi (of all the composers)...

That means there are 4 parts (listening, reading, writing and speaking) for each. The big problem is that the CD only contains the audio for the first listening test. They didn't bother to record audio for tests 2-4. So they may as well not have been written, because obviously there is no way to test your listening if there's nothing to listen to. A big boo and hiss to Barron's for putting out this incomplete package. I gladly would have paid the extra money it would have cost to pay for the one extra CD.

The face is actually a metalic blue, creating a glare (image suggests a flat face), and the numbers looked like raised silver, not flat white like the watch image alludes to. This was either photoshopped or taken under special lights, as I was not able to even closely get the watch to be readable like I thought (and I work in photoshop and photography!).

Instead of leaving from pay cheque to pay cheque every month for the whole of one's life, the author is advocating something better and smatter. From one's salary, one needs to put aside residual income for investment. This the author calls building a pipeline. An investment yield returns all the time, any time of the day, in good and bad times, whether one is sick or not. Just like a pipeline, which once constructed keeps pumping daily, year in, year out, whether one is there or not? With a paying job, one is trading time for a pay cheque (a day's work for a day's pay) but if one falls ill and is no longer able to work, the pay cheque also stops and life grinds to a halt for those people who never thought6 of investing in a pipeline, but instead were to content live from month to month on their salaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improve your reality","review":"It is a fine little book that I read in a couple of hours.

With only a few exceptions today's widescreen DVDs are \\"anamorphic\\" or \\"enhanced for widescreen TV\\" which is the same way of saying that the picture is actually on all 480 active scan lines (no black bars). Note that until you change the set-up menu of your DVD player, the DVD player itself is supplying the black bars for use with standard TV. Once you tell your DVD player to output for a new widescreen TV, the black bars are gone and the anamorphic (or tall and skinny) picture is ready to be stretched across a wide screen.

I now use this video as a teaching aid.When you view the film note the reactions of Mary to being in the old folks home at Christmas. She puts up a front of anger against her already melting heart. She went from a brat to a feeling young woman, but it took a great deal of time for this to occur.A remarkable film.

Roberts and Olson have done a commendable job of showing how \\"Remember the Alamo!\\" remains as much a battle cry in America today as it was for the Texas revolutionaries who first gave it voice.\\" --DAN RATHER for THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Santa Anna and Mexican stereotypes revisited","review":"I was assigned to read Line in the Sand for a graduate class and unfortunately it quickly turned sour. It read like a W.P.Webb history book of the 1950's where Mexicans are blood thirsty and Santa Anna is compared to Cortez himself. There is little of nothing this book can offer a Tejano historian, it is just a another book insulting Mexicans and letting us all know how great the defenders of the Alamo were."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comprehensive look at the Alamo and its myth","review":"This is a very enjoyable book that both tells the story of the siege and battle of the Alamo and the development of the myth and symbol of the Alamo in Texan and American memory. The account of the Texas revolution and siege are balanced and scrupulous, carefully distinguishing between what we know and we infer. That account makes up the first half of the book. The second half relates the cultural history of Alamo preservation and its place in the current \\"culture wars\\" and revisionist history. An interesting account of the making of both the Disney \\"Davy Crockett\\" series and John Wayne's \\"The Alamo\\" feature in this latter half. I recommend the book highly. The history of the siege and battle is fairer and more balanced here than in Jeff Long's \\"Duel of Eagles.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent overview","review":"This book serves as an excellent overview of the events leading up to the Alamo, and it provides an equally good history of the controversies that have arisen since then. As other reviewers have noted, this won't answer all the questions; it's not a minute-by-minute account, and it doesn't end with the events of March 6, 1836. On the other hand, that's not the purpose of the book. Roberts and Olson provide a balanced look at some of the most emotionally charged controversies, giving several accounts of Crockett's death (they seem to side with de la Pena's) and helping the reader to weigh the evidence. The only thing that's missing is a map or two. Alamo buffs may know the exact distances and locations from Goliad to San Antonio to San Jacinto, the layout of the Alamo in 1836, and so forth, but maps of both would be helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cryptography","review":"Great buy.But i must warn you, its very advanced!I used this as my text, in a graduate class, It was very helpful because my professor was able to explain the \\"hard stuff\\" to me.But its good, it sets the 'motion' for research on topics discussed in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase the Kindle Edition","review":"Do not purchase the kindle edition of the text book.

I think that each separate interview had at least one pearl of wisdom that aspiring film-makers (both in the highest and lowest senses) can take from this book. And for those who aren't necessairily interested in a career in the movies, this book still has plenty of intrigue and gossip in it's pages to enjoy.I got this as a Christmas present, and I hope that a sequel is in the works.CIAO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"75% fat","review":"Most of this book is wasted on pointless anecdotes with filmmakers who forgot the purpose of the interview: to describe how their first film got made.The best interviews are the first and last: the Coen brothers and James Mangold.

Verrrrrry interesting.Any good directors out there, my new book would make a wonderful animated movie, or so they tell me.

This book examines those scenes in over 25 American museums as well as private collections which serve to shed light on the role of Ancient Egyptian women in their society. Objects such as mummy cases, coffins, statues and other sacred items also hold much information. The book contains essays by Egyptologists Janet H. Johnson, Catherine H. Roehrig and Betsy M. Bryan. A chronological index, map, beautiful photos, bibliography and index have also been included.

It is a mindless string of 1960s cliches, with the acting poor and the script worse.Of course, if your sole reason for purchasing videos is that there is no sex or violence - yes, you can watch this with the children.

I saw it when it was first released with my brother and cousin on Easter sunday in Brooklyn NY. I'm not sure why but I always remembered it.Unlike the teens in todays films, these were nice kids.The film featured a pretty impressive cast of hollywood stars, some in cameo roles. The plot concerned a all girl catholic high schools cross country trip to a rally and their misadventures along the way.

An obvious attempt to recapture the magic of \\"Trouble with Angels\\", this fails miserably! I think the producers cast Stella Stevens as the progressive nun because they couldn't get Hayley Mills to star in this pathetic sequel! Stella's character is not even really likable or warm for a nun - she's just angry! Rosalind Russell still has some appeal, but all the rest of the cast are cliches from the Mills \\"Angel\\" film. Even some of the dialogue sounds like it was lifted! Really a shame, since the first film was so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Angels Go Trouble Follows","review":"Yuck! I agree with the reviewers who say this shouldn't be called a sequel. This movie shows what must have gone wrong in the Church to have had such an exodus from the convents during the 70's. Thankfully, the trend is reversing. The first movie was cute. I wanted to share it (The Trouble With Angels), with my daughter and got this one by mistake. I had seen it (Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows), when I was growing up and remember being disappointed that is wasn't more like the first movie.

I've been looking assiduously for the sequels in the year since I bought it, until I thought to check here. It really does leave you caring what happens next.

While I enjoyed the first fifty pages, I found it dragging a little bit in the middle, as it turned into a bit of a \\"chick\\" book, where the female lead was becoming all jealous and hissy-fit-ish. However, I will not spoil it, but rest assured the last fifty or so pages are some of the best story telling i have ever read. The ending was a mindblower, like Enders Game, or Wizards First Rule... Wow!Anyhow, this is a great little story about a roaming healer and her bodyguard and the adventures they get into as Eldrie runs from something in her past.

In this case, the laying of the transatlantic cable, the Civil War, the sewage plight of London, the spiritualist fad, and then more personally, grief over the death of a child, failed marriages, falls from a height, and more. There is a wealth of plot and an even greater wealth of character and Griesemer succeeds in handling it all with ease and aplomb. The history and technological details are interesting in their own right, but they never overshadow the characters and their own stories. Griesemer takes his time in this work and therefore everything that happens to these characters, everything that serves to make us laugh or moves us or surprises us is earned. In such a large, sprawling work it would have been easy to have entire sections weaker than others, but that is not the case. The book holds at a high level from beginning to end.

Essentially, it's a pornographic movie, another attempt to mainstream porn. Above all, it's a *failed* attempt to mainstream porn. The movie is really bad, and can almost be considered an unintentional parody of pornography. My favourite scene is when Young Woman enters car, and finds Older Woman having sex with Man. She is distressed and asks Rourke to stop them. Rourke responds, in a voice that's supposed to be erotic and passionate: \\"I WANT TO, BABY. BUT I CAN'T. I JUST CAN'T\\".HA HA HA HA HA.Mickey is a really bad First Lover.Later, the prudish Young Woman and Mickey (who both have sexual inhibitions of some kind) finally \\"do it\\".

That may sound harsh, but I've watched school board meetings on public access television that were more compelling. Mickey Roarke is definitely a good actor, but seemed uninspired or maybe distracted in this. Carre Otis was also disappointing. I just don't think this role was a good match for her, even though she hadn't really been tested much as an actress before this. Also, if you look at Carre today, she is one of the most beautiful women you could ever see, but she is way, way, way too thin and unhealthy-looking in this film.

It's all about an impressionable Emily coming into her own in Rio fresh off the farm with Wheeler, stuck in his own mental rut taunting her every step of the way with his games. Teasing is cruel...to a point. Without the sex, the movie would have not made any sense at all if it werent for Claudia's (Jaqueline Bisset) antics and wit. I enjoyed the plot of the movie and everything that led up to the final, delicious love scene. Its an insult to the intellect to claim Mickey and Carre were not actually having sex...watch the unrated version and think again. It really doesnt matter though, this is what couples do...and that was NOT acting.This film is not someting to watch all of the time or it loses its meaning, its like a the occasional vintage whisky you sip once in a while.

It starts out with a plot then suddenly there's no plot. Rourke's ego is the size of Texas in this film and it does not help, in fact it hurts the film. Far to much posing and showing the haircut (this doesn't help either). All the Zalman King pictures I've seen take this same \\"road\\". They seem to start with a plot and then the plot quietly slips away amid steamy sex scenes and sexy music. It's almost as if the director puts in these scenes and hopes that one doesn't notice that the film plot slips away. Carre Otis is breathtakingly beautiful and in fact close-ups of her lovely face and the shots of Brazil are what I enjoy the most about the movie. If I could I would order a copy with 90% of Rourke's scenes taken OUT and replace them with scenes of Carre Otis and Jacqueline Bisset (memories of those great scenes of her in \\"The Deep\\").

Instead what I got was essentially a beginners' text with an elementary architectural emphasis. I skipped the first eight chapters of this nineteen-chapter book entirely. Though the information in the rest of the book was a little more more useful, it was nowhere near the level and depth I had expected.

Moreover, it's very unlikely from reading this book that any one Greek philosopher (such as Aristotle for example) could have produced so much diverse written science from diverse subjects and all in one lifetime. It is also very unlikely that the Greeks were actual authors of the Library contents. This is obvious as well because the Egyptian Mystery Neophytes were prohibited from writing or speaking about their education (hence the term 'Mysteries').

Not only did I pass the second time around, I improved my score by leaps and bounds. This book is THE only book you need, period. Everythings else out there (to date) is junk in comparison. Do not waste your money on other books like I did. Buy this book, actually read it, do the exercises, and follow the plan, and you will pass the test.

They learn a lesson with each adventure instead.This movie production, however, deviates so far from the book as to be ludicrous. Instead of the father being a businessman ruined by grief, he is an incompetent absent-minded inventor. The children lie. The children are disrespectful of authority.

Dino has not a single redeeming quality other than the adolescent wisecracks. The effects are extremely cheesy, and I can't even bear to watch the \\"laser\\" scene - the noisiest non-lasers ever envisioned. The women are treated like props more than any other movie I can think of - half a dozen beauties quickly pass through the movie during the credits and first 20 minutes - until it settles on Stella and Israeli actress Daliah.

Phillips has a history of good products such as their small stereo systems, or at least the one I have. I started with the stereo CD player and figured I would build from there. The next thing I bought was A DVD/VCR combo. Within 6mo. the VCR stopped working.Well, I tought, no problem it had a 1 yr. warranty, so I took it to an \\"authorized repair shop\\". They informed me that I would have to send the unit, at my cost, to Phillips HQ to get a rebuilt replacement ( this was the way the warranty would cover it) In short this would be more expensive and hassel than to buy a new and different brand. My conclusion is Phillips helped create the light bulb then a few years later the compact disc. Anything past that they pretty much suck. Stick with what you know Phillips, and it 's not customer service or recorders.Cal the Handiman"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"This product has a known defect for which Philips has limited support.

This didn't happen every time, but most. Commercial discs played back silently.2) The machine crashes (freezes and has to be unplugged to reboot). On one occasion this happened when I programmed a recording. The recording didn't start and the controls were frozen. This means one can't have confidence programming will work. I wrote Philips to ask about software updates, got no answer until I insisted, then was sent an excerpt from the manual about how to program recording and nothing about updates.3) Editing is unstable. A thumbnail image can be set. Then it moves by itself as much as 20-30 seconds if the file is split further on and has to be redone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable and disappointing","review":"I should have known better than to buy another Philips DVDR after all the problems I had with my first one. Color me stupid, I guess.The first program I recorded on the HD ended up getting corrupted. Unfortunately, that was a continuing trend. The software tends to crash, and the only way to reset is to unplug it, which would often result in more corrupted files.To be honest, I only had one problem with the timer, and that was remedied by reseting the software to defaults.The DVD burner worked fine at first, but know it won't even read half the disks I have, even disks it burned itself.I've only had it six months, and I'm already looking to replace it.

It is an inspirational album for anyone who hasn't lost the idealism of that time, when we all felt we could change the world for the better, cast out the evil and help create social justice for all.I wouldn't call it a preachy album. It kind of reflects the news of the times. However, young people and maybe some older folks may have to look up references in order to understand some of the songs. For example the ballad of Benny Kid Paret is the story of the first boxer to die in the ring on network television. There's more to it than that, but knowing the background of these songs is helpful. Faubus Foibles refers to Arkansas Democratic Governor Orval Faubus, who staunchly opposed school desegregation.Of course, Blind Boy Grunt, featured on the Album, is Bob Dylan. One of his songs is about the Ku Klux Klan, still active at the time the album was issued."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a great book!","review":"The Case of the Invisible Cat is a great book (as is all the clue books).

When the son of Honoria's best friend comes to her for help (wanting to prove that his fiancee was murdered, and didn't commit suicide) she reluctantly agrees to ask around and see what she can find. Toss in her loyal housekeeper, Mick (her Russian lover who everybody thinks is her husband), and a smattering of other characters and you've got a great story.

Horton's book was the right mix of theory and practical application for me to quickly improve my illustrations. From this book, I began to develop a sense of when and how to use illustration in lieu of text and to supplement text. I also learned several rules of thumb for effective presentation of illustrations in my manuals.This book didn't make me a graphic artist.

The Spalding Neverflat was ironically very flat (the owner didn't know how to inflate it), and the Rawlings was pretty beat although it was okay.Now, in this price range (retail price), from my experience this is the best ball available for indoor and outdoor use (especially compared to the Spalding zi/o excel, which is also a pretty good ball). The composite leather, the channels, the weight, the soft touch, the way it bounces, everything is awesome like a good indoor ball. I'll update this review after a lot of outdoor use to see if the ball holds up, which it should based on other reviews on the 'net.

Her husband, Richard the Lionhearted, is certainly well known. Yet virtually nothing is known about his wife, nor the country she came from.

I decided to take a graduate class in software engineering to brush up on my skills and this was the textbook used.There is quite a bit in this book that applies to development environments ten to fifteen years ago and relatively little that applies to current trends.Much of the material is also presented \\"shotgun manner\\" where many techniques from different sources are just thrown out without much attempt at comparison.I came away with a worse impression of \\"software engineering\\" as a discipline than when I started.I do think this text could be used as a handy encyclopedia: a starting point to find a definition or two and a jumping point for further research on a particular topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly written","review":"If you are a software engineer already, or if you are a CS professor, you might find this book marginally entertaining. Otherwise, if you are a student trying to learn the material, you will find this book horribly written.

In this day and age of Object Oriented Analysis and Design this type of book should be put on display in a museum. This book may be good for someone who is still using fortran, cobol, or pascal. However, it will set your development efforts back 10 years if you are trying to write extensible, supportable, useful code with minimum bugs.

I rate her even above Dick Francis, as her books show a greater degree of character development. Always well-researched with intriguing plot lines, the tales are highly entertaining. For horsepeople, Stacey is in a different league altogether from most authors when it comes to the accuracy of equestrian-related details. She not only knows the technicalities, she can convey the feel of what it is to live and work closely with horses. Add to that the thrill of well-written mystery plots, and the pages go by much too fast.

These shoes have caused \\"turf toe\\" which is a common sports injury. Turf toe is another name for: First Metatarsophalangeal Joint Sprain. This is a common injury of football players who are playing on hard artificial turf. It is caused by poorly designed shoes having a soft sole, especially in the forefoot. I believe the Adidas Originals Campus 2 may cause foot injury. They do not allow the foot to rock forward gently like running shoes do. They bend the big toe improperly so the first metatarsal joint makes an 'L' when walking.

I bought it to use in my retail store space and returned it after one use. We have old hardwood floors that we clean pretty regularly but had hitherto only swept. I expected a commercial vacuum to provide some power but this one failed big time - I had to move very slowly and go back and forth repeatedly to pick up dust bunnies that any household vacuum would grab the first time. I would have been better off getting a Shop-Vac for around $20."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy","review":"It has good suction and is easy to maneuver, but a little noisier than I expected. Also, I would prefer a more narrow all bristle floor brush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for the money","review":"I had a canister vacuum prior to this little gem and hated having to clean out that disgusting canister. I realized a bag vacuum would be so much simpler to deal with and this vacuum is the perfect solution. It is a great gem for the money, has excellent suction and hasn't failed me once yet. It is light enough that I can carry it around anywhere and everywhere. I even brought it with me to help my grandmother in her fifth floor walkup apartment in the city. The attachments are annoying to keep track of since there is nowhere to really put them on the main unit, but I don't use the attachments that much anyway. I'm very happy that I chose this over many other much more expensive choices especially because if it fails, I won't be upset about how much money I spent! The replacement bags are just as easy to find on Amazon, too. Best vacuum choice I ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sanitaire SCV3683","review":"There is plenty of suction on this vacuum but it is not that easy to use. I am 5'8\\", not so terribly tall, but had to bend over to vacuum till it was very uncomfortable to use. Is everything built for midgets? Fortunately I took parts from my Mightly Mite, which burned up, I might add, and so was able to conteract this problem. The hose also keeps catching on the hook to wind up the cord on, so that was an inconveniece, too. It is hard to adjust the setting on the floor attachment, also. Therefore, I am not crazy about this vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"featherweight, but powerful","review":"Strong features of this vacuum are its very light weight and its quite adequate power. The relatively low price is also a real \\"plus.\\" The hose on this vacuum tends to coil on itself, so there's often some effort required to straighten it out. However, the vacuum has a telescoping wand that is terrific for getting into tight places. I've been running the vacuum for only a few weeks, so its long-term performance remains to be seen. However, having had a top-of-the line Hoover require three costly repairs in six years (!) even mid-term endurance for the moderate cost Sanitaire will be a real improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst design ever!","review":"I have been cleaning houses for 35 years and I have never spent more time clearing out a vacuum hose more than this one. The design is simply \\"bad\\" there is a 45 degree angle that the simplest things get caught in and the suction power even when there isn't something to reem out is pathetic. This is the worst purchase I have ever made I would feel bad giving this vacuum away it has caused me so much frustration and grief. Ugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for the price","review":"This is a great little vacuum for the price. It can REALLY suck. We use it mostly on hardwoods and it picks up all the dog hair and dirt from the kids. It's not as effective on the rugs as our upright vacuum, but for the price it's still great. Easy to vacuum stairs and under furniture. If only the cord automatically retracted, it would be perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canister vacuum","review":"I gave this as a gift.

It works okay on rugs, not so great on carpet, but it's wonderful for hardwood floors and other non-carpet surfaces. I made the mistake of getting rid of it after moving in with my boyfriend (he had carpet and a better vacuum for carpet and very little space to keep two vacuums) thinking we would be in that apartment for at least a few years, but then we bought a house full of hardwood floors and his vacuum is terrible for hardwood. I'll be ordering another one of these Eurekas very soon to replace the old one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eureka Sanitaire","review":"This canister vac is very powerful, and the canister is easy to carry. The attachment hose is pretty long, and the straight tube attachment is very nice, metal. It has the usual nozzle assortment, the main one (shown) has retractable hard bristles. One downside is the unit gets hot pretty quickly. Also, it is louder than I expected from the description. But I am very satisfied with its performance and glad I bought it, it works better than some much more expensive models I've tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible to manuver on carpet!","review":"This vacuum is horrible to manuver on carpet. Suction was great for laminate, but jumped terribly as moving along carpet. Got hot so fast, I was afraid it would start a fire. Won't ever buy again.

Great customer service, huh?!?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money.","review":"This is the 2nd vacuum I bought within a year based on very high rate by Amazon users and AGAIN I am DISAPPOINTED. First of all I read a few reviews that it can vacuum rugs and thin carpet well. I am going to disagree. It is well below average. Very annoying as well. Since the tip of the suction doesn't have wheels to roll. It doesn't move smoothly on rugs or carpets. It just simply sucks and you just keep on pulling. Doesn't suck up dog hair that well either. As far as using it on hardwood floors and tiles. Yes, it flows smoothly on it but WHY would I want to carry this CLUNKER around making noise when I can just easily use a very soft asian style broom that I can easily buy at any asian market for under $10 and quickly brush away debris off the floor? This thing vacuums but it's more annoying than its worth. I guess this is going to the Salvation Army as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"Worked ok in the first 3 months I had it, although the suction was not what I expected. Now, even with a new bag and nothing blocking the hose, it will not pick up anything. You go over the same spot multiple times and nothing happens - even on bare hardwood floors. Have taken to vacuuming without the stick. Looking for a new vac."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing pro","review":"While this is a very powerful vacuum it has a design defect verified by the service representative. The wheels on this vacuum - and the replacement vacuum we received - do not turn on their own. Only when you physically move them will they work. This is a wonderful product if you wish to utilize the shoulder strap and carry it. Otherwise this becomes a very recalcitrant puppy that you have to drag along and scratch your wood floors. This is best on a carpet as there is no problem dragging it. We would suggest its cousin for less money the Eureka which we understand from the service center does not have this design defect. If you opt for the professional product the service center suggested placing large heavy duty rubber bands on the wheels - which did work well. We suggest purchasing a large amount of these rubber bands as they do not last long.

At first I loved this powerful little machine, but now, I've got to find a replacement.

Still works well on the other areas of the house though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good little machine","review":"So far (about 1 month) like it very much. It is powerful and works well on my hardwood floors as well as the rugs. Decent job on carpets too. It is very lightweight and easy to move around the house. On the negative side, the idea of putting the electrical cord on the bottom of the cleaner combined with the idea of attaching the tools to the rear is somewhat awkward and is not very convenient. All in all very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I owned the old mighty mite about ten years ago and gave it away because I didn't think it was being used enough. After I added a parrot to our menagerie I needed a good portable vacuum, so I purchased this unit after much research.It doesn't compare to the old unit for suction or low sound levels. It would be okay for light cleaning or vacuuming cobwebs, but it is not good for pet hair or the clutter surrounding a bird cage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Main attachment falls off, hate this vacuum!","review":"I ordered this vacuum because of the great reviews. What no one seems to mention is that the heavy attachment that gets used 90% of the time falls off during use multiple times.The device on the hose near your hand, which controls air flow has pinches my hand because it will close over it.This vacuum is heavy, does not maneuver well, and is my least favorite vacuum since my last Electrolux, which finally died due to overheating.This product is not made for a petite woman. I am being hassled about returning it to the vendor. And the shipping price is ridiculous. I feel like someone stole 100 dollars from my already tight budget.Do not buy this vacuum!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of power but seems a little flimsy","review":"Bought the COMMERCIAL version of this canister vacuum because it is similar to the last canister vac we had. That one lasted about 6 years and worked well except that the rear wheels both broke just as they broke on the one before that. It was a Mighty Mite I believe. The wife is not that hard on her appliances and only uses them for the house. I am hoping this one will prove to be more durable. However, I noticed that while the Electrolux has plenty of power, the shell of the vacuum is very thin. If you hold your hand over the nozzle while in use, the sides SUCK IN. The extendable wand is metal is seems to be very high quality as are its attachments. The long power cord is nice but is a pain to wind up under the vacuum. Wished it was retractable. Looking to see how well this one compares to the last we had. All in all, I think it will work out pretty well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannister vac","review":"I am really enjoying my commercial quality Electrolux. This is a great lightweight highly efficient vac. I had a similiar vac before but this one has a more powerful suction, a very flexible but non kinking hose. You can actually empty the disposable bag at least one time for reuse. Great product and I highly recommend this. ron"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little power house","review":"After a disappointing experience with a bagless canister from dirt devil, I have learned my lesson; If u want real suction power u need a bagged canister. This vacuum looks a little cheesy and it is super light, so at first u may think it won't do it's job. However, once u turn this baby on u will be convinced. I use the extension brush to clean the sofa, furniture and more. I live in a small apartment with my husband, but no dogs or kids. For us it is perfect, because u can get in all the nooks and crannies, underneath the couch etc. If u have huge ground to cover, u may want to stick with an upright. If u are worried about replacing the bags; amazon sells them and I have used the same bag four times. It is not like u have to change it every time u use the vacuum.

I guess, any story is told with a degree of bias but this doesn't seem excessive and she paints a good picture of the various sides to his character and relationships. You get a clear insight into the early days of the Beatles, his relationship with Cynthia and some idea of the dynamics in his relationship with Yoko.

How could a woman from a seemingly solid, loving family make such a hash of her life? John hit her, cheated on her, took a ten-day vacation in Spain and left her at home with a newborn baby, traded in her car, hired a friend to follow her and possibly entrap her in adultery, and still she wanted a relationship with him? She follows this folly by marrying a succession of men who are probably after the fortune they assume she has. Then she opens a bistro and hires a mentally ill friend as a staffer. She plans a memorial concert (why??? after all JL did to harm her and her son???) but then spoils it by telling her archenemy and known snake about it. Can anyone really be that naive? It's a fascinating inside view of one woman's denial of the reality staring her in the face.

It really let you see what the early days were like from Cynthia's perspective. As for John, well I'll say this: I'm a huge Lennon fan from the time I was a kid. He was the coolest, the best singer, the funniest, I wept at his memorial in Central Park. But without reading biographies just the fact that it was publicly known he didn't treat Julian so well, I realized at a young age that the message and the actions were a contradiction. Kind of a disappointment but none the less my fault for not realizing artists are human--not the icons we make them out to be. So although it is a sad story of what John was going through (let's face it he had some baggage) no one can deny he was a talented, fantastic, charismatic musician."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, Insightless, Generic Account of Beatles Story","review":"This book will be disappointing if you're looking for anything other than an account of the Beatles story that's been told many times before. Much of the book is not even about Cynthia or any insights she might have, but a retelling, not even first hand, of aspects of John and the Beatles that any self-respecting fan would already know. When it does go into first-hand account it is as general and vague as can be. For instance when she says Pete is quiet, but George always had a quick-witted reply to John...would have been good to have given at least one example.For a good book about the early years that gives specifics I'd recommend The Man who Gave the Beatles Away by Alan Williams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whining and repetitious","review":"Isn't the saying \\"you can't be a doormat unless you lay down\\" ?

While Julian and Cynthia's frontmatter promises that Cynthia was more than the marginal character she's been portrayed as in various media over the decades, she immediately goes on to explain how she suffered in squalor \\"for John's career.\\" She portrays herself as John's foundation, yet offers no proof. He was always gone. She was a victim of her timidity, of John, of Epstein, of Mimi---and she herself offers the evidence throughout. She allowed herself to be marginalized; a real shame.I feel sorry she did not stand up and demand better treatment.

This was promoted as Cynthia finally telling the whole story but there is absolutely nothing new here even for someone with only a passing interest in the Beatles story. Cynthia wastes page after page re-telling well-known stories without even adding the insight that her perspective might hold. The worse part though is the never-ending whining that just gets worse and worse as the book goes on. Poor Cynthia and poor Julian. If Cynthia is to be believed, John is responsible for everything that ever went wrong in either of their lives, including all her failed marriages. Oh, but she's not bitter! Right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old Cynthia","review":"Yes, there is some new material.

He's Just Not that into You."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting. Cynthia seems like a sweetheart","review":"I enjoyed this book. I really have a soft spot for Cynthia. John Lennon was a jerk and an idiot in my opinion. He gave up a great gal for nasty Yoko. Cynthia sounds like a good woman to put up with his crap.

I just want to add that I loved it and would recommend it. I practically devoured this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"John & Cyn","review":"The reason for the poor rating on my review, is not that I found fault with the writing or the story. I did not. I was very disappointed that the Kindle version did not include any of the photos that were such an important part of the tale. Had I known this, I would not have purchased this version. When the author has chosen to include photos, it should be understood that they are important to the telling. The book itself was very interesting, but obviously would have been greatly enhanced by the photos that were chosen to be included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing coverage of key topics","review":"This book covers a broad range of topics, some relevant to video and audio coding, some not (e.g. digital filters, Fourier transform, phase locked loop !). Key topics such as motion estimation and compensation are not clearly described. The information on the MPEG standards is disappointing, by my reckoning less than 1/3 of the book actually deals with MPEG. There is no mention of MP4 profiles/levels or MP4 systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK read","review":"I'm not sure what I expected from this book.

The book's unique title and Oklahoma setting (where I once lived) attracted me to the book. Farm wife and mother Alafair is a very appealing heroine and though I never quite got all of her nine living children totally straight most of the other minor characters are also well developed. The book has an authentic flavor of rural Oklahoma from the \\"down home\\" cooking to the speech patterns. The mystery is solid (though my eyes may have glazed over a bit when it concerned guns) and though I guessed the real murderer well before the book's end I didn't predict the full circumstances surrounding it. I am glad to see Ms. Casey has all ready published the second in the series of Alafair's detective adventures (HORNSWOGGLED) and according to her web site a third will be published this fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I enjoyed reading The Old Buzzard Had It Coming. It was even more interesting to me since I am from a neighboring area in Oklahoma and could recognize most of the references and was able to visualize the towns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great characters, excellent storyline","review":"This mystery is a bit different than most murder mysteries in that, there is no chain-smoking, insomniac of a PI chasing leads to find a killer. While the title is funny, the story involves very likable people and an interesting plot to find the murderer. I found the book fast paced, the mystery to be a real mystery that does not hint as to who the murderer is and moves along quickly. I love relatively short, easy to read books with likable characters. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes light mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, that is a wonderful garden","review":"My garden will never be as large as that, although the video gav me some great ideas for my garden."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little book with Big Heart","review":"The authors have taken a small subject and written an entertaining, thorough, incredibly well-thought out and well-designed volume. It's very useful, because it both talks about the realities of reading to the wee (news flash: they're as likely to eat the book as listen, but READ ANYWAY...and here's why), and then goes on to make recommendations depending on subject your looking for (books about feelingimaginary friends, lovies, getting a new brother/sister, and every other subject of concern to the two and under set.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This!","review":"This DVD will not play on USA players or computers.

I can't say this for other readers, but for me, it ain't tensing enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"off to a good start","review":"I'll have to agree that when Stackpole left FASA a LOT of the magic when with him. There are several talented authors still write in the BT story line such as Keith, Charrette and others. ROC is putting a word limit on the books now, so that's hurting the story line & characters.I gave it 4 stars because it's his first Battletech book and there's always room for improvement. Yes the characters could have had a bit more depth in them and it could have been a little longer, but ROC sets the limit. Against it was a solid story line that needs some polishing done.I'd like to see Mike Stackpole back writing more Battletech!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Character-driven action","review":"Even the best action scenes in the world mean little if you don't care about the characters involved, or if you don't understand the meaning of the conflict. That's not a problem here--well-drawn characters go at each other in battles where the personal stakes are high. The characters draw you in, and once you're in this book, you race toward the climax.The main reason for giving this book four stars is that it's the author's first novel--I need to leave room in case the author gets even better in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let there be mercy","review":"Bow, how interesting.When I bought this book I hoped to get some new plots about the uprising in the Lyran empire. Well, I was disappointed. The storyline is very thin. Mechwarrior of the Novacats meets vision and changes. In the end he appears to be the silent hero. That there is a reference in the end to the mechwarrior series says enough about this book. The good storylines are finished. This was defenitely the last Battletech book I bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"The magic is gone","review":"The severe blow that was dealt when Michael Stackpole left this series is still apparent. The latest books lack depth of character, plot and intrigue. Path of Glory only typifies this. The protagonist seems destined for a change of heart from the moment he is introduced. The Nova Cat Khan who potentially could be a great new charismatic leader in the Battletech Universe is watered down dissappointingly to say the least. A certain Clan invades the Draconis Combine and it is described as an afterthought. In my opinion, the only reason to read this book is to stay up to date on the Clans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the BattleTech love?","review":"It isn't here. Ever since Stackpole stopped writing for FASA, the whole BattleTech series has gone down the tubes. Incomplete story lines, unfinished characters, leaps of judgement by supposed rock solid characters, etc. This book is yet another example that the story line in the BTech universe is wavering like a California quake.Without preamble we learn that Clan Nova Cat is the target of every clan, they are seeking its destruction. This was never introduced. You get 3 pages of explaination. Minubo Kurita is adopted into the clan. When did this take place? And on and on. Hopefully the BTech universe will get a pickup some time down the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty much worthless","review":"You could not learn Gujarati in a year with this book. It does not teach conversational Gujarati but instead teaches how to read Gujarati script. Even my girlfriend, a native Gujarati speaker, laughed at this book. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid album, but beware","review":"I ordered this album here recently, and it is a Japanese import, but it's not in a digipak miniature sleeve, and I don't know when this version was released. It is not state of the art remastering; it sounds a bit thin and high-end heavy. It's a standard jewel case with a simple insert that reproduces the original LP cover. A separate insert is a plain white paper folded to a 5X5 that has the lyrics printed in Japanese and English. Looks pretty cheesy but I'm glad to have it. Just beware if you get this version you will probably be disappointed. At this price, I'm not going to reorder it, and I am keeping what I have. Naked Songs is very hard to find on LP, so I'm just going to be satisfied.As far as the music goes, Al never put out a duffer. There's some selections here that rank among his best. It's probably his weakest solo LP, but still worth hearing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've never written a review before but felt compelled to do so after assembling this product. This product is not well made which explains the low cost. The metal is very thin. When assembling the various pieces, the holes did not match up to allow the screws to thread in. After struggling to assemble, the chairs were wobbly when placed on a hard floor. The screws to attach the chair pads are too short. The instructions are poorly written as well. I don't think it will last long. It would be much better to charge $20 more and improve the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't recommend unless you're on a tight budget.","review":"I think this is a decent set for the price, but it's not quality by any means.The instructions with this set are horrendous and hard to follow.My set was missing a table leg. When the leg was replaced I noticed that one of the \\"chain\\" pieces on for the table was broken. Although I got a replacement leg rather quickly, I gave up on that point with the chain. It looks fine enough without it. The chains, too, are not free hanging, but molded in shape.

'The book chronicles Johnny's truly amazing career in a writing style that captures the broadcaster's passion for all sports and love of the Boston Celtics.I found it amazing that Johnny Most was such a huge part of the Celtics that a number of players complained that he never received a championship ring.The authors, Mike Carey and Jamie Most, pointed out various classic stories which few Celtics fans---even the diehard ones---probably weren't aware of.I enjoyed this book tremendously. I bought it because I thought it would be interesting to read about Most's famous calls. However, the book was not just a rehash of his Celtics broadcasts. It was a fresh look at both Most as a person and his relationships with players, refs, owners, fans and his own family.Even the pictures were excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"She does it again!","review":"Louise Hay has again captured the essence of the simple, yet profound, thoughts that aid in the most basic of self-esteem lessons for our minds.

If you're unfamiliar with Christina Cox, I am writing to tell you DO NOT form an opinion of Christina's appeal from the DVD cover illustration shown. She is just beautiful with a very individual look- not the model type- but \\"real world\\" good looks. I cannot understand how her picture, and the whole green DVD cover, got by.

I used this in combination with Kathy Smith's Kickboxing video to get a total body workout and toner. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that it has very little lower body work.

Great job, Kathy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work-out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I had this video before the whole tae bo craze came out. It is definitely a great work-out, easy to follow moves & you definitely build strength while losing weight. The tape is split up into different sections so if you want to work up to one level & stop, you can or you can keep going. It will definitely test your endurance. I have a whole new respect boxers.

If you want a boxing workout, go with Tae Bo or Kathy Smith's Kickboxing workout.The first thing I did't like about this tape is that she doesn't instruct it! She merely participates as the boxer champion on the cover leads the exercise program. The audio/visual display was also awful. Another thing this tape lacks is inspiration and motivation, perhaps because there was no fun in it. :(There are some postives about this workout. One, it's intense and really gets your heartrate up. Two, the jump roping sections are really tough. I consider myself an intermediate/advanced exerciser and couldn't use a jump rope in this section. It was tough enough ACTING like I had a jump rope in my hand!I was so unhappy with this video that I sold it at an auction 2 months after I purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good scense of fun","review":"I enjoy this workout for their scense of fun. Okay, it's a bit corny at times. Kathy Smith takes a back seat for most of the workout.

It's a good workout to mix into your routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment and Boring","review":"This video is boring compared to the TaeBo workout videos I own.

Then the rest is about skipping, and while you can do it without a rope, you're still jumping, which is NOT good if you only do low impact! Somehow I missed this fact in the many reviews I read.Also, the camera work is incredibly annoying. I don't need to see smiling faces when I'm working out -- but whole bodies, so I can learn the postures and footwork!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Off the Beaten Path - no cheerleaders here....","review":"Kathy Smith (who I usually totally groove on) is superfluous to this video. She is just another class member, which is fine because she is a fitness instructor, not a boxer. Michael Olajide darn fine job, sans Kathy. The tape does take some getting used to. There is a lot of 'tricky' photography and editing, which can make following along difficult, but once you learn what to expect it is a fun and challenging workout. It might be difficult fo beginningers - it is a good supplement to an already active workout regime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"It's kind of nice to see Kathy Smith working in tandem with someone else. I did the warm up of this video, which was fine, but when I got into the core of the video, I realized this one was not for me. It included a lot of fast bouncing & movement on the toes, and a lot of jump-roping. My knees were sore from a previous workout, and I knew this workout was going to be hard on my knees & I'd be feeling it as lower back pain that persisted for a few days as well as knee pain if I finished the tape.

No, to the contrary. Do not read this book. As it goes along, it steadily worsens, to the point of being a parody of itself. The character development is non-existent, the plot is lame, and the writing, which actually starts out in the first chapter with a small amount of promise, degenerates into drivel. For example, near the end of the book, the following: \\"They took tea together, the old woman and her guests, the two most formidable executioners in the world.\\" And then, to end the book, this quote, about the main character of the novel and his newly found assassin lover (with whom he has had ever-so-touching sex on a pile of dead bodies): \\"All Rawhead knew was that he had found his woman. Now they would love and kill together. The loving had spanned many lifetimes.

It would have been a brilliant decision if it wasn't 95 degrees out the day they were delivered. Needless to say my Jelly Babies were basically just....Jelly.

I was ravenously hungry at first, but the copious amounts of water recommended as well as the daily snacks took the edge off.After the first month, I wasn't as hungry, I was acutally satisfied with the portions allotted. Sometimes, because of all the water I didn't even feel like eating and had to push myself to make up the minimum calories.I stopped when I reached my goal weight, and then I actually had to work to gain a little weight back because I was too skinny. I gained about 15 lbs in the (almost) three years since I did the program. I'm looking to get back into shape again, but I don't think I'll use this program, the emphasis on calories is annoying and the work-out regimen is too intense. I think I'll stick with something that works better for long-term maintenance."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed so hard!","review":"I have been a fan of Ellen since I first saw the Ellen sitcom! She is a non-stop make you laugh woman! Her newest DVD from HBO continues to capture Ellen at her best. She talks and jokes about things that ANYONE could relate to. I got to laughing so hard that the tears came out! You will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was in the floor from laughing so hard!","review":"This is my favorite Ellen DVD. If you don't see yourself in it & laugh out loud, then you have NO sense of humor. She is just plain funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellen rocks my world!","review":"\\"Here and Now\\" can be summed up in one word: TRIUMPH. Brilliant comic timing mixed with some of life's smallest annoyances make for one great performance. Check out Ms. DeGeneres - she's hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXTREMELY FUNNY!","review":"I rented this dvd and I couldn't stop laughing. It was so good, I bought it. Her jokes on real life situations are so funny, it is hard not to laugh. I watched it over 20 times and it still makes me laugh. It's a must-buy for all you comedy fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shamefully below par","review":"As much as I like Ellen DeGeneres, I realise that her stand-up acummen is not as good as her acting and hosting. She was woefully out of form on the evening of the filming. The lack of humour in her stories is quite disappointing. she tries hard to extract laughs from an enthusiastic audience, but the result is disappointing. The dvd has its moments but they are very few and far between. It was a waste of my money and I intend to sell it.I can't see how anyone could rate this above 2 stars. You'll do well to give this a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Don't Get It","review":"Would people find Ellen as funny if she was straight? I give her two stars since she doesn't use the shrieking obscenities I hear from other prominent female comedians, but she just hasn't said anything I find that funny.I thought Rosie O'Donnell had more edge but was only a middling talent herself.But as lesbian talk show hosts, they conquer America.I just don't get it.(And I'm not sexist: I liked Elaine Boosler and loved Carol Leifer)."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great comedy special 4.5 stars","review":"What I like about Ellen Degeneres is that she doesn't need to use a lot of cussing to be funny. Unlike comedians like Adele Givens, Margaret Cho, Mo'Nique, Sommore, Chris Rock, Bruce Bruce, etc., she doesn't need Cuss the audience out or constantly talk about sex. She can still be halarious without being dirty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Hilarious","review":"She nails it. From Popcorn, to talking on the phone, to the bathrooms--everything is right on the money.I've always been a fan of Ellen DeGeneres and was fortunate enough to receive both of her comedy specials on DVD in the same week. Both managed to make me smile, but \\"Here and Now\\" is great. In a few months, I'll pick it up and watch it again. Her facial expressions, her commitment, her style--she truly is one of the best stand-up comics around. I only hope we get to see more of her.If you like Ellen, you will not be disappointed by this DVD. Buy it! Add it to your collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Here and Now","review":"Family-worded but hilarious!

Jackson's training is not limited to literature, and his engineering background is evident in his structural/functional view of literary theory. This is a great springboard for investigation into the work of de Saussure, Barthes, Levi-Strauss, and Derrida, with reading lists presented at the end of each chapter to guide further inquiry. An emphasis is placed on primary theoretical texts, rather than the interpretations of later theorists.The series is followed by a work on Marx, entitled The Dematerialization of Karl Marx, and a (yet to be published) volume on Freud, tenatively entitled The Descientification of Sigmund Freud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Textbook Purchase","review":"The textbook was exactly as described and was received in a timely fashion.

I bought it for the song GOODBYE that is so awesome on The Crow Stairway to Heaven, but ended up in love with the whole CD, It looks so out of place in my collection next to Slayer, Mayhem, SlipKnoT, As I Lay Dying, and GG Allin but hey it's there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little book!","review":"Taking a historical look at the stories behind favorite Christmas songs, the authors manage to tell stories that are both moving and interesting. Hearing the facts behind carols like \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem\\" and \\"We Three Kings\\" help give the songs context when listened to, and reading about the tragically short life of carol composer Alfred Burt inspired me to search out the original recordings of his music.Arranged so you can search thematically (Songs about Snow, Songs from Broadway and Hollywood, Kids' Favorites, etc.), you are certain to find out facts you never knew about your favorite holiday songs.Great for someone who loves Christmas carols--American history--or both. It's easy reading that will have you spouting interesting facts at your next family gathering!"},{"rating":"1","title":"watch this book, dont take the answers for granted!","review":"I agree with michel that there are a lot of mistakes in the book.

I just downloaded the Kindle version as a refresher, and would like to extend my thanks to previous reviewers for the inaccuracy warnings. However, I figured it would still be useful as a brush-up guide.I would like to add another note to the discussion, which is that the Kindle edition is full of spelling errors. \\"Camber\\" is now apparently \\"Chamber\\", and instead of leading edge slats, we now have \\"slots\\"....

It definitely will not appeal to everyone, it's a little bit of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia meets South Park. The premise of the show is that the two guys are human guinea pigs for a company called Testico and whatever drug they end up testing usually ends up bad for them.

Too low brow? What the heck? It's raw and vulgar, yeah, but sometimes that's what you need. Maybe not all of you, but enough to make the DVD release critical.The DVD only suffers slightly from a couple of quality issues, but we're probably all a bit jaded by BD and HD and overly critical of now inferior formats.The webisodes were good, if maybe bit self indulgent and occasionally long winded. I don't care; I watched them all. So will you, even if you don't admit it to your mom."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big improvement on the DVD","review":"This was a savage war and few really good docos have appeared on it. This was first released on DVD and I assumed the Blu-ray would just be a technical upgrade. Not a bit of it, it has been substantially re-done with maps and much additional information. This must now be the best available doco on this war and I enjoyed it very much.

I couldn't tell if the artist was LUSH or STEREOLAB as the lead singer has quite a similar voice. A lot of the reviews say \\"Apartment Life\\" is the best, but I found that the album was good but a little too moody for me and slower paced. Dominique Durand's voice is very hazy and moody and the faster paced songs on \\"Realistic\\" create a good balance. Thus, I decided to go for this album, which is their first one and rock's out a bit more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voices for mercy in an era of violence","review":"This film does not fit into a neat category of good guys vs bad guys. You are given the opportunity to meet several people who live in Israel and deplore the current Nationalist fervor and Intolerance manifest by a small number of Israeli politicals as well as a minority of terrorists from abroad. The film is a plea for dealing with mercy and kindness, rather than setting up an Israeli police state. I believe it gives a fair and open hand at the materials presented. It is not the Israel of nostalgia and Children's color books, but rather a vision gone astray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arafat is smiling","review":"This video is a tour de force of liberal, left-wing propaganda.

It seemed wobbley on the metal rod and I was upset. It costs $9.99 + $4.99 shipping. I called the company and was told I had put too much sand on it. How can a 2yr old put measure how much sand to use on a toy? I was told to ship it back to get another one which would cost me another $4.99.

It's timeless because I know, even in the current conflicts of today, soldiers and leaders need to make moral decisions. Technologies change but people do not change.I also like the language of this book. So many books today don't bring in the internal element, the pain of decision and bring you in psychologically. This work does. It's not the same but that feeling reminds me of The Red Badge of Courage.Every decision, every righteous seeming move carries even more painful choices.Although the author does end the story without bringing in the greater context.

Thinking all was ruined and had to be replaced was upsetting. Upon rewashing (minus the Marmot FlashpointJacket) the yellow dye came out. Still my whites and light colored fabrics were left dingy. In this day and age colors to run is usually the unexpected, especially, with a product such as this. As a precaution, wash by hand separately and let it hang dry, you still have to be careful with the \\"drip dry\\" in terms of what fabric you use to catch the drip. Laying down a light colored towel or bathmat would not be a good idea as these will get discolored.I bought 2 of the identical jackets at Christmas time. One as a gift, and the other for me.

The DVD is great. The images are a little murky, but that's due to the film's budget. The extras are OK. For the part about it being banned in 31 countries, I can see why. The violence, especially that committed toward animals is graphic, despite some killings that are obviously fake, which is obvious in many Italian horror movies. The movie is good, but can get borish a little bit. The dubbing of course is not great. Some of the dubs don't match the tone of the actors. The best role has to go to John Morgen. Any role he does grab attention. Having him as the villian brings life to the story. This movie is one of the best to come out of the Italian horror movie genre. If you want to catch other ones, try to see The Beyond, Cannibal Apocalypse, and Zombie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good extras for a good movie","review":"The DVD is good for its extra features though the commentary by the director Umberto Lenzi is sometimes hard to understand because of his english level.When you see it for the very first time, it is really disgusting specially if you think that all the animal killing scenes were actually shoot without any special effects.

I'd pass on this and look for \\"Cannibal Holocaust\\" with the native girl impaled, it's much better for sex sleaze (though it's only a two star, way too much muddy nudity - like, real mud).

I first watched Cannibal Holocaust and then heard about this movie, so I thought it would be just as good from what I heard, but it is no where near. The animal killing in this movie is hard to watch, just like all animal killing is, and I didn't buy this movie for that, but that's basically all this movie as to offer.

The meter must be set to 1000!","review":"Cannibal Ferox has to be one of the most overrated exploitation/cannibal films ever. The most revolting part of this movie was the acting - poor to say at the least. Not that I purchased the DVD for the acting, because that would be absurd, I purchased it because of all the hype around it. I can tell you it wasn't banned in 31 countries for the cannibalism, nudity and graphic violence; because there wasn't much - it was probably banned for the real life slaughtering of animals ! Not a bad movie if your cable is out. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie's got \\"guts\\"","review":"For the movie itself, I give it 3 stars, but the creative gore scenes bring it up to a 4. I've seen a lot of gory movies, but this surprised me. never have I seen a guy get the top of his head chopped off and the brains eaten out, totally in your face, gore bonanza!!!! Ferox also features one of the most disgusting scenes in movie history, a guy's stomach is ripped open and the cannibals pull out his guts, intestines, internal organs, etc. and devour them, this is hardcore...not for the squemish. It may have been \\"the most violent movie ever\\" in 1981, but many movies have since outdone it, like Peter Jackson's \\"Dead Alive\\" still, it's worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for DVD aficionados","review":"I'm rather upset with the technical quality of this DVD.

This is certainly not worth the $20+ dollar price tag Amazon.com has right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Those poor cannibals","review":"Be advised, this film has scenes of not-actual cannibalism and not-actual acting, scripting, and directing. Nothing really happens in the movie until it's almost over, except for some poor beasts getting savaged by other less-poor beasts. Go see Cannibal Holocaust or Jungle Holocaust or some other movie with Holocaust in the title. They're much better than this lame coprolite of a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"That other cannibal movie....","review":"This is more of a \\"gorehound\\" film, in that the dialogue is cheesy along with the gore, so you can laugh it off. You can't do that with Cannibal Holocaust, which owns this genre's a**, so to speak. I've seen this film twice, and the first time, it's kind of effective. The dubbing and acting are terrible, but there's a sense of doom to the film, and the gore is pretty intense. But after seeing the 2nd time, and seeing Cannibal Holocaust, Ferox isn't as good as Holocaust, and the flaws it has are more apparent. If you want a cannibal film that really doesn't make you think or challenge you, take this one. If you want a visceral, unforgettable experience with a cannibal film, rent Cannibal Holocaust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Version","review":"Very strong film - with a mixture of sadistic images and scenes, but well handled. This deluxe VHS version is remastered, uncut with loads of goodies (almost like a DVD). The film scores 3 out 5, but the quality of this version pushes it a notch to 4 out of 5. If you're considering watching a 'cannibal' film, make it this one and this version. Excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF TIME!!!!!!!!!","review":"In response to melvin's review. Anyone that buys this type of movie is expecting 1,000 gallons of gore. That's the point! A horror movie surrounded by hype of 98 on the vomit meter is expected to produce buckets of blood and guts. Not every movie has to swim in gore but when they boast about it it should contain a lot more than Cannibal Ferox produced. Real animals are slaughtered everyday for food, just because you don't see it doesn't mean it doesn't happen.As for the movie, it's boring, pointless and down right ridiculous. Horror fans will be extremely disappointed with this piece of trash. Not only is there much better horror movies out there. There are much better Cannibal movies out there like Cannibal Holocaust or Jungle Holocaust. Steer Clear of this overhyped and under delivered movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"\\"Banned in 31 countries\\" is what got me to buy it.

The one scene that sticks in my memory is the snake thatcrushes the life out of the helpless little animal. It seems thisscene last for several minutes. You get to hear the little animal'sscreams, and you are invited to see the life being squeezed out ofit. This 'scene' is one of the most horrific moments on film, and nobody's acting. This is real!!!

I went into this film thinking it was going to be an awsome gore-fest, but I was wrong. Sure there were a few good scenes for all gore lovers to enjoy. Like the hooks through the boobs or the guy getting the top of his head sliced off and his brains eaten. But it is not worth sitting through a lot of boreing dilouge just to watch it. The actors in this film seemed to be slightly retarded, like if you see a dead body in a village of cannibals, why the hell would you decide to stay the night with them? Your just asking to be eaten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Notorious Euro-Trash","review":"Umberto Lenzi's most notorious entry into the \\"Italian Cannibal\\" subgenre is a contender with Cannibal Holocaust with the most bloodshed. Whereas Cannibal Holocaust was a well made exploitation film, Ferox is just a standard Euro-trash film laden with shocking gore moments. A student travels into the deep Amazon with a group of friends to prove here thesis that cannibalism never existed. They of course find evidence to prove this wrong. Our characters meet up with two criminals (tied in with a poorly explained subplot that takes place in New York City) who, guilty by association, get the entire group into sickening torture situations by a vengeful cannibal tribe. As usual, in poor taste, there are some real animal killings. Most of the music was taken from Umerto Lenzi's previous cannibal film Eaten Alive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the Plan 9 of cannibal films","review":"If you must see a cannibal film stick to Cannibal Holocaust. the grindhouse release is well worth the money. However the grindhouse release of ferox is just awful. The picture quality is horrendous. The movie is lacking any redeemable quality. There are a few violent moments, but just a few.

I thoroughly disagree. Cannibal Holocaust, though not as gory, is many times more realistic and could be described as a great film in my book. It actually had a purpose, whereas this film does not. Good gore effects and DVD layout tempt me to give 2 stars, but they really do not add much to an otherwise worthless DVD.For hardcore gore-fans, I actually suggest you purchase this DVD! But for those looking for a good gore-film, look elsewhere *(The Beyond, Cannibal Holocaust, Dead Alive, Evil Dead, and Dawn Of the Dead are my primary recommendations)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am snoring.....zzzzzzzz","review":"This has got to be the most boring, stupid, and non-violent movie ever.

All the pandemonium and ingenuity of this film can be summed up in one simple line: \\" (After a television broadcast threatening to destroy the world and interrupting an important baseball game airs) Call the FBI, the CIA, and the pentagon! Find out who won the game!\\" The concept of the unexpected shines through every glorious gag, every fantastic folly, in the pinnacle of the \\"Pink Panther\\" series.

But that's a priceless Steinway!...Not anymore\\" as well as Clousseau's visit to the Octoberfest where two assailants both miss Clousseau and kill each other in the bathroom. Every supporting actor (the guys who played President Gerald Ford and Henry Kissinger were superb) was believable and set up the scenes so well for the bumbling Clousseau.

Happily, \\"The Pink Panther Strikes Again\\" (1976) surpasses its predecessor in comic invention and production value. This time around, Sellers' immortal Inspector Clouseau must stop the insane Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) from destroying the world - not an easy task when the ex-boss calls for international assassins to eliminate the bumbling French detective. Edwards and Sellers make the most of this outlandish premise with several hilarious set pieces, highlighted by Clouseau's eventual penetration into Dreyfus' Bavarian castle. Slightly sadistic at times, but a comedy classic nevertheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album of the Year","review":"How to describe this music? I'd say: Brian Wilson meets the Beatles.

That was a mistake.These knives are the cheapest-looking utensils I have ever seen. The handles are made of what appears to be hollow plastic that weighs nothing at all. The blade is unbelieveably thin and wiggles back and forth. Even the cutting edge is not that sharp, except for the point, which is like a needle. They are packaged so poorly in their own box that during shipping all of the knives shifted and were poking through the cardboard.I would expect to see these in the dollar store--that's how bad they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very bad Shostakovich violin concerto performance","review":"Miss Sonnenberg performance of Shostakovich Violin concerto n.1 is one of the worse I have ever heard.Just listen to the third movement, Passacaglia, how slow and artificial is the phrasing. In all the concerto there is a poor sound in the lower strings and, as frequently happens with young violinists, a sforzando on the higher strings.The last movement is a confused race towards the chaos.Better going back to David Oistrakh and Aldo Ferraresi performances and forget about this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I say!","review":"The mysteries being written for children are a tad easy to figure out and the language is a bit too jolly for me.

It was a 5 star book when I read it. But after travelling to AK and actually meeting people who know Leo, I find myself very disappointed. Suffice it to say he is a bit of an exaggerator. Like- didn't really climb Denali alone. Had a lot more help than he admits. Treated Melissa poorly at best. Having thus lost respect for him as a person and author, the book becomes less inspirational. But, it got me to Alaska, and Alaska itself kept me here, so that's worth a couple stars right? : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent compilation","review":"A couple really good movies and a lot of 'B' movies.

The cards are very colorful and have a modern mixed media feel to them. NOTE: There are a lot of cards with naked men and women, so if that makes you uncomfortable, then consider other decks. But these cards really do provide a lot of mental stimulus with which to divine inspiration and wisdom.The accompanying book has really incredible explanations of the cards. Each description is written in a different style according to the nature of the card. Some descriptions begin with short original poems. Each suit begins with a poem about the element (fire/air/water/earth). The author did an incredible job.I recommend this deck to anyone who is comfortable with the human form on a card."},{"rating":"2","title":"great general overview of the medium","review":"Anyone into horror comics will love this book.

Outstanding!","review":"I reviewed this book for Gotta Write Network and was so impressed with it that I nominated it for their Marley Award in the mystery category.The author hooked me with the first couple of pages and I could not put the book down. It is a massive book; yet, I read it completely in one sitting. I just had to know how it ended.Arquette interweaves several subplots to give you multiple mini-stories within the one major story. He keeps you either laughing yourself silly or biting your nails. This is writing to the extremes and a treasure of entertainment! Get it today.His next book, \\"Seeing Red,\\" will be released soon. Watch for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appallingly Bad","review":"I can't believe this even made it into print. The Big Surprising Plot Twist is telegraphed on page twelve, the book is riddled with typos (he misspells his own characters' names, for goodness sake!), the characters are so shallow I didn't really care whether they died, and the only good idea in here is ripped off from Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash. And what's the deal with loudly proclaiming that Lois Duncan edited it? She certainly didn't do a very good job. Arquette should probably stick to writing poorly-worded letters to Penthouse; that's basically what this reads like. Except that even the sex isn't any good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mutter-out-loud awful","review":"Wow...this book is terrible. From the painfully hackneyed cliches to the bothersome plot (complete with characters who add nothing to the novel), this book is awful. It does offer some Mystery Science Theater-esque value, but it's still not worth buying. The good news: if you do waste money on this book, it'll be over quickly. Only took me about 3 hours to finish. But, really...go take a knitting class, get your teeth cleaned, spend time with your kids, watch bad reality shows on TV.

It doesn't compare at all to Blueprints for the Black Market or Never Take Friendship Personal. If you're going to get any of Anberlin's albums, buy the earlier stuff. It will hold your attention better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like their other albums.","review":"What happened to the rock that Anberlin used to provide? I loved their rock songs like Change The World, Cadence, Paperthin Hymn, and Feel Good Drag, but the only rock this one serves up is Godspeed. This pop album may be impressive to someone who's never heard any Anberlin before, but for a longtime fan it's very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best rock CDs in years!","review":"This is my first Anberlin CD and I was blown away. I loved \\"Godspeed,\\" \\"Adelaide,\\" & \\"The Unwinding Cable Car,\\" to name a few. These songs are catchy and very well written, as well as very well produced. Stephen Christian has a very unique voice that I happen to love! This CD gave me similar feelings to when I heard Switchfoot's \\"The Beautiful Letdown.\\" I look forward to Anberlin CD's to come and think I will probably have to look into their previous CDs...anybody have any suggestions which Anberlin CD I get next???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD of the year, so far","review":"The best album I have purchased this year. The catchiness never lets go for the whole cd from (Debut) through (*Fin).Tracks of particular interest are:A Whisper & A Clamour, the first track I heard (on local radio). It grabbed my ears and made me listen.The Unwinding Cable Car, something about the melodies and harmonies on this track really gets me.(*Fin) Probably my favorite track. This is an epic piece of music that closes the cd with greatness. Or maybe I'm just a sucker for boy choirs.If you like emo music that's not simply emo music and is even a bit positive at times then go right ahead and click this cd into your shopping cart. You will like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"First listen reaction... All the songs sound the same to me... seems like all the songs were written in an hour or two. Were all the songs in the same key? Message too murky for my Christian taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vastly underrated. A real treat to listen to.","review":"I started listening to Anberlin when a few of their songs got tossed into my Rise Against station on Pandora. Overall I would characterize this music as Rise Against at 70% intensity (with no profanity). It's moderately hard rock with a punk influence. The songs are well written and there is a nice variety of sounds on this CD.The first and last songs (Debut and Fin respectively) are a bit weak relative the rest of the album, but they make for nice bookends for the amazing music in between. There is definitely no filler music on this CD. With most albums I get annoyed when a mediocre song follows a great one. On this album I can listen to it straight through without getting tired off any of it. Why this band hasn't gotten more radio play is anyone's guess. This stuff is fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORTH THE BUY!","review":"So I bought this CD because, like most who have heard their first album, I love Anberlin. The only negative I can say about this CD is that a few of the songs sound alot like songs on their 1st album. Still though, definatly worth the buy! Oh, and see them in concert if you get a chance.

I'm a traditionalist Catholic who has always seemed theologically ultraconservative. But Fr. Slavany has proved that liberalism had tained my thought about charity, i.e., Christian love. That love requires Catholics to denounce heresy and sometimes even heretics. Blunt denunciation can be charitable becaue it protects people from a heresies and from the proponent of heresies. If it hadn't been for Father Salvany, I probably would have kept believing my misconception about charity.Today, when false ecumenism and other evils fool Catholics into thinking that they ought to be too conciliatory and to believe that non-Catholics have a God-given right to believe heresies, Father Salvany's book is a much-needed cure for liberal opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Hope You Don't Need Warrranty Service","review":"The knife set is ok, but no great deal.

A great part of this is the bamboo box, its perfect for those of us who don't yet have a large knife set and block to add to. The box has a magnetic clasp and looks great. I would definately recommend this as a starter chef's knife set. If you're looking for high quality (high price) though definately spring for the Wustof sets. My only complaint is I wish it came with some kind of sharpener. The complaint that these knives aren't sharp is ridiculous; you need to hone this type of knife for superiour cutting and safety.

But because these are journal articles, the writing style is very simple (with the exception of a couple of them) and easy reading.I can imagine that most of the people will want more articles from the \\"real action\\" of the war but the political analysis (which is the focus of most of the articles) is also an important aspect of every war so this book give me a lot of knowledge about it.I think it would be better if the notes would be printed as footnotes rather than endnotes, this way it would be easy to follow them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too verbose and no excitement in the writing.","review":"As a Vietnam Veteran who was there in 1963 the flavor of the writing was drab and did not convey what was really going on from the perspective of the ordinary GI.

Then one night about three weeks after we got it, we watched a dvd with it hooked to the the television. Froze a couple of times, no real big deal, then we unplugged it, moved it to another room for watching by itself and it started giving us a NO DISC message. It never worked again. Returned it, and exchanged for another unit, five minutes into the DVD, I pressed the menu button, and that was the last that unit worked. We were getting a LOADING message.

He struggled a little with the mouse since you have to point the mouse on specific features and then click after it is highlighted. If your child isn't familiar with using a mouse, you will have to help them until they get the hang of it. But since kids catch on rather quickly, it shouldn't take long.

(In fact, I didn't even get halfway through it.) O'Shea's writing style is such that he writes as he would speak, and it just doesn't seem very polished. O'Shea has an abundance of references, many of which I had knowledge of before finding his book. It might be just as well to look at his reference list and read those books, articles, etc. On the whole, this book seems more like a college student's paper turned into a book. In summary, I think there are better books on the subject of not vaccinating your children, which is the important issue here. My children are not and most likely will not ever be vaccinated, but not because of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Easy To Like When You Already Agree","review":"I find it interesting that that 95% of the reviews are positive, not because the book is good; but it would seem because the reviewers already hold the position that vaccinations are harmful. This is not objective reviewing, this is finding evidence that supports your belief and asking others to accept it as proof. I would give the book a better review if it were an objective dissertation on the topic. However, the author is speaking only from one side and buyer and parent beware. THE ONLY WAY to support your opinion is to challenge it. I encourage you to read books that are pro vaccination, give equal time to each side as well as books on not vaccinating.

In her 50-year career, Peggy Seeger has written many radical songs and put her name to any number of poignant and powerful albums (what's more, she continues to do so), but this one is exceptionally good even by her high standards.

Although there is some great information in the book, it is so poorly constructed both physically and in layout that I doubt it will survive until my daughter is old enough to understand it.

Thomas Lieven, a man with a passion for logical reason, good cooking and beautiful women is forced into the spy business due to no fault of his own. He navigates his way into and out of trouble with the assistance of his cooking expertise, while always seeking to make the world a better place.The novel is based on a true story and an absolute pleasure to read.

Although I wish his editor had caught many of the typos and missing or misplaced words! Those were numerous enough to be distracting. Clarkson's sense for reality is exquisite.

Rogue cop about to lose his pension if he's booted off the force a year before his retirement. His commanding officer assigns him and a cast of equally volatile cops to end the gang wars over an appartment complex. A war ensues between the crack dealers who use the appartment complex as a base and the muslim gang hired by the complex owner to get them out.

I have stored a number of telephone numbers. Also contrary to some of the reviews, I don't think the numbers are that hard to press although I can see some might expect it to be like a computer keyboard - it does take more effort than that.

It doesn't seem that it's marked as being water resistant so I've been careful to not get it too wet. I wash my hands with it on and the little splashes it gets haven't killed it yet, but that's one thing to know.2. It does have a light unlike the more simple basic calculator watch Casio makes, but it's not one of the really bright even blue backlights. It's a little yellow glow from one corner of the screen.

I tried and found I also had difficulty using them and finally helped him shape them by hand.

Not only did the directions lack ANY sense of an 8 year old trying to use it, but both my husband and I were frustrated too! The directions made it look soooo easy, yet they did not include some important points, like how to assemble the arm that makes the chrome shape of the piece. Ooops. My daughter has a lot of patience... But she was a bit annoyed by this product.

First, it is extremely flimsy, and when the clay is placed on the\\"wheel\\" to be spun, there is nothing to anchor the clay. The result is a glob of clay that wobbles when the so-called wheel spins. The attachments that are supposed to \\"carve\\" the clay are ineffective because each time one of the plastic cutters is in place to shape the clay, the clay falls over. There is nothing to which the clay attaches, so it is in free fall the entire time it is on the \\"wheel.\\" Needless to say, I am glad our special girl likes books, because Santa really came through in that area. This pitiful mess of a pottery wheel is trash, and it will find its way there soon.

First off, the instructions are vague as to how to assemble it. You have to refer to the box art.Secondly, the motor is noisy and weak so when the thing is turning and you go to use the shaper wheel the thing will stop. Our unit the foot pedal kept sticking and would not stop.This is a cheap plastic toy that maybe a very young child would like to get their hand dirty with the clay but as an actual craft item it is total garbage. It is a cheap plastic toy and my daughter was very dissapointed and she will be getting a refund.Not sure how anyone could rate this 5 stars. Any vendor selling this item should be ashamed of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"This product is virtually impossible to use.Our 8 year old daughter got this as a gift, and we thought it was a charming toy.IT WASNT!!!!This wheel was very difficult to assemble and most of the instructions are useless and unclear. When we finally got it set up, and at last got the clay into the \\"shaping tube\\", we couldn't get the clay out and had to scrape it with a spoon. Then, we had to shape it by hand.After all of this \\"setup\\" te clay would not stay in the center while the wheel was moving. We didn't even accomplish a lop sided pot, just a hunk of clay that kept falling off the turn table.The wheel's base was adorable, with small cubbies and compartments to put supplies in. Unfortunately we couldn't make a suitable pot to use these handy supplies and decorations.OVERALL, this is the worst toy EVER for a child. It will lower their self-esteem and leave them in tear. Two Harvard graduate adults couldn't even use it. We ended up making pinch pots with the supplied clay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Believe the bad reviews - it broke my daughter's heart that this was one of her Christmas presents","review":"I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. What a mistake. Please believe the bad reviews and do not purchase this product. First, the instructions are abysmal. The instructions begin by putting a fistful of clay into the device. There are no instructions that say what to do next. Common sense would dictate to take it out of the hole and work with it directly on the wheel but when you do so, it rips apart and has other problems. Further, the pictures on the box illustrate large, elaborate pottery that I doubt could be produced on this machine.Kid reaction - my son who was waiting for his turn became frustrated and said, \\"this is a bad toy\\". My daughter who is artistic and who has worked with pottery at school tried to make it work but it was no use. She too had to give up. This toy and bad Christmas present made my daughter sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Grandma","review":"I purchased this pottery wheel for my 9 year old granddaughter who has wanted one for two years - and I did lots of online research to select one that I thought would work well. In my granddaughter's eyes, this is still a fun toy - but to me it is NOT at all what I had hoped. The wheel is weak (I know it's a toy, but it is advertized to work), and the instructions are extremely incomplete (we actually resorted to just looking at the picture on the box). The \\"tools\\" are not effective since the wheel is so weak. I do like the fact that it comes with an AC adapter included. However, I'd really like to see someone make the sample pottery that's pictured on the box on THIS wheel. Unless you find this on a super-cheap sale, I wouldn't recommend buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This was a huge waste of money.

What a headache..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating product -","review":"My daughter and husband just finished trying to use this pottery wheel and we are frustrated and disappointed with how shoddy the wheel is constructed. The instructions are practically worthless. They should include more about how to center the clay and some troubleshooting tips. Once he finally got the clay centered on the wheel and got the motor to run without making hideous grinding sounds, he was able to make one pot and use one shaping tool before the motor appeared to die. He left it at that and my daughter is happily decorating it with the jewels and looking forward to painting it tomorrow. She is still thrilled. Even though we didn't buy it for her, I definitely this product is not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless as a Pottery \\"Wheel\\"","review":"If you manage to get the clay into place on the wheel, which is not easy, once the wheel starts turing,the carving blade simply pushes the clay off center and messes it up. There should be something in the bottom of the wheel to hold the clay in place. In a real wheel, I assume the weight of the clay holds it in place. But this small peice of clay does not have nearly the weight needed to hold it in place as the wheel turns so the clay just goes all over the table rather than being shaved into a circle. The only useful part of this toy is the clay itself, which your child can mold with their hands into whatever shape they want. Then they can decorate it and paint it after it is dry. I suppose that is worth some money, but the \\"wheel\\" part of it is useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS STINKS!!!","review":"I am twelve years old and I got this for Christmas.

I ended up just making a cute little mushroom with my hands and it looks awesome. I tried to do the same thing with the wheel and it ended up as a misshapen lump. So, we sent back the box, directions, wheel, everything except the clay, now in the form of a mushroom pot and I am writing this review as a warning: DO NOT BUY.

This one is similar to their previous effort with a mix of vocal and instrumental songs that cover a wide variety of musical styles. The jam band thing is prominent, but there are also songs here like \\"Miss Tinkle's Overture\\" that are pure progressive rock. The band even throw in a country ballad (actually a duet with an excellent female vocalist) that almost sounds like something Alison Krauss might do. The band feature chops galore as all the instruments are in fine form. The band still seem to have a hard time capturing their live energy in the studio and none of the songs go much beyond the 5 minute mark here, but overall this is a good album that grew on me with repeated listens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick and Demented","review":"I was sick and demented for buying this album.

The painful sounds that emanate from his ham-fisted attempts could only be endured by those with an absolutely tin ear for language, or those possessing the glazed, all-forgiving brain of the hypnotized zealot. There's a reason for Gurdjieff's endlessly convoluted style -- if he presented the useful information in a concise and lucid form, this massive tome would be a mere pamphlet -- one that could not yield the \\"fleecing\\" he required to maintain his lifestyle.

My grandmother also had this disease -- I was the only caregiver for both women. This book explained the disease thoroughly and it's effects on others. Like most mental illnesses, when a person has this, other people tend to avoid the patient, and also the caregiver. You feel isolated and lonely, frustrated and sad. Since the disease gets progressively worse, one of the feelings you experience is grief.

(usually she doesn't like eggs, cheese, or anything green). she also really likes the cheesy lentil sweet potatoes, which blew me away! it has been an incredibly valuable resource when it comes to nutrition information for kids. most of the recipes are pretty bland (low-sodium/low-sugar), but bland is what my kid seems to like. its a really great cookbook, the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because some of the recipes involve a lot of ingrients and take way too long to prepare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I bought this book as a gift for someone who has a toddler. I thought it would provide good ideas for dinnertime meals. I was disappointed when I looked through the book at the recipes. Although some looked very child friendly, such as chicken nuggets and smoothies, some looked like they were more geared towards adults. Sardine bruchetta, walnut pesto,and sweet potatoes with lentils and bacon all sound delicious, but may be more appropriate for the parent's tastes. I was so disappointed about what I read that I couldn't bring myself to give it as a gift even though the book is beautifully put together with great pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"PULP Keeper!","review":"The BEST collection of pulp genre ever.

Unfortunately ths thing is a lemon. The rods that hold the planet were bent so the planets would not line up properly, and would collide if the paths crossed.

Sadly, the kit was missing the connector to attach Venus. I contacted the Educational Insights company twice to ask for that one missing part so my daughter could complete her project (the model is useless without all planets connected). However, Educational Inights failed to respond to either of my requests.

The top that goes over the sun does not snap into place and consequently will not stay on. The star constellation cover has the same issue. It is a nice idea but since the lid will not stay on, you either have to sort of balance it on top and not jostle it, or use some sticky tape to secure the lid. Other than that it works as expected, but my daughter is really sad that she cannot use it as she expected because the lid will not stay put."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"Do not buy. My wife picked this up to teach a lesson for the solar system and shadows. She kept telling me she was having trouble putting in the C sized batteries, so I got home and tried to figure it out myself. They won't fit, at least not with the door closed. I ended up building an AC adapter to work with it for her lesson, but it was very unimpressive. Not something that's going to wow a principal or kids for that matter.It's got a standard C cell flashlight battery for the sun and it's really dim even when dialed into the recommended settings. Once the lesson was over we resolved to never use it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, poor detail, planets all rotate at the same speed","review":"Another case of you-get-what-you-pay for. Cheap quality, planets have so little (or so poorly done) detail that you almost can't tell them apart except for Jupiter and Saturn. My son keeps thinking Earth is Neptune. Also, the planets do NOT rotate at different speeds, which in my mind is a terrible \\"education\\", so for that alone it deserves 1 star. They all rotate together. All you can do is adjust at what diameter around the run the planet should be in, and that's it! Boring. It's also incredible cheap sounding and borders on \\"noisy\\". I did not have problems putting in the C batteries, but for having 4 C batteries I would expect the Sun to be a bit brighter...it's very dim. Overall, I'm very disappointed and will be returning it after I find a better one. If I find something better I will come back and update this post."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of money","review":"This toy is very cheaply made. It uses C bateries but not indicated anywhere in the box ormanuals. The sun is made of two piece cheap plastic that don't fit together properly, so, one part keeps falling off unless you tape it with clear tape. The planets are outside the range of light so there are no useful shadows. The rotation produces a fairly laud motorized sound. Also the bulb burned in less than an hour and the fact that it came with an extra bulb, does mean that you can expect the second bulb to burn in no time as well. Ultimately, this toy is a lame waste of money, a good idea with lausy production from China that really belong to the shelves of a \\"DOLAR STORE\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geosafari Motorized Solar System","review":"This solar system was difficult to put together. I read and reread the instructions before finally finding the symbols that tell you which planets are which and where they go.

I have a feeling this isn't so, but I can't say for sure.Basically, the best thing I can say about NO EXIT is that it was clumsily written. Sartre, whether you agree with him or not, was a great thinker, but from what I've sampled, his fictional writing seems obviously borne of analytical thinking. It's like he's programmed robots to play out the action for us, to convince us of his beliefs.

I found it interesting simply because it was by Sartre. But the interesting premise aside, No Exit is just simply not very profound, and generally poorly done. Seeing it performed might increase my appreciation somewhat, but then again, it might not. The whole play is based around a single philosophical idea -- \\"Other people are hell\\" (or create hell for the individual.)

After this book does not remain stone over stone in the construction of marxist theory. He even said \\"the truth is that I'm not a marxist\\". He was cleverer than his followers, I'm afraid.If anybody wants a book that could help him/her to understand the world he/she lives in, Carl Menger's Grunds?tze (In English Principles on Economics) is a better option. Other options are Human Action, by Ludwig von Mises, Capitalism, by George Reisman and Man, Economy and State, by Murray N. Rothbard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead wrong!!!!!","review":"Reading this book really shows that Marx understood nothing about economy: Prices cannot be fixed objectively according to some cost computation, but depend on how much people want things, of the balance of want and demand. I recommend instead reading book by insightful persons, like Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, Israel Kirzner, etc. Anyway reading Marx explains why all goes wrong in socialist/communist countries, why people become so poor and have so little freedom and rights. The only value of this book may be to take what Marx thinks is good as on the contrary the way things should never been done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Analysis of Capital and Political Economy","review":"Well, many others have already explained in detail the specifics of the book, so I'll only touch on those a little. This book is a critique of the *science* of political economy and a thorough investigation of the capitalist mode of production. Marx does those two things brilliantly...offering up many ideas that still stand today and making predictions that have been eerily accurate.The first two chapters are a bit hard to digest....they force the reader to learn the terminology of neo-classical economics (Marx was shortly post-Smith and post-Ricardo). After that, however, the book flows quite well.On the down side, I believe a more straighforward presentation would have been better. I think Marx delves too deeply into personal examples from industrial England...though a few of them add to the personality of the book. I'm eagerly awaiting to read the 2nd and 3rd volumes of Capital."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this version","review":"Capital Volume 1 is a masterpiece.

You would think the f'ing publisher could have hit the spellcheck button once before publishing, if they just couldn't be bothered to do a read-through first.

If you rented it at the library it may not be so bad, bud it is not worth no $30+. Each video has about sixty minutes on it, and it is filled with reapeating footage, obvious stories, and the rantings of one camera shy historian. What is worse is that, as I was fooled, this does not go in sequence of war (EG- 1964,1965, or the Tet Offensive). All that are in the pack are little tidbits of stuff. You get a movie on the Marines, on the Navy, mostly brown water, and the Viet Cong to name a few. I have read up on Vietnam, and for someone who knows a good amount, you will learn nothing from this set!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great............","review":"I agree with the first guy. This movie pack was not that great. I purchased it hoping to see some actual combat footage (or any footage for that matter) taken from the vietnam war. instead, each VHS which is supposed to specfically target one fighting aspect of the U.S. in vietnam (i.e. the marines, the bombers, the navy, helicopters, etc) just shows the same footage over and over. For instance , every video shows a diving helicopter shooting rockets and B-52s dropping bombs, which is cool the first time you see it but after 10,000 times it gets old and you realized you wasted your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the History Channel instead","review":"This was a boring and put you to sleep series of videos.

As the other reviewer mentioned, the points on Voodoo were a bit off, but I really wasn't too overly concerned enough with those details to look them up at the time.

It builds up wonderfully to prove that everyone's personal failings cause strife and destruction in the world, but eventually even just those failings coupled by the powers and otivations which nurture them eventually save it as well, continuing the ultimate struggle between good and evil, and allowing man to have free will to always choose their own path."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book kicked ***","review":"Yes, a 10. The complexities of this book are amazing, from Covenenant's unthinkable relationship with High Lord Elena; Hile Troy, the blind man who can see in this confounding and beautiful world (who provides the perfect foil to Covenant -- someone who actually believes in what is going on around him); the brilliant telling of a full-scale world war -- this book really has it all. Best of the series, probably the best fantasy book I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book two continues the magic","review":"Stephen R. Donaldson continues his epic fantasy series, The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever, with the second book, The Illearth War. Once again, the anti-hero, Thomas Covenant, has found himself in the Land; and this strange parellel world is still in the grip of a mounting terror in the form of Lord Foul, and needs the magic of Covenant's white gold ring more than ever. Covenant wrestles with his unbelief in the world and his desire to see it survive-but actually manages to be quite useless to everyone.Still, Donaldson increases the action as well as the complexity of the plot in this second volume, mainly by introducing new characters from both Covenant's real world and the Land who continue the battle against the Corruption of their home. Readers of the first book who thirst for more of the author's amazing attention to detail and thoroughly written story-as well as the lively prose inwhich it is written in-will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awe Inspiring! Masterful! Eloquent!","review":"One of those stand up and cheer series! Donaldson takes you to the brink of tears then turns it around! I'm on my second tour of 'The Land' and it's just as rich and things I missed the first go around, were brought clearly to the forefront. I would LOVE to visit! These books even helped in my personal life now that I'm a Disabled Veteran Hemi-plegic, showing that our own weaknesses can also be our greatest strengths. There is always hope and NEVER give in to despair!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Of course you'll read this","review":"If you've read Book One then you'll read this, no brainer. If you haven't go back and buy it; very thought-provoking, moving fantasy series."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding! Protagonist, Covenant, is a worm!","review":"I can't believe all the positive reviews on this book/series. I have struggled through Book I and Book II holding onto scant hope that the author would somehow redeem the main character, Thomas Covenant. He is an unlikable, egocentric, cowardly, whiny, sniveling, and I'm afraid, unredeemable worm. Try as I might I can't like him. I don't care if he lives or dies. I can't even feel sorry for him. I've read quite a bit of fantasy, some very good, some not so good but this is really awful. I'm afraid that I would find the author's style to be quite tedious even if I did like the characters. Do yourself a favor and read George RR Martin, Guy Gavriel Kay, Tad Williams, almost anyone else, but don't bore yourself with the Unbeliever"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very unimaginative series","review":"You can also read my review of the series in my review of the 1st book. Basically, I just want to restate how un-impressed and how boring this un-inspiring series was. Donaldson focuses so heavily on his writing style and his portrayal of a one-dimensional self-pitying Covenant that he forgot to write a story which would captivate his audience. Instead he writes a very rudimentary, unimaginative, predictable plot with flat unbelievable characters. My suggestion is not to waste your time reading this series as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best non Tolkien fantasy series I have ever read","review":"I just finished reading the lord of the rings series, I was expecting a let down on my next read.

Donaldson is the second installment of the 1st chronicle of the book of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever. I for one, am generally not a fantasy reader but was definitely hooked from the first book! The second book is even better. Thomas is recalled to the Land once again, to continue the battle against the legions of Lord Foul. In Illearth, we meet new characters and are reaquainted with some of the original heroes. All the characters come alive and the plot is tightly woven into a cohesive epic. Thomas' doubt continues in this book but our anti-hero gains knowledge on the power he holds and begins to understand the dilemma he faces. A few of the better reviewers pointed out that in the chronicles, is a very powerful statement on the human condition. A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much the whining anti-hero","review":"I read this series when it first arrived on bookshelves at the suggestion of some well respected book reviewers. While it was imaginative and certainly well written, I really could barely stomach the constant whining and under-achieving of the main character. In the genre of heroic fantasy you expect the lead figures to step up to the plate more often than just once at the end of the novel after almost everyone around them has suffered enormously. If you want to read a good anti-hero, I'd suggest giving this one a miss and read Moorcock's 'Elric' series. Far faster paced and a challenged character that actually makes an effort, which to me is far more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"After having forced myself to read the first book to the last page, I could not find the stomach to finish this one. As in the first volume, the main character is the only one which is carved with more than superficial detail, and the dramatic flow of the story is wrong. As a side note - I am not sure if Donaldson's intention was to describe the world from the view of a schizophrenic, but if it was, Joanne Greenberg did a better job with \\"I never promised you a rose garden\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I love this cd.

Sheryl Crow's song starts out very good, but then she wrecks it with a harmonica. The rest were not good either. The only ones that are salvagable here are the Chords \\"Shboom\\" which is classic, and Rascal Flatts had enough horse sense not to put harmonica on their cover of Tom Cochran's: \\"Life Is A Highway\\", and made it a nice groovy country song out of it; however, the rest are just terrible. I could've picked out better car tunes in my sleep. For starters how about Link Wray's \\"Jack The Ripper\\", or War Babies \\"Sweetwater\\", and also the Rip Chords with \\"Hey Little Cobra\\", and the other granddaddy of car tunes The Beach Boys \\"Shut Down\\".

We both watch the show everyday on TV but when we watched these DVDs we noticed that they are full screen cropped. These newer episodes of this show are in wide screen so why would they produce full screen version DVDs. To make it worst many of the scenes are not panned right.

It also dealt with the medical personnel as a whole and their struggles. I was very mistaken in some of my history and Philip does a wonderful job of explaining these events.The book seemed to struggle to talk about Sharon herself, possibly because Sharon wasn't in the service for that long of a period, and during that time she up to 84 hours a week in. She worked all the time. Sharon's Character however was portrayed very well, just lacked the in-depth coverage.Some pictures but not nearly as many as I would have liked.

Entertaining idea of alien termites taking over the world, unfortunately the director seemed more concentrated on making it serious than humorous.

Boring is never a good thing. There wasn't a single moving, funny, exciting, or entertaining moment in it. Then the movie decides to have the most poorly and inappropriately placed rape scene ever filmed. Was the director trying to \\"be serious\\" for a moment and \\"add drama\\" to this? The casual and inept way it was handled actually made it more offensive than anything else. Adding a rape is not how you add drama to a talentless movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH MY GOD WHAT A HORRIBLE MOVIE>>","review":"Fly a kite, read a book, jump off a cliff....anything but watch this travesty. Horrible acting, horrible video, horrible, horrible. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely horrable","review":"The only way to make this movie palatable is to have a large group of friend making fun it the entire time, and even then i don't know. Watching it drunk might help as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"P U ! Not worth a nickel!","review":"Saw this film on Sci-Fi channel and it really stinks! Don't waste any money on it. I was embarrassed for the actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gave me my fix","review":"Yes, I loved Xena:Wp show. This movie is okay, it gave me my Renee O'Connor fix. And I like Bruce Campbell. This movie isn't for those of you who want something deep-- even though they use rockets in the film; this isn't rocket science. Just a fun romp. Renee and Bruce were the only real redeeming qualities in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad I almost cried.","review":"I love Bruce Campbell, but this movie is almost unwatchable. It just drags along... not funny, scary, clever... I will keep it because Bruce is in it, but I won't be watching it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, but no WOW factor","review":"I watched the movie because I think Renee O'Connor is brilliant and love the few things that I've seen Bruce Campbell in. The plot is pretty simple and the lead acting is great (as can be expected from these two), but I didn't find anything that really WOWed me. Once I got over that fact and realized that it was simply going to be a B movie, I found that I liked it for the most part."},{"rating":"1","title":"I might have a \\"defective\\" Pooh.","review":"We gave this to our 21 month old on Christmas morning. It worked well in the box and she was quite delighted with it. However, Pooh will stop walking in mid-stride and will not turn back on for hours. I have already changed the batteries once--15 minutes after taking it out of its box. When he does walk, he doesn't go very far. It's a shame because she seems to like him and wants to cuddle him all the time. I might bring him back to the store for an exchange. Maybe we just received a \\"defective\\" Pooh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for all my kids","review":"Got this for my 18 month old, but it was enjoyed as much by my 3 year old, my 4 year old and my 5 year old, it seems to be very durable and lots of fun for all ages, would recommend it to any with smaller children"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pooh broke in two weeks.","review":"Our one and a half year old grandaughter loved this toy however it stopped walking after two weeks of use. She was not abusive to the toy. Just normal use.Buy something else that will last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Pooh is just too cute!","review":"Pooh is so much fun. My twin girls had to get use to Pooh walking around, but when I gave Pooh hugs and cuddly's, so did my girls!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have!","review":"An absolute must for any hardcore JAVA programmer! Unless of course you have a remarkable memory. The shear vastness of the java API and any anxiety thereof would be remedied by this entire series on your shelf. Looking forward to a more extensive reference on the Graphics2D/Graphics3D."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb retrospective - God Save the BBC","review":"Why did these performances stay in the BBC vaults for so long? They're brilliant! It's well known that singer Lee Mavers was unsatisfied with the sound of the La's only album. I'd like to know his reaction to this disc: the sound is crisp, the band is tight, the vocals are at least as good as on The La's. This is a great presentation of great songs - this release really breathes new life into tunes that have been on my playlist for fifteen years.The track selection is a real insight into the band at its most vital. The singles are here, but so are a couple of b-sides and Calling All, which I haven't heard before. I'd go so far as to say that this should be considered a necessary companion to the (import, with bonus tracks) studio album - either one would serve as a compelling introduction to the band.Now if they'd just tour the States!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A definitive volume","review":"I can understand some of the obsession around a particular number, since the college I attended has a longtime fascination with \\"47\\", and alumni use the number as a way to secretly identify each other. Nathaniel Lachenmeyer's \\"13\\", even at a manageable 200 pages, is a very thorough encyclopedia on the number 13. It's filled with facts, history, anecdotes, and period illustrations. I enjoyed reading it. Sometimes I just opened it to different pages and learned new things. It turns out there's an actual word to describe a morbid fear of the number 13: \\"Triskaidekaphobia\\". And I always wondered why none of the hotels in New York have a 13th floor (well, except for the Waldorf-Astoria, apparently). You'll have to read the book to find out for yourself why that is. \\"13\\" is a pleasant, interesting read, and a great gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was alright","review":"i am writing an essay about triskaidekaphobia, and found the book sort of useful. most of the information i found here was new, and not found on the internet. however, most of the information was also not appropriate for my essay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage bins are very flimsy","review":"Purchased this garbage truck for my son and I was very disappointed. Within 3-4 minutes of playing, both garbage bins clippings that hangs on to the rear of the truck broke. That piece of plastic on the garbage bin is very flimsy. I will not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"+Fast drive+all black,sleak...-bit noisy...-pricy-,only sata-150","review":"I have 2 of these in RAID-0, they literally saturate the sata-1 bus @ 150mbps. Would of been better if these drives support SATA-II at the time they were released...Can get rather noisy in a quiet environment (sounds like some slugs in a plasticbox being shaked) when heavily accessed..but atleast the audible frequencies are in the lower spectrum and doesn't have the high pitch sound that comes from my 15,000 rpm SCSI Seagate Cheetah, which is much slower than this although made since 2000. Don't go for the raptor-X infront of this one, as that one has a lower MTBF, is more audible (due to the special cover), and is entirely more expensive, unless that's what you want ofcourse. They are otherwise, identical in performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"Expensive, but worth it.
